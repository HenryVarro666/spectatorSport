Ukraine says bodies of 410 civilians removed from Kyiv area.

Russia rejects claims of atrocities against civilians in Bucha.

Oil and fuel infrastructure hit by Russian missiles in Odesa.

Regional governor says shelling in Kharkiv has continued.

Russians completely withdrawn from north, says Ukraine.

Warning: This story contains images of dead bodies.

Residents of the Ukrainian town of Bucha, near the capital Kyiv, have given harrowing accounts of how Russian troops shot and killed civilians for no apparent reason.

Bodies of civilians lay strewn across the northern town, which was controlled by Russian soldiers for about a month.

At a logistics compound that residents say was used as a base by Russian forces, the bodies of eight men could be seen dumped on the ground, some with their hands tied behind their backs.

Residents say Russian troops would go from building to building, take people out of the basements where they were hiding from the fighting, check their phones for evidence of anti-Russian activity and take them away or shoot them.

A Ukrainian presidential adviser said authorities have found evidence of serious war crimes by Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said on Sunday that scores of killed civilians have been found on the streets of the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel after the withdrawal of Russian troops. He compared the scene to ""a horror movie.""

He said some victims were shot in the head and had their hands bound, and some of the bodies had signs of torture. He accused Russian troops of raping women and trying to burn their bodies.

Arestovych said Ukrainian authorities will investigate the alleged war crimes and track down the perpetrators.

Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine's prosecutor general, said the bodies of 410 civilians have been removed from Kyiv-area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. She said 140 of them have undergone examination by prosecutors and other specialists.

Russia's Defence Ministry has rejected the claims of atrocities against civilians in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv as a ""provocation."" The ministry says that ""not a single civilian has faced any violent action by the Russian military"" in Bucha.

Dmitry Polansky, Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, on Sunday requested that the UN Security Council convene on Monday to discuss what he called a ""provocation by Ukrainian radicals"" in the town of Bucha.

International condemnation

The reports drew international condemnation, including from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

""We strongly condemn the murder of civilians in Ukraine, remain committed to holding the Russian regime accountable, and will continue to do everything we can to support the people of Ukraine,"" Trudeau said on Twitter.

""Those responsible for these egregious and appalling attacks will be brought to justice.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the images as ""a punch in the gut,"" while United Nations Secretary General António Guterres called for an independent investigation.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russia's attack on Ukrainian civilians provides ""yet more evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine.""

Johnson called the attacks in the towns of Irpin and Bucha ""despicable"" and said he ""will do everything in my power to starve Putin's war machine."" Johnson added that the U.K. will step up its sanctions and military support for Ukraine, but he did not provide details.

Other European leaders also condemned the reported attacks on Ukrainian civilians in response to images of bodies in the streets and some of the dead with their hands tied behind their backs.

Leaders in France, Germany, Italy, Greece, the Czech Republic and Poland expressed outrage at the images. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala called the images ""horrifying"" and said Russia has been committing war crimes.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said international organizations should be given access to the areas to independently document the atrocities.

French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said his country will work with Ukrainian authorities and the International Criminal Court ""to ensure these acts don't go unpunished.""

Odesa fuel infrastructure hit

The Russian military says it has struck an oil processing plant and fuel depots around the strategic Black Sea port of Odesa.

Russian Defence Ministry spokesperson Maj.-Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian ships and aircraft fired missiles on Sunday to strike the facilities, which he said were used to provide fuel to Ukrainian troops near Mykolaiv.

Konashenkov also said Russian strikes destroyed ammunition depots in Kostiantynivka and Khresyshche.

In a message posted by Italian news agency ANSA, Italian photographer Carlo Orlandi said Odesa woke to military sirens at 5:45 a.m. on Sunday, followed immediately by the sounds of bombs falling on the port city from two aircraft.

He described a column of dark smoke rising from the targets and flames from the buildings.

""What we can see is a dense screen of dark smoke, and one explosion after the other,"" Orlandi said.

Attacks in Kharkiv

The governor of the Kharkiv region says Russian troops fired on a convoy of buses that was trying to transport patients from a hospital that had been heavily damaged in shelling a day earlier.

Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said Sunday that about 70 patients needed to be taken away from the damaged hospital in the town of Balakliya — about 75 kilometres southeast of the city of Kharkiv — but that the buses were not able to enter the town. He said there was preliminary information that one of the bus drivers was killed.

Earlier on Sunday, Synyehubov said Russian artillery and tanks carried out more than 20 strikes on Kharkiv and its outskirts over the past 24 hours.

Synyehubov had said said four people were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Lozova, in the south of the Kharkiv region.

Russians withdrawing from north

The Ukrainian military says Russian troops have completed their pullback from the country's north.

The military's General Staff said in Sunday's statement that Russian units have withdrawn from areas in the country's north to neighbouring Belarus, which served as a staging ground for the Russian invasion.

The Ukrainian military said its airborne forces have taken full control of the town of Pripyat, just outside the decommissioned Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the section of the border with Belarus. It posted a picture of the Ukrainian soldier putting up the country's flag, with a shelter containing the Chornobyl reactor that exploded in 1986 seen in the background.

Officials working on Mariupol evacuations

Work on evacuating Mariupol was to continue on Sunday with buses attempting to come close to the besieged city, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

Vereshchuk said Ukrainian officials were in talks with Russia to allow several Red Cross buses to enter the city. The Red Cross abandoned earlier attempts due to security concerns. Russia blamed the Red Cross for the delays.

Mariupol is Russia's main target in Ukraine's southeastern region of Donbas — an area that's been partly controlled by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014 — and tens of thousands of civilians there have been trapped for weeks with scant access to food and water.

The fall of the southern port city would help Russia establish a land bridge from the Donbas to Crimea, a southern region annexed by Russia in 2014.

Vereshchuk also said on Sunday that 2,694 people were rescued from conflict zones in Mariupol and the region of Luhansk, which is also located in the Donbas region.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-war-1.6406800

This handout satellite image released by Maxar Technologies on April 4, 2022 shows an overview of the site before excavations near the Church of Saint Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints in Bucha, Ukraine, on February 28, 2022. Satellite photographs released on Monday appear to rebut Russian assertions that dead bodies in civilian clothing found in Bucha had appeared there after Russian forces retreated from the devastated Ukrainian town.

BOUTCHA, Ukraine — US President Joe Biden called Monday for a ""war crimes trial"" over alleged atrocities in Bucha and vowed tougher sanctions against Moscow, as Ukraine's leader urged the world to acknowledge a ""genocide"" by Russian troops near Kyiv.

Western leaders have united in outrage after dozens of bodies were found on the streets and in mass graves when Russian troops retreated from the devastated town near the capital, laying bare the horrors of a 40-day war that has killed thousands.

Bombardments continued Monday including in southern Mykolaiv, where officials said Russian strikes killed 10 civilians and wounded 46, as Kyiv warned that Moscow was shifting its military focus and preparing a ""full-scale"" attack in the country's east.

With momentum building for a stiffer European Union response beyond already unprecedented sanctions over Russia's invasion, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was ready to send investigators to gather evidence of possible war crimes in Bucha.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky blames Russian troops for the killings, but the Kremlin has denied responsibility.

""These are war crimes and it will be recognised by the world as genocide,"" Zelensky said Monday as he visited the town, where the corpses, some with their hands bound behind their backs, were discovered over the weekend.

""We know that thousands of people have been killed and tortured with extremities cut off, women raped, children killed,"" he told reporters, wearing a bulletproof vest for a rare trip outside Ukraine's capital, and appearing visibly distressed.

While Moscow suggested images of the corpses in Bucha were ""fakes,"" newly released satellite photographs by Maxar Technologies appeared to rebut such claims, and showed that bodies had been on the streets since mid-March when Russian forces controlled the town.

A grisly new discovery, meanwhile, emerged in Bucha, as the bodies of five men were found in a children's sanatorium basement -- described by the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office as unarmed civilians, their hands tied, who were beaten and then killed by Russian soldiers.

Moscow has sought a UN Security Council meeting on what its deputy ambassador to the body called a ""heinous provocation of Ukrainian radicals in Bucha.""

But Biden did not hesitate to call out Russian President Vladimir Putin over the killings.

""He is a war criminal,"" Biden told reporters at the White House.

""What's happening to Bucha is outrageous and everyone's seen it,"" he said, adding: ""We have to gather all the details"" in order to ""have a war crimes trial.""

The killings are likely to receive more international attention on Tuesday, when Zelensky addresses the Security Council's meeting on Ukraine, according to British diplomats.

'We dug a mass grave'

While the horror in Bucha appeared undeniable, the scale of the killings is still being pieced together. On Sunday, Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova said 410 civilian bodies had been recovered in the wider Kyiv region after Russian troops withdrew.

In Bucha, AFP on Saturday saw the bodies of at least 22 people in civilian clothes on a single street.

The town's mayor said 280 people were buried in mass graves because they could not be laid to rest in cemeteries that were within firing range.

Maxar released satellite images it said showed a mass grave located behind a church there.

Before leaving, Russian forces refused to let residents bury the dead, municipal worker Serhii Kaplychnyi told AFP.

Eventually, they were able to retrieve the bodies, he said. ""We dug a mass grave with a tractor and buried everyone.""

Mariupol '90 percent destroyed'

Russia has redoubled its efforts in Ukraine's south and east, including strikes Sunday on the strategic Black Sea port of Odessa, which Moscow said targeted an oil refinery and fuel depots.

The mayor of Mariupol said Monday 90 percent of the southeastern city had been destroyed since being besieged by Russian forces, trapping some 130,000 residents who have not yet fled.

Vadym Boichenko said plans to evacuate remaining residents from Mariupol, where authorities say at least 5,000 residents have died, were paused because of ""incessant"" bombings.

Britain's defence ministry confirmed that recent Russian air activity had focused on southeastern Ukraine, and that Mariupol ""continues to be subject to intense, indiscriminate strikes.""

The White House, meanwhile, said Russia has withdrawn about two thirds of the troops it had around Kyiv and is seeking to redeploy them to eastern and parts of southern Ukraine, in what is being seen as a substantial shift in strategy.

""Russia has tried to subjugate the whole of Ukraine and it has failed. Now it will attempt to bring parts of the country under its rule,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said.

The United States said more sanctions on Russia would be announced ""this week,"" while the EU was urgently discussing similar steps.

French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke about ""very clear indications of war crimes,"" said new sanctions could target the country's oil and coal sectors.

But Germany warned cutting off Russia's supply of gas to Europe was not yet possible, despite several EU countries pressing for the measure as necessary to face down Moscow.

""We have to cut all economic relationship to Russia, but at the moment, it's not possible to cut the gas supplies. We need some time,"" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said as he arrived for talks in Luxembourg.

'Something terrible is coming'

In the eastern city of Kramatorsk, women, children and the elderly boarded trains Monday to flee the Donbas region — out of the path of Russia's advance.

""The rumour is that something terrible is coming,"" said Svetlana, a volunteer organising the crowd.

Local governor Sergiy Gaiday warned Monday on Telegram that Russian troops were preparing for a major attack in the Lugansk region inside the Donbas, urging a mass evacuation.

Europe's worst conflict in decades, sparked by Russia's invasion on February 24, has killed as many as 20,000 people, according to Ukrainian estimates.

More than 4.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country and about 6.5 million have been internally displaced, UN agencies say.

The UN's top humanitarian envoy Martin Griffiths was expected in Kyiv after arriving in Moscow Sunday in an attempt to halt the fighting.

And peace talks were scheduled to resume by video Monday. — with Selim Saheb Ettaba in Odessa",https://www.philstar.com/world/2022/04/05/2172418/biden-urges-war-crimes-trial-after-bucha-killings
