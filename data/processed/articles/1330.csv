0,1fc4d029-59df-4697-82e2-c1bccf202be5,"['Darya Kurennaya', 'Mykhaylo Shtekel']",,"In the eastern Ukrainian town of Volnovakha, remaining civilians huddle in basements under near-constant bombardment from surrounding Russian and separatist forces.

""The town is being destroyed,"" one resident wrote to RFE/RL's Donbas.Realities on February 27. ""Direct hits to the hospital. Houses are burning. Looters are thriving -- they steal groceries, mobile phones, appliances. Residents are in basements, completely cut off from information. There is no light, water, heat, or telephone connection.""

Volnovakha, with a prewar population of about 21,000, lies in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, about 65 kilometers southwest of the regional capital, Donetsk, and on the front line between Ukrainian forces and the combined arms of the Moscow-backed separatists and their Russian military allies. It has been the scene of intense fighting since February 27.

""Private homes and apartment buildings, infrastructure facilities, and a hospital were severely damaged by the occupiers' shelling,"" the Kyiv-appointed head of the Donetsk regional administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, told RFE/RL. ""The town is blocked by the enemy,"" he added. ""It is impossible to evacuate the population or even bring people bread and water.... I appeal to international humanitarian organizations to help the city.""

Volunteers In Yellow Armbands

Meanwhile, some 700 kilometers to the west, the Black Sea port city of Odesa has seen little action in the first days of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. But it is impossible to escape the preparations for war. On the morning of February 28, a radio announcer advised residents which parts of an armored vehicle to target with Molotov cocktails: ""Windows, wheels, hatches,"" the voice said.

Ukraine's third-largest city, with a population just over 1 million, Odesa is known as ""the pearl of the Black Sea,"" and it has a rich cultural history to match the moniker. In Russian imperial times and in the Soviet era, people knew it as the country's ""southern capital.""

A few rockets landed in the city on February 24, the first day of Russia's invasion. Since then, residents have heard only occasional small-arms fire or bursts from anti-aircraft emplacements. The Buyalik airfield, some 100 kilometers north of the city, has been shelled.

On February 28, the city center was deserted of people, but populated by anti-tank hedgehogs, concrete barriers, and other military preparations. Volunteers in yellow armbands hustled the few pedestrians out of the area, while others handed out coffee and snacks to soldiers.

""People are armed,"" said local civil-defense coordinator Serhiy Bratchuk. ""People are carrying out their tasks in full cooperation with the armed forces of Ukraine, the National Police, the Security Service, border guards, and local authorities. We face threats from the sea and the air.""

Bratchuk and his volunteers coordinated donations of food, medicine, and other necessities brought in by local residents. Timur Nishnaianidze, a former Georgian consul-general in the city, carried an automatic rifle as he enlisted recruits in a volunteer detachment.

Most cafes, bars, and restaurants in Odesa are closed. Each day, more roads into the city are blocked and new checkpoints pop up. There is a 7 p.m. curfew.

'We Need Help'

Back in Volnovakha, locals use the Telegram app to search for missing relatives. On February 28, there was a report of a 12-year-old girl trapped alive in the basement of a collapsed building.

""Since yesterday the Russian Army has been shelling my hometown of Volnovkha,"" Lilia Filonenko wrote on Instagram on February 27. ""People are without electricity, water, and heat. No telephones. They are bombing.... Civilians are being killed. There are corpses in the streets.""

""We need help,"" she pleaded.

The Volnovakha district administration has said there is no opportunity to evacuate citizens or wounded from the besieged town. ""We know about the terrible situation and about the shelling,"" the administration said in a statement. ""We understand the situation you are in now. But unfortunately, there is no possibility of a 'green corridor' for the mass evacuation of the population. As soon as it is possible to evacuate people safely, we will do it.""

Saboteurs And Symbolism

Near Odesa on February 27, border guards reportedly intercepted ""a sabotage and reconnaissance group"" in two civilian vehicles. Land mines, grenade launchers, and automatic rifles were reportedly seized.

On February 25, the Ukrainian military reported killing 25 Russian paratroopers and sinking a Russian boat near Koblevo beach on the eastern edge of the city. Bratchuk said some of the purported saboteurs had come into Ukraine from the breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniester, a Russian-backed enclave about 50 kilometers to the northwest.

WATCH: Kyiv residents lined up on February 28 to receive weapons to help defend the Ukrainian capital from Russian troops.

The headquarters of the 122nd Territorial Defense Brigade is located in Odesa. It is responsible for guarding infrastructure facilities throughout the region and helping police and the armed forces combat saboteurs. An RFE/RL correspondent reported seeing long lines of people waiting to enlist at the unit's reception center.

""Volunteers help to organize the lives of the soldiers,"" said Oleksiy Chorniy, head of the brigade's volunteer headquarters. ""They provide them with food and other material that the state has not sent yet.... There is a huge number of people helping out.... I have never seen such a thing before.""

Local hospital volunteer Andriy Tantsyura told RFE/RL that as of February 26, 14 wounded soldiers had been brought to the Odesa Military Hospital. RFE/RL was not able to confirm that information.

Volunteer coordinator Bratchuk says that Odesa, because of the prominent role it played in the Russian Empire, has always been a key part of Russian nationalists' plans to carve the so-called Novorossia out of eastern and southern Ukraine.

""I think the occupiers have a sense of symbolism,"" he said of the invading Russians. ""They consider Odesa a symbol of the empire...and probably planned to come here as 'liberators.' But...we think that the formation of our defense has confused their plans for a landing. They have begun to understand that no one is waiting to welcome them.""

The biggest fights at the moment are in Sumy, near Kharkiv and in Gostomel (Kyiv Oblast), according to adviser to Zelenskyʼs chief of staff Mykhailo Podoliak. «Russiaʼs goal is to remove the countryʼs leadership and install their puppet government», he said.

In the evening, Feb. 24, it became clear that Russia’s armed forces target not only military but also civilian areas – hospitals in Donetsk oblast, residential quarters in the eastern city of Mariupol.

Russian forces have tried to carry out a terrorist attack on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant to cause an environmental catastrophe. It suggests that Russia wants to cause maximum destruction, according to Podoliak. He said that Russia has failed to deliver a shock strike.

Following airstrikes by the Russian military outside Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv has introduced a curfew from 10 pm to 7 am. Public transport won’t work during curfew, while metro stations will serve as bomb shelters.

World reacts Major world leaders have reacted to Russiaʼs invasion of Ukraine. They accused Putin of brutality and said that Russia will pay a ʼbitter priceʼ for its attack. The European Union promised to hit Russia with new sanctions. It will be «the harshest package of sanctions» it has ever implemented, said Josep Borrell, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. With this package, the EU will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy: it will block its access to key technologies and markets, as well as freeze Russian assets in the EU and stop the access of Russian banks to the European financial market. The EU is ready to host refugees fleeing the Russian invasion, according to the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. «We will welcome and host refugees immediately,» she said. «We are fully prepared for them, and they are welcome.» Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian foreign ministers issued a joint statement encouraging the foreign leaders to impose strong sanctions on Russia, including disengaging it from the SWIFT payment system and isolating Russia politically. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison announced sanctions against 25 Russians including army commanders, mercenaries and ministers. He promised further waves of sanctions against Russians including hundreds of members of parliament. The war in Ukraine has also prompted Ukraineʼs neighbors, including Lithuania and Moldova, to impose a state of emergency. Dozens of cars were reportedly queuing on the border with Ukraine, with Moldova and Poland saying they are ready to accept Ukrainian refugees. Читати більше Згорнути

5,1fc4d029-59df-4697-82e2-c1bccf202be5,"['Eric Schmitt', 'Helene Cooper', 'Julian E. Barnes']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — Ukraine’s soldiers have blown up bridges to halt advancing Russian ground troops. Its pilots and air defenses have prevented Russian fighter jets from conquering the skies. And a band of savvy Ukrainian cyberwarriors are so far beating Moscow in an information war, inspiring support at home and abroad.

To the surprise of many military analysts, Ukrainian troops are mounting a stiffer-than-expected resistance to Russian forces up and down battle lines across a country the size of Texas, fighting with a resourcefulness and creativity that U.S. analysts said could trip up Russian troops for weeks or months to come.

The Ukrainians are also exploiting a bungled beginning to Russia’s all-out assault. Armed with shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons, they have attacked a mileslong Russian armored convoy bearing down on Kyiv, the capital, helping stall an advance plagued by fuel and food shortages, and stretching a march that was expected to take a handful of days into possibly weeks.

To be sure, Russia’s invasion is only a week old. The strategic southern city of Kherson fell on Wednesday; the Kremlin’s army has intensified its bombardment of Kyiv and other cities; and, despite a flow of fresh arms pouring in from the West, Ukrainian leaders say they desperately need more weapons to destroy Russian tanks and down Russian warplanes.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/us/politics/russia-ukraine-military.html
6,1fc4d029-59df-4697-82e2-c1bccf202be5,['Alex Gatopoulos'],2022-03-09 00:00:00,"Despite perceptions of Russia’s military strength, Ukraine has been able to slow the Russian advance. We examine how.

The war in Ukraine has highlighted two things to Russia and the outside world: that Russia’s much-vaunted military revolution has been exaggerated and that Ukraine’s resistance to the invasion is total.

Russia’s military capabilities have been built up in Western eyes, particularly after its modernisation programme in the wake of the 2008 Georgian conflict. New equipment was ordered and training focused on realism as Russia’s armed forces were put on a more professional footing. A new doctrine, designed to give the military greater flexibility in responding to a variety of scenarios, was also developed.

Russia’s new “hybrid” military tactics were highlighted by the relatively bloodless takeover of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, when “grey” operations – those below the threshold of actual conflict – were seen. Russian soldiers gradually infiltrated the region without firing a shot, their mere presence achieving Russia’s strategic aim of taking Crimea.

Since then, Russia’s military has been running increasingly sophisticated annual large-scale exercises and has had months to build up its forces on the border of Ukraine, amassing supplies, fuel and ammunition for an invasion that few on the ground in Ukraine and in the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk believed would actually happen.

At most, a Russian military operation to partially seize the two breakaway republics was predicted, but when Russia finally invaded it went way beyond this – driving past Donetsk and Luhansk and advancing from multiple fronts right into the heart of the country.

And then it got stuck.

Russian military vehicles quickly ran out of fuel and soldiers ran out of food despite food and fuel stockpiles being nearby on the other side of the border.

Meanwhile, the hundreds of missile attacks and air strikes on Ukrainian bases and command and control centres, carried out on the first day, failed to achieve their aim of destroying Ukrainian military resistance.

Where is Russia’s air force?

These opening attacks saw Ukrainian airbases targeted but not destroyed; the Russian strikes lacked the intensity needed to stop the Ukrainian air force in its tracks.

Despite having an air force many times the size of Ukraine’s, Russia was unable to dominate the skies in the way necessary to protect the smooth and speedy advance of its mechanised columns of armour on the ground. These units now faced Ukrainian air strikes as they pushed deeper into the country.

This lack of coordination between Russian air and ground units left gaps in the defensive shield around advancing Russian armour, also allowing Ukrainian ground forces to successfully attack Russian armed helicopters, destroying many and depriving Russian army units of their protection and support.

Ukrainian air defence units successfully downed several Russian jets, further discouraging the Russian air force from flying too many sorties and dominating the target airspace, a vital objective in any conflict.

Ukrainian jets were able to fly combat missions, often flying low over towns and cities as a morale boost to the population. Despite initial losses, Ukrainian jets are still a serious challenge to Russia’s air force.

However, a deal to supply the country with Soviet legacy aircraft from its neighbours has fallen through and Ukraine is in desperate need of replacement jets if it is to prevent Russia from eventually dominating the skies over the battlefield. It may have to rely on its armed drones if it is to stop Russia.

Ukraine’s drones

Ukraine has made effective use of its meagre complement of armed UAVs or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Its Turkish-made TB2 armed UAVs have been flying combat missions, not only carrying out air strikes on Russian vehicles and command posts but conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.

They act as real-time spotters for Ukraine’s long-range artillery, allowing the Ukrainian military to destroy columns of armour, supply trucks and troop concentrations before they even reach the battlefield, blunting Russia’s advance.

In the last week, more TB2s have been delivered to Ukraine from Turkey as part of a larger assistance package. This helps offset Ukraine’s smaller air force as the TB2 drones prove their worth.

Ukraine’s domestically made armed drone, The Punisher, while only armed with a small bomb, is very hard to detect and has inflicted damage on Russian air defence systems and radar that are vulnerable and easily knocked out of commission.

Russia, on the other hand, has been slow to develop its own armed UAVs and has only just started to deploy them in combat. This lack of ability to determine an opponent’s movements combined with a drone’s offensive capabilities has Russia at a real disadvantage as the Ukrainian military has had a far clearer picture of Russian objectives and tactics.

Morale

The tepid advance of Russian forces has been linked to poor leadership, lack of supplies and the low morale of Russian soldiers. Initial reports from captured personnel showed that many of them had been told that they were only being deployed on exercises, not to an active war zone.

There has also been a lack of understanding among the rank and file of the Russian military about why they are fighting this war, particularly as Russia and Ukraine have always been culturally linked.

Despite this initial reticence among some of the Russian soldiers to fight their neighbour, Russia has an estimated 150,000 troops in Ukraine, and many of them are highly motivated, well trained and well equipped. And while they may not have known where they were going at the beginning of the conflict, they certainly know now.

A drawn-out conflict will in some ways favour Russia as it uses these units to eventually wear down the Ukrainian military. Ukraine’s army of 126,000 at the start of the conflict was not small – it is, for example, larger than France’s – but Russia’s army is vast, comprising 280,000 soldiers with a further 50,000 airborne troops. Russia also has extensive experience of urban combat, formed in the Chechen capital Grozny and northern Syria, which will stand it in good stead in what is swiftly turning into a war for Ukraine’s major cities.

Nevertheless, a nimble Ukrainian opposition is consistently inflicting heavy losses on a slow-moving Russian military that has had its reputation tarnished by its ineptitude. There is a distinct possibility that Russia will become increasingly heavy-handed in its attempts to capture Ukrainian population centres as Ukraine’s united resolve to defend its land results in Russian casualties and reverses on the battlefield.

Total war

Ukraine’s response to the invasion has been nothing short of total. The entire country has been mobilised. Many have fled, but many more remain and are contributing to the fight.

Volunteer units dig trenches, and fortify buildings and strong points around the towns and cities they live in. Improvised tank traps have been built along likely approaches for Russian armour. Food kitchens have been set up all over the country as meals are cooked, then distributed to local volunteers.

Ukraine’s army has been dramatically expanded as reservists and volunteers swamp recruitment stations. Media teams on the ground report that newly formed units manning checkpoints and roadblocks have become more disciplined and professional, as the entire country focuses on one thing only – resisting the enemy.

Politically, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has excelled at getting his message across, inspiring resistance and sustained effort. Russian President Vladimir Putin, by contrast, seems isolated and out of touch, his inner circle now hammered by unprecedented sanctions.

The propaganda war has gone into full swing as social media is inundated with the very real images of suffering and stoic preparation and training by a civilian population determined to fight. Very few images are shown of regular Ukrainian military units. However, it is not enthusiastic civilians destroying columns of Russian armour but Ukraine’s armed forces that are doing the bulk of the damage to Russia. Little is coming out from the Russian side that is not a defence ministry handout.

Yet, despite Ukraine’s valiant efforts the Russians slowly advance. The capital, Kyiv, is being approached from two sides, Ukraine’s major cities are being contested, with Kherson in the south under Russian control.

The race is now on to pressure Russia to stop the conflict. The outside world is using severe sanctions and large arms transfers, and the Ukrainians themselves are attempting to inflict losses on a scale that will be unacceptable to Russia.

Even if Russia was to somehow win this war, the ensuing insurgency would ensure a constant stream of body bags back to the small towns and villages that still form Putin’s power base, further eroding any legitimacy he has left.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/3/9/total-war-how-ukraine-mobilised-a-country-as-russia-overreached-2
