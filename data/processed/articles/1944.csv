A kindergarten in Lysychansk in the Luhansk region was among the buildings struck, along with several apartment blocks, according to local authorities.

“In the morning Lysychansk was rocked by intense fire by the Russian army. There are a significant number of destroyed residential buildings. People who were still sleeping [at the time of the attacks] have wound up beneath the ruins. Rescuers are trying to save all the survivors in time,” the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a statement on Facebook.

Serhiy Gaidai, the head of the regional administration, said at least one person was found dead beneath the wreckage, while at least five people were pulled out alive.

Areas in the Donetsk region were also bombarded with Russian fire overnight, with the towns of Maryinka and Novo-Mikhaylovka hit by airstrikes, according to local authorities.

There were reports of Russian troops using white phosphorus munitions in Maryinka, which could constitute a war crime if used near civilians. The incendiary weapon is known for the severity of burns it leaves on human flesh.

“The situation in the region is complicated. The night passed with shelling in practically every area. In Maryinka phosphorus munitions and airstrikes were used,” said Pavel Kirilenko, chairman of the regional military administration.

The Daily Beast could not immediately verify whether white phosphorus was used, or thermite submunitions, which were previously reported in use by Russian troops in Syria.

The attacks are in line with assessments by U.S. and Western officials that the Russian military plans to intensify its attacks further east in the country after suffering setbacks around Kyiv and Chernihiv. Russia’s Defense Ministry on Tuesday vowed to “drastically reduce” military activities in those areas.

But even after that claim, which Russia billed as a way to boost “mutual trust” during peace negotiations with Ukraine, shelling was still reported in the Chernihiv region overnight, and several Russian rockets were shot down outside Kyiv, Ukrainian authorities said.

Chernihiv Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko told CNN a “colossal attack” left 25 civilians injured on Wednesday.

“They actually have increased the intensity of strikes,” he said.

“Yesterday the Russians publicly declared that they would reduce their offensive attacks in the Chernihiv and Kyiv regions. Do we believe them? Of course not. And we are ready for any scenario. We will also meet the enemy in Chernihiv, which we are doing,” said Viacheslav Chaus, head of the Chernihiv region.

Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said early Wednesday that “unfortunately, it is not yet possible” to say Russian forces have cut back their attacks.

“We can say that certain units and equipment have moved to the territory of Belarus. This looks more like a rotation and licking of wounds than a real suspension of hostilities,” Denysenko said in a live telemarathon on the state of the war.

The death toll from Russia’s attack on an administrative building in Mykolaiv also continued to grow Wednesday, with 15 people found dead in the wreckage.",https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-forces-attack-ukrainian-residents-as-they-sleep-authorities-say
1,5df3858f-e6d2-4bd9-a85a-a2b86dcf0e4b,['Rfe Rl'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Creeping forward block by block, Ukrainian soldiers in a reconnaissance unit on Tuesday found signs of a retreating Russian army everywhere: a charred armored vehicle, abandoned body armor decorated with an orange and black St. George ribbon, a Russian military symbol, and the traditional blue-and-white striped underwear issued to Russian soldiers, cast aside in a forest.

What they did not encounter was the Russian army in any organized state. After a month of savage street fighting, one of the most pivotal battles in the war ended this week — at least for now — with an improbable victory in Irpin for Ukraine’s outgunned and outnumbered military. By Tuesday, Ukrainian forces had quashed any significant Russian resistance in this strategic outlying town near Kyiv, the capital.

Pockets of Russian soldiers remained, posing risks. A firefight erupted in the afternoon when Ukrainian soldiers destroyed a lone Russian armored personnel carrier in an otherwise empty neighborhood, according to a commander.

But Ukraine’s military had essentially recaptured Irpin, a town both strategically and symbolically important as the closest the Russian army had gotten to Kyiv, just 3 miles away. Its success in driving the Russians away may have factored into the peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on Tuesday, when the two sides achieved what appeared to be their most substantive progress to date.

Moscow promised to reduce “by multiples” the intensity of its military activity around Kyiv, an area that includes Irpin, in effect acknowledging that its advance toward the capital had stalled and was at least in some places being pushed back.

With superior numbers and weaponry, Russia could always decide to mount another assault on Irpin. And Ukrainian security experts expressed skepticism about Russia’s pledge to pull back. “They will not abandon plans to take the capital,” said Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of Ukraine’s Security and Defense Council.

Still, some people saw the recapture of Irpin as a moral victory, even if street fighting continues in the town and the military gains may be tentative.

Kyiv was always the biggest prize of all for the Russian military, as the seat of government and a city ingrained in both Russian and Ukrainian identity. But the Ukrainian military’s performance in the vicious street fighting in an arc of outlying towns and villages became emblematic of the challenges Russian forces would face as they attempted to encircle or capture the capital.

“Today we have good news,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a videotaped address Monday. “Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, regaining control over Ukrainian territory.”

Zelenskyy said the town of Irpin was “liberated.” He added, “Well done. I am grateful to everyone who worked for this result.” He said some fighting continued.

In its attempt to capture the capital, the Russian military was bedeviled by logistical setbacks as it advanced in lumbering tank columns into the urban environment of Kyiv’s suburbs, where armored vehicles are vulnerable to ambushes. Over a month of fighting, with Ukraine’s military putting up fierce resistance, the losses piled up.

Western and Ukrainian officials have said for weeks that the Russians have taken heavy casualties in these suburban battles. That was on display Tuesday, as the Ukrainian reconnaissance unit pushed into a scene of destruction in a neighborhood of one-story homes in Irpin.

The vicious give-and-take of the fighting for nearly a month left a sprawl of burned or blown-up buildings, tank tracks in the roads and bullet cartridges scattered all about. Wires sagged from the utility poles.

The area had been a base for Russian special operations soldiers, or Spetsnaz, and ethnic Chechens fighting on Russia’s side, according to Western military analysts and Ukrainian soldiers.

Here, as elsewhere in the fighting around Kyiv, the Ukrainian military achieved its battlefield success by deploying small, fast-moving units largely on foot that staged ambushes or defended sites with the benefit of local knowledge. Many such units are based in central Kyiv, commuting to the war zone by car.

The reconnaissance unit that patrolled Irpin on Tuesday, a part of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, uses as its base a shuttered bar in Kyiv, now cluttered with sleeping bags, boxes of ammunition and hand grenades.

At dawn on a clear, cold morning Tuesday, the soldiers strapped on body armor and pouches of ammunition, with a crackling noise of Velcro, then jumped in place to ensure their gear was well attached. The bar’s stereo played Ukrainian folk songs.

The front in Irpin was a quick drive away. The soldiers filtered into the town in small groups of three or four, to avoid drawing Russian artillery, then regrouped in a maze of back streets.

“We are defending our land,” said a commander of one of the two squads, consisting of eight men each. He asked to be identified only by his first name, Bohdan. While the Russian military has pulled back in force, he said, Ukrainian soldiers still must search house to house in the city to flush out pockets of remaining enemy soldiers.

“We move into a neighborhood and if there is contact, we fire or call in artillery,” he said of these operations. “If there is no contact, well, then it is clear this territory is again ours.”

The mayor of Irpin, a once quiet and leafy suburb with a prewar population of about 70,000, said that all but about 4,000 civilians had fled. The patrol encountered only one elderly man, who waved from behind a window of a house.

Two hours into their rounds, the Ukrainians were panting and sweating, dashing between walls and into backyards, climbing in and out of broken windows. “They lived in these houses and they were firing on Kyiv from this neighborhood,” Bohdan said of the Russians.

The buzz of their drone was nearly always overhead, scouting the street in front of them.

Through most of the day, there were no sounds of small-arms fire anywhere in town. Such fire would indicate close engagements between the two armies. The soldiers passed a Russian military identification document, fluttering in the wind on the lawn of a house, but did not touch it to check the name, fearing a booby trap.

Irpin has loomed large symbolically in the war not just because of its adjacency to the capital. In normal times, it was a town that conveyed nothing so much as the ordinariness and tranquility of middle-class suburban life in Kyiv, with parks for bike riding and tree-lined streets. But the fighting grew fiercer as Russia moved to encircle the capital, and the death of a mother and her two children fleeing the city early in the conflict — struck by a mortar as they crossed a bridge — came to represent the shattered sense of security in once-safe communities.

In a town park, the Ukrainian patrol found a destroyed Russian armored personnel carrier, burned in places to a rich orange color. Beside the vehicle were the traditional blue-and-white undershirts used by Russian soldiers, called telnyashkas. Elsewhere, they found a cardboard box labeled Russian army food. “Individual Food Ration,” the label said. “Not for Sale.”

The soldiers took selfies beside the incinerated armored personnel carrier. Some sank to the pine duff to rest, gazing at the spectacle of the destroyed vehicle where Russian soldiers had died. The bodies had been retrieved earlier, though by whom was unclear.

“I don’t see the Russians as enemies,” said a Ukrainian soldier who offered only his first name, Hennady, out of concern for his safety. “They are just inert people, doing things without knowing what they are doing.”

The day had been quiet but suddenly shifted with a cacophony of heavy machine-gun fire and explosions from rocket-propelled grenades as the squad led by Bohdan, which had remained behind, encountered a Russian armored personnel carrier. Why it remained in this place, otherwise empty of Russian soldiers, was unclear. Later, a commander said the vehicle was destroyed.

Serhiy, one of the soldiers, offered a more skeptical assessment of Ukrainian gains in Irpin. While perhaps the largest occupied town was recaptured, he said, Ukraine’s control was uncertain. “We have a tentative front line” now outside Irpin, he said, “but the key word is tentative.”

“Their goal is Kyiv,” he added. “They will come back. They will need to cover this ground again.”",https://indianexpress.com/article/world/kyiv-suburb-ukrainian-military-big-prize-7844302/

Russia's attacks in populated areas of Ukraine are of ""immense concern"" and could amount to war crimes, the UN human rights chief has said.

Presenting her latest report on the situation in Ukraine, Michelle Bachelet expressed concern over the ""persistent use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas"".

She said missiles, heavy artillery shells and rockets and airstrikes were causing ""massive destruction and damage to civilian objects"".

Bachelet said her office had received ""credible allegations that Russian armed forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times"".

Her office is also investigating allegations that Ukrainian forces have used these weapons as well, she said.

The UN rights office, she said, had verified 77 incidents in which medical facilities were damaged, including 50 hospitals.

Ten of the facilities were completely destroyed, she said, adding that the actual numbers are ""likely to be considerably higher.""

""Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes,"" Bachelet warned.

The UN typically does not categorically state that war crimes are being committed, since this can only be determined in a court of law.

But Bachelet said ""the massive destruction of civilian objects and the high number of civilian casualties strongly indicate that the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution have not been sufficiently adhered to"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60923158/page/7

Key developments

Germany says Putin agrees to keep taking euros for gas

Germany said Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated that European nations can continue paying for Russian gas in euros, despite a previous demand for rouble payments.

After German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke with Putin on Wednesday, a German government spokesman said that Putin told Scholz that “the payments would continue to be made exclusively in euros” to Russia’s Gazprom bank and would then be converted into roubles. Scholz asked for “written information in order to understand the procedure more precisely”. The Kremlin said only that Scholz and Putin agreed that their experts would discuss the issue.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi also spoke with Putin on Wednesday on the issue, as French President Emmanuel Macron did a day earlier. The countries are among the European Union’s largest consumers of Russian gas, and the calls may signal a sense of alarm in Europe about a potential cut-off. Energy ministers from the Group of Seven nations this week rejected the demand to pay in roubles, which officials say violates contract terms.

South Ossetia says it’s seeking to join Russia

The breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia will take legal steps to join the Russian Federation, its President Anatoly Bibilov said in an address posted on the Russian ruling party’s website.

Only a handful of countries, including Russia, Syria and Nauru, have recognised South Ossetia since it declared independence after Russia’s 2008 war with Georgia. Russia last annexed a territory in 2014, when it seized Crimea from Ukraine.

Biden pledges more aid in call with Zelensky

President Joe Biden spoke to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky for about an hour on Wednesday, and pledged “$500-million in direct budgetary aid” from the US, according to a White House statement.

They discussed how the US is “working around the clock to fulfil the main security assistance requests by Ukraine” and “continued efforts by the United States with allies and partners to identify additional capabilities to help the Ukrainian military defend its country”, according to the statement.

Zelensky said on Twitter that they shared an “assessment of the situation and at the negotiating table” as well as “specific defensive support, a new package of enhanced sanctions, macro-financial and humanitarian aid”.

Biden on Monday cast doubt on the prospects for a Russian pullback in Ukraine, despite the Kremlin signalling it planned to scale down military operations around Kyiv.

Blinken says Putin is being given bad intelligence on the war

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin is being given bad intelligence because those around him are afraid to deliver bad news.

“One of the Achilles’ heels of autocracy is that you don’t have people in those systems who speak truth to power or who have the ability to speak truth to power,” Blinken told reporters during a visit to Algiers. “And I think that is something that we’re seeing.”

US intelligence officials have come to the same conclusion, according to an unidentified official cited by the Associated Press. The official said a recently declassified intelligence finding concluded that Putin has felt misled by the Russian military and that there’s now persistent tension between him and senior Russian defence officials. It found that Putin wasn’t aware that conscripts were being sent to Ukraine or the extent of damage to the Russian economy from sanctions imposed by the US and allies, according to the AP.

Johnson questions Macron’s talks with Putin

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson questioned the value of French President Emmanuel Macron’s efforts to persuade Vladimir Putin to engage in a ceasefire.

“The question of negotiations with Vladimir Putin – the value of those negotiations – is an open one,” Johnson told a panel of members of Parliament in London. “My view is that plainly Putin is not to be trusted.”

Johnson also said the UK is examining supplying armoured Land Rover vehicles to Ukraine as it is “looking at going up a gear” with its support. Asked about when sanctions against Russia could be lifted, he replied, “I certainly don’t think you could expect the G7 to lift sanctions simply because we had a ceasefire in Ukraine”, but refused to be drawn on whether Russia would have to withdraw from Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.

EU may tighten sanctions next week

The European Union may agree as early as next week on a new set of measures to tighten existing sanctions against Russia and strengthen their enforcement.

The measures could include sanctioning banks that the EU has cut off from the international payments system Swift, including state-controlled VTB, but hadn’t yet applied other restrictions to, according to people familiar with the preparations who asked not to be identified because the talks are private.

The bloc is also looking to add more people to its listings as it continues to go after Russian tycoons and their associates. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the timing of the possible sanctions.

Russia’s internet giant risks running out of key tech

Russia’s omnipresent tech company, which created products ranging from the country’s dominant search engine to its biggest ride-hail service, is facing a shortage of hardware due to US sanctions.

Yandex may run short of semiconductors needed for its servers within a year to 18 months because of import restrictions, two people with direct knowledge of the issue said. Sanctions on dual-use technology, which have both military and commercial uses, have hit its self-driving vehicle unit particularly hard, they said.

Yandex has plunged into crisis since Putin began the war, caught between the Kremlin’s increasingly harsh internet censorship and a backlash in its key foreign markets.

Russian negotiator says Ukraine agreeing to key demands

Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s chief negotiator, struck an upbeat tone on the results of Tuesday’s talks, saying that the written offer Ukraine presented “for the first time showed readiness to fulfil a whole range of the most important conditions” set by Moscow, state-run Tass news service reported.

Medinsky specifically cited Kyiv’s willingness to agree to give up its ambition to join Nato, as well as declare its neutrality and commit not to obtain nuclear weapons. But he reiterated that Moscow refuses to discuss the status of Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv had sought talks on the issue as part of the peace deal.

Earlier on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this week’s talks had yielded no breakthroughs and that much work remains to be done before a deal could be possible.

Germany is talking about giving Ukraine a security guarantee

Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said that Chancellor Olaf Scholz signalled in several phone calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Germany has a “general willingness” to act, together with other countries, as a security guarantor. He added, though, that this is still at a “very early” stage because there is not even a ceasefire yet.

AerCap insurance claims signal a looming battle

AerCap Holdings, the world’s largest aircraft-leasing firm, filed insurance claims totalling about $3.5-billion tied to jets and engines stuck inside Russia that it hasn’t been able to recover since the invasion of Ukraine.

The size of the claim – greater than Dublin-based AerCap’s exposure to potential asset writedowns – signals a looming battle with insurers, including Lloyd’s of London, which dominates the market, over who shoulders financial losses caused by the war.

Zelensky says Russia is sending reinforcements to Ukraine

Russia is deploying new forces for fighting in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a speech to Norway’s Parliament, without specifying the time frame.

“We have to do more to stop this war and first and utmost is weapons,” Zelensky said via video link from Ukraine. He added that the Russian military has mined the Black Sea to blockade Ukrainian ports, endangering marine traffic.

Ukraine calls on marine insurers to withdraw Russia coverage

Oleg Ustenko, the chief economic adviser to Zelensky, urged a group of shipping insurance specialists in a letter to withdraw coverage in a bid to reduce cash flowing into Russia from international buyers of its energy.

The letter was sent to the International Group of P&I Clubs, a collection of insurance associations which say they provide marine liability coverage for around 90% of sea-bound cargo. The club’s members have insured 363 vessels carrying oil, gas and coal from Russian ports since the invasion of Ukraine began, the letter said.

Kremlin downplays talks, delays rouble gas payments

Talks with Ukraine in Istanbul yielded “no breakthrough”, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists a day after peace talks in Istanbul, adding that much work remained to be done. He said Ukrainian negotiators’ willingness to provide specific proposals on paper was “positive”.

Peskov also told reporters that the process of switching to roubles payments for Russian gas export deliveries would take time and won’t begin immediately this week despite a March 31 deadline in a presidential order on the issue. “This process is more drawn out in time technologically,” he said.

Russia’s exports of refined fuels are sliding fast as buyers stay away following the invasion of Ukraine, denting supplies in a market that’s already fretting over stockpiles.

Europe tallies up economic fallout from war

The economic damage from the war in Ukraine is worsening across Europe as already-record inflation soars further and Germany faces a danger of recession because of its dependence on Russian energy.

In Spain, inflation surged by almost 10% in March – the most in nearly four decades – while advisers to Chancellor Olaf Scholz slashed Germany’s growth outlook.

Ukraine refugees top four million

More than four million refugees from Ukraine have fled after five weeks of fighting, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, said he’s in Ukraine now to meet with officials in the western city of Lviv.

Poland to shun Russian energy supplies this year

Poland plans to “do everything” to stop importing Russian oil and gas by the end of 2022, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said at a news conference. The European Union’s largest economy outside the euro will also halt coal purchases from Russia by April or May, he said.

The premier has called on the EU to tax Russian hydrocarbon imports in order to limit Russia’s ability to build its army and attack neighbouring countries.

UK says sanctions to stay until troops leave Ukraine

UK Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said sanctions on Russia will remain until the nation withdraws its troops from Ukraine.

“The sanctions are there to tighten the grip on Putin’s war machine and until the invasion is withdrawn – and I think that would need to be entirely or on a verifiable basis – I don’t think the sanctions can or should be lifted,” Raab told BBC radio in London.

Attacks continue near Kyiv, Ukraine says

Fighting continued north and west of Kyiv, despite Russia’s declaration it would pull its forces back. Russian forces shelled targets in several cities, including Hostomel, Bucha and Makariv and there were skirmishes in villages along the main westbound highway out of the capital, according to Ukraine’s defence ministry.

Russian forces also shelled the northern city of Chernihiv overnight, damaging civilian structures including libraries and shopping centres, according to Vyacheslav Chaus, the region’s governor, who said he was sceptical of Russia’s promise. “Do we believe this? Surely not,” he said in a video statement.

Rouble recovers as Moscow stocks rebound

Russia’s rouble strengthened for a third straight day, edging closer to wiping out the steep losses it incurred in the weeks after Putin sent troops into Ukraine. Stocks in Moscow climbed as much as 3.5% as oil and gas producers rallied. Crude oil rebounded after two days of gains, while stocks in Europe slipped along with US equity futures.

Germany triggers emergency plan for energy supplies

Germany activated an emergency plan to secure supplies of natural gas on concern the war in Ukraine could disrupt shipments from Russia. A task force will be established that will meet on a daily basis to monitor the situation and Economy Minister Robert Habeck urged companies and consumers to help by reducing energy consumption wherever possible.

Ukraine pushes for more humanitarian routes

Ukraine proposed that Russia should agree to establish humanitarian corridors in 97 areas that have suffered war damage, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video statement. As of Wednesday, three such corridors have been agreed upon, leading from Mariupol, Melitopol and Energodar.

India eyes new rouble payments for Russian oil

India is considering a proposal from Russia to use a rouble-based system developed by the Russian central bank for bilateral payments as the Asian nation seeks to buy oil and weapons from the sanctions-hit country. India is keen to continue bilateral trade due to its dependency on Russian weapons and the prospect of buying cheaper oil as global prices surge. Lavrov arrives in India for a two-day visit Thursday.

Apartment buildings hit in Russian attack

Russia shelled residential buildings in Lysychansk in the Ukraine-controlled part of Luhansk, and several apartment buildings suffered significant damage, according to the region’s governor. Moscow also targeted the towns of Rubizhne, Kreminna and Zolote in the region overnight.

The shelling in Luhansk also caused another 30,000 households to lose electricity and 34,000 households to stop receiving gas supplies.

Some Russian units return to Belarus, UK says

Some Russian units that have experienced heavy losses are returning to Belarus to regroup, the UK Defence Ministry said in an update on Twitter. “Such activity is placing further pressure on Russia’s already strained logistics and demonstrates the difficulties Russia is having reorganising its units in forward areas within Ukraine,” the ministry said, warning that Russia is expected to continue launching missile and artillery attacks.

Russian oil takes hit on exports, refining

Three key indicators of Russia’s oil industry declined in the second half of March as appetite for the nation’s barrels dropped at home and abroad, according to data seen by Bloomberg. It indicates how international pressure over the war is affecting Russia’s energy industry, which accounts for some 10% of global crude production.

Only a handful of nations have imposed explicit bans on imports from Russia, but many traditional customers are looking elsewhere amid condemnation of its military aggression.

Russian foreign minister in China

Lavrov is set to participate in a meeting of foreign ministers of countries bordering Afghanistan, Interfax reported last week.

He is also set to visit India on Thursday to discuss the sale of Russian crude to the country and the possibility of a rupee-rouble denominated payment method that could work outside the Swift messaging system.

Zelensky sees ‘positive’ signals in peace talks

There are some “positive” signals from the latest round of peace talks, though those signals “won’t drown out the explosions of Russian shells”, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his daily video address to the nation.

The Ukrainian president again ruled out any compromise over Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the negotiations and said the issue of easing sanctions on Russia can’t be raised before the war is over.

Threat to Kyiv hasn’t faded, says Pentagon

The threat to Kyiv isn’t over despite Russian talk of pulling back, because Putin’s goals continue to stretch well beyond the eastern Donbas region, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters.

“Nobody should be fooling ourselves by the Kremlin’s now recent claim that it will suddenly just reduce military attacks near Kyiv or any reports that it is going to withdraw all its forces,” Kirby said. It’s “a repositioning, not a real withdrawal” from positions around the Ukrainian capital.
