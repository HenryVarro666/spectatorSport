Kramer']",2022-02-25 00:00:00,"KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian defense forces, outmanned and outgunned, waged a ferocious resistance to the Russian invasion on Saturday, battling to keep control of the capital, Kyiv, and other cities around the country.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine posted a video on Twitter, telling the public not to believe false reports.

He was alive. Kyiv had not fallen. Any reports of Ukraine laying down its arms was a lie, Mr. Zelensky said.

“I’m here,” he said. “We are not putting down any arms. We will protect our country, because our weapons are our truth. The truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will protect them all.”

“That is it. That’s what I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.”

His comments, released before 9 a.m., came as fighting intensified in Kyiv. What until three days ago had been a thriving European metropolis has been transformed into a battle zone. Russian troops pressed in from all directions.

There was intense street fighting, and bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard across the city, including its heart, Maidan square, where in 2014 Ukrainian protests led to the toppling of a pro-Moscow government.

The Russian military has a decisive edge in cyberwarfare, tanks, heavy weaponry, missiles, fighter planes and warships. In sheer numbers, its military dwarfs that of Ukraine.

Russia has established attack lines into three cities — Kyiv in the north, Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south — and Ukrainian troops are fighting to hold all three. The Pentagon reported late Friday that the Russians did not appear to be in control of a single major population center. Significantly, a senior U.S. defense official said, Ukrainian command and control remains intact.

The Ukrainian government reported that hundreds of Russian soldiers had been killed in the war, along with scores of their own soldiers, while the Russian defense ministry issued a statement on Saturday morning that made no mention of any casualties or anything about the fight for Kyiv.

The Russian invasion started with targeted airstrikes before dawn on Thursday, but on the third day of the war, bloody battles were often being waged in close quarters. Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news site, citing witnesses, reported combat 400 yards from Maidan Square in central Kyiv.

All Ukrainian men of fighting are being drafted into service, and tens of thousands are signing up. Ukrainians were asked to make Molotov cocktails. And there were tearful scenes at airports in western Ukraine as wives kissed their husbands goodbye before they headed to front.

The nation has rallied around its president, Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian.

To him and other officials, the objective of the Russian invasion of a neighboring country that possessed no military threat is to topple the government.

Mr. Zelensky has said that he is “target no. 1.”

As battles were waged around the city on Saturday morning, there were reports of clashes near the city’s train station and along a central thoroughfare, Bohdan Khmelnitsky Street, leading from Victory Square toward the city center, according to the witness accounts. Along that street, closer to the city center, bursts of gunfire could be heard through the night.

“We are stopping the horde, so far as we can,” the secretary of the Ukrainian Security and Defense Council, Oleksy Danilov, said around 7 a.m. “The situation is under control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and citizens of Kyiv.”

In dozens of interviews in the tense hours before the invasion and in the days after, Ukrainians struggled to understand how a country at peace so suddenly found itself at war. For many Ukrainians, the answer was found in Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.

This is Mr. Putin’s war. But what frightened people perhaps as much as the threat of missiles and bombs was that they did not know what he wanted.

The fear was evident in the drive from Kyiv to a small village outside the city. Military convoys had replaced families going on vacation or visiting friends. Where once Kyiv was known as a city where the music played a touch too loud in its cafes, the incessant wail of air raid sirens drowned out all joy.

The fear was evident in the faces of the people seeking safety in Western Ukraine, after they emerged from 20-hour train rides in packed carriages that were kept pitch-black to avoid being targeting by Russian rockets.

From Lviv in the west to Odessa in the south and Kharkiv and nearly all points in between, people huddled in air raid shelters and lined up and bank machines and stocked up on essentials.

According to Newsweek, the orphanage is located in Okhtyrka, a small city in Ukraine’s Sumy province.

Casualties have been reported, some among them children, but no definite total is yet known. Severe injuries among victims have also been reported.

Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba is calling for an investigation into the reported attack.

“Today’s Russian attacks on a kindergarten and an orphanage are war crimes and violations of the Rome Statute,” Kuleba said in a Twitter statement. “Together with the General Prosecutor’s Office we are collecting this and other facts, which we will immediately send to the Hague. Responsibility is inevitable.”

The attack follows news of Russian forces have taken over the streets of Ukraine.

An air raid alert was issued in Kyiv on Friday, warning citizens to head for shelter immediately.

Zelensky, 44, spoke Friday as he continues to defend his country and his regime from Russian forces for the third straight day.

'What kind of war is being led against Ukrainian children in kindergartens? Who are they?'

Zelensky, a former actor, used some of the rhetoric the Russians have used to justify their invasion against them.

'Are they also neo-Nazis from kindergartens? Or are they NATO soldiers that put Russia in danger?' he asked.

He spoke after it was reported that a kindergarten and orphanage had been attacked in the city of Okhtyrka, a small city in the northeastern Ukrainian Sumy province.

Photos of the attack were shared by a Ukrainian lawmaker, who wrote: 'In a town Okhtyrka Russian missiles hit kindergarten and bomb shelter. Among dead and injured are children. What else Russian fascists should do for NATO to wake up and defend Ukraine?!'

Two adults are shown, apparently lying in puddles of blood, with others crouched alongside.

This came following the bombing of a hospital Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called 'beyond evil'.

'Consider this: Putin has launched a massive war of aggression in Europe during a still raging pandemic,' he added.

Ukraine's armed forces were engaged in a fierce battle for Kyiv on Friday night, with footage on social media showing explosions close to a metro station in the western center of the capital by the zoo; a battle ongoing for control of a thermal power plant to the north; and multiple reports suggesting fierce fighting 20 miles south, near a vital airbase.

In Kyiv, footage shared on social media showed a bombardment close to Beresteiska metro station, in the west of the city, which is near the zoo.

More than 50 explosions and heavy machine gun fire were reported in the district of Shulyavka, near Beresteiska metro and the zoo, according to The Kyiv Independent.

A bridge near the metro was blown up, according to reports. It was unclear whether the explosion was caused by artillery or by Ukrainian forces intent on stopping the Russian advance.

The district is under the control of the 101st Independent Security Brigade of the General Staff.

Terrified residents posted videos filmed from their apartments, with flashes of light and the sound of gunfire. One video shared on social media showed an apartment building glowing with red lights, which some speculated was to guide bombers or snipers. Others said the lights were to warn the military not to bomb them.

The northern suburb of Troieshchyna was also coming under sustained attack for another night, as Russia tried to wrest control of the thermal power plant on the banks of the Dnieper river. Unconfirmed reports suggested dozens of Russians had been arrested.

By 5:30am in Kyiv (10:30pm Eastern), Ukraine's armed forces were claiming that the advance from the west had been repelled.

But a CNN crew in Kyiv reported the sounds of heavy gunfire and what appeared to be anti-aircraft fire.

Ukraine's government said earlier on Friday night that they had shot down two Russian military transport planes carrying paratroopers on the outskirts of Kyiv.

The first IL-76 came down near Vasylkiv, 20 miles south of Kyiv, the Ukrainian military said.

The second IL-76 was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles south of the capital, Nexta reported.

The fate of those onboard was unclear. The aircrafts - medium-range military transport aircraft, which first went into service in 1974 - can hold 150-225 fully-equipped soldiers, and is used to drop paratroopers into combat and resupply arms.

The town of Vasylkiv appeared, at 3am local time (8pm Eastern), to be a focus of heavy fighting to the south.

Nexta, a local media network, reported that Russians 'dressed in uniform of the Ukrainian national police' attacked a checkpoint near Vasylkiv, shooting at Ukrainian soldiers.

'Immediately after that a group of Russian military in a truck came in. There is a heavy fight going on,' the site reported.

New satellite images showed the build up of troops to the north, in Belarus.

The photos showed approximately 150 transport helicopters and ground troops 20 miles from the Belarusian-Ukrainian border, in southern Belarus.

Not long after the first troop carrier was shot down, Ukraine's State Agency for Special Communications said that Ukraine's air defense had downed a Russian close-support aircraft and a helicopter in Donbas.

A S-300 surface-to-air missile system destroyed a Russian Sukhoi Su-25 jet and an unspecified helicopter at midnight, they said.

The Russian Air Force currently operates around 250 Su-25s of all variants, and they are considered a staple of Russian ground-attack regiments.

Opposition was growing in Russia to the carnage in Ukraine.

Communist MP Mikhail Matveev said: 'I think that the war should be stopped immediately.

'When I voted for the recognition of the DPR / LPR, I voted for peace, not for war.

'For Russia to become a shield, so that the Donbas was not bombed, but not for Kyiv to be bombed.'

The onslaught came shortly after Ukraine's president warned that the Russians intend to take Kyiv overnight, urging his countrymen to resist the expected onslaught as Western officials say the city appears surrounded.

Volodymyr Zelensky, addressing the nation from a secret location in the capital, had a dire warning for his embattled and defiant people on Friday night.

'Russia will try to break our resistance with all its might,' he said, in a video posted to social media.

'Tonight the enemy will begin storming us. We need to withstand them!'

Smoke and flames are seen billowing over Kyiv's Victory Avenue in the west of the city, near the zoo, in the early hours of Saturday morning

The Ukrainian armed forces tweeted in the early hours of Saturday that the attack from the west, near the city's zoo, had been repressed, stating: 'Russian war criminals attacked one of the military units in Kyiv on Victory Avenue. The attack was repulsed'

Zelensky said that Chernihiv, Symy, Kharkiv, Donbas, and the south could also come under attack.

'This night will be difficult, very difficult. But the morning will come,' he said, according to The Kyiv Independent.

The 44-year-old referenced the Russian shelling of a kindergarten in Ukraine that killed at least one child and injured more, saying: 'What kind of war is that? Were these children neo-Nazi? Or were they NATO soldiers?'

Vitali Klitschko, the former world champion heavyweight boxer who is now the mayor of Kyiv, said his city faces a 'difficult night'.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10553917/Zelensky-claims-Russian-forces-attacked-KINDERGARTENS-attempt-Ukraine.html
