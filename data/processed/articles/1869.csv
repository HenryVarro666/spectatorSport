MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — Ukrainian troops recaptured territory around Kyiv on Saturday as Russian forces pulled back from towns they had seized in the opening days of the war and left in their wake scenes of destruction and horror, including the abandoned bodies of dead civilians.

ArrowRight Journalists entered the town of Bucha, a suburb northwest of the capital, and saw numerous corpses strewn on the streets. Video posted to social media and verified by The Washington Post showed what appeared to be at least nine dead, including one child.

Bucha’s mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, said in an interview that around 270 local residents had been buried in two mass graves. He estimated that 40 people were lying dead in the streets. Some had been bound and executed — shot in the back of the head, he said.

The mayor added that officials are worried that the bodies could be booby-trapped with explosives. In a video address to Ukrainians early Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was “mining the whole territory.”

“They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed,” he said. The Post has not verified those claims.

Revelations of atrocities and alleged war crimes, including reports of soldiers firing on civilian protesters in the east, cast a pall over what has in some ways been a hopeful period for Ukrainians as they resist the Russian invaders.

The capital appears safe for the moment, but at the same time, shelling and intense fighting in the east and south of the country are continuing. Efforts to rescue civilians in besieged cities have been slowed by the extremely dangerous conditions on the ground.

The war, in its 38th day, remained a grinding conflict with no clear resolution in sight. The Russian strategic pivot may foreshadow a long war of attrition. That would prolong the already severe humanitarian crisis in which millions of Ukrainians have fled their homes, becoming refugees in neighboring countries.

A cease-fire in the largely destroyed coastal city of Mariupol has been in place for several days, creating a corridor to leave the city. A team from the Red Cross failed to reach the city Friday or Saturday, citing the unsafe environment. A Red Cross spokesperson emailed a note with few details saying that teams are en route but have yet to reach Mariupol.

Western military analysts are still trying to interpret the decision by Russian military commanders to reposition their forces. Russian officials have said they are concentrating their forces in the eastern part of the country. The repositioning could signal an intense battle for control of the Donbas region. It appears that, at least for now, Russian President Vladimir Putin has recalculated what he can and can’t achieve with his invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, Anna Malyar, said late Saturday that the entire Kyiv administrative region is fully under Ukrainian control.

Zelensky had said earlier that the movement of Russian forces was “slow but noticeable.”

But he continued his ongoing appeal to allied nations to do more to aid his war-scorched country. He cited the suffering in Mariupol, where tens of thousands of residents have been trying to survive amid the rubble.

“Europe has no right to react in silence to what is happening in our Mariupol. The whole world must react to this humanitarian catastrophe,” Zelensky said in his video address.

Zelensky’s demand for help came amid significant battlefield developments that potentially could alter the geography of the war.

If, as some Western analysts believe, Putin focuses on expanding his control of territory in the east, it would open a broad corridor between Russia and the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. But a more limited strategic goal could undermine support within Russia for the war effort.

But after Moscow’s negotiators agreed in talks with Ukraine to de-escalate the fighting around Kyiv and Chernihiv, and focus instead on the eastern Donbas region, propagandists and pro-war politicians expressed dismay. Prominent state television anchor Vladimir Solovyov said Thursday that “that any negotiation with the Nazis until the boot is on their throat is weakness. You shouldn’t shake hands with this creep,” he said, apparently referring to Zelensky.

Another pro-Kremlin journalist and blogger Semyon Pegov, from the outlet War Gonzo, which reports from the Russian side of the war, said the invasion was just beginning and that Russia would continue “to the end.” He called Russian soldiers “real Russian heroes.”

“No one and nothing will take away their feat from them,” he posted to Telegram on Friday. “It’s already gone down in history.”

As part of their retreat, Russian forces abandoned an airport seized at the start of the invasion. Near the border with Belarus, Ukrainian forces regained control of the disabled Chernobyl nuclear power plant that had been attacked and captured by Russian forces. The national flag once again was raised over the plant.

The repositioning of troops so far has been relatively modest and is possibly a tactic to fool the Ukrainians into lowering their defensive posture in the capital, Brookings Institution defense analyst Michael O’Hanlon said Saturday. He added the Russians may be hoping that Zelensky reveals his whereabouts.

“If they can get the Ukrainians to lower their guard, that would be for them potentially an opportunity to make a strike against Zelensky and/or his inner circle and the top tier of the government,” O’Hanlon said. “I still think there’s a possibility that they’re trying to lure the Ukrainians into making a mistake.”

On-and-off negotiations for a broad cease-fire have been on again in recent days, but the sincerity of the Russians at the table has been questioned by their Ukrainian counterparts. They fear, as do security analysts in the West, that Russian gestures toward a cease-fire and a negotiated peace could be a diversion to help the attackers reposition their forces after the initial thrust of the invasion yielded disappointing results.

According to Ukrainian media reports, David Arakhamia, the head of the Ukrainian delegation to the talks, said officials are preparing for a possible meeting between Zelensky and Putin in Turkey.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych told national television that Ukrainians should prepare for “difficult fights” ahead in Mariupol and in the southern and eastern regions of the country.

In the east, four people were “injured and severely burned” after Russian forces fired mortars at protesters in a city near Zaporizhzhia, the site of a nuclear plant that Russia captured last month, according to Ukraine’s human rights ombudswoman.

Residents of Enerhodar, a satellite town of Zaporizhzhia, which has been occupied by Russian forces for nearly four weeks, held a rally in support of Ukraine on Saturday. Russian soldiers used light and noise grenades to disrupt the protest and opened mortar fire on residents, the ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said in a statement posted to Telegram.

“Such treatment of civilians is a crime against humanity and a war crime as defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,” Denisova said.

The Washington Post verified two videos recorded by witnesses and posted to Telegram. The images were filmed at the same time from separate angles and show at least nine flashes followed by large booms. Gunfire is audible as people run away from the site of the protest.

“There is a fight in the city center!” a man yells in a third video, verified by The Post, while rushing away from multiple loud booms. “Russian occupiers attacked civilians. There was a peaceful protest here.”

Tens of thousands of people in recent weeks have fled Ukrainian cities under attack by Russian forces after Kyiv and Moscow agreed on fragile evacuation deals.

Across Ukraine, seven humanitarian corridors have been established, according to Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, including the one from Mariupol. She said in a Telegram post that more than 6,000 people were evacuated from front-line cities to other parts of the country on Friday.

Vereshchuk said those evacuees included more than 1,400 people who left in their vehicles along planned routes from the southern cities of Berdyansk and Melitopol, which are under Russian control, to the nearby Zaporizhzhia region.

Among them were hundreds of people from Mariupol who had managed to escape in private vehicles. Separately, she said, a convoy of 42 buses carried Mariupol residents to Zaporizhzhia from Berdyansk, which they had previously reached on their own.

In southern Ukraine, the death toll from a missile strike that hit a main government building in the city of Mykolaiv this week has risen to 32, the governor of the region, Vitaliy Kim, said Saturday on Telegram.

Dozens of people remain unaccounted for after that attack blasted a hole through part of the building, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a press officer of the Mykolaiv Regional State Administration, said earlier. More than 30 people were injured, he said as rescue workers continued to clear rubble Friday and funerals were held for many of the victims.

The war continues to stir tensions globally and could have ramifications in low Earth orbit: The director of Russia’s space agency suggested he would submit a proposal to end his country’s cooperation in the International Space Station program.

In tweets on Saturday, Dmitry Rogozin, head of the agency Roscosmos, pointed to sanctions against a “number of enterprises in the Russian rocket and space industry.” He said that he appealed to the heads of NASA, the Canadian Space Agency and the European Space Agency to lift sanctions and that in their responses, the “position of our partners is clear: the sanctions will not be lifted.”

“I believe that the restoration of normal relations between partners in the International Space Station and other joint projects is possible only with the complete and unconditional lifting of illegal sanctions,” Rogozin wrote.

Rogozin has frequently used threatening and blustery rhetoric, including to repeatedly suggest Russia could exit the partnership. His latest remarks came three days after two Russian cosmonauts and a NASA astronaut returned from the space station, a symbol of partnership in space even amid mounting tensions over the war in Ukraine.

Since Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, NASA has maintained that the station has been operating as normal, unaffected by the conflict. NASA has said it would be unable to operate the space station without the Russians because the nation provides the propulsion necessary to keep the station in orbit.

In China, officials on Saturday renewed their criticism of sanctions placed on Russia. The remarks came a day after a high-level virtual summit between China and the European Union.

“We oppose sanctions, and the effects of these sanctions also risk spilling to the rest of the world,” Wang Lutong, director general of European affairs at China’s Foreign Ministry, told reporters on Saturday.

Since Russian forces invaded Ukraine, E.U. leaders have taken a tougher stance on China, urging it to drop its tacit support for the invasion and work for peace — but Beijing is pushing back.

“China is not a related party on the crisis of Ukraine. We don’t think our normal trade with any other country should be affected,” Wang said. He added that China is contributing to the global economy by conducting normal trade with Russia.

Pope Francis said Saturday that he is considering making a trip to Kyiv. While traveling from Rome to Malta, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church was asked by a reporter on his plane whether a visit to Ukraine was a possibility following invitations from Ukrainian political and religious officials.

“Yes, it is on the table,” Francis answered, but he offered no further details, according to Reuters.

Zelensky has spoken twice with the pope by telephone, according to the Vatican, and along with Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has extended invitations to Francis to visit Ukraine. The country has a sizable Roman Catholic population. However, most Ukrainian Catholics identify with the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

Francis has vocally condemned the war in Ukraine, calling it a “senseless massacre where every day slaughters and atrocities are being repeated.”

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

A few dozen people who had been living mostly in basements for a month staggered outside to collect food — bags of potatoes and bread — brought by Ukrainian soldiers.

Elena Shur, 43, an accountant for Ukraine’s national airline, said the first sign of the Ukrainian military came on Friday, when a civilian car carrying soldiers drove through town waving the country’s flag.

“We saw people on the street, and soldiers,” Ms. Shur said. “I cried.”

Reporters counted six bodies of civilians on the streets and sidewalks of Bucha. It was unclear under what circumstances they had died, but the discarded packaging of a Russian military ration was lying beside one man who had been shot in the head.

As photos of casualties in Bucha emerged, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president said on Saturday that some of the dead wearing civilian clothes appeared to have been bound and executed.

“The bodies of people with tied hands, who were shot dead by soldiers lie in the streets,” the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter. “These people were not in the military. They had no weapons. They posed no threat.” He included an image of a scene, photographed by Agence France-Presse, showing three bodies on the side of a road, one with hands apparently tied behind the back.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Kremlin-ordered attack on his country amounted to genocide, after local officials reported scores of civilians had been killed in the towns of Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel near the capital.

Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s refusal to be subdued to Russia was the reason “we are being destroyed and exterminated”, describing the war to the US network CBS as “the torture of the whole nation”.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dymtro Kuleba, said Russia was “worse than Isis”.

Witnesses of alleged atrocities in Bucha told the Guardian that Russian soldiers, who have now withdrawn from the area, had fired on men fleeing the town, and had killed civilians at will.

Taras Schevchenko, 43, said Russian soldiers had refused to allow men to leave through a humanitarian corridor, instead shooting at them as they fled across an open field. Bodies, he said, were scattered on the pavements, with some of those killed having been “squashed by tanks … like animal skin rugs”.

Shevchenko’s mother, Yevdokia, 77, said she had witnessed an elderly man who had challenged a Russian soldier being shot dead as his wife stood next to him. “They shot him dead, and ordered the woman to leave,” she said. The accounts could not be independently verified.

Reporters from Agence France-Presse saw at least 20 bodies, all in civilian clothing, strewn across a single street in the town of Bucha on Friday. One had his hands tied behind his back with a white cloth, and his Ukrainian passport left open beside his body. “All these people were shot,” Bucha’s mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, told AFP, adding that a further 280 bodies had been buried in mass graves in the town.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said: “I am deeply shocked by the images of civilians killed in Bucha, Ukraine. It is essential that an independent investigation leads to effective accountability.”

The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the killings added to evidence of Russian war crimes, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, expressed shock about the “terrible and horrifying” footage from Bucha. “Streets littered with bodies. Bodies buried in makeshift conditions. There is talk of women, children and the elderly among the victims,” Scholz said.

The British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, said it was clear that rape had been used as a weapon of war by Russian forces. She said: “Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.”

Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, condemned the killings of civilians in the town of Bucha as a “terrible war crime [that] cannot go unanswered” and called for a strengthening of sanctions. The country’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the images from Bucha were “unbearable”.

“Putin’s frantic violence is wiping out innocent families and knows no bounds,” she wrote on Twitter, adding that those responsible for war crimes must be held to account.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, described the killings at Bucha as “a punch to the gut” and joined western allies in vowing to document the atrocities to hold the perpetrators to account.

The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said he was shocked by “haunting images of atrocities committed by [the] Russian army in liberated region of Kyiv”, adding that “further EU sanctions and support are on their way”.

The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she was “appalled by reports of unspeakable horrors in areas from which Russia is withdrawing”. An independent investigation was urgently needed, she said, and “perpetrators of war crimes will be held accountable”.

Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minister, pledged France would work with Ukrainian authorities and the international criminal court (ICC) “to ensure these acts don’t go unpunished and that those responsible are being sent to trial and convicted”.

Johnson, who spoke on Saturday to Zelenskiy, said the UK “will continue to step up military, economic and diplomatic support, including further ramping up sanctions to increase the economic pressure on Putin’s war machine, while Russian troops remain on Ukrainian territory”.

He said the murder of innocent civilians in Irpin and Bucha was “yet more evidence that Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine”. The Russian president’s invasion was failing, Johnson added, and Ukrainian forces’ resolve had “never been stronger”.

Russia for its part tried to paint the situation in Bucha as somehow representing a “provocation” by Ukraine intended to disrupt peace talks. The Kremlin’s foreign ministry said Russia was seeking a UN security council meeting on the matter. Russia denied responsibility for the Bucha killing of civilians. Its defence ministry described the photos and videos as “another staged performance by the Kyiv regime”, echoing a similar claim made after the bombing of a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol.

Russia has repeatedly claimed, without proof, that Ukraine has staged such atrocities, but the Kremlin line is starkly contradicted by conditions on the ground and ample evidence of Russian attacks on civilian targets.

Kuleba urged the ICC and international organisations to come to the region to collect evidence of Russian war crimes.

Speaking on Times Radio on Sunday, he said Bucha was a “deliberate massacre”. Describing Russia as “worse than Isis”, he said Russian forces were guilty of murder, torture, rape and looting. He also urged G7 countries to impose “devastating” sanctions immediately.

Another senior Ukrainian official, Mykhailo Podolyak, who is leading Kyiv’s negotiating team in talks with the Russians, condemned the lack of western response as further horrific images emerged. “Today’s ‘leaders of Europe’, hundreds of current European politicians, [are] eating well and sleeping peacefully in their beds now, do you not want to look closely at this photo archive of hell arranged by Russians in the Kiev region?”

At a Brussels summit last week, the EU’s 27 leaders agreed to “move quickly with further coordinated robust sanctions” against Russia and its ally Belarus, but they have been divided about next steps.

Germany, whose industrial economy is heavily dependent on Russian gas, has resisted calls for an immediate ban on Russian fossil fuels, angering Poland and the Baltic states, which would like the most stringent measures against the Kremlin’s war machine.

Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who cruised to victory in parliamentary elections on Sunday, has also faced criticism from Ukraine for his past support for Russia. Over the weekend, Zelenskiy renewed his attack on Orbán, saying he had failed to show moral leadership and lacked honesty. “He is virtually the only one in Europe to openly support Mr Putin,” Zelenskiy said.

On Saturday, Latvian authorities announced that all three Baltic states had stopped importing Russian gas since 1 April. Lithuania’s president, Gitanes Nausėda, said his country was no longer importing Russian gas. ”If we can do it, the rest of Europe can too,” he wrote on Twitter.

Nausėda said the “photo and video evidence from Irpin [and] Bucha unveil the brutal reality of horrific war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine”.

Russia’s actions in Bucha were consistent with more than a century of military practice, said Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. “Anyone saying that Bucha is the result of brutalisation or rogue behaviour is wrong. This was the plan. It was premeditated,” he wrote on Twitter. “And if the Russian military had been more successful there would have been many more towns like it.

“Now that the Ukrainians have pushed the Russians out of Kyiv… we are in this kind of dangerous inflection point, where the Russians have a more credible concept of operation,” he told the Guardian, referring to Russia’s decision to focus on southern Ukraine and the Donbas.

“The Russians could regroup and rebuild momentum and start taking ground again, but they are currently on the back foot and they are somewhat disorganised and morale is very low. If Ukrainians can capitalise on that they can potentially roll back the Russians.”

He added that the next couple of weeks “are a critical turning point in terms of whether the Ukrainians can keep the momentum”.

Western countries needed to prioritise military equipment, such as anti-tank weapons, air defence missiles and portable air defence systems that would allow Ukraine “to start attriting the Russian air defence systems command posts, electronic warfare systems, high-value targets”.

“Not all western countries have those systems and those that don’t should help resource those that do.”

The evidence of atrocities emerged against a backdrop of faltering peace negotiations. Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said talks on an agreement were not advanced enough to allow a meeting between Zelenskiy and Putin, contradicting a more optimistic statement from his Ukrainian opposite number, David Arakhamia. Ukraine has offered to relinquish its goal to join Nato, a key Russian demand, but the two sides have not agreed on the status of Russia-annexed Crimea and two self-declared republics in the Donbas.

BUCHA, Ukraine, April 3 (Reuters) - Ukraine on Sunday accused Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha, while Western nations reacted to images of dead bodies there with calls for new sanctions against Moscow.

Russia's defence ministry denied the Ukrainian allegations, saying footage and photographs showing bodies in Bucha were ""yet another provocation"" by the Ukrainian government.

The images from the town, 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv's city centre, emerged after Ukraine said on Saturday its forces had reclaimed control of the whole Kyiv region and liberated towns from Russian troops.

Anatoliy Fedoruk announced on Friday night that the town outside the capital had been reclaimed the previous day, adding that 31 March “will go down in the history of our town... as the day of its liberation from Russia”.

The news came as a Ukrainian journalist claimed that Russian troops were retreating “en masse” from around Kyiv.

Oleksiy Sorokin said Bucha and Hostomel were among “tens of other towns and villages” that are now under the Ukrainian flag.

It has not been possible to independently verify these claims.

Meanwhile a spokesman for Ukraine’s military said Russian units had “partially” withdrawn from Kyiv and Chernihiv - adding there were currently insufficient Russian troops to attack the capital.

“But we can’t predict what will happen, and we aren’t going to reduce our defence,” he said.

It comes three days after Moscow claimed it would reduce military activity near the capital and the northern city of Chernihiv to promote trust in talks between Russia and Ukraine.

However the mayor of Kyiv said the bombardment of satellite towns near capital was ongoing. Vitali Klitschko told Sky News on Friday he could hear the sounds of explosions “nonstop during the day and night”.

Ukraine’s military claimed on Friday that 17,700 Russian troops have now been killed since the invasion began on February 24, with 1,751 armoured personnel vehicles destroyed.

Last week, Russia claimed that 1,351 of its troops had died fighting in Ukraine, while a Nato officer has estimated between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian deaths.

As Russia appeared to shifting its focus away from Kyiv and the surrounding areas, there were reports on Friday night of rockets hitting a residential district around Odesa in southwest Ukraine. The region’s governor said there were casualties, claiming the missiles were fired from an Iskander missile system in Crimea, the southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.

Meanwhile a Red Cross convoy was forced to postpone a rescue mission in the besieged port of Mariupol.

The convoy was intended to help residents escape the devastated city on Friday but was forced to turn around, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said.

“They will try again on Saturday to facilitate the safe passage of civilians from Mariupol,” the ICRC said in a statement. It said the convoy returned to Zaporizhzhia northwest of the southern port “after arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed.”

Mariupol has been encircled since the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that began on February 24.

A previous attempt by the Red Cross to reach it in early March failed because the route was found to be unsafe.

The Red Cross team of three cars carrying nine staff members had aimed to lead a convoy of about 54 Ukrainian buses and a number of private vehicles out of the city, where the mayor says 170,000 people are without power and have limited food.

ICRC spokesperson Ewan Watson said the Red Cross was not allowed to take medical equipment and other humanitarian aid with the convoy.

“The situation is horrendous and deteriorating. It is now a humanitarian imperative that people be allowed to leave and aid supplies be allowed in,” Watson said.

Ukrainian authorities also said the Russians were blocking humanitarian aid from reaching Mariupol.

After announcing Friday mission’s had been unsuccessful, the ICRC renewed its appeal for all parties to respect the agreements before the next attempt and provide “the necessary conditions and security guarantees.”

In other developments as the invasion entered its 38th day:

* Ukraine denied accusations from Moscow that it had launched a cross-border attack on a fuel depot. The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said two people had been wounded in a raid by two helicopter gunships on the fuel depot 20 miles from the border.

“For some reason they say that we did it, but in fact this does not correspond with reality,” Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, said on Ukrainian TV.

* Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr Putin had ordered the military to strengthen the country’s western borders so that no one would ever think of launching an attack.

* The White House said the US is providing Ukraine with supplies and equipment in case Russia deploys chemical or biological weapons. Press secretary Jen Psaki said the supplies were being provided given the possibility that Russia could deploy such weapons in Ukraine and might be planning a “false flag” operation to lay the groundwork for such an attack.

* The International Energy Agency says its members agreed Friday to release further oil from their emergency reserves in response to the market turmoil caused by Russia’s invasion.

* Turkey’s president said he renewed a call for a meeting between leaders of Ukraine and Russia in a phone call Friday with Mr Putin.

* The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said that Russian forces’ departure from the decommissioned Chernobyl power plant on Thursday is “a step in the right direction” and the UN nuclear watchdog plans to be there “very, very soon.”",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/ukraine-invasion-bucha-kyiv-mariupol-odesa-putin-troops-killed-zelensky-b992073.html

Russia preventing Ukraine resupply by Black Sea: UK

The British ministry of defence has said Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea.

Russia retains the capability to attempt an amphibious landing, but such an operation is likely to be increasingly risky due to the time Ukrainian forces have had to prepare, the ministry said on Twitter.

It added that the presence of mines within the Black Sea was “almost certainly the result of Russian naval activity in the area, demonstrating how its invasion of Ukraine is affecting neutral and civilian interests”.

Russia increasing air activity in southeastern Ukraine: UK

The British Ministry of Defence says there has been a “concentration of Russian air activity in southeastern Ukraine” over the past week.

This is likely a result of Russia focusing its military operations in that area, the ministry said in its latest intelligence update.

It added that Ukraine continues to provide a significant challenge to Russian air and missile operations despite Russian efforts to diminish Ukrainian air defence capabilities.

“Russia’s inability to find and destroy air defence systems has seriously hampered their efforts to gain broad control of the air, which in turn has significantly affected their ability to support the advance of their ground forces on a number of fronts.”

UK could build up to seven nuclear plants

The United Kingdom could build up to seven new nuclear power stations as part of a radical expansion of homegrown energy following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told The Sunday Telegraph.

“There is a world where we have six or seven sites in the UK” by 2050, Kwarteng told the newspaper.

The Sunday Telegraph said ministers have agreed to set up a new development vehicle, called Great British Nuclear, to identify sites, cut through red tape to speed up the planning process, and bring together private firms to run each site.

It said Britain’s new energy security strategy, set to be unveiled on Thursday, is expected to commit the government to supporting the construction of at least two new large-scale nuclear plants by 2030 in addition to small modular reactors.

Russia ‘verbally’ agreed to Ukraine proposals: Negotiator

Ukraine’s top negotiator in peace talks with Russia said that Moscow had “verbally” agreed to key Ukrainian proposals, raising hopes that talks to end fighting are moving forward.

Negotiator David Arakhamia told Ukrainian television channels that any meeting between Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin would “with a high probability” take place in Turkey.

“The Russian Federation has given an official answer to all positions, which is that they accept the (Ukrainian) position, except for the issue of Crimea [annexed by Russia in 2014],” Arakhamia said.

Russia and Ukraine have held several rounds of negotiations, both in Turkey and by video conference.

Almost 300 buried in mass grave in Bucha, near Kyiv: Mayor

Almost 300 people have been buried in a mass grave in Bucha, discovered after the Ukrainian army retook control of the key town close to Kyiv.

Anatoly Fedoruk told Al Jazeera that the town’s streets remain littered with the bodies of at least 22 people killed by Russian forces. He said it had not been possible to collect the bodies yet, amid fears that Russian forces had booby-trapped the corpses.

“According to the mayor, [the dead people] were trying to escape to Ukrainian-held territory when, according to him, they were simply gunned down,” said Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Lviv in western Ukraine.

Ukraine says regained control of ‘whole Kyiv region’

Ukraine has regained control of “the whole Kyiv region” after Russian forces retreated from key towns near the Ukrainian capital, Deputy Defence Minister Ganna Maliar said.

“Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the whole Kyiv region were liberated from the invader,” Maliar said on Facebook.

All three towns lie northwest of Kyiv and have suffered heavy destruction since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24.

Ukraine presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said its troops have retaken more than 30 towns and villages since Russia pulled back from the area this week.

Officials in Ukraine said that troops had found civilian corpses with bound hands, gunshot wounds to the head, and showing signs of torture, after Russian soldiers withdrew from the outskirts of the country’s capital. The Ukrainian government has accused Russia’s armed forces of carrying out a “massacre” and “genocide”.

After Ukraine announced on Saturday that it had reclaimed control of the Kyiv region – the first time it has done so since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion on 24 February – the mayor of Bucha, a liberated town 37 km northwest of the capital, said that hundreds of its residents had been killed by the Russian army.

Ukrainian prosecutors investigating possible war crimes by Russia have so far found 410 bodies in various towns near Kyiv, the country’s prosecutor general Iryna Venedyktova said later on Sunday.

The photographs of bodies strewn across the street, wrapped in bin bags and buried in mass graves, in Bucha as well as in the Kyiv suburbs of Irpin and Hostomel, spurred calls from officials in Ukraine, and vows from ministers across Europe, to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow.

Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, said the scores of dead looked like “a scene from a horror movie”, while Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said: “Bucha massacre was deliberate. We are still gathering and looking for bodies, but the number has already gone into the hundreds.

“Dead bodies lie on the streets. They killed civilians while staying there and when they were leaving these villages and towns.”

Mr Kuleba urged the G7 nations to impose “devastating” new sanctions on Moscow that would target its oil, gas and coal industries, goods exports, and financial sector, and asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to collect evidence of what he called war crimes.

In an interview with CBS News later on Sunday, Mr Zelensky himself said Russia was committing genocide against his country.

“Indeed, this is genocide. The elimination of the whole nation and the people,” he said, speaking through a translator. “We are the citizens of Ukraine and we don’t want to be subdued to the policy of Russian Federation. This is the reason we are being destroyed and exterminated.”

Russia’s defence ministry denied that its forces had killed civilians in Bucha, and described photos and videos from the town as “another staged performance by the Kyiv regime for the western media”.

Moscow has previously denied targeting civilians, and has rejected allegations of war crimes in what it calls a “special military operation” aimed at demilitarising and “denazifying” Ukraine.

The foreign ministers of France, Germany, the UK and the US were among those to condemn Russia over the reports from Bucha.

US secretary of state Antony Blinken said the images of dead civilians were a “punch in the gut” and that those responsible must be held accountable.

UK prime minister Boris Johnson denounced Russia’s “despicable attacks” against civilians in Bucha and Irpin, describing them as war crimes and pledging tougher sanctions against Moscow along with increased military support for Ukraine. The British government has vowed to support any war crimes investigation undertaken by the ICC, and Mr Johnson said it would provide additional funding and investigators for the court.

Earlier, foreign secretary Liz Truss said that “indiscriminate” attacks by Russian forces against innocent civilians must be investigated as war crimes, and that the UK would “not rest” until those responsible for the “atrocities” in Ukraine had faced justice. Ms Truss added that Russia would not be allowed to cover up its involvement by means of “cynical disinformation”.

French president Emmanuel Macron, who has spoken frequently with Mr Putin in recent weeks, called the pictures “unbearable” and said that Moscow “will have to answer for these crimes”, while the German vice-chancellor Robert Habeck said the killings were a “terrible war crime [that] cannot go unanswered”.

Later, Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that western allies would agree further sanctions on Russia in the coming days, in response to its continuing invasion and the “atrocities” committed by its forces in Bucha.

Nato head Jens Stoltenberg described the killings as “a brutality against civilians” not seen in Europe for decades, while UN chief Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply shocked” by the images and called for an independent investigation into the deaths.

Meanwhile, fighting continued across Ukraine on Sunday in the sixth week of a war that has driven more than 4 million people out of the country as refugees and uprooted at least 6.5 million people within the country.

Missiles struck near the southern port of Odesa, with Russia saying it had destroyed an oil refinery and fuel depots used by the Ukrainian military to supply its troops.

The regional governor in northeastern Kharkiv said that Russian artillery and tanks had launched over 20 strikes on Ukraine’s second-largest city and its outskirts over the past day, killing an unstated number of civilians and injuring 23.

Evacuation efforts in southeastern Mariupol and nearby Berdyansk were set to continue, with a convoy of buses being prepared with help from the Red Cross, although The Independent understands that hopes are low after several previous attempts have failed.

The strategic port city is Russia’s main target in the Donbas region, and tens of thousands of civilians there have been trapped for weeks with very little to eat or drink. Several residents who had managed to escape the city by their own means told The Independent on Saturday that those who remained there had been forced to bury the bodies of those killed by shelling in graves they had dug in gardens, parks, and the sandpits of nursery schools.

There was little sign of a breakthrough on Sunday in efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict, although Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said talks were set to resume on Monday via videoconference.
