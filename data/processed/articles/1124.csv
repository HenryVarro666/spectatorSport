According to the Kremlin, Putin gave Bennett his assessments on the ongoing negotiations and “progress of the special military operation” in Ukraine.

The Russian leader also expressed condolences over Wednesday’s deadly terror attack in Beersheba, the statement added.

There was no immediate comment from the Prime Minister’s Office on the latest call.

The two leaders last spoke on March 14. Bennett has held a handful of calls with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as he has sought to exploit Israel’s working ties with both countries to help mediate a ceasefire that will end the war. He even traveled earlier this month to Moscow, where he became the first foreign leader to meet in person with Putin since the invasion began on February 24.

Bennett has reportedly told his staff to lay the groundwork for a possible trip to Kyiv if enough progress is made in the negotiations to warrant such a summit.

Wednesday’s call was the first since Zelensky spoke over Zoom Sunday to Knesset lawmakers, in a speech in which he lamented the middling support from Jerusalem.

Bennett has sought to avoid aligning too closely with Ukraine due to fears that it might risk spoiling Israel’s ties with Russia, which controls the airspace over Syria. Israel needs coordination with Moscow as it operates to target Iranian proxies in the country.

Avoiding a clear alignment with the West has exposed Israel to significant criticism, as it refuses requests to supply Ukraine with much-needed military aid or to join international sanctions against Russian oligarchs. It has, however, supplied humanitarian aid and this week opened a field hospital near Lviv.

Channel 13 reported last week that senior members of Bennett’s coalition have warned him that the mediation efforts could have negative repercussions due to his association with Putin, and that they feel the dangers are increasing.

If the prime minister helps broker some kind of deal that includes any achievements for Putin, the unnamed coalition partners cautioned, Bennett might be tarnished for having helped the Russian president against Ukraine and its internationally supported leader, President Volodymyr Zelensky, the report said.

And if the effort fails, they warned, Bennett could be seen as having enabled Putin to mislead negotiators to better Russia’s military position.

A report from The Financial Times last week said Bennett was the “primary international mediator” in ceasefire negotiations between the sides, citing three people familiar with the matter.

Officials close to the prime minister have been careful not to exaggerate Bennett’s role in negotiations and have said he is not actively making proposals or pressuring the sides. Instead, they describe him as a channel of communication, passing messages from the sides in what they have described as a frank and realistic manner.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/putin-speaks-to-bennett-on-ukraine-offers-condolences-over-beersheba-attack/

At the end of last month, the Israeli PM offered his country's intermediary services on Ukraine to Putin. Earlier, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had also asked Naftali Bennett to serve as a mediator in possible talks with Russia.

Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine on February 24 with the goal of demilitarizing the country, neutralizing nationalist battalions, ensuring Ukraine remains a neutral country and that Crimea is recognized as a part of Russia that cannot be taken away. Russia also seeks to ensure Ukraine also recognizes the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics are independent states.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke this week on the phone with both the Ukrainian and Russian presidents, continuing his diplomatic efforts to mediate between the sides.

On Wednesday, he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The last time he spoke with him was nine days earlier. A statement issued by the Kremlin said Putin gave Bennett his assessments on the ongoing negotiations and ""progress of the special military operation"" in Ukraine. Reportedly, the Russian president expressed condolences over Wednesday’s deadly terror attack in Beersheba, where four Israeli civilians were killed.

A day earlier, Bennett spoke with Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian president said he had spoken that day with Bennett, as well as with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda. In a late-night speech broadcast on social networks, Zelenskyy said, “All the conversations and speeches are so that Russia will understand one thing: We need to reach peace. Russia should also want peace.” Zelenskyy did not offer any details about his conversation with Bennett.

On Sunday, Zelenskyy said Jerusalem could be a good venue to hold a peace summit. Zelenskyy's chief-of-staff, Andriy Yermak, expressed yesterday the same idea. In a video call with Israeli reporters, Yermak said that Israel could also be ""one of the guarantors of a major international treaty that would provide clear security guarantees"" for his country. ""Such an agreement provides for a large list of countries — potential guarantors. Therefore, we are holding separate consultations with each of these countries in order to meet together afterward,"" Yermak said.

Ukraine, he added, ""has very warm, friendly and special relations with Israel,"" noting that Ukrainian leadership appreciates Israel's mediation efforts. ""We are amazed at how deeply Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, are aware of the issue. And we believe that he is really determined to do everything necessary to bring peace to our land and end the war.""

French President Emmanuel Macron hailed yesterday all those leaders ""who dialogue with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, whether they are from the European Union or not."" Macron was apparently referring primarily to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with whom he met earlier that morning, but perhaps also to Bennett.

Yesterday, Israel was among the 140 countries that supported a UN General Assembly resolution demanding an end to Russia’s war against Ukraine. Israel was also among over 70 countries to endorse the text.

Yesterday’s resolution was the second one adopted by the UN against the Russian invasion. Israel had also supported and sponsored that first text, which was approved with 141 votes. In both cases, Israel was represented by Deputy Ambassador Noa Furman and not by Ambassador Gilad Erdan himself. Also, Israel did not sponsor a similar resolution adopted by the UN Security Council shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid met in Jerusalem with European Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi, discussing among other issues Israel’s absorption of Ukrainian refugees. Lapid tweeted after the meeting, ""We had a productive conversation about regional challenges as well as possibilities for deepening ties between Israel and Europe.""",https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/03/israels-bennett-continues-mediation-efforts-between-russia-ukraine
