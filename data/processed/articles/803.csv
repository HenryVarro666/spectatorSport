0,7d71a442-1f27-40c2-8db5-bac7dcd29469,[],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"Footage apparently shot by one of Ukraine’s Turkish-built Bayraktar TB2 drones shows the routing of an ambushed Russian convoy as it neared Kyiv this week, forcing the diminished column to beat a hasty retreat – and offering an example of the determined and often successful counterattacks defenders have inflicted on invading troops during the three-week conflict.

The video was tweeted by the international group of researchers Bellingcat on Thursday, with text describing it as showing “a Russian military column coming under attack and retreating… in Brovary, northeast of Kyiv.” Republication by various media outlets since has added information – some identifying the village by another name – but all tend to concur on the main elements and veracity of the footage. Shot straight on from a drone, it captures a convoy of over 20 Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers being ambushed by Ukraine militia fighters, who destroyed at least two vehicles and reportedly killed the commanding officer before the column sped off back where it had come from.

It’s unclear whether the drone fired any of the shots in what’s been dubbed online as the “Battle of Brovary,” but the effective Ukraine attack – and ignoble retreat of the battered Russian convoy – is emblematic of the unexpected resistance that has slowed or halted the advance of invading troops.

Accompanying the Ukrainian drone video is presumably a radio intercept of a Russian soldier in Brovary reporting to someone wanting updates on the situation. A translation of the exchange posted as a reply to the Bellingcat footage appears to confirm the death of the commanding officer.

The ambush was reportedly the work of Ukraine Azov militia, which – while having earned plaudits for its highly effective action against Russian forces – traces its origins to extreme-right nationalists who fought Moscow-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine. While particularly potent, however, that unit is just one of many formed by Ukrainian volunteers across the country to defend their cities from invading forces.

That far stronger Ukrainian resistance than Russian President Vladimir Putin banked on has also gotten significant aerial support from Turkish Bayraktar TB2 military drones, and medium-sized domestic Punisher UAVs. Both have both claimed serious losses to enemy vehicles, munitions, and personnel.

Also spotted in the Ukraine drone video of the ambush is what in some postings say may have been a Russian TOS-1A Heavy Flamethrower – a tank-mounted thermobaric warhead launcher. The weapon essentially turns the air and everything around its targets into flames, and was used with devastating and horrific effect during Russia’s 2000 invasion of Chechnya, which some observers fear may become Putin’s model for continued combat in Ukraine.

It looks like an instructional video from the U.S. Army Infantry School at Ft. Benning, Georgia. Or perhaps a cautionary video for tank crews at the Armor School there.

As video continues to surface from the conflict in Ukraine, these images of a column of Russian tanks being ambushed in a classic anti-armor missile engagement will likely be watched and re-watched by tank crews around the world. This video is a worst-case scenario for tank crews.

Any time an armored column is forced to move through an urban environment surrounded by buildings and constrained to driving on a road, the vehicles in the armored column loose one of their biggest advantages; the ability to maneuver.

Heavy tanks in a closely spaced column with buildings on each side have only two directions to move, forward or rearward. Opposing force anti-tank units can easily cover both escape venues when initiating an ambush with lightweight, portable anti-tank missiles. This is the tipping point on the fulcrum of asymmetrical warfare for small units that are well-drilled and well equipped with modern anti-tank weapons. A small number of skilled and daring infantrymen can take on a large column of heavy tanks and win.

Ukrainian forces are using a broad assortment of portable anti-tank weapons ranging from the old and relatively small 66mm M72 Light Anti-Tank Weapon (LAW) to the lethal and highly advanced FGM-148 Javelin, and nearly everything in between. The Ukrainians are throwing the anti-armor kitchen sink at the advancing Russians, and according to most western media accounts and the maps of Russian progress in Ukraine, these anti-tank weapons and the tactics used to employ them are proving to be at least somewhat effective, perhaps highly effective, in slowing the Russian advance.

This video surfaced on Mar. 9, 2022, on the ukraine_defence social network channels. It shows what is likely 10 Russian heavy tanks and additional, lighter armored vehicles entering a Ukrainian village. The scenario is bad for the Russians.

﻿

The vehicle column is constrained to one road, hemmed-in by buildings on both sides with limited or no escape routes. Obstacles placed in the single road slow the advance of the vehicles through the urban area. The column slows, the vehicles bunch up. The ambush is initiated.

The first target is the vehicle at the front of the column, the “point” position. Once disabled by an anti-tank missile, the following vehicles have only two choices; attack directly into the ambush, a common counter-ambush infantry doctrine, or, reverse out of the kill zone, a much less viable and potentially deadly alternative since this escape route is almost always covered by another anti-tank missile team. In this case, attacking directly into the direction of fire proves to be impractical for the Russian column because of the buildings on either side of the road. The armored column is trapped in the kill zone.

Anti-tank crews maintain the initiative by firing another missile at the vehicle at the rear of the column, effectively trapping every vehicle between the front and the back of the column in the kill zone. From there, all the Russians can do is fight back against an unseen enemy and likely “die in place”, or dismount and run for it, almost always another lethal alternative.

The Ukrainians have not only been effective in employing small unit tactics, as illustrated in this video, against Russian forces, they’ve also been successful in employing another lethal and modern weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine; social media. While there are videos from state-sponsored media of Russian successes in Ukraine appearing on YouTube and in other social media, the traffic numbers on that media has been miniscule compared to the number of views, shares and impressions of Ukrainian shared social media of “kill TV” videos and imagery like this one. If the social media battlefield weighs on the outcome of this conflict, at least in the west, Ukraine is leveraging both battlefield tactics and social media tactics to craft what appears to be the impression of effective resistance.

Intelligence estimates suggest that Russia is using T-90s, T-72s and the possibly even their new, highly advanced T-14 Armata tank in Ukraine.

By the way, the video highlights the importance of drones in this conflict: we are not talking about the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones that have become so popular on social media but also much smaller and COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) ones particularly useful for spotting enemy activities from distance and film hi-rez footage that can be used to boast the successes of the Ukrainian forces against the Russian invaders.",https://theaviationist.com/2022/03/10/ukraine-anti-armor-ambush/

So when the Russian invasion began, many experts expected the few drones that the Ukrainian forces managed to get off the ground would be shot down in hours.

But more than two weeks into the conflict, Ukraine’s drones — Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 models that buzz along at about half the speed of a Cessna — are not only still flying, they also shoot guided missiles at Russian missile launchers, tanks and supply trains, according to Pentagon officials.

The drones have become a sort of lumbering canary in the war’s coal mine, a sign of the astonishing resiliency of the Ukrainian defense forces and the larger problems that the Russians have encountered.

“The performance of the Russian military has been shocking,” said David A. Deptula, a retired three-star Air Force general who planned the U.S. air campaigns in Afghanistan in 2001 and the Persian Gulf in 1991. “Their failure to secure air superiority has been reflected by their slow and ponderous actions on the ground. Conversely, the Ukrainian air force performing better than expected has been a big boost to the morale of the entire country.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/us/politics/ukraine-military-drones-russia.html

4,7d71a442-1f27-40c2-8db5-bac7dcd29469,['Thomas O Falk'],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"Ankara, which has good relations with both Moscow and Kyiv, has sold dozens of its combat drones to Ukraine since 2019.

During Russia’s war on Ukraine, video footage has circulated on the internet showing the Turkish combat drone Bayraktar TB2 successfully striking the Russian army.

But as so often during heightened conflicts, it is hard to distinguish between factual events and misinformation – some videos of the drone attacks have already been exposed as the latter.

Given the chaotic events on the ground, it is almost impossible to assess how often and how successfully Ukraine has utilised its Turkish drones so far, Mauro Gilli, senior researcher in military technology and international security at ETH Zurich, told Al Jazeera.

“There have been some video footages allegedly showing the employment of the TB2. Of course, information at this point is fragmented, and it needs to be taken with caution.

“We do know that Ukraine bought some TB2 over the past years and that Turkey and Ukraine signed an agreement for the production within Ukrainian borders of the TB2 – but, as far as I know, production had not started yet.

“Allegedly, some transport aircraft delivered some drones shortly before the beginning of the hostilities with Russia,” Gilli said.

Since 2019, Kyiv has bought dozens of drones from Ankara.

They have also been used in Libya and in last year’s battle between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh – when the drones were used by Turkey’s ally Baku.

“The TB2 produced by the company Bayraktar is one of the two prominent armed drones produced by Turkey [the other being the Anka produced by Turkish Aerospace Industry]. It is cheaper than other Western models, but it has a good performance in key parameters [range, altitude as well as sensors and communication system],” Gilli said.

But given Russia’s strength of forces, what impact drones might have in Ukraine?

“It will very well depend on Russian air defences. Drones like the TB2 are vulnerable to anti-air defence systems. To be effective, they need to be employed in a savvy way, in coordination with other electronic warfare systems that ‘blind’ enemy radars and through appropriate tactics,” Gilli said.

“However, against capable enemies, these technologies and tactics might not be sufficient. In Libya, Russian forces figured out effective ways to counter Turkish tactics and shoot down their drones. The same [has been] observed in Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh,” he added.

“That Ukraine could strike some Russian ground forces with TB2 suggests either that Russian forces are advancing without air defence – which is very well possible, in light of the logistical and organisational problems Russia has encountered so far. Or that Ukrainian forces acquired also advanced electronic warfare systems. Whether they will have a systematic effect on the outcome of the war, it’s hard to say, but I tend to be sceptical,” said Gilli.

Regardless of their impact, the use of drones inevitably raises Turkey’s profile.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has maintained amicable relations with Russia and Ukraine for years, but Moscow’s invasion has complicated his balancing act.

“Turkey and Ukraine were enjoying good and friendly relations before the war,” Erdi Ozturk, associate professor in politics and international relations at London Metropolitan University, told Al Jazeera.

“Turkey has strongly supported Ukrainian independence in the 1990s. After its independence, they worked closely to establish a stable environment in the Black Sea [through] economic and military cooperation,” he said.

As far as Ankara is concerned, Russia is unlikely to change this dynamic.

“Turkey has been playing an active role with its drones, and eight trucks of humanitarian aid have been delivered to local authorities in Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova. Furthermore, in an hourlong call with Moscow [last] Sunday, Erdogan appealed for an urgent general ceasefire,” said Ozturk.

However, Erdogan still has to be cautious. He cannot afford to favour either side, as this would have severe security and economic consequences.

“On the fifth day of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, Erdogan, one more time, repeated that Turkey could not abandon its ties with Russia or Ukraine,” Ozturk said.

“Turkey is still trying to perpetuate the balance-based policy, which does not mean that Turkey has been establishing its policies without a dilemma. Instead, Turkey has been in a stuck position between Russia and the West regarding security, economy, and energy,” Ozturk noted.

But while Russia is facing off Turkish drones in Ukraine, the Ankara-Moscow relationship is unlikely to suffer, Cristian Nitoiu, lecturer in diplomacy and international governance at Loughborough University London, told Al Jazeera.

“I’m sure there have been informal discussions between Erdogan and Putin on potential military support from Turkey to Ukraine, including the supply of drones,” he said.

“Ankara has a dualistic approach, criticising Russia for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity and expressing its support for the Tatar community in Crimea. Turkey also closed the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to warships, a move which favours Russia, as it does not allow NATO warships to enter the Black Sea in order to aid Ukraine,” Nitoiu said.

Furthermore, following the shooting of the Russian aircraft in 2015 by the Turkish air force, the two nations have developed early warning strategies and methods for managing potential military tensions.

“It is likely that Erdogan will inform or even consult Putin before sending military support to Ukraine,” Nitoiu added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/11/turkey-drones-use-ukraine
