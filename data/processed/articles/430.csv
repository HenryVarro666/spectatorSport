1,6b7eaa4d-0ff9-42e4-8d9f-37e7b6d3ac16,[],,"This morning, Ukrainian troops scorched a column of Russian armored vehicles near Hostomel, Kyiv region.

This is evidenced by a video of the territorial defense, sent to Ukrinform.

"" Ukrainian troops scorched a column of Russian armored vehicles near Hostomel. Glory to the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Glory to Ukraine!"" reads the message.

On the morning of February 25, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informed that the air assault troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were fighting near Dymer and Ivankiv, Kyiv region, where a large number of enemy armored vehicles had advanced, and stopped the overwhelming enemy forces near Teteriv river. The bridge across the river was destroyed.

The media also reported that about 56 vehicles of Russian troops were moving from Dymer towards Kyiv. In addition, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reports that the enemy launched an air strike on units near the city of Kropyvnytskyi.

Significant activity of enemy helicopters in the areas above Vylkovo and from Tiraspol was observed. Another tactical group of the defense forces is holding the Hostomel airfield, to which Russian airborne troops rushed yesterday.

2,6b7eaa4d-0ff9-42e4-8d9f-37e7b6d3ac16,[],,"Russia pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks on three fronts in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order.

Explosions the government described as “horrific rocket strikes” sounded before dawn in Kyiv as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting and Ukraine’s president pleaded for international help.

CNN reported that a plane was shot down over the capital. Videos (below) showed large explosions from the incident from several angles.

The falling debris was said to have injured a number of people.

The blasts came amid signs that the capital and largest Ukrainian city was increasingly threatened following a day of fighting that left more than 100 Ukrainians dead.

“Airborne assault troops of the Ukrainian armed forces are fighting in the areas of the settlements of Dymer and Invankiv,” the army said on its Facebook page. Dymer is around 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Kyiv, while Ivankiv is around 60 kilometers northwest of the Ukrainian capital.

“The hardest day will be today. The enemy’s plan is to break through with tank columns from the side of Ivankiv and Chernihiv to Kyiv. Russian tanks burn perfectly when hit by our ATGMs [anti-tank guided missiles],” Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said on Telegram.

The military confirmed that a bridge across a river had been destroyed in the area of Ivankiv, about 60 kilometers (37 miles), northwest of Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the government had information that “subversive groups” were encroaching on Kyiv, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the city “could well be under siege” in what US officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and install his own regime.

Blinken said in television interviews that he was convinced that Russia was intent on overthrowing the Ukrainian government, telling CBS that Putin wants to “reconstitute the Soviet empire.”

Zelensky said Moscow would “sooner or later” have to talk with Kyiv to end their war. “The sooner the conversation begins, the fewer losses there will be for Russia itself,” Zelensky said in a video address.

“They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. But this is another lie of theirs. In reality, they do not distinguish between areas in which they operate,” Zelensky said.

“Ukrainian air defense systems are defending our skies,” Zelensky said. “Ukrainians are demonstrating heroism.”

“All our forces are doing everything possible” to protect people, he added.

“Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter on Friday morning. “Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany.”

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call that Russian mechanized forces that entered from Belarus were about 20 miles from Kyiv, according to a person familiar with the call.

The assault, anticipated for weeks by the US and Western allies and undertaken by Putin in the face of international condemnation and cascading sanctions, amounts to the largest ground war in Europe since World War II.

“Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won’t give up its freedom,” Zelensky tweeted. His grasp on power increasingly tenuous, he called Thursday for even more severe sanctions than the ones imposed by Western allies and ordered a full military mobilization that would last 90 days.

Zelensky said in the video address that 137 “heroes” had been killed and 316 people wounded.

The dead included 13 border guards on the Zmiinyi Island in the Odesa region, which refused to surrender as it was taken over by Russians, the Ukraine Foreign Ministry said.

Zelensky concluded an emotional speech by saying that “the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.”

UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told Sky News on Friday that Russia has lost more than 450 troops, but that number was unverified.

Wallace said the UK government believed Putin planned to “invade the whole of Ukraine,” but that Russia was “behind its hoped-for timetable.”

US President Joe Biden was to talk Friday morning with fellow leaders of NATO governments in what the White House described as an “extraordinary virtual summit” to discuss Ukraine.

On Thursday, Biden announced new sanctions against Russia, saying Putin “chose this war” and had exhibited a “sinister” view of the world in which nations take what they want by force. Other nations also announced sanctions, or said they would shortly.

Fearing a Russian attack on the capital city, thousands of people went deep underground as night fell, jamming Kyiv’s subway stations.

The invasion began early Thursday with a series of missile strikes, many on key government and military installations, quickly followed by a three-pronged ground assault. Ukrainian and US officials said Russian forces were attacking from the east toward Kharkiv; from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014; and from Belarus to the north.

Zelensky, who had earlier cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law, appealed to global leaders, saying that “if you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.”

Both sides claimed to have destroyed some of the other’s aircraft and military hardware, though little of that could be confirmed.

Hours after the invasion began, Russian forces seized control of the now-unused Chernobyl plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle.

The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said it was told by Ukraine of the takeover, adding that there had been “no casualties or destruction at the industrial site.”

The 1986 disaster occurred when a nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kyiv exploded, sending a radioactive cloud across Europe. The damaged reactor was later covered by a protective shell to prevent leaks.

Alyona Shevtsova, adviser to the commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, wrote on Facebook that staff members at the Chernobyl plant had been “taken hostage.” The White House said it was “outraged” by reports of the detentions.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense issued an update saying that though the plant was “likely captured,” the country’s forces had halted Russia’s advance toward Chernihiv and that it was unlikely that Russia had achieved its planned Day One military objectives.

The chief of the NATO alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said the “brutal act of war” shattered peace in Europe, joining a chorus of world leaders decrying an attack that could cause massive casualties and topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government. The conflict shook global financial markets: Stocks plunged and oil prices soared amid concerns that heating bills and food prices would skyrocket.

Condemnation came not only from the US and Europe, but from South Korea, Australia and beyond. Even friendly leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orban sought to distance themselves from Putin.

While some nervous Europeans speculated about a possible new world war, the US and its NATO partners have shown no indication they would send troops into Ukraine, fearing a larger conflict. NATO reinforced its members in Eastern Europe as a precaution, and Biden said the US was deploying additional forces to Germany to bolster NATO.

European authorities declared the country’s airspace an active conflict zone.

Putin made clear earlier this week that he sees no reason for Ukraine to exist, raising fears of possible broader conflict in the vast space that the Soviet Union once ruled. The autocratic leader denied plans to occupy Ukraine, but his ultimate goals remain hazy.

Russia and Ukraine made competing claims about damage they had inflicted. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had destroyed scores of Ukrainian air bases, military facilities and drones. It confirmed the loss of one of its Su-25 attack jets, blaming “pilot error,” and said an An-26 transport plane had crashed because of technical failure, killing the entire crew. It did not say how many were aboard.

Despite pleas from the international community, Putin rebuffed condemnation and sanctions, warning other countries that attempts made by other states to interfere would lead to “consequences you have never seen.”

4,6b7eaa4d-0ff9-42e4-8d9f-37e7b6d3ac16,[],2022-02-25 21:08:04+00:00,"Standing beside his Kozak armoured car in a convoy parked in a rolling field, Sergeant Taras spoke of the long and fierce fight his men had faced, and the hard and violent road that still lay ahead.

“There were many, many of them, a lot of Russians, they were really trying to push through. I think they felt that if they went past us, they would have a good run to Kyiv,” he said, before adding with a quick grin “but we stopped them”.

The sergeant was a member of Ukraine’s Air Assault Force which had been sent to Dymer and Ivankiv, on the Teteriv River, to defend the capital from Russian troops who have broken through the border from Belarus.

The two towns, 25 and 36 miles respectively from Kyiv, are in a strategic location the Russians wanted to control and use for an assault south.

“The enemy’s plan was to break through with tank columns from the side of Ivankiv and Chernikov to Kyiv,” said Anton Gerashchenko, a senior adviser with the Interior Ministry.

Facing the threat, the Ukrainian forces decided to blow up the bridge across the Teteriv, stopping most of the Russian unit from crossing the river.

“I think that has definitely slowed them up, we have gained some time,” said Sergeant Taras. “Our side fought well, we faced a lot of firepower, everyone did their best. We have some young guys and they didn’t fail us.”

The 34 year old NCO (non-commissioned officer) did not want his family name made public. Some of his relations live in Slovyansk in the Donbas, a city which may fall under the control of the Russians and their separatist allies in the east in the current conflict.

Tiredness was etched across the sergeant’s face; there was a cut on his forehead, his right hand was covered by a bloodstained and grimy bandage. He was heading back to Kyiv and then to the airborne headquarters in Zhytomyr to arrange resupplies.

“We prepared for this invasion, but even then some people did not think that Putin would do something like this, against Ukraine. I have family in the Donbas, had family in Donetsk before they moved, we are linked in so many ways,” he shook his head. “We stopped them for a while, but this is not going to end soon, they’ll want to keep coming, we need to keep fighting them.”

New battles were taking place elsewhere even as the sergeant was talking. Mr Gerashchenko, while praising the military on the Teteriv River defence, also acknowledged the grim reality of what is unfolding.

“The hardest day will be today,” he warned, with Russian troops massing around the capital. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Russian Special Forces were already inside Kyiv to carry out sabotage and assassinations. There was shooting this afternoon near a complex of government buildings in the city centre; no details have yet emerged about what lay behind the eruption of gunfire.

Salvoes of missiles and artillery rounds came into Kyiv from the early hours of the morning, continuing to rise in volume, with very few breaks between the sound of sirens. A warplane, believed to be a Su-24, was shot down over Kyiv. The Russians and Ukrainians each claimed the downed plane belonged to the other – a legacy of a common past in the Soviet military.

Moscow insisted that it was targeting Ukrainian government, military and security apparatus, not civilians. But two residential buildings were hit, setting them on fire.

Eight people were injured in a strike in Pozniake, a densely populated district in the north of the city. One resident, 68-year-old Nicolai Rudenko, standing in rubble asked: “Where is the military they were trying to hit here? Only people live here, there is no rocket factory, no army place, so why did they fire rocket into here.”

The UK armed forces minister James Heappey said in London that 57 civilians have been killed so far in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. This was more than the number of 25 fatalities produced by the UN rights council.

The prospect of mass casualties was raised by the Ukrainian government with the claim that radiation levels emanating from Chernobyl were continuing to increase.

Helicopters, meanwhile, landed Russian troops at Obolonskyi airfield north of the capital followed by the appearance of tanks. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence called on the people there to “inform us of troops movements”, and also to form resistance groups and fight with “Molotov cocktails and neutralise the enemy”.

Mr Zelensky had changed the law to allow citizens to arm themselves, and there was a marked increase in sale of guns until shops shut after the Russian invasion. Pictures emerged of scores of volunteers arming themselves.

Citizen volunteer groups have been drilling at weekends in preparation of a war for months, sometimes with wooden rifles. Igor Derkach, a 29-year-old mechanic, bought himself a second-hand Soviet made Makarov pistol last week, after “sensing that something may happen”. He has sent his family to Liviv in the west of the country, but decided to stay in Kyiv himself.

“I have trained with the citizen volunteers, but the government has so far only called up the army reserves. But as the situation changes, this will be expanded,” he said. “I bought the Makarov for personal protection, but I also know where to get assault rifles if necessary very quickly.

“I saw the message about the Molotov cocktail; they are easy enough to make. We will know soon if the Russians will come into Kyiv. Even if they don’t come in immediately, they have agents inside who will try to act.”

Later in the day, Interior Ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko announced that 18,000 machine guns ""have been handed out in Kyiv to all volunteers, all those who want to defend our capital with weapons in their arms”.
