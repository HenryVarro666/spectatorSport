Russian forces pressed their assault on Ukrainian cities Friday, with new missile strikes and shelling on the edges of the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv, as world leaders pushed for an investigation of the Kremlin’s repeated attacks on civilian targets, including schools, hospitals and residential areas.

The early morning barrage of missiles on the outskirts of Lviv was the closest strike yet to the center of the city, which has become a crossroads for people fleeing from other parts of Ukraine and for others entering to deliver aid or fight.

Black smoke billowed for hours after the explosions, which hit a facility for repairing military aircraft near the city’s international airport, only six kilometers (four miles) from the center. One person was wounded, the regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyy, said.

Multiple blasts hit in quick succession around 6 a.m., shaking nearby buildings, witnesses said. The missiles were launched from the Black Sea, but the Ukrainian air force’s western command said it had shot down two of six missiles in the volley. A bus repair facility was also damaged, Lviv’s mayor Andriy Sadovyi said.

Lviv lies not far from the Polish border and well behind the front lines, but it and the surrounding area have not been spared Russia’s attacks. In the worst, nearly three dozen people were killed last weekend in a strike on a training facility near the city. Lviv’s population has swelled by some 200,000 as people from elsewhere in Ukraine have sought shelter there.

Early morning barrages also hit a residential building on the northern edges of Kyiv, killing at least one person, according to emergency services, who said 98 people were evacuated from the building. Two others were killed when strikes hit residential and administrative buildings in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, and Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection.

In city after city around Ukraine, hospitals, schools and buildings where people sought safety have been attacked. Rescue workers searched for survivors in the ruins of a theater that served as a shelter when it was blown apart by a Russian airstrike in the besieged southern city of Mariupol Wednesday. And in Merefa, near the northeast city of Kharkiv, at least 21 people were killed when Russian artillery destroyed a school and a community center Thursday, a local official said.

In Kharkiv, a massive fire raged through a local market after shelling Thursday. One firefighter was killed and another injured when new shelling hit as emergency workers fought the blaze, emergency services said. In the northern city of Chernihiv, dozens of bodies were brought to the morgue in just one day.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that American officials were evaluating potential war crimes and that if the intentional targeting of civilians by Russia is confirmed, there will be “massive consequences.”

The United Nations political chief, Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo, also called for an investigation into civilian casualties, reminding the U.N. Security Council that international humanitarian law bans direct attacks on civilians.

She said many of the daily attacks battering Ukrainian cities “are reportedly indiscriminate” and involve the use of “explosive weapons with a wide impact area.” DiCarlo said the devastation in Mariupol and Kharkiv ”raises grave fears about the fate of millions of residents of Kyiv and other cities facing intensifying attacks.”

About 35,000 civilians left Mariupol over the previous two days, Kirilenko said Friday.

In Mariupol, hundreds of civilians were said to have taken shelter in a grand, columned theater in the city’s center when it was hit Wednesday by a Russian airstrike. On Friday, their fate was still uncertain, with conflicting reports on whether anyone had emerged from the rubble. Communications are disrupted across the city and movement is difficult because of shelling and fighting.

“We hope and we think that some people who stayed in the shelter under the theater could survive,” Petro Andrushchenko, an official with the mayor’s office, told The Associated Press on Thursday. He said the building had a relatively modern basement bomb shelter designed to withstand airstrikes. Other officials said earlier that some people had gotten out.

Video and photos provided by the Ukrainian military showed the at-least-three-story building had been reduced to a roofless shell, with some exterior walls collapsed. Satellite imagery on Monday from Maxar Technologies showed huge white letters on the pavement outside the theater spelling out “CHILDREN” in Russian — “DETI” — to alert warplanes to the vulnerable people hiding inside.

Across Mariupol, snow flurries fell around the skeletons of burned, windowless and shrapnel-scarred apartment buildings as smoke rose above the skyline.

“We are trying to survive somehow,” said one Mariupol resident, who gave only her first name, Elena, on the outskirts of the city Thursday. “My child is hungry. I don’t know what to give him to eat.”

She had been trying to call her mother in another town. “I can’t tell her I am alive, you understand. There is no connection, just nothing,” she said.

Cars, some with the “Z” symbol of the Russian invasion force in their windows, drove past stacks of ammunition boxes and artillery shells in a neighborhood controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

Russia’s military denied bombing the theater or anyplace else in Mariupol on Wednesday.

In Chernihiv, at least 53 people were brought to morgues over 24 hours, killed amid heavy Russian air attacks and ground fire, the local governor, Viacheslav Chaus, told Ukrainian TV Thursday.

Ukraine’s emergency services said a mother, father and three of their children, including 3-year-old twins, were killed when a Chernihiv hostel was shelled. Civilians were hiding in basements and shelters across the embattled city of 280,000.

“The city has never known such nightmarish, colossal losses and destruction,” Chaus said.

The World Health Organization said it has verified 43 attacks on hospitals and health facilities, with 12 people killed and 34 injured.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said early Friday he was thankful to President Joe Biden for additional military aid, but he would not get into specifics about the new package, saying he did not want Russia to know what to expect. He said when the invasion began on Feb. 24, Russia expected to find Ukraine much as it did in 2014, when Russia seized Crimea without a fight and backed separatists as they took control of the eastern Donbas region.

Instead, he said, Ukraine had much stronger defenses than expected, and Russia “didn’t know what we had for defense or how we prepared to meet the blow.”

In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven leading economies accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of conducting an “unprovoked and shameful war,” and called on Russia to comply with the International Court of Justice’s order to stop its attack and withdraw its forces.

Both Ukraine and Russia this week reported some progress in negotiations. Zelenskyy said he would not reveal Ukraine’s negotiating tactics.

“Working more in silence than on television, radio or on Facebook,” Zelenskyy said. “I consider it the right way.”

While details of Thursday’s talks were unknown, an official in Zelenskyy’s office told the AP that on Wednesday, the main subject discussed was whether Russian troops would remain in separatist regions in eastern Ukraine after the war and where the borders would be.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks, said Ukraine was insisting on the inclusion of one or more Western nuclear powers in the negotiations and on legally binding security guarantees for Ukraine.

In exchange, the official said, Ukraine was ready to discuss a neutral military status.

Russia has demanded that NATO pledge never to admit Ukraine to the alliance or station forces there.

The fighting has led more than 3 million people to flee Ukraine, the U.N. estimates. The death toll remains unknown, though Ukraine has said thousands of civilians have died.

(Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters)

China respects ""the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries,"" Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing on Friday.

He was speaking ahead of a 9 a.m. ET call between US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping that is expected to focus on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""China always stands for respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, attaching importance to the legitimate security concerns of all countries, supporting all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis and promoting peace talks and easing the humanitarian situation,"" Zhao said.

""China’s position is above board, fair, objective and unquestionable.""

China's friendship with Russia: Since a February meeting between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, China has talked up its “no-limits partnership” with Russia.

US officials believe Russia has asked China for military and economic support to wage its unprovoked war in Ukraine and that Beijing has indicated its openness to helping Moscow. Both Russia and China have denied the allegation.

The US has indicated that China would pay an economic price if its support for Russia goes beyond rhetoric.

Speaking Friday, Zhao repeated China’s public rebuke, saying ""some people in the US have been spreading disinformation to smear and put pressure on China, which is extremely irresponsible and will not help solve the issue. China is firmly opposed to this and will never accept it.""

""The US should seriously reflect on its role in the Ukrainian crisis, take its due responsibilities and take concrete actions to ease the situation and resolve the issue, rather than adding fuel to the fire and shifting the conflict to others,"" he said.

Zhao said Ukraine needs food rather than weapons, and the US sending military assistance to the country will not bring peace.

Why leaders' meeting matters: The call comes at a potential turning point for ties between the United States and China. White House officials are watching with growing concern the budding partnership between Xi and Putin, and China's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has proved troubling to Western observers.

White House officials said they expected the call could turn intense; a preliminary meeting between the two leaders' aides stretched for seven hours earlier this week.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-18-22/h_7605e6b306047a83ee1bc46035c7aea3

The IEA has announced a 10-point plan to cut oil use after countries -- including Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia -- banned imports of oil from Russia.

Among the proposals is to reduce highway speed limits by at least 10 kilometers per hour (6 miles per hour), make public transport more accessible, and introduce car-free Sundays in large cities.

According to IEA executive director Fatih Birol, the actions are designed to ease strains on the energy market and reduce the pain of oil price rises for consumers.

In advanced economies, Birol said, the actions could help cut oil demand by 2.7 million barrels a day ahead of peak demand season.

Some context: The IEA warned this week that potential large-scale disruptions to oil production were ""threatening to create a global oil supply shock” in light of sanctions imposed on Russia and as buyers increasingly avoid Russian oil purchases.

Russia could soon be forced to curtail crude oil production by 30%, the IEA said, subjecting the global economy to the biggest supply crisis in decades unless Saudi Arabia and other major energy exporters start pumping more.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-18-22/h_2e36372a0aa7d6c10a9e46129858f5d4

The strike on the Lviv State Aircraft Repair Plant was the closest yet to the western city of Lviv, which has served as a relative safe haven since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began last month.

""Several missiles hit the aircraft repair facility. Its buildings were destroyed by the strikes. Active work at the plant had been stopped in time, so as of yet, there are no casualties,"" said Mayor Andriy Sadovyi.

Minutes before the strike, air raid sirens rang throughout the city. A plume of smoke could be seen over the airport at sunrise. Hours later, the area of the facility was still smoking.

Authorities said that Russia had launched six cruise missiles at the facility, two of which were intercepted by Ukrainian defense forces.

""The missiles, which were fired from the Black Sea area, were partially shot down. But four of them hit the aircraft repair plant,"" said Maksym Kozytskyy, the head of Lviv's military administration.

An archived version of Lviv State Aircraft Repair Plant website describes it as Ukraine's ""leading aircraft maintenance company."" Operated by the Ukrainian state-owned defense company Ukroboronprom, the facility primarily services MiG-29s, the Soviet-made fighter jet used by Ukraine's air force.

Friday's strike was just over 4 miles from Lviv's city center, by far the closest the war has come to the western city. The facility sits on the edge of the Danylo Halytskyi International Airport, the civilian airport in Lviv.

With so much of the fighting concentrated in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, Lviv had become a bastion of relative normalcy in a country stricken by war and something of a central station for humanitarian aid and refugees.

The prospect of the violence coming here, too, is terrifying, residents of the area told NPR.

""We all heard the explosions, and once we did, we all ran into the bomb shelter,"" said Yevhen Halakhov, a resident of a building near the airport, who added that he was awoken by screams from family members in another room. Still, he had no plans to move, he said as he pushed his grandson on a swing set a few hours after the strike.

The calculus may be different for the more than 200,000 people who have come to Lviv after fleeing violence in other parts of Ukraine.

""We left Kyiv because it got very hot there, so we came here instead. But it's obvious now that we can't stay here, because we don't know what will be next,"" said a woman who gave her name only as Diana.

She and her daughter are staying with family in an apartment near the airport, she said. But the early morning strike — ""the entire building shook, the glass and the windows shook,"" she said — had her considering leaving the country altogether, as 3 million other Ukrainians have done, according to the U.N.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian missile strikes and shelling continued Thursday night and Friday morning, including in the capital Kyiv. In Kharkiv, which has been under near-constant bombardment since the invasion began nearly a month ago, Ukrainian authorities reported that shelling had killed at least 10 people overnight.

And apartment buildings in Kramatorsk, a city in the Donbas region, were also hit by rockets, according to regional officials.
