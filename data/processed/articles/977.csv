Belarus could join war: The US and NATO believe that Belarus could ‚Äúsoon‚Äù join Russia in its war against Ukraine, US and NATO officials tell CNN, and that the country is already taking steps to do so. It is increasingly ‚Äúlikely‚Äù that Belarus will enter the conflict, a NATO military official said on Monday.

Ukrainians fighting to reclaim territory: Ukrainians forces have now been trying to take back territory in the last few days that the Russians had gained, according to a senior US defense official, calling them ‚Äúable and willing‚Äù to do so.

Ukrainian forces have regained control of Makariv, a town 30 miles west of Kyiv, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a post on Facebook on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the mayor of Boryspil, a city to the east of the capital, is calling on residents to leave, saying ""fighting is already raging around the region"" in a video statement posted to Facebook.

Dwindling supplies: Some towns in Ukraine don‚Äôt have more than three or four days‚Äô worth of food, the aid agency Mercy Corps said Tuesday, warning that the humanitarian system in the country ‚Äúis entirely broken down.‚Äù

Food and medical supplies have almost run out in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, according to spokesperson for Ukraine‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs Oleg Nikolenko.

Refugees: More than 3.5 million refugees have now fled Ukraine, according to the latest update from the UN Refugee Agency.

About half a million refugees who have fled the war in Ukraine to Poland require support for mental health disorders, and 30,000 are estimated to have severe mental health problems, the World Health Organization‚Äôs representative in Poland said Tuesday.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-22-22/h_d59db12bc9bb387c9ab42c596ef6fc7b
