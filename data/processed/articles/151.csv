Statement

On 08 April, the EU adopted a fifth package of sanctions in response to the continuing war of aggression against Ukraine and the reported atrocities committed by Russian armed forces in Ukraine (see press release here).

The sanctions package includes a prohibition on the import of Russian coal into the EU, a ban on Russian-flagged ships from EU ports, a ban on Russian and Belarussian road transport operators from the EU, further export bans designed to degrade Russia’s technological base and industrial capacity, as well as further import bans aligning sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus. Additional targeted economic measures are intended to strengthen existing measures and close loopholes. Another 18 entities were added to the sanctions list, including four key Russian banks, representing 23% of market share in the Russian banking sector. 217 additional individuals were also designated, including oligarchs, propagandists, President Putin’s two daughters and members of the ‘parliaments’ and Ministers of the breakaway regions.

Additional sanctions measures are likely to be discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, 11 April.

Speaking about the introduction of this latest sanctions package, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney T.D., said:

“Ireland, along with our EU partners, has agreed another ambitious sanctions package. This is particularly important following the atrocities committed in Ukraine that came to light last week. Ireland continues to support the strongest possible sanctions, and I look forward to discussing further measures with my colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg on Monday. We must do what it takes to cut off funding to the Kremlin’s war effort, and to push those close to the regime to use their influence to bring this unjustified, illegal and immoral war to an end. The EU will continue its close cooperation with like-minded partners to coordinate on the toughest sanctions. We stand united with Ukraine”

For more information on the sanctions adopted since 23 February, see this information note, as well as the Department’s dedicated sanctions page. Updates are made to this information note on a regular basis.

Ambassadors of the European Union member states approved the fifth package of anti-Russian sanctions on Thursday, which, among other things, introduces restrictions on financial institutions and prohibits coal imports from Russia and high-tech exports to Russia, Tass reports

The French presidency of the European Council said in a Twitter post: ""This meaningful package of sanctions against Russia extends the sanctions to new spheres.""

""It includes, among other things, asset freeze of several Russian banks, ban on coal imports from Russia, arms embargo on Russia, ban on exports to Russia, including high-tech goods,"" the French presidency said.

The volume of sanctions-hit export is estimated at 10 billion euro, while restrictions on imports of ""raw materials and critically important materials"" will affect products worth 5.5 billion euro in total.

Moreover, Russian-flagged vessels will not be allowed to enter European ports, while transport companies from Russia and Belarus will be prohibited from business activities on the European Union territory.

The statement specifically mentions sanctions against Russian businessmen and ""propagandists."" European sanctions will also be expanded to include security and military officers and defense enterprises related to Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine.

""This package of measures will be adopted by the European Council under a written procedure and should be published by the Official Journal of the European Union tomorrow,"" the statement says.

On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an early morning televised address that he had launched a special military operation in Ukraine in response to a request for help from the leaders of the Donbass republics. He stressed that Moscow had no intention of occupying Ukrainian territories, the sole purpose of the operation, the leader stressed, is the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.

Microsoft says it disrupted Russian hacks

US tech giant Microsoft claims to have disrupted hacking attempts by Russian military spies.

The spies were attempting to break into Ukrainian, EU and US targets, according to the company. Microsoft attributes to the attacks to a group it calls ""Strontium.""

In a blog post on Microsoft's website, the firm said that a group was using internet domains in an effort to spy on US and EU government bodies and think tanks, as well as a number of Ukrainian institutions including media organizations. Microsoft did not provide further details on who the targets were.

Microsoft said that it was taking legal and technical action to seize control of domains controlled by Strontium, and had obtained a court order that allowed it to take over seven domains on April 6.

Germany will need full 120 day period to implement coal ban — Scholz

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the country would need to use the full transition period in order to implement a ban on Russian coal.

EU leaders agreed that a fifth package of sanctions should include an embargo on coal and that there would be a 120 day window in which member states would need to find alternative sources.

EU agrees new sanctions package, including on coal

The currently French presidency of the European Council said late on Thursday that the bloc's latest sanctions package has been given the political green light.

The main preparatory body comprised of each member's EU representatives, known as Coreper, approved of what would be the fifth EU package of sanctions, including a stop to coal imports from Russia.

The package will be implemented once it is published in the EU's official journal, which is expected to happen on Friday.

The package includes an EU embargo on Russian coal imports, as well as an import ban on Russian wood and vodka.

Once implemented, it would be the bloc's first sanctions package to majorly target Moscow's energy industry.

The measures all short of a total ban on Russian fossil fuel imports, but EU officials said it could follow if Moscow maintains its assault.

Peskov acknowledges Russia's significant losses in Ukraine

In an interview with the British TV channel Sky News, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov admitted that Russia had suffered significant losses in Ukraine.

In late March, Russia said it had lost 1,351 soldiers with another 3,825 wounded.

However, NATO has issued far higher casualty estimates for Russia.

The Kremlin spokesman also rejected allegations of a massacre in the town of Bucha as ""a well-staged insinuation.""

Peskov also continued to refuse using designations such as war and invasion, referring to the conflict as a ""special military operation."" However, he did acknowledge ""it is a very serious operation with quite heavy consequences, yes,"" when pressed on the issue.

In an interview with DW, Bucha Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk said the number of civilians found dead in his city is growing every day.

According to the mayor, almost 90% of those killed have ""bullet wounds, not shrapnel wounds.""

""There were 50,000 residents in Bucha [before the war. - Ed.]. As of today, 3,700 people live in Bucha, but the number of people is slowly growing,"" the mayor said.

The killings in Bucha, a town near Kyiv, have sparked global outrage. After the retreat of Russian troops, more than 300 corpses were found in the streets and houses, as well as in three mass graves.

Facebook looking into 'misinformation and hoaxes' from Russian government

Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, said it uncovered hacking campaigns and scam operations related to the war in Ukraine.

In a new report, the social media giant said there has been a surge in content related to Russia's invasion — with Moscow and its allies playing a major role in spreading disinformation and propaganda.

""We're constantly reviewing our policies based on the evolving situation on the ground and we are actively now reviewing additional steps to address misinformation and hoaxes coming from Russian government pages,"" said Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs.

In one instance outlined in the report, hackers aligned with Russia broke into social media accounts of numerous Ukrainian military officers. The hackers attempted to upload videos of Ukrainian troops surrendering when the plot was uncovered.

WHO prepares for war in Ukraine to get worse

The World Health Organization said there were ""no assurances that the war will not get worse.""

Speaking in Lviv in western Ukraine, WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge said his organization is helping authorities prepare for all eventualities.

""WHO is considering all scenarios and making contingencies for different situations that could affect the people of Ukraine from the continued treatment of mass casualties to chemical assaults,"" Kluge said.

However, the WHO's incident manager in Ukraine, Heather Papowitz, said the health body was more concerned about people ""dying from common causes.""

""The worst-case scenario really is what we are seeing now, which is the lack of access to health care and the trauma,"" she said.

The WHO has confirmed 91 attacks on health care providers, including ambulances and hospitals.

The UN's health agency again called on Russia to immediately declare a ceasefire, ""which includes unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for those in need.""

Lavrov accuses Ukraine of undermining peace talks

In comments published by Interfax news agency, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Ukraine has presented Moscow a draft peace deal that was different from the agreements reached in Istanbul on March 29.

According to Lavrov: ""In the Istanbul document, the Ukrainians clearly stated that the future security guarantees of Ukraine do not apply to Crimea and Sevastopol. Yesterday's draft lacks this clear statement.""

However, Russia would continue talks and press to secure its own requirements ""despite all provocations,"" the minister said.

Lavrov also accused Kyiv of drawing out and undermining peace talks. According to the Russian foreign minister, the reason is the West's desire to ""push the Ukrainian side to continue hostilities.""

Zelenskyy calls on Greece to help save the residents of Mariupol

In his address to Greek lawmakers, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Greece to organize a humanitarian mission to rescue the remaining population of ""martyred"" Mariupol, the besieged city in the South of Ukraine.

""Basic humanitarian goods are not allowed there. I am convinced that the strength of Greece can help carry out this mission.""

Zelenskyy also called on the West to ""bring Russia to justice,"" saying Moscow's actions were directed not only against Ukraine but also Europe.

G7 condemn 'atrocities committed by Russian forces'

G7 foreign ministers condemned ""in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns.""

They met Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, on the sidelines of the NATO foreign ministers' meeting on Thursday in Brussels.

In a joint statement, the group said those responsible would be held to account.

""Haunting images of civilian deaths, victims of torture, and apparent executions, as well as reports of sexual violence and destruction of civilian infrastructure show the true face of Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and its people,"" the ministers said.

They added that they support ongoing investigations into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity.

""We are convinced that now is the time to suspend Russian membership of the [UN] Human Rights Council,"" the G7 statement added.

Germany's Foreign Ministry said earlier that the G7 was ready to provide further assistance to Ukraine, including military equipment and financial support.



German politicians file war crimes complaint against Russia

Two former German government ministers have submitted a criminal complaint with federal prosecutors seeking the opening of a war crimes probe against Russian officials.

German laws include aspects of universal jurisdiction, that allows serious crimes committed in one country to be tried elsewhere.

""Everyone who participates in these crimes must know that they are liable to prosecution,"" former Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger and former Interior Minister Gerhart Baum said.

They are specifically targeting President Vladimir Putin, members of his security council and members of the Russian military.

The crimes detailed in the complaint range from the attack on a nuclear power plant to the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol, said lawyer Nikolaos Gazeas, who compiled the 140-page criminal complaint on behalf of the politicians.

Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court have also launched an investigation into war crimes in Ukraine.

""Aside from the mines, the importance of cooperation in the Black Sea for peace, calm and stability was emphasised,"" Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said.

Russia was notably absent from the virtual meeting.

Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Turkey has detonated three separate floating naval mines while Romania has also defused a stray mine in its waters.

Turkey’s government had said previously that it was in contact with both Moscow and Kyiv about the weapons.

An international treaty prohibits countries from laying unanchored mines.

Report: German spies intercepted Russian transmissions about Bucha killings

Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND, has intercepted radio transmissions from Russian military officers in which the killing of civilians in Bucha, was discussed.

Germany's weekly news magazine Der Spiegel revealed the intercepts suggest that these were neither random acts nor the actions of individual soldiers who got out of hand.

According to Der Spiegel, the BND showed the killings were discussed as if it was normal procedure, possibly to fear and terror among the civilian population.

It seems the Russian paramilitary group, Wagner, was also involved in the killings.

Ukrainian forces found bodies of civilians that were apparently executed and mass graves in Bucha after retaking the city over the weekend.

Sberbank holds a third of Russia's total banking assets, while Alfabank is the fourth largest bank in the country.

In the latest round of sanctions imposed by Washington on Russia, the two banks were blacklisted in the United States. The move freezes any assets connected to the US financial system and prohibits business with the two banks.

Family members of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov were also frozen out of the US financial system in the latest round of sanctions, as were members of Russia's Security Council such as Prime Minister Mikhail Mishushtin and former president Dmitry Medvedev.

The EU included Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova in its updated list of individuals facing an assets freeze and travel ban. The two EU officials from different EU member countries spoke Friday on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because the updated list of individuals and entities sanctioned has not been published yet.

The move from the European bloc follows a similar move two days earlier by the United States.

In the wake of evidence of torture and killings emerging from war zones outside Kyiv, the EU decided to impose a fifth package of measures.

“These latest sanctions were adopted following the atrocities committed by Russian armed forces in Bucha and other places under Russian occupation,” said Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat. “The aim of our sanctions is to stop the reckless, inhuman and aggressive behavior of the Russian troops and make clear to the decision makers in the Kremlin that their illegal aggression comes at a heavy cost.”

But many in the Ukraine government want tougher measures that will have a quicker impact on the war.

“Some countries may want to exhaust the Russians economically rather than stop them, while the Ukrainians are shedding their blood. We don’t accept that,” said Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk “The idea of the sanctions should be not just to exhaust the Russians in the longer term, but to stop them within months, not years.”

In addition to sanctions on individuals and members of their families, oligarchs and high-ranking Kremlin officials, the 27-nation bloc also formally approved Friday an embargo on coal imports starting in August, as well as a full transaction ban on four key Russian banks representing 23% of market share in the Russian banking sector.

Also, vessels registered under the Russian flag are now prohibited to access EU ports, with an exception for agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid and energy.

This is the first time that EU sanctions target Russia’s lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine. According to the EU council, imports of coal into the region are currently worth 8 billion euros per year.

The EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

EU officials said the impact of the bloc’s sanctions so far over the first four weeks shows that imports into the 27 nations from Russia dropped off by 9% in terms of value, and over 20% in terms of volume. Trade from the EU to Russia has fallen by three quarters.

The ban on coal imports will be the first EU sanctions targeting Russia’s lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine and is estimated to be worth 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) per year, the EU presidency, held by France, announced. In the meantime, the EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

“The package is very substantial and extends sanctions against Russia to new sectors” and more oligarchs, the presidency said, mentioning officials linked to propaganda, military security and high technology linked to the Ukraine war.

The deal was given the final political go-ahead in a meeting of EU ambassadors and will be enacted once published in the EU’s official journal, likely on Friday.

So far, banning natural gas has remained out of reach, but not because of lack of support from the European parliament.

The legislature approved a resolution by a 513-22 margin — with 19 abstentions — demanding “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel and gas.”

Even if the move underscores the EU’s determination to act against the Kremlin, it carried little more than moral weight, since it is up to the member states themselves to unanimously impose such bans.

And energy is key in Europe’s trade relations with Russia. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell has said that the 27-nation bloc is paying a billion euros a day for energy provisions, accounting for over 35 billion euros since the war started.

Late Thursday, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that, if not gas, oil would be on the list soon. “The next step we are looking intensively at the moment (is) oil, so to prepare to be able to phase out oil,” she told reporters.

On Wednesday, the United States announced sanctions targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s two adult daughters and said it was toughening penalties against Russian banks in retaliation for “war crimes” in Ukraine.

The moves against Sberbank and Alfa Bank prohibit assets from touching the U.S. financial system and bar Americans from doing business with those institutions.

The EU sanctions approved late Thursday also included the freezing of assets of several Russian banks, an extension of a arms export ban covering contracts prior to 2014, and other export bans totaling some 10 billion euros. The nations also approved a further 5.5 billion in imports and a ban on port access for Russian vessels.
