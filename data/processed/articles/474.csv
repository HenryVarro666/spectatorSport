The discussion comes as Paris has maintained a firm policy of dialogue and solidarity with Ukraine. Macron has also vouched for a political settlement of the all-out conflict and joined its Western and European allies to pressure Russia to de-escalate tensions. Earlier this week, Macron pledged to continue speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite the lack of fruitful outcome. ""I won't tell you that I am satisfied, but we need to continue,"" the French President said while speaking on France's TF1 channel.

Notably, Macron has spoken to Putin multiple times in the last month, the latest being on Saturday. The call included German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. ""Europe can't be safe and at peace, if it doesn't talk to Russia,"" Macron has said, explaining his flurry of phone calls. He further added that the objective of the dialogues is to ""try to break his (Putin's) logic"" and keep the line of communication open over manifold issues, including humanitarian corridors, protection of nuclear plants, and potential cessation of the war.

Russia-Ukraine war

The developments come as the Russian attack on Ukraine intensified with each passing day since it began on February 24. The war ensued months of undeterred military build-up along the Donbass region, which Putin unilaterally identified as independent, effectively annulling the Minsk Accord. The all-out war has killed thousands, further damaging infrastructure worth billions.

Nothing the escalating devastation in Ukraine, Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko on Thursday demanded Moscow must give up its rights granted under the UN Charter, under which Russia currently holds power to veto. His statement came after Moscow defied the order of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which asked Russia to cease military operations in Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin gave the go-ahead for more than 1,000 Russian troops lining the Ukraine border to begin invading the country nearly a month ago on February 24. Since then, missiles have rained down on several Ukrainian cities with violent explosions occurring throughout the stricken country. Western countries have moved to slam Russia with financial sanctions aimed at crippling the Russian economy and bringing down Putin.

The UK, acting alone outside the EU following Brexit, last week imposed asset freezes and travel bans on seven leading oligarchs and 386 members of the Russian Duma - and has since announced a ban on exports to Russia of high-end luxury goods. Brussels hit Russia hard this week with a fourth package of restrictive measures, including bans on Russian energy sector investments, luxury goods exports to Moscow and imports of steel products from Russia. The sanctions also saw a freeze on assets of Russian oligarchs. But the EU had been widely criticised for not doing enough early on, including member states not agreeing to ban Russia from the global SWIFT banking system, as well as hesitation over what to do about the Nord Stream 2 gas line project.

Mr Macron has also held several phone calls and meetings in Moscow with Putin but they have seemingly made no difference, with Russia ramping up its aggression against Ukraine. Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy expert and former aide to Margaret Thatcher, launched a furious attack, telling Express.co.uk: ""Take Emmanuel Macron for example - what has he done to ever stand up to Putin? ""Macron sees himself as some kind of statesman and peacemaker but the reality is Macron is just seen as a useful idiot by Putin. ""Putin is seeking concessions from Macron and the Europeans. He believes Macron is just a soft touch."" READ MORE: Russian soldiers now begging Ukrainians for food as villagers hounded

Mr Gardiner also didn't hold back against the actions of the EU towards Russia, warning the bloc's ""limited response"" shows it is ""incapable of standing up to the likes of Putin"". He raged: ""The EU as a whole has been absolutely pathetic and useless in confronting Russia. ""They have appeased Putin for decades upon decades. Now they are starting to wake up but even now, their response is limited. ""I suspect most EU leaders just want the whole Ukraine crisis to just go away and for things to get back to normal.
