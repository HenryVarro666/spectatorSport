MOSCOW, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Russian troops started advancing into Ukraine again on Saturday after President Vladimir Putin paused the offensive a day earlier in anticipation of talks with Kyiv that never happened, the Kremlin said.

Both Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke of possible talks on Friday but Ukraine said clashes with invading Russian troops continued on Friday night and on Saturday.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitriy Peskov said that after Putin's order Russian troops only clashed with ""groups of nationalists"" -- as opposed to regular Ukrainian forces.

The Kyiv government said on Saturday Russian forces were attacking a number of Ukrainian cities and Russian saboteurs were being detained in the capital city.

Russia's defence ministry said on Saturday morning it had taken over the Ukrainian city of Melitopol.

Peskov also told a briefing Russia had expected the sanctions imposed by the West in response to the invasion and was taking measures to minimise their impact on the economy.

On Thursday morning, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a “special military operation” in eastern Ukraine’s Donbass region. The announcement came shortly on the heels of the Kremlin’s decision to recognize the Ukrainian separatist Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR) earlier this week. Putin framed the Ukrainian government as a neo-Nazi “junta” that is “plundering Ukraine and humiliating the Ukrainian people.” Russia cannot stand idly by, he said, as Ukraine vies to become a staging ground for NATO aggression against Russia. Putin said the goal of the operation is to “demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.”

It was revealed within the next few hours that the Russian operation would not be confined to the Donbass region, but instead involved sweeping cruise and ballistic missile strikes against military assets spread across the country. Russia’s Defense Ministry announced by the end of Thursday that as many as seventy-four “objects of above-ground military infrastructure” in Ukraine had been destroyed, including a dozen airfields, three command centers, and a Naval base. The Russian shock and awe campaign was accompanied by a three-front ground operation: Russian troops began pouring into Ukraine from Crimea, through the eastern separatist territories, and via Belarus. The latter forces seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, a move seemingly driven by Russia’s stated concerns over Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s recent announcement that Ukraine may reconsider prior commitments not to pursue nuclear weapons if the West fails to provide Kiev with sufficient security guarantees.

The air and ground assault resumed in full force on Friday morning, with Russian forces pressing closer to the capital of Kiev amid reports of fierce fighting in the city’s outskirts. Zelenskyy, who alleged on Friday that he is the “number-one target” of an active Russian assassination attempt, previously announced that over 130 Ukrainian servicemen had died and 316 more were wounded.

The specific end goals of the ongoing Russian military action in Ukraine are largely unknown. The Kremlin has repeatedly insisted in prior days that it is not planning to occupy Ukraine; Western military experts have noted that Moscow may not have the resources required to execute a successful long-term occupation even if it wanted to. Experts have suggested that Moscow could be planning to install a pro-Russian government in Kiev while seizing everything east of the Dnieper River; still, others argue that the Kremlin is eyeing Ukraine’s strategically vital Black Sea coast as a forward staging post against NATO’s eastern flank. Among the outstanding questions is whether the Kremlin is considering dialogue with Zelenskyy under any circumstances, or if regime change in Kiev is a non-negotiable part of the Russian military operation. It is likewise unclear if Russia intends to administer any new potential territories directly or through its newly-recognized eastern client states, the LPR and DPR.

Unconfirmed reports emerged earlier this week that Zelenskyy is signaling his willingness to sign what would amount to a surrender agreement with Moscow. The Ukrainian president announced on Friday that he is “not afraid” to enter into wide-ranging peace talks that would include discussions of the country’s “neutral status,” a stark shift from the Zelenskyy administration’s previous vow to seek NATO membership as a core national aim. In a Friday press conference with the heads of the Donetsk and Lugansk separatist republics, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov accused Zelensky of “lying” about his willingness to consider state neutrality. “We offered various options for ensuring security. President [of Russia Vladimir] Putin spoke about that at a press conference following the results of the negotiations with President [of France Emmanuel] Macron. He pointed it out clearly: NATO’s expansion is unacceptable but we want to look for such options through joint negotiations, joint efforts for ensuring security that will guarantee corresponding conditions, corresponding possibilities and requirements for Ukraine, for European countries and, of course, for the Russian Federation,” said Lavrov. “Therefore, President Zelensky's missed opportunities are well known, and there is no need to fall from a sore head to a healthy one now.”

In remarks given earlier this week, Putin suggested that any potential settlement with Kiev must include Ukraine’s recognition of Crimea as a Russian territory and explicit, binding guarantees never to seek NATO membership. Chinese leader Xi Jinping reportedly told Putin to settle the conflict through “balanced negotiations” in a phone call on Friday. Putin conveyed to Xi in the same conversation that he is ready “to negotiate with the Ukrainian side at a high level,” according to a statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. But the Russian president struck an uncompromising tone in a Friday address to the Armed Forces of Ukraine (ZSU), describing the government in Kiev as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have settled in Kyiv and taken the entire Ukrainian people hostage.” Putin appeared to welcome the prospect of—If not explicitly call for—a military coup, encouraging the ZSU to “take power into your own hands” and opining that it would be “easier” to negotiate with Ukraine’s top brass than with the Zelenskyy administration.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko is ready to host a platform for prospective peace talks between Moscow and Kiev. ""Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who, for his part, assured that he would be ready to create all necessary conditions for the arrival of the delegations, for ensuring their safety and security, and for holding the mentioned negotiations,"" he said. But top Kremlin officials, up to and including Putin, continue to insist that Russia’s goal remains the “denazification and demilitarization” of Ukraine, suggesting that Moscow will accept nothing short of Kiev’s total and unconditional capitulation.

This is the first official statement by the Gulf nation and close US ally, and it comes hours after the UAE, along with China and India, chose to abstain on a vote on a draft United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

In a statement published by the UAE’s Permanent Mission at the UN and titled “UAE explanation of vote at the UN Security Council,” the Emirati permanent representative Amb. Lana Nusseibeh said that the UAE supports the de-escalation of violence, the resumption of dialogue and the sending of humanitarian aid.

The foreign ministry did not mention Russia in the statement, instead calling on all parties to respect international humanitarian law, and focused on emphasizing the need to protect civilians and provide humanitarian assistance.

“Being from the Middle East, we are intimately aware of the critical importance of a stable regional security environment, and of de-escalation, diplomacy, and dialogue. Similarly, we understand from experience the need for inclusive and consultative processes,” Nusseibeh told the Security Council on Friday, according to the Foreign Ministry statement.

The UAE’s Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed will be meeting Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in a visit to Moscow on Monday, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said, according to a tweet by the Russian MFA.

The Emirati top diplomat also received a call from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken prior to the Security Council vote, where Blinken spoke about the “importance of building a strong international response to support Ukrainian sovereignty through the UN Security Council.” The Emirati readout of the call was issued after the vote and did not include Blinken’s statement.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-26-22/h_690878a9ddf0883eb34b7414d0688cbd
6,fa4343dd-1867-4458-82f3-ed5511d5aac1,[],,"Moscow [Russia], February 26 (ANI): Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the suspension of advancement of its military forces in Ukraine on Friday (local time) but the operation was resumed Saturday afternoon after the Ukrainian leadership refused to talk, said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

""Yesterday afternoon, in connection with the expected negotiations with the Ukrainian leadership, the Russian president and supreme commander ordered the suspension of the advance of the main forces,"" Peskov said, speaking to reporters on Saturday.

""Since the Ukrainian side essentially refused to negotiate, the advance of the main Russian forces resumed this afternoon in accordance with the operational plan,"" he added, reported Sputnik.

Earlier, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested to Putin that they sit down at the negotiation table amid escalating tensions over Russia's military actions in Ukraine.

""I would like to address the president of Russia once again ... let us sit down at the negotiation table to stop people dying,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address, Sputnik News Agency reported.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had also said that Moscow is ready for negotiations on Kyiv at any moment. ""We are ready for negotiations. At any moment, as soon as the armed forces of Ukraine respond to the call of our president (Vladimir Putin), stop resisting and lay down their arms. No one is going to attack them, no one is going to oppress them, let them return to their families,"" Lavrov said.

Zelenskyy on Friday discussed the sanctions, defence assistance and an anti-war coalition with US President Joe Biden.

The conversation comes after Zelensky, who is still in Kyiv, delivered a speech saying Ukraine was ""alone in defending our country"".(ANI)",https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/putin-paused-military-operation-but-resumed-after-ukraine-refused-to-negotiate-kremlin-spokesperson20220226210907

The latest: As Ukrainian and Russian officials prepared for peace talks Monday, the U.K. Defense Ministry issued a statement saying British intelligence supports Ukrainian forces' claims that they've ""slowed down"" Russia's offensive, adding: ""Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continue to frustrate the Russian advance.""

The British statement concurs with comments by a Pentagon official on Sunday that the bulk of Russia's forces had stalled about 30 kilometers (19 miles), from Kyiv's city center.

Meanwhile, Russia's currency collapsed in overnight trading, with the ruble plummeting against the dollar, as the West ramps up sanctions over the invasion.

The Russian central bank raised interest rates from 9.5% to 20% and announced a raft of measures on Monday.

By the numbers: A senior Pentagon official said Sunday that Russia had committed two-thirds of its massed forces to fight in Ukraine and fired over 320 missiles, but still does not hold a major population center.

The invasion has caused at least 352 civilian casualties, including 14 children with another 1,684 people — including 116 children — injured, Ukraine's Ministry of Interior said Sunday.

State of play: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced Sunday following a conversation with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to hold peace talks with ""no preconditions"" on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River.

Putin ordered Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert Sunday. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said this was an attempt ""to put additional pressure on the Ukrainian delegation"" in peace talks.

Ukraine's Defense Ministry said all of Kharkiv — Ukraine's second-largest city, which lies on its eastern border with Russia and has endured some of the heaviest fighting of the war — was back under Ukrainian control Sunday.

The European Union announced sweeping sanctions on Russian aircraft and state media and said that, for the first time, the bloc will buy and deliver weapons to Ukraine — including transferring Soviet-era fighter jets.

What to watch: The United Nations will convene a rare emergency session of the 193-member General Assembly on Monday to vote on a resolution calling for peace in Ukraine.

Forces from Chechnya have entered the fight, while Belarusian forces have reportedly been readied to deploy in support of Russia.

What they're saying: Announcing the peace talks, Zelensky said: ""Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarusian territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation's travel, talks and return.""

""Our president, from the beginning, even before the war started, was focused on the diplomatic solution,"" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova said after the announcement, per CNN.

""But he always said, 'we’re ready for peace talks, we’re not ready to surrender,"" added Markarova, who compared Putin's tactics to those of Adolf Hitler.

Between the lines: It's unclear what exactly can be achieved from negotiations between envoys sent by Putin and Zelensky, given that Putin's unprovoked invasion appears to be aimed largely at removing Zelensky from power.

Putin has called on the Ukrainian military to topple their president and absurdly suggested that Zelensky's administration comprises Nazis (Zelensky is Jewish and lost family members in the Holocaust).

Zoom in: Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told AP Kyiv residents had water and electricity, ""but the infrastructure is destroyed to deliver the food and medication,"" which he said could cause a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""

What else is happening: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the all ""Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft,"" including the private jets of oligarchs, would be banned from European airspace.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared that Russia's invasion ""marks a turning point in the history of our continent,"" and promised major new contributions to Ukraine and to Germany's own defenses.

The Kremlin and state media continue to tell Russians that no ""war"" or ""invasion"" is taking place, but instead states there's a limited defensive operation in eastern Ukraine.

What to watch: Having already threatened independent publications that report on Russian casualties or aggression with censorship, the Kremlin announced Sunday that ""the provision of any assistance to a foreign state"" during the ""military operation"" would be considered treason — punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

As the day began, Russia’s currency lost as much as a quarter of its value within hours. Scrambling to stem the decline, the Russian Central Bank more than doubled its key interest rate, banned foreigners from selling Russian securities and ordered exporters to convert into rubles most of their foreign-currency revenues. It closed the Moscow stock exchange for the day because of the “developing situation.”

“The economic reality has, of course, changed,” the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters, announcing that Mr. Putin had called an emergency meeting with his top finance officials.

Even as Russian and Ukrainian delegations met for talks at the Belarus border, Moscow’s military offensive showed no sign of letting up, and the hectic moves offered the first signs that the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West over the weekend were shaking the foundations of Russia’s economy. The decisions by the United States, Britain and the European Union restricting the Russian Central Bank’s access to much of its $643 billion in foreign currency reserves have undone much of the Kremlin’s careful efforts to soften the impact of potential sanctions.

And with dozens of countries closing their airspace to Russian planes, major foreign investors pulling out and the West placing debilitating restrictions on Russia’s biggest banks, it was becoming clear that Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was ushering in a period of international isolation for Russia unseen since the Cold War.

“So, has Russia become Venezuela or is it still Iran?” the morning-show host on the liberal-leaning Echo of Moscow radio station asked an economist on Monday.

“We’ll go through the Iran phase,” Yevgeny S. Gontmakher of Moscow’s Higher School of Economics responded, referring to sanctions placed on Iran because of its plans for uranium enrichment, “but what happens after that is hard to say.”

Elvira Nabiullina, the widely respected governor of the Russian Central Bank, was expected to speak to the public at 4 p.m. Moscow time.

On Sunday, Mr. Putin called the West’s sanctions “illegitimate” in a televised meeting with his defense minister and top military commander. Mr. Putin then told them to place Russia’s nuclear arsenal on high alert; some analysts fear that Russia’s economic instability could lead Mr. Putin to escalate his conflict with the West using new military threats or other means, such as cyberattacks.

But there was also extreme uncertainty inside Russia as the value of people’s savings evaporated and the interconnections with the Western world that Russians had come to take for granted in the last three decades rapidly broke away. It was not immediately clear whether most Russians would blame Mr. Putin for the crisis — or whether they would take cues from Kremlin propaganda and blame the West.

“Times change, much has happened, but one thing has not changed,” a reporter on the state-run news channel Rossiya 24 said on Sunday. “When a united Europe tried to destroy Russia, this always ended up bringing about the opposite result.”

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.
