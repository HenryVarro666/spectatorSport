Previously, Biden had stopped short of labeling atrocities being documented on the ground in Ukraine as ""war crimes,"" citing ongoing international and US investigations.

But on Wednesday, speaking with reporters at an unrelated event, Biden affixed the designation on the Russian leader.

""I think he is a war criminal,"" the President said after remarks at the White House.

The shift from the administration's previous stance came after an emotional address to Congress from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who aired a video showing Ukrainians suffering amid Russia's onslaught. Zelensky asked American lawmakers and Biden for more help defending itself, including a no-fly zone and fighter jets.

Biden responded in his own address a few hours later, laying out new American military assistance to Ukraine -- including anti-aircraft and anti-armor systems, weapons and drones -- but stopping short of acceding to Zelensky's requests.

Still, Biden acknowledged the horrors transpiring on the ground.

""We saw reports that Russian forces were holding hundreds of doctors and patients hostage in the largest hospital in Mariupol,"" Biden said. ""These are atrocities. They're an outrage to the world. And the world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make Putin pay a very heavy price.""

It wasn't until a few hours after that that Biden responded to a question about Putin being a war criminal. Biden initially said ""no,"" but immediately returned to a group of reporters to clarify what had been asked. When asked again whether Putin was a war criminal, he answered in the affirmative.

On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Biden's remarks were ""absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable.""

Officials, including Biden, had previously avoided saying war crimes were being committed in Ukraine, citing ongoing investigations into whether that term could be used. Other world leaders have not been as circumspect, including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said last week war crimes were being committed. The International Criminal Court at the Hague has also opened an investigation into war crimes. And the US Senate unanimously asked for an international investigation into war crimes on Tuesday. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said last week that actions committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people ""constitute war crimes,"" marking the first time a senior US official directly accused Moscow of war crimes since last month's attack on Ukraine began.

In Poland last week, Vice President Kamala Harris called for international investigations into war crimes, and made clear she believed atrocities were underway. She said the intentional targeting of civilians would constitute war crimes.

After Biden delivered his assessment, the White House said the administration's investigation into war crimes would continue.

""The President's remarks speak for themselves,"" press secretary Jen Psaki said. She said Biden was ""speaking from the heart.""

State Department spokesman Ned Price echoed Psaki later Wednesday, telling CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront"" that ""when you are speaking from the heart, speaking as a human and you're seeing what we've all seen, these searing images on TV, a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, strikes against residential buildings, against schools, against civilian neighborhoods, it's hard not to walk away with that conclusion.""

""What we are doing here at the State Department, we are collecting every single piece of information, we're evaluating it, we're documenting it and sharing it with our partners. There is a process that is involved in this and there are people working almost around the clock to document, evaluate, share as we all watch what is happening with some horror.""

Pressed as to how Putin's actions don't currently amount to war crimes, Price reiterated that ""there is a formal process here at the department under international humanitarian law to document war crimes. We're involved in that.""

While the term ""war crimes"" is often used colloquially -- as Biden appeared to be doing Wednesday -- they do have a legal definition that could be used in potential prosecution. That includes in the Geneva Convention, which specifies intentional targeting of civilians as a war crime.

Yet in order to prosecute a war crime, solid evidence is required. And for Russian officials to be held accountable, they would need to travel outside of the country.

Still, an official designation of war crimes -- backed up with evidence -- would still present the West with a symbolic tool in framing Putin's actions in Ukraine.

Biden has come under increasing pressure to do more to help besieged Ukrainians as Russia's campaign intensifies. On Wednesday, a theater in Mariupol where civilians were sheltering was bombed, the latest example of Russia's indiscriminate shelling.

The pressure was only likely to increase after Zelensky's dramatic appeal to lawmakers for more help. He compared what is happening in Ukraine to Pearl Harbor and September 11, and said ""we need you right now"" to offer more support.

Biden watched the address from the library of his private residence, and later called it a ""convincing"" and ""significant"" speech.

""Putin is inflicting appalling, appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine, bombing apartment buildings, maternity wards, hospitals,"" he said afterward. ""I mean, it's godawful.""

Next week, Biden plans to travel to Brussels for an extraordinary session of NATO leaders, where he hopes to demonstrate western unity amid Russia's aggression.

Just hours before Mr. Biden’s declaration, his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told Nikolai P. Patrushev, Mr. Putin’s main national security adviser, that “any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine” would result in an even harsher Western response. Several of Mr. Biden’s aides have been concerned that if the Russian leader feels cornered or believes the United States is trying to foment opposition, the chances that he will reach for such weapons could be heightened.

So the debate underway in Washington now is what, exactly, might trigger Mr. Putin. Some believe he could lash out if dissent in Russia, already visible in street demonstrations, poses a real threat. Others believe that his trigger point might be a more direct entry into the war by NATO countries. They are already providing antitank and antiaircraft weapons that have contributed to what the Pentagon now estimates is a Russian death toll of at least 7,000 troops.

One former intelligence official noted that it was Hillary Clinton’s support for anti-Putin street demonstrations in Russia that prompted him to order the hacking of the Democratic National Committee when Mrs. Clinton was running for president in 2016. Mr. Putin is a believer, the official said, in retribution.

Mr. Putin would have good reason to think the Biden administration is looking forward to his exit, though American officials choose their words carefully to avoid the implication that Washington’s policy is to speed the process. Mr. Blinken, speaking to reporters on Thursday, said that “when all is said and done, an independent Ukraine will be there, and at some point Vladimir Putin will not.”

The last time an American president went head-to-head with a Russian or Soviet leader with so much at stake was 60 years ago, during the Cuban missile crisis, widely regarded as the closest the world came to Armageddon. And yet at that moment, in October 1962, President John F. Kennedy’s instinct was to avoid personalizing the conflict — and to help his Soviet counterpart, Nikita S. Khrushchev, find a way out of direct confrontation.

“I think it is the most natural comparison to this moment,” said Fredrik Logevall, a Harvard historian and Kennedy biographer.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/us/politics/biden-putin-war-criminal.html

President Biden on Wednesday was asked by reporters whether he was ready to call Russian President Putin a war criminal.

""I think he is a war criminal,"" Biden said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted that a legal review has been under way at the State Department to review the matter.

""He was speaking from his heart,"" she said.

This is the furthest that Biden — who often emphasizes the role of personal leader-to-leader diplomacy in international relations — has gone to decry the actions taken by Putin. When asked earlier this month if he thought Russia was committing war crimes, he said the White House was following events closely but that ""It's too early to say that.""

Biden spoke earlier in the day about 'atrocities' in Ukraine

Earlier Wednesday Biden spoke about the ""appalling devastation"" inflicted on Ukraine, including reports of doctors and patients being held hostage in Mariopol. ""These are atrocities,"" Biden said. ""It's an outrage to the world.""

The White House has called for an investigation into if Russian forces are committing war crimes in Ukraine, and experts have told NPR that evidence of them is ""undoubtable."" If any International Criminal Court investigation advances, Putin and his generals could face indictment.

Last week, Vice President Harris and Polish President Andrzej Duda decried Russia for its attacks on Ukrainian hospitals. Harris said the world had witnessed ""atrocities of unimaginable proportion"" with the attacks, and said the United States and Poland were unified ""in partnership and solidarity"" to support Ukraine's humanitarian and security needs. Duda spoke about the ""barbarous aggression"" from Russia, saying it had ""the features of a genocide,"" noting particularly the bombing of a maternity hospital in Ukraine.

""It is obvious to us that, in Ukraine, Russians are committing war crimes,"" Duda said. Harris expressed support for the ongoing war crimes investigation.

4,c604d8ba-b044-4699-af8b-e467f4bc032d,['Dan Mangan'],2022-03-16,"President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he believes Russian leader Vladimir Putin ""is a war criminal"" for his attacks on Ukraine.

It was the first time Biden has publicly branded Putin with that phrase.

Biden's comment came hours Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other top officials met virtually with the International Criminal Court's top prosecutor, who two weeks ago opened an investigation into possible war crimes by Russia.

And it came after Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., earlier Wednesday said Biden ""absolutely"" should call Putin a war criminal.

Kelly cited Russia's attacks on ""hospitals, maternity wards, apartment buildings"" in Ukraine and its military's ""direct fire on civilians.""

In an exchange with a reporter in a loud, crowded room in the White House following an event, Biden was asked, ""Mr. President, after everything we've seen, are you ready to call Putin a war criminal.""

Biden initially replied, ""No,"" as he walked by the journalist.

The reporter then asked if Biden will ""go to Poland,"" where many Ukraine refugees have fled the Russian invasion.

Biden then returned to the journalist asking, ""Did you ask me whether I should call?""

""Oh, I think he is a war criminal,"" Biden said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki later said Biden was speaking from his heart about what he has seen on the news about the ""barbaric actions by a brutal dictator.""

Psaki noted that there is a separate legal process to determine whether Putin has violated international law and committed war crimes. That process currently is underway at the State Department, she said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in response to Biden, said, ""We consider unacceptable and unforgivable such rhetoric of the head of the state, whose bombs killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world,"" according to the Russian news agency Tass.

The United Nations on Tuesday said that since Feb. 24, when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, nearly 700 civilians have been killed, with more than 1,140 civilians injured.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/16/biden-says-russian-leader-putin-is-a-war-criminal-for-ukraine-attacks.html
5,c604d8ba-b044-4699-af8b-e467f4bc032d,[],2022-03-16,"The comment followed Biden’s announcement earlier on Wednesday that the U.S. would send an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine. His commitment to more aid, which brings the total to $1 billion allocated to the country this week, came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered an emotional address to Congress. Zelenskyy pleaded with the U.S. and its NATO allies to do more to help his country, whether by enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine or sending jets to aid in its war against Russia.

Biden, during Wednesday’s speech, addressed the nature of the “difficult battle” Ukrainians have faced in the three weeks since Russia launched its assault. The Ukrainian death toll has continued to climb as Russian bombing expands toward the country’s west. More than 700 civilians have been killed the past few weeks, according to the United Nations, and dozens of children have been confirmed dead as of March 15, though these numbers are difficult to track and are likely considerably higher.

“The American people will be steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin’s immoral, unethical attacks on civilian populations,” Biden said. “We are united in the abhorrence of depraved onslaught, and we are going to continue to have their backs as they fight for their freedom, their democracy, their very survival.”

White House aides confirmed that Biden had not planned in advance to declare that Putin was a war criminal. The president had taken aides’ advice and not taken questions at his Wednesday morning event when he signed the authorization to send the additional resources to Ukraine.

But at the end of his afternoon event, in which he reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, Biden worked the crowd in the East Room for nearly half an hour before he ended up next to group of gathered reporters. He took one question from a reporter who asked whether Putin was a war criminal. Biden answered no and kept walking.

He returned a moment later and indicated that he realized that he might have misheard the question. When it was repeated, the president answered in the affirmative, becoming the first member of his administration to assign that label to Putin.

Horrifying images have been seen across the world this month. Just this week, it was confirmed that a pregnant woman and her baby died after a maternity hospital was bombed in the southeastern port city of Mariupol last week. Multiple journalists have now been reported dead. Millions of Ukrainians have fled the country, while millions of others are facing a humanitarian crisis within Ukraine’s borders.

Russia is already at the center of multiple investigations opened in recent weeks, including a probe by the U.N., which announced it would open a commission to investigate alleged human rights abuses. U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield was the first Biden administration official to call Russia’s attacks war crimes last week, as world leaders ramp up calls to hold Putin accountable and the U.S. weighs its role in international investigations, particularly when it comes to the International Criminal Court.

ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan announced his court’s probe on March 2, after dozens of member states called for him to take action. The U.S. is not a member of the ICC and has long had a complicated relationship with the court, though the Biden administration is reviewing its policy on the ICC, Foreign Policy reported.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about Biden’s directness, and what changed his assessment of Putin’s attacks. Psaki acknowledged that there is a legal process underway at the State Department, where the agency is documenting and compiling information about the attacks on Ukrainian civilians to reach a conclusion.

“He was speaking from his heart and speaking from what he’s seen on television, which is barbaric actions by a brutal dictator through his invasion of a foreign country,” Psaki said.

Vice President Kamala Harris last week, while in Poland, accused Russia of committing “atrocities,” though stopped short of leveling the accusation as Biden did on Wednesday. She also said the U.S. would participate in investigations by the U.N. to determine whether Russia has committed war crimes.

“Just limit it to what we have seen,” Harris said last week, discussing potential Russian war crimes. “Pregnant women going for health care? Being injured by, I don’t know, a missile? A bomb? In an unprovoked, unjustified war?”

“Absolutely, there should be an investigation,” she added. “And we should all be watching. And I have no question the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities. Have no doubt.”

The president initially told a reporter ""no,"" when asked if he was ready to label Putin a war criminal ""after everything we've seen,"" but moments later Biden circled back, asking her to repeat the question, which he appeared to have initially misunderstood.

""I think he is a war criminal,"" Biden said of Putin, for the first time since the unprovoked attack began.

A short time later, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at an afternoon press briefing Biden was speaking ""from the heart"" after he made the comment, while carefully noting there is still a State Department review of whether it considers Russia's attacks on Ukrainian civilians a war crime.

""There is a legal process that continues to – is underway, continues to be underway at the State Department.""

ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce followed up, noting the ongoing, formal process to use the term, and said, ""So something must have changed for the President to feel like he can take this additional step today.""

""The president was answering a direct question that was asked, and responding to what he has seen on television, we have all seen,"" Psaki replied. ""Barbaric acts, horrific acts, by a foreign dictator in a country that is threatening and taking the lives of civilians impacting hospitals, women who are pregnant, journalists, others, and I think he was answering a direct question,"" she added, appearing to downplay the comment.

Despite the evidence, the White House had gone out of its way not to label Putin a war criminal, repeatedly noting there was an official review underway before the Biden administration could formally accuse Putin of war crimes.

Earlier this month, Biden said it was ""clear"" Russian forces were targeting civilian areas but said that it was too early to label the actions war crimes.

""Do you believe Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine?"" Biden was asked on March 2.

""We are following it very closely. It's early to say that,"" he said.

The shift in characterization follows a wave of U.S. sanctions on Russia including personal sanctions on Putin and following a powerful appeal from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to Congress, in which he called on Biden to do more to aid Ukraine.

President Biden explicitly called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” Wednesday, after weeks of avoiding the term and at a time when his administration is still determining whether that label officially applies. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Biden made the dramatic accusation seemingly off the cuff, in response to a reporter’s shouted question at an afternoon event on an entirely different topic. “I think he is a war criminal,” Biden said, after delivering comments on the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.

The asseveration was emblematic of the day’s high emotions and dramatic agenda, which were driven by a forceful speech to Congress delivered by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, rather than by Biden’s own carefully laid plans and message.

Biden watched Zelensky’s 9 a.m. address from the private library of his White House residence, absorbing an emotional plea that invoked both Pearl Harbor and Sept. 11 — two deadly attacks on the United States that came from the sky — and beseeched the president to close the skies above Ukraine.

“Our country experienced the same every day, right now, at this moment, every night for three weeks now,” Zelensky said, speaking to lawmakers via video with the help of an interpreter.

Almost exactly four hours later, Biden responded with his own remarks praising Zelensky’s “passionate” and “significant” speech, outlining the help his administration is providing Ukraine and announcing significant new aid. But he also made clear that the crux of Zelensky’s appeal — a no-fly zone above Ukraine — remains a nonstarter for the United States.

Biden’s comments, which began more than an hour after initially scheduled and ran half the length of Zelensky’s entreaty — eight minutes to Zelensky’s 16 — underscored the fluid dynamic between the two leaders, with Biden (wearing a suit, subdued, age 79) finding himself, for one of the first times since Russia invaded Ukraine, clearly in response mode to Zelensky (clad in military green, resolute, age 44).

“The American people are answering President Zelensky’s call for more help, more weapons for Ukraine to defend itself, more tools to fight Russian aggression,” Biden said.

His comments at times took on an almost defensive tone, as he noted that the United States had been equipping Ukraine since before the invasion, that American weapons have helped the Ukrainians inflict significant damage and that the $800 million in new aid he was announcing would include “cutting-edge systems” such as drones.

Starting with Russia’s initial buildup on the Ukrainian border last fall, Biden and his team took the lead in trying to avert Russian aggression against its neighbor. The administration worked with NATO and other Western allies to deter Putin through diplomatic channels and the threat of sanctions. And Biden himself signed off on a new strategy to declassify intelligence, sharing it with the world in an attempt to thwart Putin’s ability to use a false pretext to invade Ukraine.

The White House even launched a secretive “Tiger Team” to plan for how to handle a Russian invasion.

Indeed, if Russia’s bellicosity offered any silver lining, it was that Putin helped catapult Biden back into a position in which he is most comfortable, serving as a transatlantic leader and declaring — both literally and symbolically — that America is back after four years of chaos and alliance-busting under Donald Trump.

But since the actual war between Russia and Ukraine began three weeks ago, Biden and his European counterparts have articulated no clear end game, and Wednesday’s Biden-Zelensky juxtaposition offered something of a split screen, with the U.S. president and his team trying to explain why the administration was falling short on meeting Zelensky’s stirring request.

The Ukrainian leader ended his speech by switching to English and calling out Biden directly: “You are the leader of the nation, of your great nation,” Zelensky said. “I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.”

In response, Biden found himself explaining at great length what he has already done to support Ukraine and announcing that he is authorizing an additional $800 million in security assistance, noting that it brought the total to $1 billion “just this week” and to $2 billion since the start of his administration.

“This new package on its own is going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine,” Biden said. “It includes 800 antiaircraft systems to make sure the Ukrainian military can continue to stop the planes and helicopters that have been attacking their people and to defend the Ukrainian airspace. And at the request of President Zelensky, we have identified and are helping Ukraine acquire additional longer-range antiaircraft systems and the munitions for those systems.”

The White House reported that the $800 million in new assistance includes 800 Stinger antiaircraft systems; 2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems; 100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems; 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 shotguns; more than 20 million rounds of small-arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds; 25,000 sets of body armor; and 25,000 helmets.

Speaking to reporters Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki was repeatedly pressed on why the administration has been willing to provide Ukraine lethal assistance, such as Javelin antitank missiles and Stinger surface-to-air missiles, while repeatedly refusing Zelensky’s requests for Polish MiG fighter jets.

The administration has sought to draw a careful line between defensive and offensive weapons, arguing that the latter risked setting off a direct confrontation with Russia that could turn into a larger war.

“I would note that the equipment that we’ve provided is defensive, as you know, not offensive,” Psaki said. “And we see that as being a difference.”

And again, several minutes later, Psaki offered: “Javelins and Stingers are defensive weapons. MiGs or planes are offensive weapons, which are a different type of military system.”

But Poland has offered to provide fighter planes to the United States for use in Ukraine, a notion that has some bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. Immediately after Zelensky’s speech, several Republican lawmakers weighed in with calls for the Biden administration to send Zelensky the MiGs he wants.

“Zelensky has the courage of his convictions. The question he asked the Congress and the United States government is will we have the courage of ours,” said Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.). “We’re a superpower — we should act like it.”

Asked about a no-fly zone, Sasse added: “We should have gotten them planes long ago.”

And referring to a video Zelensky showed Congress that included footage of his country being decimated, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) offered a similar assessment.

“I don’t know how anyone could listen to him and see the videos and not be in favor of sending the MiGs, sending drones, sending additional weaponry, ceasing doing business in Russia and implementing his call for broader sanctions,” Collins said.

As for Biden’s unexpected comment that Putin is a war criminal, Psaki depicted it as a heartfelt remark. “The president’s remarks speak for themselves,” she said. “He was speaking from his heart and speaking from what we’ve seen on television, which is barbaric actions by a brutal dictator through his invasion of a foreign country.”

She reiterated Wednesday that the State Department is conducting a legal review to determine whether the actions in Ukraine are war crimes. “If Russia is intentionally targeting civilians, that would be a war crime,” she said last week in disclosing the inquiry. “But we need to go through the legal assessment and review in order to make a formal conclusion.”

Vice President Harris endorsed a war crimes inquiry last week, speaking during a visit to Poland, saying, “Absolutely there should be an investigation, and we should all be watching.” And in The Hague, the prosecutor’s office at the International Criminal Court recently announced that it was looking into the Ukraine situation.

But neither the international court nor the U.S. government has formally concluded that Russia’s actions constitute war crimes, making Biden’s seemingly spontaneous assertion Wednesday all the more striking.

Psaki emphasized that the administration has been in regular contact with the Ukrainians, saying that while Biden is not prepared to accede to every demand by Zelensky, nothing the Ukrainian leader requested came as a surprise.

“If we were President Zelensky, we would be asking for everything possible as well, and continuing to ask for it,” Psaki said. “Because he is watching his country and his people be attacked and brutalized by President Putin and the Russian military,” Psaki said.

Psaki said a legal review is underway at the State Department to review Russia's actions in Ukraine and whether they constitute war crimes.

Putin's press secretary reacted angrily to Mr. Biden's comments, according to TASS, the Russian state-owned news agency. ""We consider unacceptable and unforgivable such rhetoric of the head of state, whose bombs killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world,"" said Dmitry Peskov.

Mr. Biden's comment came as Russia has continued its bombardment of civilians in Ukraine, with the loss of lives and suffering growing. On Tuesday, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution condemning the violence in Ukraine and calling for an investigation of Putin and members of his regime for war crimes

The International Court of Justice has ordered Russia to cease its invasion and opened an investigation into the war. The United Nations human rights office registered roughly 600 civilian deaths, though the toll is expected to be much higher. More than 2,000 people are believed to have been killed in the port city of Mariupol alone, according to Ukrainian officials. The U.N. estimates 3 million people have fled Ukraine because of Russia's war, while another nearly 2 million have been internally displaced. The U.N. said the refugee crisis in Ukraine is the fast-growing in Europe since World War II.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine said Russian forces shot and killed 10 people who were standing in line for bread in Chernihiv, a city in northeast Ukraine that was hit in a Russian artillery strike.

""Such horrific attacks must stop. We are considering all available options to ensure accountability for any atrocity crimes in Ukraine,"" the embassy said in a tweet.

Local officials in Ukraine and Dmytro Kuleba, the country's minister off foreign affairs, on Wednesday said Russian troops struck a theater in Mariupol where ""hundreds"" of civilians were sheltering.

""Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter,"" Kuleba tweeted, along with a photo purporting to show the besieged theater.

Mr. Biden announced $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine Wednesday morning, including armed drones. But the new security assistance does not include fighter jets or impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy requested in a virtual address to Congress Wednesday morning.

""Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,"" Zelenskyy said in his speech, during which he played for lawmakers a graphic video showing the extent of the death and destruction in Ukraine by Russia.
