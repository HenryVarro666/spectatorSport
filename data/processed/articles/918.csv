Plus that unfinished second An-225 in storage...



A similar situation exists for rockets, although Angara has chased Zenit away. The Russian surely would not spit on taking back the rocket industry there.



Ukraine main rocket OKB happened because of one of Korolev early rivals: Yangel. When he lost that battle, Yangel went to Brezhnev, who was Ukrainian (AFAIK) and he got his rocket shop moved to Ukraine. Where it still is to this day.



That Yangel OKB built (among many other things) the LK Soviet lunar lander engine.



Also huuuuge ICBMs: R-16 (the one that went kaboom in 1960, incinerating Marshall Nedelin and 200 poor souls) and then the R-36, and the Tsyklon derived civilian boosters.



Later the Energiya boosters were offloaded there, also as a fly-alone rocket: Zenit.



That's why the Russians never replaced Proton with Zenit as originally planned by the Soviets: that thing was from Ukraine, and so they created Angara instead (took them 20 years: 1995-2015, to make it fly). Zenit went to a private company on a former oil rig: SeaLaunch, which has gone bankrupt and then seized by... Russian interests.",https://www.secretprojects.co.uk/threads/antonov-future.38963/

Today is a major day in the Russian military operation. Why?

Because Russian forces are now on the outskirts of many major Ukrainian cities. If yesterday was “standoff weapons” day, today is the first day when Russian forces can now begin to degrade Ukrainian artillery dispositions, engage Ukie armor and break through Ukrainian fortifications. Today is also the last day for US PSYOPs to try to present a counter-narrative (Ukies heroically resisting, Russian dying in huge numbers, effective counter-attacks, etc.).

Yet we live in the smartphone with camera era and picture like this one tell the full story:

What you see in this picture are immense traffic jams of folks fleeing not Mariupol or Kramatorsk, but Kiev, the capital.

Here is a quick machine translated news update from Col. Cassad:

1. LDNR – the positional nature of the fighting remains, with attempts by the LDNR armies to advance to the borders of the territories occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

2. The southern direction – the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation retained control over the bridge over the Dnieper at Kherson, repulsing attempts of counterattacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.. Fighting in the Antonovsky Bridge area continues.

A New Kakhovka is also being held. Melitopol was taken this morning and the advance towards Berdyansk began.

3. Kharkiv direction – fighting continues on the near approaches to Kharkov. Both sides are suffering losses in people and equipment.

4. Sumy direction – the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation took Putivl and passing through Sumy (the battle at the airport continued there today), advanced to Konotop, surrounding the city. Today, attempts to take Akhtyrka continued in order to reach Kharkov from the west. There are Russian roadblocks on the Sumy-Kiev highway. There is an advance to Kiev and Chernihiv. (The APU repelled the attack of the Russian Armed Forces in the Chernihiv direction).

5. Kiev – Gostomel airfield is held by paratroopers. The APU could not dislodge them from there. This morning, tank columns of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation broke through to the near approaches to Kiev and are close to establishing direct communication with the landing. The AFU is preparing a counterattack, stating that another landing will be thrown out in the Gostomel area today. The Pentagon says that Kiev will fall in the coming days. After 10 o’clock shooting was heard in the city. Also, according to the statement of the Armed Forces of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the landing was thrown to the west of Zhytomyr. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are actively undermining bridges on the approaches, trying to slow down the advance of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,

6. In the morning, strikes continued on military facilities of the Armed Forces of Ukraine throughout the territory of Ukraine. A Su-27 of the Ukrainian Air Force was shot down over Kiev – according to one version by the Russian air defense system, according to another – by the Ukrainian ones. The downed “Caliber” fell on a residential building in Kiev, but there were no casualties. During the shelling of Gorlovka, a school was hit – 2 teachers were killed.

7. The AFU launched a missile attack on the Millerovo airfield on the territory of the Russian Federation. Damage is reported at the airfield, but there are no losses in aircraft.

I now leave you with an open thread, please try to stick to FACTUAL INFORMATION and please refrain from prophecies about the future or stream of consciousness about the present.

One more thing: today Putin appealed to the Ukrainian soldiers and told them not to let the Banderistas to rule over them, he basically called for them to take power and negotiate with Russia. Ukie generals need to think hard about what they will do next.

I will try to post an analysis of the day later today.
