The European Union will not ban Russian oil imports for now and will focus on the far easier task of cutting out less valuable coal instead, despite evidence of apparent war crimes committed by President Vladimir Putin’s forces in Ukraine.

Under a sanctions package put to member countries by the European Commission on Tuesday, Russian coal deliveries worth around €4 billion a year will be phased out of the bloc’s energy imports. The EU imported over €5 billion worth of coal from Russia in 2021.

There will be bans on Russian vessels and trucks entering the EU and tougher sanctions on four key Russian banks, which will be totally cut off from the markets.

But — amid resistance from countries led by Germany — the bloc is stopping short of an embargo on Russian oil, even though such action would deal a far bigger blow to the Kremlin’s war effort than targeting coal. Indeed, coal is only a tiny fraction of the EU's imports of ""mineral fuels"" from Russia, which hit €98.9 billion in 2021. Ukraine and several Eastern European countries have been pushing for an energy embargo, arguing that oil and gas revenues are the main revenue streams funding Putin's war.

An oil ban is particularly difficult for Germany, however. One official in Berlin stressed that banning gas was impossible for Germany and that it might also take months for Europe's leading economy to be in a position to end its use of Russian oil. In contrast, the German government had already made clear it would phase out Russian coal by the summer anyway. In a major loophole in Tuesday's sanctions, ships in the energy sector are exempted.

Pressure has been building on Berlin to agree to ditch Russian oil since reports emerged over the weekend of atrocities against civilians apparently committed by Russian troops before they retreated from the Kyiv area.

Scenes of bodies littering the streets in Bucha outside the Ukrainian capital, and accounts of murder and rape, provoked a storm of outrage from world leaders and intensified demands within the EU to hit Putin’s oil profits.

On Tuesday, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen outlined the latest package of sanctions, which will be put to EU ambassadors for approval on Wednesday. While the sanctions go further than previously planned, there is likely to be increasing pressure to do more in the days ahead, especially on ending imports of Russian oil and gas.

“We all saw the gruesome pictures from Bucha and other areas from which Russian troops have recently left,” von der Leyen said. “These atrocities cannot and will not be left unanswered.”

Von der Leyen said the EU’s proposed fifth package of sanctions will “cut deeper” into the Russian economy but are not the end of the bloc’s ambitions. More work is ongoing on stronger sanctions, she said, including on Russian oil.

“Russia is waging a cruel and ruthless war, not only against Ukraine's brave troops, but also against its civilian population. It is important to sustain utmost pressure on Putin and the Russian government at this critical point.”

However, instead of an immediate, blanket ban on Russian coal, the Commission is proposing only a gradual move, according to a text sent to EU countries and seen by POLITICO. The ban would not come into force until three months after the final sanctions package has been announced and would apply only to new coal contracts, not deals already signed.

Some countries such as Poland, which have since the start of the invasion been pushing for tougher sanctions, stressed the EU should go even further. ""We reiterate that gas and oil must be included,"" a Polish official said. ""This is why Poland announced steps to end imports by end of the year.""

Von der Leyen said Russian shipping will be banned from accessing EU ports, under the proposed sanctions, although there will be exemptions for “certain essentials” including energy, food, agricultural products and humanitarian aid. Russian and Belarusian road transport operators will also be banned from entering the EU, which will “drastically limit” the options for Russian industry to obtain vital goods, she said.

The sanctions include further export bans in areas such as advanced semiconductors, machinery and transport equipment. The package also bans the participation of Russian companies in EU public procurement contracts and will include further listings of individuals.

3,7dfe4193-8a2b-4de3-a594-bcb68928deb2,['Bne Intellinews'],,"The European Commission has proposed new sanctions on Russia that will hit coal imports, trade and more banks in response to the massacre in Kyiv’s suburb of Bucha on April 3, where retreating Russian soldiers murdered civilians in cold blood.

EU President Ursula Von der Leyen announced the new sanctions on twitter, listing the main points:

· An import ban on coal from Russia, worth €4bn per year, cutting another important revenue source for Russia;

· A full transaction ban on four key Russian banks, among them VTB, the second-largest Russian bank;

· A ban on Russian and Russian operated vessels from accessing EU ports and a ban on Russian and Belarusian road transport operators;

· Further export bans, worth €10bn, in crucial areas: advanced semiconductors, machinery and transport equipment;

· A ban on Russian and Russian operated vessels from accessing EU ports and a ban on Russian and Belarusian road transport operators;

· Further export bans, worth €10bn, in crucial areas: advanced semiconductors, machinery and transport equipment;

· Specific new import bans, worth €5.5bn euros;

· Targeted measures, such as a ban on participation of Russian companies in public procurement in Europe and exclusion of all financial support, EU or national to Russian public bodies;

“Finally, we are also proposing further listings of individuals,” von der Leyen added.

“We are also working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports, and reflecting on some of the ideas of the Member States, like taxes or specific payment channels such as an escrow account,” von der Leyen added. “Today over 40 countries apply sanctions like these. To take a clear stand is crucial for the whole world. A clear stand against Putin’s war of choice. Against the massacre of civilians. Against the violation of the fundamental principles of the world order. Slava Ukrainje!”

All told, the new sanctions will reduce the trade turnover with Russia by an estimated €20bn a year. In 2021 Russia’s trade turnover with Europe was €257.5bn, according to the European Commission.

Following the atrocities in Bucha there have been widespread calls for Europe to cut off imports of Russian gas, but many countries, led by Germany, have shied away from the idea, afraid of the negative economic impact. Russia accounts for 41.1% of the EU’s gas imports, which totalled 155bn cubic metres (including LNG) in 2021, worth $145bn, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF) estimates.

Russia plays an even bigger role in the importing of coal, accounting for 46.7% of total EU imports, which were worth $15bn in 2021, according to IIF estimates. But as the EU is in the process of winding down the reliance on coal as a fuel as part of its Green Deal, ending the imports of coal is a more palatable measure.

The ban on the import of coal is the first sanction since the start of the war in Ukraine on Russia to directly target an energy supply from Russia to Europe. A ban on Russian coal had been proposed in January should Russia invade its neighbour, but EU sources told Reuters it was blocked by Germany.

Banning oil imports was also not mentioned in the new fifth packet of sanctions, as although Russian oil makes up 26.9% of EU oil imports, worth $120bn in 2021, some countries are much more exposed to the trade. The UK government has already said that it will phase out imports of Russian oil, but not until the end of this year, as it is the most dependent on Russian oil imports of all European countries.

Other measures in the new sanctions strike at Russian transport and logistics and are designed to stymie Russia’s ability to transport and sell its commodities, which in turn will also reduce its export revenues, which are significant.

The SWIFT sanctions limiting Russia’s access to the international financial system were extended modestly, targeting VTB Bank in particular, Russia’s second-largest bank. However, while the SWIFT sanctions have proved highly disruptive, they have only been extended to seven banks so far out of a total of 372 banks as of the end of 2021.

Notably, Gazprombank, the financial arm of Russia’s natural gas producer, remains exempted from the SWIFT bans and continues to be the payment agent for European countries to settle their gas import bills with Russia.

In a particularly painful sanction, high tech products and machinery were also targeted. Russia has missed out on two revolutions in machine tool development and remains highly dependent on imports of precision machine tools , sourcing the bulk of them from the world leaders of Germany and the US. Cutting off access to these tools will severely hamper Russia’s economic development.

The import bans go into effect as soon as they are published in the EU's official journal, with winding-down periods whose length is still to be decided, a source told Reuters.

The European Union announced a fourth package of Russian sanctions on March 15 that were designed to “further contribute to ramping up economic pressure on the Kremlin and cripple its ability to finance its invasion of Ukraine”. The measures included: a ban on transactions with certain Russian state-owned enterprises; an import ban on steel products; a ban on new investment into the Russian energy sector; and an export ban on luxury goods amongst other things. The list of sanctioned oligarchs was also extended.

EU countries are also discussing other restrictions against Russia. Bloomberg noted that the restrictions could affect sales of natural gas liquefaction equipment. The Wall Street Journal writes that the EU will introduce new sanctions against ""oligarchs"" and their families. Reuters sources add that the European Commission will also proposed including in the new package of sanctions a ban on imports from Russia of rubber and chemicals (possibly fertilizers, although Vladimir Putin ruled out this possibility, saying that fertilizers will be taken because ""no one wants to die of hunger "").

In addition, the EU may impose sanctions against Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova, whom the media call the daughters of Vladimir Putin. This is reported by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal correspondent in Europe Lawrence Norman. Bloomberg notes that the inclusion of Tikhonova and Vorontsova in the sanctions lists will be ""a symbolic step, since it is not known whether they have significant assets outside of Russia, but it is intended to attract the attention of the president.""

What do restrictions on coal imports mean for Russia?

For Russian coal, the European market is important: in 2021, about 50mn tons of coal were exported to Europe, which accounted for 22.1% of total exports. “For Europe, the dependence is even higher: about 50% of imports are from Russia,” Alexander Titov, a senior expert at the Institute of Energy and Finance, told The Bell.

He notes that the wording of the ban chosen by the European Union in “billion euros”, and not in “million tons”, which leaves some room for manoeuvre when distributing quotas by country and clarifying the volumes under sanctions.

“If we count at average prices for 2021, then almost all imports of Russian coal to the EU (48-49mn tons) will be banned, about €4bn were exported there, according to the Federal Customs Service of Russia. But if we take current prices, then the ban will affect about 16.5mn tons of exports, that is, only a third of the total,” Titov told The Bell.

At the same time, prices are likely to continue to rise. On April 5, futures for coal supplied to north-western Europe rose 7.9% to $205 per ton. This means that the reduction in imports may be even smaller. It is expected that in the near future the European Union will clarify the procedure for distributing quotas by country.

It will not be easy for Europe to find alternative suppliers to Russian coal, Titov notes. “It could come from South Africa, Colombia, Indonesia, the USA and Australia, but a number of companies from these countries at the beginning of March already announced that they had contracted their volumes to Asia and other regions and they have little free volumes that can be redirected to Europe,” he explained.

On the other hand, Europe now has time to find new suppliers, as the heating season is over. Power stations and utilities have until the end of the summer to replenish coal reserves. By that time, it may be possible to find other sources of imports and/or reduce coal consumption.

American sanctions

The Joe Biden administration also plans to announce a new package of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday, NBC News reported, citing sources. According to them, the package was developed in coordination with the G7 countries and the European Union.

The new sanctions, according to the TV channel, ""are aimed at causing significant economic damage to Russia"" and are introduced as a response to ""war crimes in Ukraine."" They provide for a ban on all new investment in Russia, increase pressure on the country's financial institutions and state-owned enterprises, and impose restrictions on officials and their families.

The Wall Street Journal also writes about the preparation of new US sanctions. According to the paper, the new sanctions package may include additional restrictions against Sberbank.

Europe continues to expel Russian diplomats

On April 6, several other European countries announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats. And the European Union declared 19 employees of the Russian Permanent Mission to the EU persona non grata.

The expulsion of diplomats as of April 6 included:

Denmark will send 15 Russian diplomats, all of them are suspected of espionage;

Slovenia expels 33 Russian diplomats;

Romania declared 10 Russian diplomats persona non grata;

Latvia will send 13 employees of the Russian diplomatic mission and close two Russian consulates general;

Estonia expels 14 employees of the Russian consulate and closes the consulate in Narva and the office in Tartu.

In addition, it became known that the Russian embassy in Dublin complained to the Irish Foreign Ministry about the ""discriminatory"" refusal of local companies to supply diesel fuel for heating and hot water. The parties do not comment on this information, however, anti-Russian protests in Dublin were among the most violent, and a month ago the gates of the embassy were rammed by a truck. The Irish media also write that the Bank of Ireland blocked the embassy's accounts, but there is no independent confirmation of this information either.",https://intellinews.com/ec-announces-a-fifth-package-of-sanctions-on-russia-targeting-coal-high-tech-equipment-and-transport-240449/

More countries continue to expel Russian diplomats as part of the fallout from Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Here's a list of countries and the actions they have taken:

Italy has expelled 30 Russian diplomats for ""national security"" reasons, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said in Berlin on Tuesday.

The decision ""taken in agreement with other European and Atlantic partners"" was needed for ""reasons related to our national security, in the context of the current crisis resulting from the unjustified aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation,"" Di Maio said.

""Italy is available to act as a guarantor of security and peace in Ukraine and we will do whatever it takes to carry out this work.""

Spain is expelling “about 25 Russian diplomats and embassy staff who represent a threat to the security interests of our country,” Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said Tuesday at news conference in Madrid.

The expulsions also “come after the terrible actions in recent days in Ukraine, especially in Bucha,” Albares said, in reference to images of Ukrainian civilians killed in that town at close range.

Spain’s Foreign Ministry press office said those expelled will have a few days to prepare for their departure. The list does not include the Russian ambassador to Spain, the press office added.

Sweden has expelled three Russian diplomats for carrying out intelligence operations in the country in breach of diplomatic relations, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde said in a news conference in Stockholm on Tuesday, condemning ""war crimes committed by Russia"" in reference to scenes from Bucha.

She added that Sweden wants ""to see a fifth sanction package as soon as possible that goes further when it comes to Russian exports of fossil fuels.""

Latvia announced Tuesday that it was closing two Russian consulates and expelling staff over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday. The Russian ambassador to Latvia was told that the consulates in the Latvian cities of Daugavpils and Liepāja must close and their staff leave the country by the end of the month, the foreign ministry added.

“The decision was taken in solidarity with Ukraine in its fight against the unprovoked and unjustified military aggression and war started by Russia,” a ministry statement read.

Estonia has said it will shut down both Russian consulates in the country and expel 14 staff in light of the atrocities revealed to have been committed by Russian forces against Ukrainian civilians.

Seven of the employees have diplomatic status, according to a statement from Estonia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The former Soviet state is the latest European country to participate in Tuesday’s mass expulsion of Russian diplomats.

Consulates in Narva and Tartu will close and staff have until April 30 to leave, the Russian ambassador was told, according to the Estonian Foreign Ministry. Russia still has an embassy operating in Estonia’s capital city of Tallinn.

Several European countries – including France, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands – also decided to expel Russian diplomats. Denmark said Tuesday it has expelled 15 alleged Russian intelligence officers it claims were working undercover as diplomats.

Russia's response: Russia on Tuesday warned the European Union of “adequate reciprocal measures” after the bloc designated 19 Russian diplomats to the European Union as “persona non grata” over its invasion of Ukraine, the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the EU said in a statement.

""This openly unfriendly — moreover, hostile and, most importantly, completely groundless step continues the European Union's policy of dismantling the partnership between Russia and the EU, which until recently both sides proudly called strategic,” the statement said.

The expulsion of Russian diplomats is a “short-sighted step” that will “inevitably lead to retaliatory steps,” the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on a regular conference call on Tuesday.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU High Representative Josep Borrell today proposed a 5th package of sanctions against Russia for the approval of the European Council.

These sanctions aim to further cripple Putin’s war machinery, following the atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces in Bucha and other places under Russian occupation in Ukraine.

Russia is waging a cruel, ruthless war, also against Ukraine’s civilian population.

This fifth package has six pillars.

An import ban on coal from Russia, worth €4 billion per year. This will cut another important revenue source for Russia. A full transaction ban on four key Russian banks, among them VTB, the second largest Russian bank. These four banks, now totally cut off from the markets, represent 23% of market share in the Russian banking sector. This will further weaken Russia’s financial system. A ban on Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing EU ports. Certain exemptions will cover essentials, such as agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid as well as energy. Additionally, the Commission will propose a ban on Russian and Belarusian road transport operators. This ban will drastically limit the options for the Russian industry to obtain key goods. Further targeted export bans, worth €10 billion, in areas in which Russia is vulnerable. This includes, for example, quantum computers and advanced semiconductors, but also sensitive machinery and transportation equipment. With this, the EU will continue to degrade Russia’s technological base and industrial capacity. Specific new import bans, worth € 5.5 billion, to cut the money stream of Russia and its oligarchs, on products from wood to cement, from seafood to liquor. In doing this, the EU also closes loopholes between Russia and Belarus. A number of very targeted measures, such as a general EU ban on participation of Russian companies in public procurement in Member States, or an exclusion of all financial support, be it European or national, to Russian public bodies.

The European Commission also proposed further listings of individuals, adding, according to Borrell, “dozens of people from politics, the business sector and engaged in propaganda activities”.

According to Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission is also working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports, and reflecting on some of the ideas presented by Member States, such as taxes or specific payment channels such as an escrow account.
