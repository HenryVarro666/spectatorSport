SWIFT curbs to be imposed on some Russian banks

Ukraine president says Russian forces being repelled

Russia says its troops are advancing

KYIV, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces battled Russian troops pushing into the city of Kharkiv on Sunday on the fourth day of an invasion that has shaken Europe's long-standing security architecture and pushed Germany to spend more on defence.

The invasion of Ukraine from three sides ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin is the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two.

The attack, which Russia calls a special operation, has so far failed to topple the government in Kyiv or take major cities, but has driven hundreds of thousands of refugees, mainly women and children, into neighbouring countries.

Russian soldiers and armoured vehicles entered the northeastern city of Kharkiv and firing and explosions could be heard, witnesses said. A burning tank was visible in a video posted by the government.

Ukraine's fighters repelled the attack, according to authorities in the city, the country's second largest with a population of about 1.4 million people.

""Control over Kharkiv is completely ours! The armed forces, the police, and the defence forces are working, and the city is being completely cleansed of the enemy,"" regional Governor Oleh Sinegubov said.

Reuters was unable to immediately corroborate the information.

The Russian troops blew up a natural gas pipeline in Kharkiv before daybreak, a Ukrainian state agency said, sending a burning cloud up into the darkness.

Both Ukraine's gas pipeline operator and Kremlin-controlled energy giant Gazprom said the transit of Russian gas via Ukraine, vital for Europe's energy needs, was unaffected.

Ukraine's Western allies ratcheted up their response to Russia's land, sea and air invasion with an almost blanket ban on Russian airlines using European airspace.

'NO OTHER ANSWER'

Germany will ramp up spending on defence to more than 2% of its economic output in response to the invasion, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, a turnaround after keeping military spending low for decades in light of the country's bloody 20th century history and the resulting pacifism among its population.

""There could be no other answer to Putin's aggression,"" Scholz told lawmakers, a day after Germany agreed to send defensive anti-tank weapons, surface-to-air missiles and ammunition to Ukraine, jettisoning its previous refusal to deliver weapons to conflict zones.

In the strongest economic sanctions yet on Moscow, the United States and Europe said late on Saturday they would banish major Russian banks from the main global payments system and announced other measures aimed at limiting Moscow's use of a $630 million war chest of central bank reserves.

Ukrainian forces were also holding off Russian troops advancing on the capital Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. But shelling hit civilian infrastructure and targets including ambulances, he said.

""We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on,"" Zelenskiy said in a video message from the streets of Kyiv posted on his social media.

Russian missiles found their mark overnight, including a strike that set an oil terminal ablaze in Vasylkiv, southwest of Kyiv, the town's mayor said. Blasts sent huge flames and billowing black smoke into the night sky, online posts showed.

Russian-backed separatists in the eastern province of Luhansk said a Ukrainian missile had blown up an oil terminal in the town of Rovenky.

A U.S. defence official on Saturday said Ukraine's forces were putting up ""viable"" resistance to Russia's advance.

CASUALTIES RISE

Ignoring weeks of frantic diplomacy and sanctions threats by Western nations seeking to avoid war, Putin has justified the invasion saying ""neo-Nazis"" rule Ukraine and threaten Russia's security - a charge Kyiv and Western governments say is baseless propaganda.

Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, won independence from Moscow in 1991 at the fall of the Soviet Union and has pushed to join the NATO Western military alliance and the EU, goals Russia opposes.

Putin has said he must eliminate what he calls a serious threat to his country from its smaller neighbour, accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine - something Kyiv and its Western allies reject as a lie.

The Kremlin sent a diplomatic delegation to neighbouring Belarus offering talks, but Ukraine rejected the offer.

Russian troops are believed to have entered Ukraine from Belarus, a close ally of Moscow. Ukraine was happy to hold talks elsewhere, Zelenskiy said. read more

At least 198 Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed in Russia's invasion, the head of Ukraine's Health Ministry was quoted as saying.

A United Nations agency reported 64 civilian deaths and a Ukrainian presidential adviser said about 3,500 Russian soldiers had been killed or wounded. Reuters was not able to verify the numbers. Western officials have said intelligence showed Russia suffering higher casualties than expected.

Russia has not released casualty figures and Reuters was unable to verify tolls or the precise picture on the ground.

REFUGEES FLEE FIGHTING

A U.N relief agency said more than 368,000 refugees, have crossed into neighbouring countries, clogging railways, roads and borders.

The United States and its allies have authorized more weapons transfers to help Ukraine fight and imposed a range of sanctions on Russia in response to the assault, which threatens to upend Europe's post-Cold War order.

On Saturday, they moved to block certain Russian banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system, making it harder for Russia to trade and for its companies to do business.

They also said they would impose restrictions on Russia's central bank to limit its ability to support the rouble and finance Putin's war effort.

""We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin,"" the leaders of the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada and the United States wrote.

They did not name the banks that would be expelled. An EU diplomat said some 70% of the Russian banking market would be affected. read more

Sanctions on Russia's central bank could limit Putin's use of the country's more than $630 billion in reserves, widely seen as insulating Russia from some economic harm.

The Kremlin said its troops were advancing again in all directions and Putin thanked Russia's special forces, singling out those who are ""heroically fulfilling their military duty"".

EU and Britain to freeze assets of Putin and Lavrov

KYIV, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Russian and Ukrainian governments on Friday signalled an openness to negotiations even as authorities in Kyiv urged citizens to help defend the capital from advancing Russian forces in the worst European security crisis in decades.

Ukraine and Russia will consult in coming hours on a time and place for talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's spokesman Sergii Nykyforov said on social media, offering the first glimmer of hope for diplomacy since the invasion began.

The Kremlin said earlier it offered to meet in the Belarusian capital Minsk after Ukraine expressed a willingness to discuss declaring itself a neutral country, but that Ukraine had proposed Warsaw as the venue. That, according to Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov, resulted in a ""pause"" in contacts.

""Ukraine was and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace,"" Nykyforov said in a post on Facebook. ""We agreed to the proposal of the President of the Russian Federation.""

But U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Russia's offer was an attempt to conduct diplomacy ""at the barrel of a gun"", and that President Vladimir Putin's military must stop bombing Ukraine if it was serious about negotiations.

The diplomatic overtures stood in stark contrast to events unfolding on the ground and Putin's harsh rhetoric against Ukrainian leaders, including a call for a coup by the country's military.

Kyiv residents were told by the defence ministry to make petrol bombs to repel the invaders, and on Friday evening witnesses reported hearing artillery rounds and intense gunfire from the western part of the city. The sound of frequent artillery fire, apparently some distance from the city center, continued in the early hours of Saturday.

Zelenskiy filmed himself with aides on the streets of the capital, vowing to defend Ukraine's independence.

""Tonight, they will launch an assault. All of us must understand what awaits us. We must withstand this night,"" he said in a video address posted to his Telegram channel. ""The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.""

Some families cowered in shelters after Kyiv was pounded on Thursday night by Russian missiles. Others tried desperately to get on packed trains headed west, some of the hundreds of thousands who have left their homes to find safety, according to the United Nations' aid chief.

After weeks of warnings from Western leaders, Putin unleashed a three-pronged invasion of Ukraine from the north, east and south on Thursday, in an attack that threatened to upend Europe's post-Cold War order.

""I once again appeal to the military personnel of the armed forces of Ukraine: do not allow neo-Nazis and (Ukrainian radical nationalists) to use your children, wives and elders as human shields,"" Putin said at a televised meeting with Russia's Security Council on Friday. ""Take power into your own hands.""

Putin has cited the need to ""denazify"" Ukraine's leadership as one of his main reasons for invasion, accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss the accusations as baseless propaganda.

The United States imposed sanctions on Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov. The European Union and Britain earlier froze any assets Putin and Lavrov held in their territory. Canada took similar steps.

However, the steady ramping-up of economic restrictions has not deterred Putin.

Moscow said on Friday it had captured the Hostomel airfield northwest of the capital - a potential staging post for an assault on Kyiv that has been fought over since Russian paratroopers landed there in the first hours of the war. This could not be confirmed and Ukrainian authorities reported heavy fighting there.

Early on Saturday, Ukraine's air force command reported heavy fighting near the air base at Vasylkiv southwest of Kyiv, which it said was under attack from Russian paratroopers. It also said one of its fighters had shot down a Russian transport plane. Reuters could not independently verify the claims.

The mayor of Kyiv and its 3 million people, former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said on Friday Russian saboteurs had already entered the city. ""The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us,"" he said.

'GLORY TO OUR DEFENDERS'

In New York, Russia vetoed a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would have deplored Moscow's invasion, while China abstained, a move Western countries viewed as proof of Russia's isolation. The United Arab Emirates and India also abstained while the remaining 11 members voted in favor. read more

Amid the chaos of war, a picture of what was happening on the ground across Ukraine - the second largest country in Europe after Russia itself - was slow to emerge.

Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter that there had been heavy fighting with deaths at the entrance to the eastern cities of Chernihiv and Melitopol, as well as at Hostomel.

""Glory to our defenders, both male and female, glory to Ukraine,"" he said, flanked by the prime minister and advisors in a video posted to confirm he was in the capital.

Witnesses said they had heard explosions and gunfire near the airport in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, close to Russia's border. Ukraine's military said Russian troops had been stopped with heavy losses near the northeastern city of Konotop.

Britain's defence ministry said Russian armoured forces had opened a new route of advance towards the capital after failing to take Chernihiv.

Ukraine said more than 1,000 Russian soldiers had been killed so far. Russia did not release casualty figures.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart and condemned reported civilian deaths, including those of Ukrainian children, in attacks around Kyiv, the State Department said. read more

United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said hundreds of thousands of people were on the move in Ukraine.

The White House asked Congress for $6.4 billion in security and humanitarian aid for the crisis, officials said. read more

Ukraine has banned men of fighting age from leaving, and at borders with Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia, those seen crossing by Reuters journalists were mostly women and children.

White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the coordinated decision to sanction Putin - something U.S. President Joe Biden had avoided until now - was intended to send a clear message of allied unity. read more

Russia's foreign ministry said the new sanctions reflected the West's ""absolute impotence,"" the RIA news agency reported.

Western countries have announced a barrage of sanctions on Russia, including blacklisting its banks and banning technology exports. But they have so far stopped short of forcing it out of the SWIFT system for international bank payments.

On Friday, European soccer's governing body moved May's Champions League final from St Petersburg to Paris, and Formula One cancelled this year's Russian Grand Prix. The European Broadcasting Union shut Russia out of the widely watched Eurovision Song Contest for 2022. read more

'BURN IN HELL'

U.S. officials believe Russia's initial aim is to ""decapitate"" Zelenskiy's government.

Putin says Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, is an illegitimate state carved out of Russia, a view Ukrainians see as aimed at erasing their more than thousand-year history.

He says he does not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and remove its leaders, but it is not clear how a pro-Russian leader could be installed unless Russian troops control much of the country.

Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and Kyiv hopes to join NATO and the EU - aspirations that infuriate Moscow.

As air raid sirens wailed over Kyiv for a second day, some residents sheltered in underground metro stations.

Windows were blasted out of a 10-storey apartment block near the main airport. ""How can we be living through this in our time? Putin should burn in hell along with his whole family,"" said Oxana Gulenko, sweeping broken glass from her room.

Hundreds crowded into a cramped shelter beneath one building after a televised warning of air strikes.

""How can you wage a war against peaceful people?"" said Viktoria, 35, as her children aged 5 and 7 slept in their winter coats.

Western allies to kick major Russia banks off SWIFT system

Russia says its forces advancing 'on all sides'

KYIV, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Western allies announced sweeping new sanctions against Moscow on Saturday, including kicking key Russian banks off the main global payments system, as a defiant President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces were repelling Russian troops advancing on Kyiv.

Seeking to ratchet up economic punishment for Russian President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine, the United States and its European partners also said they would impose restrictions on Russia's central bank to limit its ability to support the rouble and finance his war effort.

The announcement came as fighting continued across Ukraine. Reuters witnesses in Kyiv reported occasional blasts and gunfire in the city on Saturday evening, but it was not clear exactly where it was coming from. The capital and other cities have been pounded by Russian artillery and cruise missiles.

Putin launched what he called a special military operation on Thursday, ignoring weeks of Western warnings and saying the ""neo-Nazis"" ruling Ukraine threatened Russia's security - a charge Kyiv and Western governments say is baseless propaganda.

Russia's assault is the biggest on a European state since World War Two and threatens to upend the continent's post-Cold War order.

A U.S. defence official said Ukraine's forces were putting up ""very determined resistance"" to the three-pronged Russian advance that has sent hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing westwards, clogging major highways and railway lines.

""As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies,"" the Western allies said as they escalated their punitive response.

""We will implement these measures within the coming days,"" according to a joint statement from the United States, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Britain and the European Commission. read more

After initially shying away from such a move largely because of concern about the impact on their own economies, the allies said they committed to ""ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system."" They did not name the banks that would be expelled but an EU diplomat said some 70% of the Russian banking market would be affected.

The move - which the French finance minister had earlier called a ""financial nuclear weapon"" because of the damage it would inflict on the Russian economy - deals a blow to Russia's trade and makes it harder for its companies to do business.

SWIFT, or the ""Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication"", is a secure messaging network that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making it a crucial mechanism for international trade.

Sanctions on Russia's central bank could limit Putin's use of his more than $630 billion in international reserves, widely seen as insulating Russia from some economic harm.

The new measures will prevent Russia from ""using its war chest,"" according to Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive.

'THE FIGHTING GOES ON'

Clay Lowery, executive vice president for the Institute of International Finance, said the new sanctions ""will most likely exacerbate ongoing bank runs and dollarization, causing a sharp sell-off, and a drain on reserves.""

But because Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, new sanctions imposed on them, such as cutting them off from SWIFT, could have a spillover effect, hurting trading partners in Europe and elsewhere.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said in a Twitter post early on Sunday: ""Thanks to our friends ... for the commitment to remove several Russian banks from SWIFT.""

The Kremlin said its troops were advancing again ""in all directions"" after Putin ordered a pause on Friday. Ukraine's government said there had been no pause.

""We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on,"" Zelenskiy said in a video message from the streets of Kyiv posted on his social media.

The crisis has galvanised the NATO Western military alliance, which has announced a series of moves to reinforce its eastern flank. While NATO has said it will not deploy troops to Ukraine, a string of countries are sending military aid.

U.S. President Joe Biden approved the release of up to $350 million worth of weapons from U.S. stocks, while Germany, in a shift from its long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones, said it would send anti-tank weapons and surface-to-air missiles. read more

Amid a barrage of cyberattacks blamed on Moscow, Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said his government will create an ""IT army"" to fight back. Kyiv already has quietly called on its hacker underground to help against Russian forces, Reuters exclusively reported. read more

Fedorov also called on Saturday on SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk to provide Ukraine with the company's Starlink satellite broadband service. Musk responded on Twitter: ""Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route."" read more

Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, won independence from Moscow in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union and wants to join NATO and the EU, goals Russia opposes.

Putin has said he must eliminate what he calls a serious threat to his country from its smaller neighbour, accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine - something Kyiv and its Western allies reject as a lie.

A Ukrainian presidential adviser said about 3,500 Russian soldiers had been killed or wounded. Western officials have also said intelligence showed Russia suffering higher casualties than expected and its advance slowing.

Russia has not released casualty figures and it was impossible to verify tolls or the precise picture on the ground.

""We know that (Russian forces) have not made the progress that they wanted to make, particularly in the north. They have been frustrated by what they have seen is a very determined resistance,"" the U.S. official said, without providing evidence.

Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said there was no major Russian military presence in the capital but that saboteur groups were active. Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, later told Germany's Bild tabloid the city was ""nearly encircled"".

Authorities have handed thousands of assault rifles to residents and told citizens to make petrol bombs.

At least 198 Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed and 1,115 people wounded so far, Interfax quoted Ukraine's Health Ministry as saying.

Interfax later cited the regional administration in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, saying 17 civilians had been killed and 73 wounded by Russian shelling.

Moscow says it is taking care not to hit civilian sites.

U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said more than 150,000 Ukrainian refugees have crossed into neighbouring countries - half to Poland and many to Hungary, Moldova and Romania.

Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces had captured Melitopol, a city of 150,000 in southeastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials did not comment and Britain cast doubt on the report.

If confirmed, it would be the first significant population centre the Russians have seized.

Several European countries, including Russia's Baltic neighbours Lithuania and Latvia, said they were closing their airspace to Russian airliners. read more Germany said it was preparing to follow suit.

KYIV/MOSCOW, Feb 27 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert on Sunday in the face of a barrage of Western reprisals for his war on Ukraine, which said it had repelled Russian ground forces attacking its biggest cities.

The United States said Putin was escalating the war with ""dangerous rhetoric"", amid signs that the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two was not producing rapid victories, but instead generating a far-reaching and concerted Western response.

Less than four days after it started, the invasion has triggered a Western political, strategic, economic and corporate response unprecedented in its extent and coordination.

Putin, who has called the invasion a ""special operation"", thrust an alarming new element into play when he ordered Russia's ""deterrence forces"" - which wield nuclear weapons - onto high alert.

He has justified the invasion by saying ""neo-Nazis"" rule Ukraine and threaten Russia's security - a charge Kyiv and Western governments say is baseless propaganda.

On Sunday, he cited aggressive statements by NATO leaders and the raft of economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the West.

""Not only do Western countries take unfriendly measures against our country in the economic dimension - I mean the illegal sanctions that everyone knows about very well - but also the top officials of leading NATO countries allow themselves to make aggressive statements with regards to our country,"" he said on state television.

Putin previously referred to his nuclear arsenal in a speech announcing the start of the invasion on Thursday, saying Russia's response to any country that stood in its way would be immediate and carry ""consequences that you have never encountered in your history"".

The EU's Borrell said Russia had clearly threatened a nuclear attack on countries supporting Ukraine after the invasion. ""We are afraid that Russia is not going to stop in Ukraine,"" he said.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, at the U.N. Security Council, urged ""Russia to tone down this dangerous rhetoric regarding nuclear weapons.""

A Ukrainian state news agency said that Russian troops had blown up a natural gas pipeline in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, sending a burning cloud into the sky.

Soon after, Russian armour rolled into Kharkiv, in northwest Ukraine, and witnesses reported firing and explosions. But city authorities said the attack had been repelled.

Reuters was unable to corroborate the information.

Ukrainian forces also appeared to be holding off Russian troops advancing on Kyiv but the Ukrainian armed forces described Sunday as ""a difficult time"", saying Russian troops ""continue shelling in almost all directions"".

Satellite imagery released by the private Maxar Technologies taken on Sunday showed a 5 km (3.25 mile) long convoy of Russian ground forces including tanks approximately 40 miles (64 km) away heading towards Kyiv. Reuters could not independently verify the images.

""We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on,"" Zelenskiy said in the latest of several video messages from the streets of Kyiv. read more

President Vladimir Putin may still seek some form of control over the entire country, they said, as he strives to stop Ukraine ever joining NATO. He is also not guaranteed victory. A senior U.S. defence official said on Friday that Russia was facing more resistance than it expected, not least in its advance on Kyiv.

The tactics of the advancing Russian troops point to a “flanking movement” from Ukraine’s weakest points - its northern border with Belarus, and in the south Crimea, which Russian annexed eight years ago, with its huge naval base.

Such a strategy, if successful, could allow Moscow to control eastern Ukraine including its seaboard directly while reducing western Ukraine to a vassal state, and in turn reduce the financial costs of a long-term occupation, experts say.

“I think that now they (the Russians) are aiming at creating a land bridge all the way to Moldova,” said Konrad Muzyka, director of the Poland-based Rochan consultancy.

Russian tanks and forces began their invasion on Thursday through the eastern Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, and from the south in Tavriya, while missile strikes and bombing from Belarus began an advance towards Kyiv from the north, according to the Ukrainian military.

According to a Ukrainian defence ministry broadcast posted on Facebook on Thursday, military movements so far suggest that the Kremlin’s goal is to “block Kyiv, create a land corridor to the occupied Crimean peninsula and self-proclaimed Transnistria”.

In 2014, Russia not only seized Crimea but also backed rebels who set up separatist administrations in Donetsk and Luhansk, in the largely Russian-speaking Donbass region of eastern Ukraine.

It also has troops in Transnistria, a Russian-speaking breakaway province of Moldova.

Joerg Forbrig, at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, said Russian troops could “try to gain control of a very large part of Ukraine, which will include those territories that would make a land corridor between the between the three territories they control already”.

‘UKRAINIANS WOULD RESIST’

Ukraine’s armed forces have so far denied Putin a rapid advance on Kyiv. “As long as the Russians don’t have control of the airspace, they won’t be able really to make their armoured thrust into Ukraine count,” said Jamie Shea, a former NATO official now at the Friends of Europe think-tank.

Russian missiles pounded Kyiv on Friday. Moscow claimed to have captured the Hostomel airfield northwest of the capital, a potential staging post for an assault on Kyiv.

U.S. officials believe Russia’s initial aim is to topple Ukraine’s pro-Western president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

“Putin doesn’t want Donbass or Donetsk – he wants all of Ukraine, but he does not have to occupy the entire country to reach that goal. He will aim to decapitate the Ukrainian state,” said retired German general Hans-Lothar Domroese.

Defence experts pointed to the huge expense for Russia of a military campaign in Ukraine, a former Soviet state of 44 million people slightly smaller than Texas.

“The Soviet Union spent so much money having its troops in eastern Europe, and they were they were willing participants as communist regimes. Ukrainians would resist any Russian government,” said Elisabeth Braw at the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington.

It is also unclear how a protracted war with many Russian casualties would be perceived at home, even when Putin does not tolerate dissent. Police detained more than 1,800 anti-war protesters across Russia on Thursday.

Putin could seek an arrangement for western Ukraine - where most people speak Ukrainian rather than Russian as their first language - similar to the one Moscow has with Belarus, where Russia has helped long-time president Alexander Lukashenko suppress opposition and dissent.

Carlo Masala, professor for International Politics at Bundeswehr University Munich, said Russia had so far not tried to send troops to western Ukraine in numbers.

“The Russian military build-up, no matter if it is 160,000 or 200,000 troops, is not enough to occupy Ukraine for any long period of time,” he said.

“I am still sure that Putin’s main goal is seizing Donbass ... and a land corridor to Crimea, splitting these areas off from Ukraine and establishing a tame government in Kyiv.”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-military-analys-idCAKBN2KU2HS

The G-7 leading industrial nations are the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, Germany and Japan. A meeting of the leaders of those countries, along with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel concluded before 10:30 a.m. ET.

Read the full statement below:

We the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) are appalled by and condemn the large-scale military aggression by the Russian Federation against the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, directed partly from Belarusian soil.

This unprovoked and completely unjustified attack on the democratic state of Ukraine was preceded by fabricated claims and unfounded allegations. It constitutes a serious violation of international law and a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and all commitments Russia entered in the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris and its commitments in the Budapest Memorandum. We as the G7 are bringing forward severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions. We call on all partners and members of the international community to condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms, to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, and raise their voice against this blatant violation of the fundamental principles of international peace and security.

This crisis is a serious threat to the rules-based international order, with ramifications well beyond Europe. There is no justification for changing internationally recognised borders by force. This has fundamentally changed the Euro-Atlantic security situation. President Putin has re-introduced war to the European continent. He has put himself on the wrong side of history.

We are committed to uphold peace, stability and international law. We are united in our support for the people of Ukraine and its democratically elected government. In this dark hour our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine. We stand ready to support with humanitarian assistance in order to mitigate the suffering, including for refugees and displaced persons from the Russian aggression.

We call on the Russian Federation to stop the bloodshed, to immediately de-escalate and to withdraw its forces from Ukraine. We also call on Russia to ensure the safety of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. We also condemn the involvement of Belarus in this aggression against Ukraine and call on Belarus to abide by its international obligations.

We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russian President Putin's decision on February 21 to recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk self-declared entities in eastern Ukraine as ""independent"" states as well as his decision to send Russian military forces into these regions. We call on other states not to follow Russia's illegal decision to recognise the proclaimed independence of these entities. The decision by President Putin is a grave violation of the basic principles enshrined in the UN Charter, in particular the respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states and also a blatant breach of UN Security Council resolution 2202 – supported by the Russian Federation as a permanent member of the Security Council – as well as of the Minsk agreements, which stipulate the return of the areas concerned to the control of the Ukrainian Government.

We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders and territorial waters as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future and security arrangements. We reaffirm that illegally occupied Crimea and the self-declared ""people's republics"" are an integral part of Ukraine.

We condemn President Putin for his consistent refusal to engage in a diplomatic process to address questions pertaining to European security, despite our repeated offers. We stand united with partners, including NATO, the EU and their member states as well as Ukraine and remain determined to do what is necessary to preserve the integrity of the rules-based international order. In this regard, we are also closely monitoring global oil and gas market conditions, including in the context of Russia's further military aggression against Ukraine. We support consistent and constructive engagement and coordination among major energy producers and consumers toward our collective interest in the stability of global energy supplies, and stand ready to act as needed to address potential disruptions.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/24/ukraine-russia-news-vladimir-putin-orders-attack-as-explosions-are-reported.html

Two separate Russian missile attacks on oil and gas facilities in northern Ukraine late Saturday caused massive explosions and fires that could easily become environmental catastrophes, according to Ukrainian officials in the cities impacted by the blasts.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, Russian troops fired a missile that hit a major gas pipeline late Saturday night, local officials said. The resulting blast was so massive that it prompted the government to specifically caution residents that what they had seen was not a nuclear bomb.

""This is NOT a nuclear strike, although the explosion is visually similar to it,"" the Kharkiv government Telegram channel warned, according to an NBC translation of the message.

The channel advised residents to close their windows, purify the air if possible and prepare to wear wet masks if they smelled smoke.

Around 250 miles west of Kharkiv, the same advisory was issued to residents in and near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv after Russian troops blew up a fuel tank in Vasylkiv.

According to the regional governor of the state where Kyiv is located, the missile attack cut off Vasylkiv's gas supply and caused a fire so large that it could be seen 15 miles away in the capital. Fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces prevented first responders from extinguishing the fire, the governor said in a Telegram post.

""This night, the occupiers are causing man-made disasters,"" said the local government of Kharkiv.

The attacks on the fuel lines came as invading Russian troops encountered resistance Saturday and early Sunday from the Ukrainian military, which managed to hold all three of the cities Moscow had targeted: Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson.

U.S. officials said Saturday they believe Russian President Vladimir Putin was unprepared for the tenacity of Ukraine's military response.

They said Putin was mistakenly convinced that Ukraine's military would collapse within hours of a Russian invasion, and its president Volodomyr Zelenskyy would flee. Neither of these happened.

Russia has launched a full-scale military attack on Ukraine that opened with air and missile attacks on Ukrainian military facilities before troops and tanks rolled across the borders from the north, east and south.

The Ukrainian military has fought back on multiple fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address early on Friday that 137 people, both servicemen and civilians, have been killed and hundreds more wounded.

A senior United States defence official said Russia may be intent on seizing Kyiv, the capital, and other key cities and ultimately installing a more friendly government.

As Ukrainian forces fought back and civilians piled into trains and cars to flee, the US and European leaders rushed to punish Russia with strong financial sanctions. NATO moved to strengthen its eastern flank.





Key recent developments:

Missiles hit the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, as Russian forces press their advance

Top Ukrainian official says Russian forces will enter areas just outside Kyiv later on Friday, even though Ukrainian units were defending positions on four fronts despite being outnumbered

Ukrainian forces downed an aircraft over Kyiv, which then crashed into a residential building, a government adviser said.

Zelenskyy pleads with the international community to do more, saying sanctions announced so far were not enough

Ukraine’s nuclear agency says it was recording increased radiation levels from the site of the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which has been captured by Russian forces.

Here is what we know about the conflict so far:

Putin makes his move

In a televised address as the attack began, Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for almost eight years.

The Russian leader warned other countries that any attempt to interfere in Ukraine would “lead to consequences you have never seen in history”.

Putin accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to block Ukraine from ever joining NATO and offer Moscow security guarantees.

Putin said Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but plans to “demilitarise” it, a euphemism for destroying its armed forces. He urged Ukrainian servicemen to “immediately put down arms and go home”.

Soon after his address, explosions were heard in the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. The Russian Defence Ministry said it had destroyed 83 Ukrainian military facilities.

Zelenskyy responds to Russian attack

Ukraine’s president urged residents to remain calm and stay at home, and pleaded with world leaders to punish Putin with even more severe sanctions.

He promised that Ukraine will defend itself and ordered a full military mobilisation. Ukraine’s army stands at 250,000 service members with 140,000 reservists. The US said Russia had nearly 200,000 troops arrayed near Ukraine’s borders before the invasion began.

Zelenskyy said he has information that he is the No. 1 target for the invading Russians, but he is determined to remain in Kyiv.

An uneasy night in Kyiv

By Thursday evening, many of the capital’s residents took shelter deep underground in metro stations. People brought sleeping bags and blankets, dogs and crossword puzzles to pass an uneasy night in the makeshift bomb shelters.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko had called on the city’s three million people to stay indoors unless they worked in critical sectors and said everyone should prepare go-bags with necessities such as medicine and documents.

Chernobyl in Russian hands

Ukraine said it lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site after Ukrainian forces waged a fierce battle with Russian troops. A nuclear reactor at the plant 130km (81 miles) north of Kyiv exploded in April 1986, sending a radioactive cloud across Europe. The damaged reactor was later covered by a protective shell.

Alyona Shevtsova, an adviser to the commander of Ukraine’s Ground Forces, wrote on Facebook that the staff had been “taken hostage” when Russian troops seized the facility.

The White House press secretary expressed alarm, saying it could hamper efforts to maintain the nuclear facility.

The West decries attack

World leaders decried an invasion that could cause extensive casualties, topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government and threaten the post-Cold War balance.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called Russia’s attack “a brutal act of war” and said Moscow had shattered peace on the European continent.

US President Joe Biden said Putin “has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering”.

The leaders of the Group of Seven called on the international community “to condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms, to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, and raise their voice against this blatant violation of the fundamental principles of international peace and security”.

The head of the UN refugee agency urged neighbouring countries to keep their borders open for Ukrainians fleeing the fighting. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said his agency had stepped up its operations and capacity in both Ukraine and its neighbours.

Sanctions on Russia

In announcing a new round of sanctions on Thursday, Biden said the US and its allies will block the assets of four large Russian banks, impose export controls and sanction oligarchs.

The penalties fall in line with the White House’s insistence that it would look to hit Russia’s financial system and Putin’s inner circle while also imposing export controls that would aim to starve Russia’s industries and military of US semiconductors and other high-tech products.

New US sanctions also focused on the military and financial institutions of Belarus, which Russia is using as a staging ground for its troops moving into Ukraine from the north.

United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would aim to cut Russia off from the UK’s financial market.

The sanctions include freezing the assets of all big Russian banks, including VTB Bank, its second-biggest. The UK also plans to bar Russian companies and the Russian government from raising money on its markets.

The UK will ban the export of a wide range of high-tech products, including semiconductors, to Russia and bar its flagship airline, Aeroflot, from landing at UK airports.

The European Union and other Western allies, including Australia, Japan and South Korea, announced similar sanctions.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/25/russia-ukraine-crisis-what-we-know-so-far
