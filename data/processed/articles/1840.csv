During an hour-long phone call with the Russian president, Stoere said he urged Putin to end the war in Ukraine, pull out Russian troops and enable humanitarian access.

“We have very limited expectations of what could be achieved, but nothing should be left untried in the situation we are now in,” Stoere said.

Commenting on their discussions about the need for humanitarian access to civilians in the port city of Mariupol, Stoere said: “My impression is that he confirms Russia’s intention to contribute to that.”

Stoere added, however, that only actions on the ground could tell whether Russia delivers on the promises or not.

The Russian ministry asked Kyiv to guarantee the ""unconditional respect"" for the ceasefire through written notification to the Russian side, the UNHCR and ICRC before 6am (03:00 GMT) Thursday.

6:30am: US, UK say fearful advisors misled Putin on Ukraine war

President Vladimir Putin is being misled by fearful advisors as his Ukraine invasion goes awry, with mutinous Russian troops sabotaging equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft, US and British intelligence agencies say.

The close allies, whose spies have played up Russia's failures and highlighted Kremlin divisions, said Putin's advisors were ""too afraid"" to tell him the full truth about battlefield reverses and the real impact of sanctions.

Hours after the White House released its withering intelligence assessment, Britain's GCHQ spy agency chief Jeremy Fleming said Thursday that the Russian leader had overestimated his military's ability to secure a rapid victory.

""We've seen Russian soldiers – short of weapons and morale – refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,"" Fleming said in a prepared speech to the Australian National University in Canberra.

""And even though Putin's advisors are afraid to tell him the truth, what's going on and the extent of these misjudgements must be crystal clear to the regime.""

1,2ffdc04a-8165-46cc-8a74-9cd7c063894b,['Jon Henley'],2022-03-31 00:00:00,"Peace negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv will resume on Friday, a senior Ukrainian official has said, amid mounting western scepticism about Russia’s intentions in the talks more than five weeks into its invasion of Ukraine.

A Ukrainian negotiator, David Arakhamia, said on Thursday that talks would continue by video, focusing on the peace framework the Ukrainian side presented during a face-to-face meeting in Istanbul this week that Moscow described as constructive.

Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow would not refuse a separate meeting between the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, providing the talks between them were “substantive”.

Kyiv and its allies have cast doubts, however, on Russia’s commitment to talks, noting there had been no real sign of the partial military pullback in northern Ukraine it had promised as a goodwill gesture and suggesting the Kremlin may be playing for time.

Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, further upped the diplomatic stakes, signing a decree requiring foreign buyers to pay in roubles for Russian gas from Friday or see their energy contracts halted – a demand Germany, France and the UK instantly rejected and that Berlin described as blackmail.

Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said Turkey’s aim was to bring Lavrov and Kuleba together for further talks. “There could be a higher-level meeting, at least at the level of foreign ministers, within a week or two weeks,” he said. “What matters is that the two sides come together and agree on a lasting ceasefire.” He added that “significant progress” had been made but conceded that some may have been “tactical manoeuvring” and little had changed on the ground.

Arakhamia praised the role of the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich in the peace talks, saying he had initially acted as an “unofficial back-channel of communication” and was now trying to act more as a neutral mediator between the two sides.

Çavuşoğlu also said the former Chelsea football club owner was “playing a useful role”, while the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said Abramovich plainly had Putin’s trust and was “sincerely trying” to end the conflict.

However, the Kremlin has already rejected some key elements of Ukraine’s peace proposals and Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, said on Thursday that Putin had told him in a telephone conversation that “conditions were not yet mature” for a ceasefire. “In Putin’s opinion, there have been some small steps ahead in the negotiations,” Draghi said. “We all want to see a ray of light … There is a desire to move forward soon, but it is also too soon to overcome scepticism.”

Western analysts and diplomats, including in the US and UK, have said the Kremlin may be using talk of de-escalation as a ploy while regrouping and resupplying its forces in order to redeploy them for a more aggressive offensive in eastern Ukraine.

Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said on Thursday alliance intelligence indicated Moscow was not scaling back military operations in the north, but instead redeploying forces to join attacks in Ukraine’s contested eastern Donbas region held by pro-Russian separatists.

0 Ukraine: drone footage shows before war and after the invasion – video

Kyiv’s chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, has insisted, however, that the Kremlin was considering Ukraine’s proposals, which included an international treaty under which Ukraine would remain neutral, with its security guaranteed by third countries.

The proposals, intended to come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, include a 15-year consultation period on the status of the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine and annexed in 2014.

Podolyak said a draft agreement could be signed in the next few days, paving the way for a meeting between the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Putin. Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, also hinted progress looked possible.

In speeches to the Dutch and Australian parliaments, meanwhile, Zelenskiy on Thursday asked for more weapons and aid and a complete halt to business with Russia, saying failure to halt Moscow’s aggression would encourage others to follow suit.

“Stronger sanctions are needed so that Russia doesn’t have a chance to pursue this war further in Europe,” the Ukrainian president told Dutch MPs via a video link. “Stop all trade with Russia.” Energy imports from Russia must be halted “so that you do not pay billions for the war”.

Referring to the international war crimes courts in The Hague, Zelenskiy called for justice. “Those who gave the orders to bombard and shell Ukraine must be called to account. In The Hague, city of tribunals, people know that,” he said.

To Australia’s parliament, Zelenskiy said Russia must be held accountable. “If we don’t stop Russia now, if we don’t hold Russia accountable, then some other countries of the world … will decide that such things are possible for them as well,” he said.

The Ukrainian leader repeated his call for tougher sanctions, accusing Moscow of “nuclear blackmailing” to limit the global response to the invasion, which has cut out Russia from much international trade through unprecedented sanctions.

The European development bank said on Thursday it expected the Russian economy to contract by 10% this year and Ukraine’s by 20%, calling the war between the two countries “the greatest supply shock” for 50 years.

“This is a war of aggression by the Russian leadership, by President Putin that has left millions of people displaced, homeless; has targeted civilians, hospitals and other innocent people across Ukraine,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference on Friday.

“We know who the aggressor is; that is President Putin and Russia. And beyond that, I do not have any comment on military tactics,” she said.

The official, however, refrained from commenting on the Russian statement that an apparent attack by Ukraine on one of its fuel depots is making it harder for Russia to stay engaged in the talks to end the war.

“We have seen those reports. We are not in a position to comment on the Kremlin’s statements. I would note Ukraine has not made any statements or confirmation of these reports,” she said.

“I would also note that this is a war that President Putin started -- a brutal war with Russia's forces continuing to bombard cities across Ukraine and commit terrible acts of violence. We have seen the people of Ukraine fight valiantly in the face of unprovoked Russian brutality, but there is one aggressor here, and that is President Putin and the Russian military at his direction,” Psaki said.

In Tampa for the Central Command change of command ceremony, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Putin’s invasion of his sovereign neighbour is unprovoked and unjust.

“And the Ukrainians are fighting bravely to defend their lives, democracy, and their freedom,” he said.

Earlier, Secretary of State Tony Blinken spoke with his British counterpart Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss, during which the two diplomats emphasised the continued importance of transatlantic unity to support Ukraine, and coordinate further swift and consequential actions against those who support Putin’s war of choice on Ukraine.

“The two discussed the upcoming NATO Foreign Ministerial meeting and developing additional possible actions to ratchet up our response to Putin’s continued assault on the Ukrainian people,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said.

But now the potential consequences, given the advent of nuclear weapons, are even graver. Vladimir Putin, the despot, appears to be stymied as his forces wither at the gates of Kyiv. Mussolini, a frustrated dictator, resorted to the barbarism of chemical weapons in 1936 to achieve what he could not gain by other means. As history rhymes, we can anticipate Putin also escalating his aggression through continued attacks on civilians, perhaps resorting to the use of chemical or even tactical nuclear weapons.

Nearly 86 years later, history is rhyming. The world, through 21st-century information technology, now views a war of conquest in Europe in near real time. Russia’s war in Ukraine has upended a world order established in the wake of a worldwide conflict and designed to prevent wars of conquest and to prevent one dictator from attempting to shift the boundaries of nations at his own whim. Again, factions are forming—either in support of the aggressor state, led by a despot who stands in opposition to basic human rights, or in favor of the established order that obligates nations to refrain from wars of conquest.

On June 30, 1936, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia appeared before an international body charged with maintaining world peace and providing a forum for resolving international disputes. In Geneva, Haile Selassie pleaded for his people before the world’s mightiest nations—collectively, the League of Nations—to prevent further destruction by a power bent on a war of conquest, Benito Mussolini’s fascist Italy. Haile Selassie’s beleaguered forces continued to fight against a better armed, more powerful foe. The assembled nations listened and sympathized but ultimately took no action in collective security to stop the war. Some nations sympathetic to Italy, the aggressor, because of ideological alignment and opposition to the then-existing world order, balked at unified action to stop the war. Three years after Haile Selassie’s address, with the League of Nations proven incapable of preventing state aggression, the world was at war. The same sides that aligned in favor of and against Italy became pitted against each other. The cost in lives grew from tens of thousands in 1936 to tens of millions by 1945.

As history rhymes, we can anticipate Putin also escalating his aggression through continued attacks on civilians, perhaps resorting to the use of chemical or even tactical nuclear weapons.

Putin will do this and anything else in order to survive. No matter the cost, he must save face and claim victory—or face his own people not as a strongman but a featherweight. Even as his maximalist goals of gorging on all of Ukraine are now shattered, he will seek to bring Ukraine to terms and seize territory to claim victory. The Ukrainians, after their sacrifice, will come to terms only if the cost becomes unbearable. The consequence of ceding even one additional inch of Ukraine in a war of aggression like this is dire. Granting Putin anything short of defeat reinforces the notion for tyrants that they can change borders by force if they are willing to pay a price in the lives of their own subjugated masses. Tyrants will make this choice every time for their own interests.

There are a number of feasible off-ramps to this conflict. One idea is a negotiated armistice. An armistice would seek to suspend open hostilities, arrange for the release and repatriation of prisoners of war, and establish a separation of forces. The benefit of an armistice is that it freezes a conflict, pending future peace negotiations, without politically recognizing new boundaries. The boundaries would need to be negotiated. Additionally, an armistice may include a demilitarized zone (DMZ) to provide a buffer between forces. An armistice allows the parties to stop the bloodshed and save face without resolving the ultimate political issues. Outside powers can act as guarantors to effectively formalize a cease-fire and create a DMZ. Such an agreement allows one party to claim victory by stating the goals of a punitive expedition were achieved while the other can stop the bloodshed without recognizing any political demarcations.

Any real Putin victory that recognizes his gains means the demise of the post-World War II rules-based order and corrupts the value of the United Nations system. The United Nations’ purposes include maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations, and achieving international cooperation. The U.N. was meant to be a successor to the League, correcting its flaws. It hasn’t been perfect, but it has never been tested as it is now. How can the U.N. survive when one permanent member of the Security Council, charged with maintaining peace and security among countries, is the initiator of a war of aggression? The short answer is that it can’t in its current form.

A successor to the U.N. or a modified U.N. must follow this war. It must be an organization where one nation cannot escape accountability because it is in a special class. Tyrants and despots are watching this war and will learn what they can get away with. Other nations will draw lessons about giving up nuclear weapons. The stakes in the outcome of the present conflict cannot be overstated. Undoubtedly, the interest in ending the conflict and providing off-ramps is high. Policymakers will have to balance providing a face-saving exit for a nuclear-armed autocrat against saving the international rules-based system. They will need to be creative about ending the war and considerate of the lessons learned when shaping a successor organization or modified U.N. system. Whatever the new organization, a total veto by one special status state will be antithetical to the purpose of that body. There are many ideas on how to address this problem.

For instance, a mechanism to prevent a single member of a distinct class from thwarting the system is a veto override. This could be a supermajority override or nonunitary action requirement. Such a complex system would be designed to carefully balance the status of distinctively situated states against the need to prevent one outlier from wrecking the system. Within this construct, upon a veto, the other permanent or nonpermanent members of the council would call for a second to support the veto; if there is no second, then the veto is overridden. The veto override construct sets a high bar for overriding a member for the council but would moderate any extreme or fringe action when the outlier knows its power is not absolute. The principal purpose of such a system is to restrain the most extreme impulses of veto-holding members to prevent the most dangerous actions in violation of the basic principles of the U.N. Charter. This or any paradigm that prevents a unitary member from standing against the whole would be a vast improvement over the current system.

My service on the White House National Security Council, which focused, in part, on international organizations, helped me appreciate the value of international organizations. Ultimately, any body that seeks to uphold international norms must have the ability to hold all its members accountable should they violate international law. Putin’s actions, like Mussolini’s, have uncovered the failings of the U.N. If this body fails in crisis and cannot preserve order, it should fade into oblivion like the League of Nations.

4,2ffdc04a-8165-46cc-8a74-9cd7c063894b,[],,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just expanded on his proposal to halt Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine by offering to seek his country’s long-term security through a neutral status guaranteed by Russia, the United States and European nations. Zelenskyy's choice undercuts Russian President Vladimir Putin’s declared reason for war—to deny Ukraine its right to someday join the NATO alliance. The question now confronts Putin: Will he thus end his bloodshed? Or will he continue a war more truly based on his fear of allowing Russians to witness a free democracy of their fellow ethnic Slavs on Russia’s border?

In this week’s talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials signaled readiness to discuss neutrality for Ukraine similar to that established by Austria during the Cold War. Austria declared it would avoid any military alliance or the hosting of foreign military bases as the way to win Moscow’s agreement in 1955 for an end of the country’s occupation by Soviet, U.S., British and French forces after World War II. Ukraine’s proposal includes having the country maintain strong self-defense forces.

Bolstering Ukraine—and Peace for Europe

Ukraine would anchor this neutrality in treaty agreements under which a broad array of states would guarantee its security with a pledge to help in Ukraine’s defense if it were attacked again. These guarantors would include the five permanent U.N. Security Council members — the United States, Russia, France, China and Britain — as well as Germany, Poland, Turkey and Israel. The guarantors would accept a legally binding duty to send their own forces to defend Ukraine in case of attack — a requirement parallel to the mutual defense commitment among members of NATO.

Ukraine’s approach is sure to spark discussion among policymakers in all of these countries, especially as treaty commitments would have to be ratified by their legislatures. The proposal aims to add a NATO-like buttress — a vital brick in the structures of peace and security — at what is one of weakest spots in the security architectures in and around Europe. If only for that reason, policymakers focused on strategic security should give the idea serious consideration.

For many, the idea of U.S. and European security guarantees for Ukraine may feel difficult — or at least surprising, given how remote the notion would have been only weeks ago. But Putin changed the world on February 24 by launching Europe’s first war of aggrandizement since the era of Hitler and Stalin. Nations have united in a historic act of resistance to an aggression that threatens to undermine the international rule of law and return humanity to rule by blunt force. Just as the moral clarity of this war has led governments, businesses and public opinion to impose unprecedented sanctions and isolation against Russia, we will need to consider longer-term steps to strengthen the global institutions for peace that we began building after World War II.

As citizens and policymakers consider the Ukrainians’ request for broad-based security guarantees, we should note the historical lens through which Ukrainians now see this question: Following the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1992, Ukraine held the world’s third-largest arsenal of nuclear weapons. But it chose to secure its future by abjuring nuclear arms, allowing their removal to Russia and instead relying on security “assurances” provided by Russia, the United States and Britain in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Putin’s government invaded Ukraine less than 20 years later.

In offering his compromise, Zelenskyy is demanding a cease-fire by Russian forces and, he said in his March 27 interview with Russian journalists, the Russian troops’ return to the sections of Ukraine they occupied before February 24 — that is, Crimea and the southernmost part of the Donbas region. He also would submit this proposal, and any concession that required a change to Ukraine’s constitution, to a national referendum. To win an end to this war and a chance for Ukraine’s recovery without prejudicing Ukrainians’ insistence on the return of all Russian-seized territory, Zelenskyy’s team is proposing to separate and postpone for 15 years negotiations on what it calls “the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions and Crimea.”

The Risks of Putin Cornered

For at least three reasons, it remains unclear how serious is Putin’s current interest in real negotiations. First, his historical pattern is to seize all advantage he can by bluster, threat or assault against a weaker opponent — and only then to shift to talks in which he can hope to lock in those gains. So the seriousness of Russia’s negotiations will be set by the degree of Putin’s realization that he is losing, and cannot win, militarily.

Secondly, Russia’s representatives in talks, headed by a former culture minister, Vadim Medinsky, are effectively not as authoritative as their Ukrainian counterparts because they are not close to Putin as the Ukrainian team is to Zelenskyy. The Russian side in the talks so far has been less able to offer substantive positions.

Third, with Putin’s real impetus obscured beneath layers of propaganda and outright lies, it is unclear—perhaps even to him—just what mix of losses and deterrence may force his retreat to a real negotiation. Ukraine’s offer to build its future security outside of NATO responds to Putin’s loudest demand in his current assault. But Putin has made clear his determination to rule large swaths of Ukraine that he says “rightly” belong to Russia. And he has shown that he feels threatened by Ukraine’s decades-long evolution toward Europe and democracy, and away from Moscow-led authoritarianism.

Ukraine’s heroic defiance of Russia’s assault is gradually creating the military losses that are necessary for Putin to shift from warfare to negotiation. A lightning invasion that U.S. intelligence assessments say Putin expected to complete within 48 hours has now stalled for more than a month and killed thousands of Russian soldiers — about 10,000, by U.S. estimates. Military analysts who know Russia’s forces well note that Russia already has run out of sufficient contract soldiers, who are better trained, and is relying on conscripts who normally serve only for 12 months, who are more poorly trained — and who, by law, may not be sent to fight in wars abroad.

Still, U.S. officials’ warnings this week of tensions between the Russian president and his military and intelligence leaders underscore that Putin may still not grasp how badly his war is damaging Russia’s military and economy.

The assessment of when Putin is negotiating for real, and how far to trust him, will be up to Ukraine’s government. As Russian and Ukrainian negotiators met in Istanbul this week, Russian signals were inconclusive. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called Ukraine’s proposals “significant progress,” and Russian military officials said they were reducing their attacks on Kyiv and northeastern Ukraine. But, said Zelenskyy, “These signals do not silence the explosion of Russian shells.” Ukrainian officials and journalists report Russian attacks continuing.

To advance the hopes for truly substantive negotiations, democracies should sustain their financial support and defense supply lines for Ukraine’s self-protection, and their sanctions against Russia. Whenever Putin responds and full negotiations can begin, those supporting Ukraine’s fight on behalf of democracy and the rule of law will need to be ready to address Ukrainians’ longer-term needs for peacefully assuring their own security.",https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/03/ukraine-considers-neutrality-will-putin-respond
5,2ffdc04a-8165-46cc-8a74-9cd7c063894b,"['Zeeshan Aleem Is A Writer', 'Editor For Msnbc Daily. Previously', 'He Worked At Vox', 'Huffpost', 'Politico', 'He Has Also Been Published In The New York Times', 'The Atlantic', 'The Nation']",2022-04-01 15:29:01+00:00,"In an unscripted moment in mid-March, President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” in response to the way he’s waged war in Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made similar claims, telling reporters he believes Russian forces have committed war crimes based on reports of indiscriminate shelling and targeting of civilians.

The accusations were not made casually, and for good reason. They’ve framed Putin’s war as not just an act of aggression, but a distinctly wicked one, and they raise the possibility of legal action in the aftermath of the war.

On the other hand, the odds that Putin is at some point hauled before the International Criminal Court are slim. Given that reality, what is the purpose of branding him a war criminal? And what does it mean for the U.S., a country that refuses to become a member of the International Criminal Court and that human rights watchdogs have said has perpetrated many war crimes of its own in recent decades, to accuse another country of doing so?

There are proposals for a new Nuremberg: a standalone tribunal to try Putin and others for starting the war.

For more in-depth context, I called Samuel Moyn, a scholar of history and law at Yale University and the author of “Humane,” a book discussing what it means to try to make war more ethical. What began as a chat about the United States' accusations evolved into a wider-ranging conversation about the fascinating history and immense challenges of developing a legitimate system of international justice.

That conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Zeeshan Aleem: Why do you think the Biden administration has repeatedly accused Putin of being a war criminal?

Samuel Moyn: Well, first, because he is one. There are rules, that are very old, that prohibit some of the acts that Putin has, if not ordered, then supervised. But of course, that's true of a lot of others in the world who haven't been punished. And, of course, that's true of the leaders and soldiers of Western countries.

I think the main reason Biden said that is to try to shift Putin's incentives. When that language comes into play, it means that there's a future specter of accountability. And even if it's not real, it could have an effect. So it changes potentially the way that people think about the conflict, and even how leaders might think about conflicts.

Could you walk us through some of the potential consequences of these accusations? From a legal standpoint, but also politically and culturally?

Moyn: Well, if the charge is meant to have a legal meaning, then we'd be starting to look for a forum in which the transgressors — Putin, and his generals and soldiers — could be held accountable. Now, of course, that would presuppose capturing them at some point so that they're actually able to stand trial.

That's why it's probably more worth considering this almost as a political charge. It's true, there are some new venues that didn't exist in the past. Of course the Geneva Conventions, the main treaty that prohibits war crimes, envisions states punishing their own. But this doesn't tend to happen, and Russia won't punish its own any more than America has.

But there is an International Criminal Court, which is investigating the possibility of war crimes on Ukrainian territory. Until Russia quit the Council of Europe, there was the fact that it was a member of the European human rights regime, which has made judgments in prior cases of Russian war — which leads to, if not personal accountability, then at least states having to pay penalties, which Russia has.

Finally, there are proposals for a new Nuremberg: a standalone tribunal to try Putin and others for starting the war. Because that's what the Nuremberg trials originally prioritized — the crime of aggressive war. Technically, the International Criminal Court can also try aggression, but not in this situation, since Russia is not party to the treaty.

So that's all the legal side. And as I've suggested, that's really hypothetical, given that we're so far away from a real accountability regime in legal terms.

However, historically there have been immense political consequences to charging war crimes, and charging atrocity in particular. Going back at least to the beginning of the 20th century, when the Germans were accused of war crimes when wheeling through Belgium in the initial days of World War I, the claim has delegitimized the perpetrator in the eyes of the world. That's one goal for charging war crimes in the court of public opinion.

In our lifetimes, the importance of war crimes accusations to those who got concerned about American detainee abuse, and especially torture, was not just to see if they could bring an end to the practice, and not just to pave the way for accountability for Americans involved in the practice, but also to make the war seem less legitimate. And so I would say that's probably the central goal of those who are making this claim. And they're on firm ground, because the evidence of Russian war crimes is, in some cases, before our eyes.

Can you walk us through the practical obstacles to Putin being tried by the ICC?

Moyn: First its perpetrators have to be tried in person, and that means they have to be captured. And there's no global constabulary. In the case of the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, it took years and years for the conditions to arise to capture some of the worst war criminals like Ratko Mladic. And a lot of it was luck.

There could be charges against Putin that, even if you couldn't get at him, could affect him even distantly in the future, by making it difficult for him to travel internationally, since he may fear being arrested over war crimes. We don't know what's going to happen in Russia, and maybe a future government would offer him up for trial. But all of this is so hypothetical that it's probably best to focus on how the rhetoric of war crimes is politically damaging right now.

What's the point distinguishing between war crimes and war activity that isn't considered a crime in the context of a war that is premised on a violation of international law in the first place?

Moyn: For background, an illegal war — starting one in violation of international law — is also potentially a war crime. And that's why the proposal from Gordon Brown, the former U.K. prime minister, for a new Nuremberg is so important, because it's about that war crime that used to be the most important one.

For obvious reasons, prohibiting war means all the other war crimes are also stopped or prohibited. But the reverse isn't true: If we allow a lot of illegal wars, and only clean them up by stigmatizing the crimes within them, then think of all the legal activity that we allow. The death of all the soldiers, which is a terrible thing. The death of civilians, collaterally, because you can kill civilians under the law, just not too many. The capital destruction, the opportunity costs, since you could spend the money on something else. The destabilization — think about the consequences the Iraq War had regionally that weren't intended.

I'm of the view that we may have lost focus on what used to be the central war crime, which was aggression. And in a way, the silver lining of Putin's war is that it's helping us get that old focus back after years of prettifying illegal wars. Let's focus on their illegality at the start.

Could you talk a little more about the U.S.’s relationship to the International Criminal Court and its own record on war crimes? Sometimes people will try to brush this away as whataboutism. But how can one develop norms if the actors making accusations aren't upholding the same principles?

Moyn: Two wrongs don't make a right. That is to say, the U.S.’s war crimes don’t make Russia’s war crimes any less immoral. At the same time, that doesn't mean that one party should get to continue to commit the wrong without any consequence while the other party gets hauled into court. And that's true domestically, too. We don't want a legal system that punishes the relatively weaker and lets the strong off scot-free.

Now on the topic of the International Criminal Court, it's such a fascinating history. And what's so fascinating about Nuremberg is that charging aggression was a Soviet idea. And the United States backed it fully.

But, later, in the 1990s, when the International Criminal Court gets founded, it's very significant that the crime of aggression was left out. Even so, the United States steered clear of involvement. Sometimes that weakened, under Democratic presidents, but it was never a remote possibility that the United States would ratify the Rome Statute [the treaty that established the International Criminal Court]. And of course, it still hasn't. However, it's very interesting that over the course of the life of the International Criminal Court, it's sometimes proved very useful for the United States. And in particular, since the ICC can get cases from [United Nations] Security Council referrals, the United States was very happy to refer cases to it, when it wasn't the United States’ friends doing the outrageous things.

Now, more recently, there was the possibility that the International Criminal Court might take up war crimes on Afghan territory. And this caused a freakout in Washington, because it hypothetically meant that the International Criminal Court could indict Americans. And so that caused another turn in this long, tempestuous relationship. This situation is interesting, because the ICC can take up the matter — not through the U.N. Security Council, which Russia would block [because it has veto power on the Security Council] — but because Ukraine has declared that the ICC can exercise one-time jurisdiction within its borders, something the Rome Statute allows. The International Criminal Court is a deeply political institution. And it's deeply bound up with geopolitics. And what that means is that hypocrisy is a big part of how states relate to the justice it represents.

Do you see any possibility of the U.S. joining the ICC, and wouldn’t that be a prerequisite for developing robust international norms regarding what constitutes war crimes?

Moyn: No — this will not happen anytime soon. But that doesn’t mean the situation is hopeless.

The United Nations Charter would have to be revised for great powers to be called out within the Security Council — since as of now they have a veto power there. Some have called for the General Assembly to be able to refer cases of aggressive war to the ICC, or create new courts, the way the Security Council did in response to war crimes in the 1990s in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Either way, we're really looking at the Global South, and other like-minded actors, insisting that a system of global justice should cover the transgressions of all great powers, not just weaker states — or more powerful states that everyone already gangs up against.

We should return to what the Americans and Russians once agreed about — which is that aggression is the crime of crimes.

Some might consider such moves impossible. But we wouldn’t have a United Nations in the first place if we didn’t think we could organize peace in the aftermath of a great-power war. So why not think of an even better system than we have?

It is worth adding that the more states that ratify the Rome Statute, the easier it is to hold great powers to account for war crimes (outside of the crime of illegal war). This is because the court can exercise jurisdiction when war crimes take place on the territory of states that have ratified the treaty or, as in Ukraine today, invited the attention for a time — even if the perpetrators are from a state that hasn’t ratified. That is why the Afghan situation and the Ukrainian situation have proved troublesome for great powers, because great powers can't easily control the court if states where they're fighting have joined it.

Any final thoughts on parts of the war crimes narrative you think might be being overlooked or misunderstood?

Moyn: Between the Vietnam War and the present, in elite spaces across the Atlantic, it came to seem like war was sometimes even progressive, even when it was illegal. And that's why there was such, I think, a lopsided emphasis on cleaning up the results of wars, making sure that we complied with rules to forbid atrocity. Putin's blatant act gives us a chance to revisit that calculus, and maybe we should return to what the Americans and Russians once agreed about — which is that aggression is the crime of crimes, the ultimate gateway crime.",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-accusing-russia-s-putin-war-crimes-big-deal-n1293798
6,2ffdc04a-8165-46cc-8a74-9cd7c063894b,['Steve Gutterman'],,"MUNICH, Germany -- U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has told European leaders that the United States ""is now and will always be your greatest ally,"" seeking to assuage concerns about Washington's commitment to transatlantic ties under President Donald Trump.

Speaking on February 18 at the Munich Security Conference, Pence said the ""enduring bond"" between the United States and Europe was built not only on ""strength of arms"" but on shared values and principles ""that we cherish: freedom, democracy, justice, and the rule of law.""

He said he brought a message from Trump: ""The United States of America strongly supports NATO and will be unwavering"" in its support for the alliance.

At the same time, Pence forcefully repeated Trump's calls for European allies to shoulder their share of the financial burden, saying that only five NATO members had reached a target set in 2014 of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense within a decade, and that several had no clear path to that goal.

""It's time to do more,"" Pence said.

He said the United States will ""hold Russia accountable"" for interference in Ukraine even as it seeks ""common ground"" with Moscow, which he said Trump believed can be found.

Russia must uphold the 2015 Minsk cease-fire and peace deal signed in Belarus, starting by de-escalating violence in eastern Ukraine, Pence said.

Turning to broader issues, Pence said that the United States was committed to ensuring that Iran cannot obtain nuclear weapons, and to fighting ""radical Islamic terrorism"" as well as threats from ""rogue nations"" and other ""new adversaries"" he said had emerged following the end of the Cold War a quarter-century ago.

The focus on this year's edition of the prominent annual security conference in Munich has been fears that Trump might loosen U.S. ties to Europe, withdraw or reduce U.S. backing for NATO, and sacrifice the interests of countries from Ukraine to Western Europe in the name of a new ""reset"" with Russia.

Those worries stem from comments from Trump, who in the past year has expressed enthusiasm for Britain's exit from the European Union, called NATO ""obsolete,"" voiced admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin and suggested he might scrap sanctions imposed on Moscow over its actions in Ukraine.

""Know this: the United States will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which as you know, President Trump believes can be found,"" Pence said.

Lavrov Rejects Blame On Moscow

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov rejected the blame placed on Moscow for the continuing conflict in eastern Ukraine, where the fighting between Kyiv's forces and Russia-backed separatists has killed more than 9,750 people since it erupted in April 2014 -- shortly after Russia seized control of Crimea from Ukraine.

Lavrov accused Ukraine of failing to meet its commitments under the Minsk agreement and suggested that the remarks of Western officials about the conflict reflected a Cold War mind-set that he said persists in the West.

In a pointedly short statement a few hours after Pence spoke, Lavrov repeated Russian accusations that the enlargement of NATO to include former Soviet republics and satellites has created tension in Europe -- rejecting the alliance's position that it is Russia's aggressive actions that are to blame.

Lavrov said that the ""post-Cold War order"" had come to an end and that he hoped ""responsible leaders"" will choose to create a ""democratic and just world order -- if you want you can call it a post-West world order.""

Lavrov was speaking 10 years after Russian President Vladimir Putin used the Munich Security Conference as the stage for a sriking denunciation of the United States as a dangerous hegemon that was ignoring state borders, violating international law, and ""plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts.""

While repeating Kremlin criticism of the West and its military alliance, Lavrov called for the resumption of military cooperation between Russia and NATO, and said Moscow wanted relations with the United States that are ""pragmatic"" and marked by mutual respect and acknowledgement of a shared responsibility for global stability.

Lavrov said the badly strained ties that existed now are ""unnatural"" and the two countries have huge potential for cooperation.

Pence, for his part, did not go into much detail about the prospects for ""common ground"" between Washington and Moscow.

Focusing on the transatlantic relationship, he painted a powerful picture of what he suggested were the historical affinities between the United States and Europe, using anecdotes about two previous visits to Germany to make his point.

During the Cold War, he crossed from a Western Europe seeking to rebuild after World War II into drab communist East Germany, he said -- then traveled to Germany again after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and saw flowers and other signs of mourning and solidarity.

""Europe stood tall with the United States"" at that time, Pence said, adding that ""the American people will be forever grateful.""

But he warned Europe that ""peace only comes through strength"" and that ""Europe's defense requires your commitment as much as ours.""

""The United States will be strong -- stronger than ever before,"" he said, stressing that Washington plans to spend more on its military.

Merkel Backs Minsk Pact In Ukraine

Pence addressed the conference just after German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said she was committed to meeting the defense-spending goal set by NATO in 2014, and the two met for talks later in the day.

Merkel said Western states must protect the principle of territorial integrity, calling it a crucial foundation of the post-World War II order, and that NATO needed to strengthen its eastern flank following Russia's interference in Ukraine.

Merkel said that there was ""great anxiety"" about the situation in eastern Ukraine and that Russia's interference in Ukraine ""highlighted"" the importance of NATO. Stressing the need to maintain international alliances, Merkel told the audience -- with Pence seated a few meters away -- that NATO was ""in the American interest.""

Merkel said she was committed to seeking a political solution to the conflict and supported the Minsk agreement, which she called ""the only thing we have at the moment to move forward talks and the possibility of solving the problems. When we don't have anything else, I am against throwing something away that may still be useful.""

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told other leaders at the Munich conference on February 17 that they must not ""appease"" Russia by lifting sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union for seizing Crimea and stoking conflict in eastern Ukraine.

""It would be a mistake to think that Russia's appetite is limited"" to Ukraine.

After talks with Pence in Munich on February 18, Poroshenko said he received a ""very strong message supporting Ukraine"" in that meeting and in phone calls with Trump and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in the last two weeks.



Pence also reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the security of the Baltic countries in a meeting with the presidents of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Pence's office said he noted the Trump administration's support for the collective defense of NATO allies -- a crucial concern for the Baltic states, which are wary of Russia's intentions.



Pence held separate meetings with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi and Masud Barzani, president of the Iraqi Kurdistan region. U.S. officials said he thanked both for committing to fight the extremist group Islamic State (IS) and encouraged close cooperation between the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan regional government.



Meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, Pence voiced U.S. support for Afghanistan's national unity government, and officials said the two affirmed the importance of continuing what they called the ""strategic partnership"" between the United States.



And Pence met with Bono, the Irish rock star and social activist.



Also on the sidelines of the security conference, the foreign ministers of Russia, Ukraine, and mediators Germany and France agreed to press for implementation of the existing and much-violated cease-fire in eastern Ukraine starting on February 20.



""All parties will use their influence to implement the agreement of the trilateral contact group from February 15,"" referring to a body comprising Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).



""The aim is to have a cease-fire starting from February 20 and to do what has long been agreed but never implemented: To withdraw the heavy weapons from the region, to secure them and enable the OSCE monitors to control where they are kept,"" German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told reporters.

Merkel, meanwhile, said she wanted good relations with Russia and believes it is in the common interest of Russia and the West to fight international terrorism.

She also said that Western countries had a ""responsibility to bear"" in accepting refugees and tackling the root causes leading people to flee their countries.

Merkel called for countries to work together, saying they must do so if they are to be strong. ""Will we be able to act in concert, or will we fall back into parochial policies...? Let us stand together and make the world a better place,"" she said.

Speaking after Pence, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said all allies must contribute their share in funding the alliance and stressed that NATO's ""bond remains essential"" on both sides of the Atlantic.

""Europe needs North America and North America needs Europe,"" he said.

""I don't think America First means America alone,"" Stoltenberg said, referring to a policy Trump set out in his inaugural address on January 20.

7,2ffdc04a-8165-46cc-8a74-9cd7c063894b,[],2022-04-01 00:00:00,"The White House smells Putin’s blood in the waters of his disastrous invasion. The flow of weapons, the sweeping sanctions, and other acts of economic warfare are ultimately aimed not just at defending Ukraine and making the regime pay for the invasion in the immediate present, but also setting in motion its downfall. “For god’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said during his recent visit to Poland. The White House sought to walk back the line and clarify that it did not constitute a change in policy but was merely an expression of the president’s righteous anger. The kerfuffle over what Biden really meant is less important than the very public actions of the U.S. and its allies.

Ever since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, there has been an unprecedented cohesion of messaging emanating from the U.S. government, its NATO and other European allies, and large segments of the Western media establishment. As massive quantities of weapons pour into Ukraine, there has been consistent media and political agitation for President Joe Biden and other Western leaders to “do more” or answer for why they are not further escalating the situation, including through the imposition of a no-fly zone.

It should not be assumed that the strategies and actions being employed by Washington and its allies in their proxy war against Moscow will always be in the best interest of Ukraine or its people. Likewise, Ukraine’s calls for military support and action from the West — however justifiable and sincere they are — may not be in the best interest of the rest of the world, particularly if they increase the likelihood of nuclear war or World War III. The desire to avoid this scenario by advocating for a negotiated solution to the war that addresses Russia’s stated concerns or its rationale for the invasion is not a capitulation to Putin and it is not appeasement. It is common sense.

The war in Ukraine is simultaneously a war of aggression being waged by Putin and part of a larger geopolitical battle between the U.S., NATO, and Russia. “We are engaged in a conflict here. It’s a proxy war with Russia, whether we say so or not,” said Leon Panetta, the former CIA director and defense secretary under Barack Obama. “I think the only way to basically deal with Putin right now is to double down on ourselves, which means to provide as much military aid as necessary.” Speaking to Bloomberg News on March 17, Panetta laid out the U.S. strategy: “Make no mistake about it: Diplomacy is going nowhere unless we have leverage, unless the Ukrainians have leverage, and the way you get leverage is by, frankly, going in and killing Russians. That’s what the Ukrainians have to do. We’ve got to continue the war effort. This is a power game. Putin understands power; he doesn’t really understand diplomacy very much.”

While this position may feel morally right, particularly when it is bolstered by the ghastly images of human carnage wrought by Russian forces and the pleas of Ukrainians for the world to intervene much more directly, embedded within this mindset is a morally dubious principle: Ukrainians should bear the human cost not just of the defense of their nation, but also of the larger-scale agendas of the U.S. and other Western governments. In her recent essay for The Atlantic, Anne Applebaum, a prominent Russia hawk , argued that now is the time for the U.S. and its allies to embrace a new Cold War. “As long as Russia is ruled by Putin, then Russia is at war with us too. So are Belarus, North Korea, Venezuela, Iran, Nicaragua, Hungary, and potentially many others,” she wrote. “There is no natural liberal world order, and there are no rules without someone to enforce them.”

While the fate of Ukraine and the lives of its civilian population are evoked in calls for more escalatory action from the West, it is these very people who will suffer and die in large numbers every day the war drags on. Western media coverage is often crafted to portray only one outcome as acceptable: a decisive Ukrainian victory, in which the government of Volodymyr Zelenskyy emerges from the horrors of the Russian invasion in complete control of all of its territory, including Crimea and the Donbas region. Ukraine, as a free and independent state, should be free to join NATO, and Russia has no legitimacy in questioning the implications of such a move. Advocacy for accepting anything short of this outcome is a victory for Russia and therefore traitorous to even consider.

The routine belligerence exhibited by countless politicians, pundits, and media figures about taking the fight to Putin in Ukraine is largely chickenhawkery. “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is today’s Churchill, and President Biden is today’s FDR,” wrote the notorious war promoter Max Boot in the Washington Post. “A Russian defeat,” Boot argued, “is essential to save Ukraine and safeguard the liberal international order. The Ukrainians are willing to fight on despite their heartbreaking losses. We just need to give them the tools to finish the job.” Yet when you listen to the fine details of Ukraine’s own negotiators and leaders, it’s clear that they understand that the war does not end with the swift annihilation of Putin, the downfall of Russia, or with a clean and complete Ukrainian retention of its territorial sovereignty. That’s why Zelenskyy’s government has acknowledged that the issue of NATO membership, a formalized neutrality status, and an internationally brokered process on the status of Crimea will all be on the table.

There has been much noise about Russia’s recent indications that it was drawing down its military actions in parts of Ukraine, particularly around the capital Kyiv. The U.S. and NATO have acknowledged a partial drawdown but asserted that Russian forces appear to be repositioning, likely for use in the east. Russia has also said as much itself. Moscow’s position is that “the main goals of the first stage of the operation have generally been accomplished.”

There is a peculiar dynamic surrounding the analysis of Putin’s comments on his intentions for Ukraine. He is accused of lying when his remarks undermine the U.S. narrative, but we are told to believe he is absolutely telling the truth when his pugnacious threats bolster the U.S. position. Whether or not Putin intended to seize all of Ukraine and become an imperial occupier, he did seem to believe his invasion could cause the Ukrainian government to collapse and its leaders to flee in fear. That did not happen. Instead, U.S. and NATO-armed Ukrainian forces outside Kyiv have fought the Russian troops ferociously and inflicted significant losses against them on the battlefield. At the same time, by opening multiple fronts, Moscow forced Ukraine to defend vital territory, including its capital. This strategy exacted a tremendous human toll on the Russian military, but it did take some heat off Russian forces in the Donbas territories in the east, which Putin has cited as his territorial priority in the operation.

But the question of Putin’s original intent — to take Kyiv or to use that threat as a strategy to spread Ukraine’s defenses thin — is now largely irrelevant except in the rhetorical battlespace focused on Russian weakness, incompetence, or failure.

The most contentious issue in the negotiations to end the war will likely have little to do with NATO membership. Zelenskyy has already conceded that to end the war Ukraine will have to drop that ambition and adopt a neutral and nonaligned status, though he does want to continue the pursuit of joining the European Union. Russia will certainly oppose any attempts for Kyiv to win a backdoor “Article 5” status that could trigger defense of Ukraine by Western powers in cases of future military actions by Moscow. Ukraine has suggested that it would also want China and Turkey to be a part of such a guarantee, not just adversaries of Russia. There are indications that the U.S. doesn’t think the proposal is viable, and Britain’s deputy prime minister bluntly stated, “Ukraine is not a NATO member,” adding, “We’re not going to engage Russia in direct military confrontation.”

Based on the reports out of the recent negotiations in Turkey, it seems that the most incendiary questions will revolve around the breakaway republics in the Donbas region. Ukraine has effectively said it wants a return to the pre-invasion status quo, which would mean erasing the Putin-recognized declarations of independence from Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia, which is currently expanding its control over the Donbas and seizing more territory, is unlikely to agree. This dynamic more than any other could delay or block any meaningful resolution and would be a central focus in a potential summit between Zelenskyy and Putin.

Once there is a brokered agreement, the flow of Western weapons into Ukraine and Russian military support for the separatists will result in a constant state of war footing for many years to come. A cloud portending more fighting and bloodshed will remain hovering over eastern Ukraine. If U.S. and other NATO troops resume their training exercises in Ukraine, as Biden has indicated they should, this means that there will always be a risk of incidents that could quickly escalate.

This six-week war surely has left the war industry jubilant. In Washington, Biden recently proposed what would be the largest U.S. “defense” budget in history, more than $813 billion. Germany and other European countries are publicly committing to buying and selling more weapons and spending more on defense. NATO is raising the prospect of expanding its permanent military presence in Europe and Washington is reasserting its political dominance over Europe on security matters. But despite the image of global unity of cause being promoted by the U.S. and its NATO allies, several large and powerful nations, including China, India, Indonesia, and NATO member Turkey, are not marching to Washington’s drumbeat — not in the proxy-war business and not in the policy of sanctioning and vilifying Russia.

The overt war in Ukraine will have to end at the negotiating table. But the proxy war is escalating and will have consequences that extend far beyond the current battlefield.",https://theintercept.com/2022/04/01/russia-ukraine-proxy-war-washington-diplomacy/

As many observers have noted, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine parallels Iraq’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. So does the international response. Both then and now, a significant international coalition has united to impose punishing sanctions, accusing the invading country of flagrant violations of international law and basic human rights.

So far, the U.S.-led response seems to be bringing together allies and hitting Russia hard. Sanctions have crippled the Russian economy. Similarly, three decades ago during the Gulf crisis, President George H.W. Bush received high marks for bringing the world together to impose unprecedented sanctions on Iraq. The robust international response ignited hopes for what Bush called a “new world order,” much as today’s headlines suggest a newly reunited West.

My research on Iraq under sanctions suggests that building the coalition and imposing sanctions will be the easy part. Bush ended the first Gulf War by uniting a military coalition that expelled Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait — but that didn’t end the conflict with Iraq. Russia’s nuclear weapons make NATO involvement in the conflict unlikely — and the rhetoric and sanctions will make ending the conflict with Russia quite difficult.

Sanctions tend to take on a life of their own, causing intense suffering among the general population without significantly harming the ruling elite. Indeed, sanctions can strengthen the leader’s hold on power. International unity forged during crisis can be difficult to sustain over time as national interests diverge. And once the invading leader has been demonized to arouse support for sanctions, it becomes difficult to lift the sanctions or accept a political compromise.

How do you negotiate after you’ve said, as President Biden recently said about Russian President Vladimir Putin, that someone “cannot remain in power”?

The political expediency of harsh rhetoric

Biden recently called Putin a “war criminal.” The International Court of Justice has ordered Russia to leave Ukraine, and the International Criminal Court is investigating possible Russian war crimes, for which Putin could be held accountable.

Given the bombing of hospitals, “war criminal” may be accurate. Such a term is certainly politically useful in building support for policies that raise fuel prices and may escalate the war.

Bush used similar rhetoric. He argued, “We’re dealing with Hitler revisited, a totalitarianism and a brutality that is naked and unprecedented in modern times, and that must not stand!” After the Gulf War, Bush’s secretary of state, James Baker, told his European counterparts that Hussein was “a murderer, and a thug, and a criminal. No one — I repeat no one — should conduct any normal business with an Iraqi government headed by Saddam.”

The Clinton administration continued this approach. When asked if he would moderate U.S. policy on Iraq in 1994, President Bill Clinton responded that Hussein was guilty of “crimes against humanity, including genocide,” and that Clinton would “see that Saddam Hussein and his regime are held fully responsible for the bloodshed in Kuwait and Iraq.” But until President George W. Bush’s administration, the United States lacked the means or the will to hold Hussein accountable or remove him from power.

George H.W. Bush’s descriptions of Hussein’s “brutality against innocent citizens” were often accurate. However, they made ending the conflict politically untenable.

Perpetual sanctions, no regime change

Sanctions have a poor track record for inducing regime change. Crippling sanctions in Iraq increased food prices by 4,000 percent between 1990 and 1995. News media reported that ordinary Iraqis were selling their gold and furniture and that poor families were forced to send their children to orphanages. But Saddam continued to build palaces; people close to the regime emerged as a newly wealthy class. In 1996, an oil-for-food scheme further enriched regime officials while doing little for ordinary Iraqis.

The sanctions on Iraq, designed to undermine Hussein’s support, made Iraqis more dependent on his regime. As the Iraqi economy collapsed, the government rationed food, which in practice meant that the regime decided who ate and how much. After a decade of sanctions the regime still had a strong grip on power.

Hussein eventually realized that the United States was unwilling to lift sanctions and ceased cooperating with the United Nations, suspending weapons inspections in Iraq. If Putin comes to a similar conclusion, he may be less likely to leave Ukraine. That would increase the likelihood of a bloody stalemate.

Diplomatic costs of a stalemate

In the 1990s, Bush’s coalition was torn apart by the desire for Iraqi oil, the aversion to Iraqi suffering and the United States’ refusal to compromise.

Moscow had supported Washington in the Gulf crisis, and U.S. leaders hoped it would be a pillar of the new post-Cold War order. But in 1994, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev argued that if Iraq began to cooperate, the United States and the U.N. Security Council “must be ready to take ‘Yes’ for an answer.” France and then most of Western Europe soon joined Moscow in criticizing U.S. inflexibility. France stopped helping to enforce no-fly zones over Iraq. The humanitarian crisis eroded support for a strategy of containment. In 1998, these disagreements led Russia to recall its ambassador to Washington for the first time since World War II.

But even if the Clinton administration had wanted to change course, anti-Hussein rhetoric in the U.S. had created domestic constraints that were hard to overcome. In 1998, the Senate passed the Iraq Liberation Act by unanimous consent, codifying an uncompromising policy of regime change in Baghdad. That position increasingly isolated the United States from its allies, undermined its moral standing and hurt its interests. One result was the 2003 Iraq War, which irreparably damaged U.S. foreign policy and was catastrophic for Iraqis.

Unsatisfying outcomes

Iraq never fully met its Gulf War’s cease-fire agreement obligations. Hussein also continued violating his citizens’ human rights. Yet at several points in the 1990s, Baghdad sought to reset its relationship with Washington and the West.

When Iraq showed a willingness to cooperate, Washington could not reciprocate. How can one negotiate with Hitler?

Regardless of what happens in Ukraine, it’s unlikely that sanctions will topple Putin’s regime. Over time, the coalition will likely fray, as the need for peace in Eastern Europe and access to Russian energy leads much of the world to come to terms with Putin.

In the days following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the United Nations (UN) General Assembly convened an Emergency Special Session under its Uniting for Peace mechanism. The initiation of this session was prompted by the exercise of the veto power by Russia, thereby impeding the Security Council from adopting a resolution on the situation. The Security Council took the unusual step (by majority vote) of deciding to call an Emergency Special Session given that Russia’s veto had “prevented it from exercising its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.” For the first time since 1997, the General Assembly convened an Emergency Special Session on a new situation, broadcast live around the world, in which state diplomats joined together in large numbers to express their collective disapprobation of Russian aggression. It resulted in the adoption of Resolution ES-11/1 by a large majority (141 for, five against and 35 abstentions). This Article discusses the legal significance of this resolution and revisits the powers available to the General Assembly in supporting the maintenance and restoration of international peace and security. It shows that, moving forward, there are various legal solutions open to the General Assembly, some creative, to mitigate the Security Council’s failures to act on the Ukraine situation.

The nature of the Uniting for Peace mechanism has been extensively analyzed, such that only a brief outline of its key features is necessary here. In response to Security Council deadlock on continued UN military action in Korea, the General Assembly adopted Resolution 377A on 3 November 1950. The resolution stipulates that either the General Assembly or Security Council can initiate an Emergency Special Session where, due to a “lack of unanimity of the permanent members,” the Council “fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.” In this case, the Assembly “shall consider the matter immediately with a view to making appropriate recommendations to Members for collective measures, including in the case of a breach of the peace or act of aggression the use of armed force when necessary, to maintain or restore international peace and security.” In the ten prior Emergency Special Sessions, the Assembly took and recommended a variety of measures. It has condemned violations of international law and called for cessation of these breaches. It has recommended the imposition of sanctions against offending states. It has established peacekeeping forces with host state consent. Perhaps most famously associated with the Uniting for Peace mechanism, in 1951 the Assembly called upon states to support continued UN military action in Korea, including to repel Chinese aggression, a feat that it has not repeated since.

The output of the first meeting of the Emergency Special Session on Ukraine, Resolution ES-11/1, did not go as far as some of these prior resolutions, but it did return to a legal characterization that it has long avoided: aggression.† It deplored “in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine in violation of Article 2 (4) of the [UN] Charter” and condemned Russia’s declaration as to the necessity of this “‘special military operation.’” It demanded Russia to “cease its use of force against Ukraine” as well as to “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.” It also condemned “all violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of human rights,” demanding that parties to the conflict “fully comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law to spare the civilian population.” It recalled the obligations under Article 2(2) of the UN Charter, that all member states, “in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits of membership, shall fulfil in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the [UN] Charter.”

Resolution ES-11/1 is unlikely to be the General Assembly’s final word on the Ukraine situation. The Emergency Special Session is now adjourned, but can be resumed in the future upon requests from member states. Although it is impossible to predict how this unfolding crisis is resolved, it is worthwhile considering the legal options open to the Assembly in seeking to secure peace and, in time, justice for the victims of aggression and other international crimes. To what extent is the Assembly able to take action or otherwise recommend measures to the membership that would be legally analogous to that taken by the Security Council?

This question comes back to the debate on the scope of the General Assembly’s powers and the effect of its resolutions. A commonly held view is that the Assembly, being a deliberative body, is lacking in legal authority to impose its will on states; its powers in Articles 10 to 14 are merely recommendatory. Rather, it is the Security Council that is vested with the powers to bind and coerce the membership, including to justify the use of military force and the imposition of economic sanctions. Furthermore, it is clear from past Assembly practice that it is not necessary for them to act in an Emergency Special Session in order to condemn member states or the Security Council in failing to meet its responsibilities under the UN Charter; it has become routine practice in regular sessions to do so.‡ An Emergency Special Session under Uniting for Peace, on this view, is symbolic, in creating the bracing optics of an urgently convened session to address shocking events, but does not give the Assembly any more power than it possesses under the UN Charter. Yet, even if one accepts that Uniting for Peace does not add to the Assembly’s legal powers, this view ignores the important role that the General Assembly’s solemnly worded resolutions in an emergency situation possess in crystallising a series of legal claims by the community of nations that can be used to support future actions. In this context, the use of the Uniting for Peace mechanism is a symptom of the UN’s institutional failure, with the many (i.e. the 193 members of the Assembly) attempting to do through a process of collective legal interpretation what the few have failed to do through Chapter VII decisions (i.e. the 15 members of the Security Council). The Assembly can legally support future actions against Russia in a variety of ways.

Its finding in Resolution ES-11/1 that Russia has committed aggression in Ukraine provides the first such internationally authoritative determination that this conduct occurred. Prior Assembly findings of this nature in other situations have been used to augment legal action taken by other bodies, including the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) exercise of jurisdiction and the ordering of provisional measures in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Most relevantly, Resolution 68/262 (2014), which declared Russia’s annexation of Crimea to be of “no validity” was used by the ICC Prosecutor to support the opening of an investigation, on the basis that Crimea was Ukrainian territory. Indeed, in the recently initiated case, Ukraine v Russia, the ICJ drew upon Resolution ES-11/1 to support the ordering of provisional measures to protect the rights of Ukraine from being subject to the use of force by Russia based upon false allegations of genocide under the Genocide Convention.

The General Assembly can also take into account the Russian aggression as a factor in those internal operational matters in which it is empowered to make decisions. Its finding in Resolution ES-11/1 that the “rights and benefits” of membership entail good faith obligations provide a hook for future claims that the Russian government has not acted in accordance with the expectations incumbent on a UN member state. One route is via Article 5 of the UN Charter, which provides that “a member of the United Nations against which preventive or enforcement action has been taken by the Security Council may be suspended from the exercise of the rights and privileges of membership by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.” The obvious impediment here is that Russia would not support its own suspension from the UN when voting on the matter in the Security Council. However, this does not preclude the membership from forming a view as to whether a representative possesses the credentials to represent a state in the Assembly. Normally this is a formality in approving the governmental representatives of a state, but there is precedent for the General Assembly to factor in a regime’s fidelity to the UN Charter in assessing whether to accept or reject credentials. The credentials of the South African apartheid regime were thus rejected by the Assembly due to its “flagrant violation” of the UN Charter. Whether isolating Russia in this way is politically wise is another matter. Yet, it is open to member states to object to the Russian representative based on the South Africa precedent, thereby triggering a consideration of its credentials by the UN Credentials Committee.

Another way in which the General Assembly’s legal determinations might assist in the Ukraine situation is in supporting the legal justification for the imposition of sanctions against Russia. Sanctions raise complex questions of legality, particularly when taken unilaterally outside an international institutional framework. Within the text of the UN Charter, the power to sanction is textually the reserve of the Security Council, which, pursuant to Article 41, are able to take measures to restore or maintain international peace and security. Still, there is a body of Assembly practice in calling upon members to impose sanctions against offending states, including the breaking of diplomatic relations; closure of sea and air ports; trade boycotts; severance of cultural relations; targeted sanctions against individual perpetrators; and arms embargoes. The difference in the Ukraine situation is that states have been quick to impose sanctions without the need for encouragement or endorsement from the Assembly. Still, there is a role, moving forward, for the Assembly to evaluate the legality of sanctions against Russia by, for example, certifying that the conditions for the valid invocation of the law of countermeasures have been met. These conditions, according to Article 49 of the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on State Responsibility, include proportionality, proper purpose (aimed at inducing Russia’s compliance), and temporal limitation to the period of the breach. While an Assembly resolution would not automatically release states from its various treaty obligations to Russia, the involvement of the Assembly in certifying that these conditions have been met can serve to alleviate concerns regarding abuse that might arise in a single state, or a small group of states, determining the legality of sanctions unilaterally. Furthermore, closer coordination of sanctions through the Assembly would give effect to the international obligation on states to cooperate through international institutions (such as the UN) to bring to an end breaches of peremptory norms (such as the prohibition on aggression).

The General Assembly can also empower judicial or quasi-judicial bodies to address the legal implications arising from Russia’s aggression and its conduct in Ukraine. Resolution 377A noted it to be one of the Assembly’s responsibilities under the Uniting for Peace mechanism to “ascertain the facts and expose aggressors.” The Assembly can advance this purpose most obviously by creating a commission of inquiry with a mandate to collect and evaluate evidence to ascertain violations of international law. The recent precedent set in the Syria situation takes the Assembly’s powers a step further to allow commissions to prepare individual case files of persons suspected of committing international crimes, thereby facilitating future investigations and prosecutions at a domestic or international level. In 2016, Russia sought to resist this innovation as ultra vires but failed. A quasi-prosecutorial mechanism of this nature in turn enhances the Assembly’s ability to meet its responsibility under the Uniting for Peace mechanism to “expose aggressors” in the Ukraine situation. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Assembly’s subsidiary organ, the Human Rights Council, has established a commission of inquiry to investigate a broad range of violations arising from the Russian aggression. This will, in turn, serve to not only ensure that an international investigation is conducted into these violations, but also provide the Assembly with information to underpin its future findings and legal characterizations on the Ukraine situation.

Furthermore, the General Assembly, acting under Article 96 of the UN Charter, could request an advisory opinion from the ICJ. Ukraine has already initiated proceedings against Russia which, given the latter’s limited acceptance of the ICJ’s jurisdiction, is confined to arguments concerning the application of the Genocide Convention. This provides a hook for the judicial consideration of the reasons purporting to support the invasion, but the Assembly might also confer jurisdiction on the ICJ on a broader basis through a request for an advisory opinion. The ICJ has the power to consider “any legal question” which has been construed broadly to include the conduct of individual states. As the Emergency Special Session on Israel shows, the Assembly has used the Uniting for Peace mechanism to request an advisory opinion on the legal consequences of Israel’s construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Similarly, the Assembly could ask the ICJ to address the legal consequences arising from Russian conduct on a broader basis, both in February 2022 as well as in relation to earlier incursions into Ukrainian territory, such as its 2014 annexation of Crimea.

Finally, a more radical suggestion is for the General Assembly to create an ad hoc criminal tribunal to try suspects accused of international crimes, including aggression, in relation to the Ukraine situation. A group of leading figures have called for a Special Tribunal for Aggression to be established to prosecute Russia’s aggressive acts. While it has been the Security Council who has established ad hoc tribunals in the past, their failure to act on the Ukraine situation would arguably support the creation of an analogous tribunal by the Assembly under the Uniting for Peace mechanism. This view has gained some traction in UN practice, with the commission of inquiry report on North Korea noting the possibility for states to pool their combined sovereign powers over criminal jurisdiction to empower an Assembly created ad hoc tribunal. Although the Prosecutor of the ICC has initiated an investigation into the Ukraine situation, there are limitations to this Court’s jurisdictional reach, particularly over the crime of aggression. As Russia is not an ICC state party, and the Security Council is unable to make a referral of the situation due to Russia’s veto, the crime of aggression cannot be prosecuted at the ICC in this situation. The establishment by the Assembly of an ad hoc tribunal over the crime of aggression represents one legal option to redress this impunity gap.

The overview of legal options open to the General Assembly says nothing about the sizeable challenges in operationalizing these various options, especially in trying the incumbent Russian leadership for the crime of aggression. Nor has it sought to predict the geopolitical winds of change that might make these options more or less viable as a matter of international politics. However, as states and other actors coordinate their activities and strategize in forging creative solutions to overcome misuses of the Security Council veto, it is the General Assembly, now as in 1950, that can step into the breach. Resolution ES-11/1 has made a start.
