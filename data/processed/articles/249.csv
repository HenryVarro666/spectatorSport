The Russian invasion of Ukraine has hit the southern port city of Mariupol particularly hard, as new satellite photos show.

The Russian military has been besieging Mariupol for a week now, pounding the city with barrages of missiles and artillery. These weapons are hitting civilian as well as military targets; for example, one of Mariupol's maternity hospitals was destroyed on Wednesday (March 9), The New York Times reported .

New satellite imagery gives a sense of how widespread the destruction is in Mariupol, which had a population around 500,000 before the invasion began. (Many people have since fled.)

The photos, captured on Wednesday morning by Maxar Technologies' WorldView-3 spacecraft, depict extensive damage ""to the civilian infrastructure in and around the city, including residential homes, high-rise apartment buildings, grocery stores and shopping centers,"" a public relations (PR) company that represents Virginia-based Maxar wrote in an emailed statement about the imagery.

On Wednesday, Maxar's WorldView-2 satellite also captured a view of the maternity hospital before it was destroyed — a ""before"" image that can be compared, in the not-too-distant future, to a grim ""after"" photo of the leveled building.

Maxar's satellites have been monitoring the invasion in other parts of Ukraine as well. For example, on Tuesday (March 8), WorldView-3 snapped new imagery around Kyiv, Ukraine's capital.

A 40-mile-long (64 kilometers) Russian military convoy has been stalled on the outskirts of Kyiv for more than a week now. Cloudy weather has prevented optical-light satellites like WorldView-3 from getting good views of the convoy for most of that stretch.

Clouds continued to hang over most of the convoy route on Tuesday, but ""armored vehicles and equipment can be seen maneuvering to the northeast and southwest of Antonov Airport (near Hostomel, Ukraine),"" in the WorldView-3 photos from that day, the PR company wrote in an emailed statement. (Hostomel is a suburb of Kyiv.)

""Nearby, people are leaving from Irpin near the damaged bridge over the Irpin River,"" the statement continued. ""Multiple bomb craters are visible in the fields and surrounding area.""

Maxar isn't the only company providing a bird's-eye view of the invasion. Satellites operated by Planet , BlackSky and other outfits are also capturing optical-light imagery of the war and its effects. And companies such as Capella Space are eyeing the region with synthetic aperture radar, which doesn't require sunlight or clear skies to get a good look at the ground.",https://www.space.com/mariupol-ukraine-damage-satellite-photos
2,533d040d-3796-48c0-ad65-d0b6b334a910,[],,"US lawmakers sign off on almost $14 billion in aid for war-torn Ukraine as part of a giant blueprint to fund federal agencies and avoid a damaging government shutdown at home.

The House of Representatives green-lights around $1.5 trillion in spending through September, less than 48 hours before the Friday-Saturday midnight deadline, when government funding was due to dry up.

The 2,700-plus page package will need to be rubber-stamped by the Senate before the budget can pass into law.

“The brave, freedom-loving people of Ukraine and our allies in the region will receive urgently needed investments to fight Vladimir Putin and the Russians’ illegal and immoral invasion,” Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer say in a joint statement.

Lawmakers in the lower chamber also pass a four-day “continuing resolution” to keep federal agencies running until next Tuesday.

This gives the Senate some breathing room in case the procedural hurdles required to get the full package to US President Joe Biden’s desk cannot be completed by Friday night.

The rigid timetable was forced on lawmakers because Democrats were due to spend the rest of the working week at a retreat in Philadelphia.

Included in the deal is $13.6 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine and its Eastern European allies in response to Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s invasion, which is entering its third week.

The funding, which has huge cross-party support, was one of the keys to passing the omnibus package, which has proved controversial in other areas.

“This bipartisan government funding agreement is the major step forward that our national security needs,” Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says in a statement. “This is a dangerous time for the United States and our partners.”

It provides $782 billion in defense funding — far more than Biden’s initial $715 billion request and an increase of 5.6 percent over last year.

The package includes $730 billion in non-defense cash, a 6.7% increase over 2021 and the largest hike in four years.

Lawmakers on the left of the Democratic Party had signaled they would be unhappy about defense spending hikes, but they back the increases in domestic spending and allowed the package to advance to the Senate.

There was a backlash from progressives however over a provision to provide $15.6 billion to fund the Biden administration’s COVID-19 strategy, forcing it to be stripped out of the omnibus package.

Republicans are refusing to back any new cash for the federal pandemic response, and Democrats had agreed to take the money from existing programs, including $7 billion allocated to state governments in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan.

But rank-and-file Democrats objected to the proposal, meaning leadership had to schedule a separate vote on Covid funding, likely to come next week.

Lawmakers are also expected to vote on a new sanctions bill that includes a ban on importing oil and other petroleum products from Russia.

Biden has already instituted the oil ban by executive order, but Democratic leaders in Congress want their members to be on the record supporting the measure.

The Senate is unlikely to follow suit in any case.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-10-2022/

(Diego Herrera Carcedo/AP)

Tatiana Perebeinis and her two children — Alise, 9, and Nikita, 18 — were killed on Sunday by Russian shelling as the family tried to evacuate Irpin, Ukraine, according to a statement from her employer, SE Ranking.

Another unidentified man, thought to have been a family friend, also died from the blast.

Perebeinis, 43, served as SE Ranking's chief accountant. The Bay Area tech company issued a statement on Monday confirming the deaths.

""There are no words to describe our grief or to mend our pain. But for us, it is crucial to not let Tania and her kids Alise and Nikita remain just statistics. Her family became the victim of the unprovoked fire on civilians, which under any law is a crime against humanity,"" the company said in the statement.

Ksenia Khirvonina, a PR manager for SE Ranking, said Perebeinis was originally from Donetsk and fled to Kyiv in 2014 following the city's occupation. Tatiana, her children, and her husband had been living in an apartment in the northern city of Irpin, just outside Kyiv, since 2018.

Though much of Irpin had been left without water supply, electricity, and heating, Perebeinis was hesitant to leave the city because she had been taking care of her sick mother. One day before they fled, the apartments above their home were bombed, forcing them to take shelter in the basement of their building, where they remained until Sunday, according to Khirvonina.

""Even from there, she was telling us everything's okay, was cheering everyone around her, and texting my colleagues that everything's gonna be okay,"" Khirvonina said.

According to Khirvonina, Perebeinis had wanted to leave on Saturday, but ultimately decided to wait to leave through the ""green corridor"" with other civilians.

Ukrainian photojournalist Andriy Dubchak captured the moment the family was struck by a mortar shell in a graphic video published by the New York Times.

""The Russian army are criminals, and they should be stopped. Our hearts are broken. Our prayers are for all Ukrainians, who are fighting for their right to exist,"" the company said.

Perebeinis was taken to a nearby hospital, where she later passed. Nikita, a university student, and Alise were killed immediately. The man with them also survived the initial blast but later died, according to the New York Times.

Previous media reports had mistakenly identified the man as the father of the children. Perebeinis' husband — with whom SE Ranking has been in touch — was not fleeing Irpin with the family and was in a different city at the time of their deaths.

Khirvonina said she did not know where Perebeinis and the children were planning on fleeing to, but that it likely would have been a western Ukrainian city. Ukrainian men over the age of 18 are banned from leaving the country, and Perebeinis had refused to leave her son Nikita.

""My overall impression was that they had a great family, they were united,"" Khirvonina said. ""Tatiana herself was very kind, very supportive person, you could always come to her to ask for advice for work advice or life advice, it didn't matter. She always cheered everyone around her up or with her stories and with her jokes. She was truly a great person.""

SE Ranking, which specializes in search engine optimization (SEO), has a global presence, including in San Francisco; London; Minsk, Belarus; Kyiv and Moscow.
