President Vladimir Putin has cast aside international condemnation and sanctions, warning other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to ""consequences you have never seen."" (AP)

MOSCOW: More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers and around 10 civilians died in the first hours of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, an aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters on Thursday.

""I know that more than 40 have been killed and several dozen wounded. I am aware of nearly 10 civilian losses,"" presidential administration aide Oleksiy Arestovych told reporters.

Russia's ground forces invaded Ukraine from several directions on Thursday, encircling the country within hours of President Vladimir Putin announcing his decision to launch an assault.

Heavy Russian tanks and other equipment crossed the frontier in a string of northern regions as well as from the Kremlin-annexed peninsula of Crimea in the south.

They were also advancing into the Western-backed government's territory along the eastern front, where a separatist insurgency has claimed more than 14,000 lives since 2014.

Ukraine's confirmed military death toll reached five a few hours after Putin launched the invasion.

But there were reports of major clashes across large parts of the vast eastern European country and the death toll seemed likely to climb throughout the day.

Ukraine claimed to have killed around 50 ""Russian occupiers"" while taking back control of the eastern frontline town of Shchastya.

AFP could not independently confirm the claim.

Although Ukraine has been riven by conflict in the east, which has forced some 1.5 million from their homes, it had reported no fatalities along its southern border with Crimea for some years.

But the border guard service reported some of the heaviest fighting near Crimea, where the servicemen died in Russian missile and helicopter attacks.

Russia has heavily fortified its positions on the peninsula, where it has had military bases since its takeover in 2014.

After holding a series of emergency calls with world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, Ukraine's leader Voldymyr Zelensky convened a meeting of the top military brass.

Zelensky ""gave orders to inflict maximum losses against the aggressor,"" Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Major General Valeriy Zaluzhny, said.

Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said Ukraine's forces were ""waging heavy combat"" and repelling Russian advances in some parts.

Kyiv airport bombed

Ukrainian officials said Russia was primarily targeting military infrastructure and silos, hitting a string of air fields.

These included Boryspil airport in Kyiv, the armed forces said.

Ukraine closed its airspace to civilian traffic. Tracking websites showed no civilian airliners within the country's airspace on Thursday.

The invasion was also staged from several positions in Belarus, where Russian armed forces have been holding massive military drills this months involving an estimated 30,000 troops.

But Belarus strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko said his forces were ""not taking part in this operation"".

Ukraine also claimed it had downed six Russian planes, a helicopter, and destroyed four tanks.

Moscow did not confirm suffering any casualties or other military losses.

In Ukraine's east, where AFP reporters heard violent explosions in several towns along the front, Russian-backed forces took control of several villages that had been under the government's control.

But Ukraine's armed forces claimed it had won back some areas in a counteroffensive.

The ministry said more than 30 Russian tanks had been destroyed, along with seven Russian aircraft and six helicopters.

This comes hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree ordering general mobilization, in the wake of Russian military operations.

""Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Hanna Malyar informs: Estimated losses of the enemy as of 03:00 25.02.2022 Aircraft 7 units Helicopters 6 units Tanks - more than 30 units. BBM - 130 units. The loss of enemy personnel is approximately (to be specified) 800 people,"" Ukraine's Defense Ministry tweeted in Ukrainian.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized Ukraine's breakaway regions - Donetsk and Luhansk - as independent entities. Later, Putin ordered special military operations ""to protect"" the people in the Donbas region.

Since then, several nations including the UK, the US and Canada have condemned Russia's military operations and imposed sanctions on Moscow. The European Union has decided to impose additional sanctions on Russia over the latter's military operation in Ukraine.

Earlier today, explosions were heard in the capital city of Kiev as the Russian special military operation entered the second day.

Ukraine's Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin said explosions were caused by Ukrainian ""anti-missile system shooting"" a missile out of the sky, CNN reported, noting that the inputs were not independently verified.

On Thursday, Russian Defense Ministry Spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said over 70 ground infrastructure facilities belonging to Ukraine were incapacitated by strikes carried out by Russia's Armed Forces.

""As a result of the strikes conducted by Russia's Armed Forces, 74 ground facilities of Ukraine's military infrastructure were knocked out of action. Among them are 11 airfields belonging to the Air Force, three command points, a Ukrainian Navy base and 18 radar stations of S-300 and Buk-M1 missile systems,"" Konashenkov was quoted as saying by TASS news agency.

The spokesperson further said that the Russian strikes are not targeting Ukrainian cities as well as social facilities in military garrisons. (ANI)

""Some say a few weeks. Others — several years. Some say the war will last until the end of this year. And someone advises to prepare for a permanent confrontation with Russia as long as it exists,"" he said in his nightly address to the nation.

But Zelenskyy says the ""effectiveness of instruments of influence"" on Russia used by Ukraine as well as its entire anti-war coalition against Russia must be taken into account, when predicting how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield is really significant. Historically significant. But not enough to clean our land from the occupiers yet. We'll beat them more,"" he said.

""Sanctions against Russia are very significant. Economically painful. But still not enough for the Russian military machine to be left without means of subsistence. We promote stronger, more destructive ones,"" Zelenskyy said.

These two areas, he says, will determine how long this war will last. The amount of support for Ukraine ""literally defines how many more Ukrainians the occupiers will manage to kill.""

""If someone says: year or years, I answer: you can make the war much shorter.

Putin of Russia invaded Ukraine, his military has already lost more soldiers, according to American intelligence estimates.

The conservative side of the estimate, at more than 7,000 Russian troop deaths, is greater than the number of American troops killed over 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.

It is a staggering number amassed in just three weeks of fighting, American officials say, with implications for the combat effectiveness of Russian units, including soldiers in tank formations. Pentagon officials say a 10 percent casualty rate, including dead and wounded, for a single unit renders it unable to carry out combat-related tasks.

With more than 150,000 Russian troops now involved in the war in Ukraine, Russian casualties, when including the estimated 14,000 to 21,000 injured, are near that level.

Its pilots and air defenses have prevented Russian fighter jets from conquering the skies. And a band of savvy Ukrainian cyberwarriors are so far beating Moscow in an information war, inspiring support at home and abroad.

To the surprise of many military analysts, Ukrainian troops are mounting a stiffer-than-expected resistance to Russian forces up and down battle lines across a country the size of Texas, fighting with a resourcefulness and creativity that U.S. analysts said could trip up Russian troops for weeks or months to come.

The Ukrainians are also exploiting a bungled beginning to Russia’s all-out assault. Armed with shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons, they have attacked a mileslong Russian armored convoy bearing down on Kyiv, the capital, helping stall an advance plagued by fuel and food shortages, and stretching a march that was expected to take a handful of days into possibly weeks.

To be sure, Russia’s invasion is only a week old. The strategic southern city of Kherson fell on Wednesday; the Kremlin’s army has intensified its bombardment of Kyiv and other cities; and, despite a flow of fresh arms pouring in from the West, Ukrainian leaders say they desperately need more weapons to destroy Russian tanks and down Russian warplanes.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/us/politics/russia-ukraine-military.html

The war in Ukraine has highlighted two things to Russia and the outside world: that Russia’s much-vaunted military revolution has been exaggerated and that Ukraine’s resistance to the invasion is total.

Russia’s military capabilities have been built up in Western eyes, particularly after its modernisation programme in the wake of the 2008 Georgian conflict. New equipment was ordered and training focused on realism as Russia’s armed forces were put on a more professional footing. A new doctrine, designed to give the military greater flexibility in responding to a variety of scenarios, was also developed.

Russia’s new “hybrid” military tactics were highlighted by the relatively bloodless takeover of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, when “grey” operations – those below the threshold of actual conflict – were seen. Russian soldiers gradually infiltrated the region without firing a shot, their mere presence achieving Russia’s strategic aim of taking Crimea.

Since then, Russia’s military has been running increasingly sophisticated annual large-scale exercises and has had months to build up its forces on the border of Ukraine, amassing supplies, fuel and ammunition for an invasion that few on the ground in Ukraine and in the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk believed would actually happen.

At most, a Russian military operation to partially seize the two breakaway republics was predicted, but when Russia finally invaded it went way beyond this – driving past Donetsk and Luhansk and advancing from multiple fronts right into the heart of the country.

And then it got stuck.

Russian military vehicles quickly ran out of fuel and soldiers ran out of food despite food and fuel stockpiles being nearby on the other side of the border.

Meanwhile, the hundreds of missile attacks and air strikes on Ukrainian bases and command and control centres, carried out on the first day, failed to achieve their aim of destroying Ukrainian military resistance.

Where is Russia’s air force?

These opening attacks saw Ukrainian airbases targeted but not destroyed; the Russian strikes lacked the intensity needed to stop the Ukrainian air force in its tracks.

Despite having an air force many times the size of Ukraine’s, Russia was unable to dominate the skies in the way necessary to protect the smooth and speedy advance of its mechanised columns of armour on the ground. These units now faced Ukrainian air strikes as they pushed deeper into the country.

This lack of coordination between Russian air and ground units left gaps in the defensive shield around advancing Russian armour, also allowing Ukrainian ground forces to successfully attack Russian armed helicopters, destroying many and depriving Russian army units of their protection and support.

Ukrainian air defence units successfully downed several Russian jets, further discouraging the Russian air force from flying too many sorties and dominating the target airspace, a vital objective in any conflict.

Ukrainian jets were able to fly combat missions, often flying low over towns and cities as a morale boost to the population. Despite initial losses, Ukrainian jets are still a serious challenge to Russia’s air force.

However, a deal to supply the country with Soviet legacy aircraft from its neighbours has fallen through and Ukraine is in desperate need of replacement jets if it is to prevent Russia from eventually dominating the skies over the battlefield. It may have to rely on its armed drones if it is to stop Russia.

Ukraine’s drones

Ukraine has made effective use of its meagre complement of armed UAVs or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Its Turkish-made TB2 armed UAVs have been flying combat missions, not only carrying out air strikes on Russian vehicles and command posts but conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions.

They act as real-time spotters for Ukraine’s long-range artillery, allowing the Ukrainian military to destroy columns of armour, supply trucks and troop concentrations before they even reach the battlefield, blunting Russia’s advance.

In the last week, more TB2s have been delivered to Ukraine from Turkey as part of a larger assistance package. This helps offset Ukraine’s smaller air force as the TB2 drones prove their worth.

Ukraine’s domestically made armed drone, The Punisher, while only armed with a small bomb, is very hard to detect and has inflicted damage on Russian air defence systems and radar that are vulnerable and easily knocked out of commission.

Russia, on the other hand, has been slow to develop its own armed UAVs and has only just started to deploy them in combat. This lack of ability to determine an opponent’s movements combined with a drone’s offensive capabilities has Russia at a real disadvantage as the Ukrainian military has had a far clearer picture of Russian objectives and tactics.

Morale

The tepid advance of Russian forces has been linked to poor leadership, lack of supplies and the low morale of Russian soldiers. Initial reports from captured personnel showed that many of them had been told that they were only being deployed on exercises, not to an active war zone.

There has also been a lack of understanding among the rank and file of the Russian military about why they are fighting this war, particularly as Russia and Ukraine have always been culturally linked.

Despite this initial reticence among some of the Russian soldiers to fight their neighbour, Russia has an estimated 150,000 troops in Ukraine, and many of them are highly motivated, well trained and well equipped. And while they may not have known where they were going at the beginning of the conflict, they certainly know now.

A drawn-out conflict will in some ways favour Russia as it uses these units to eventually wear down the Ukrainian military. Ukraine’s army of 126,000 at the start of the conflict was not small – it is, for example, larger than France’s – but Russia’s army is vast, comprising 280,000 soldiers with a further 50,000 airborne troops. Russia also has extensive experience of urban combat, formed in the Chechen capital Grozny and northern Syria, which will stand it in good stead in what is swiftly turning into a war for Ukraine’s major cities.

Nevertheless, a nimble Ukrainian opposition is consistently inflicting heavy losses on a slow-moving Russian military that has had its reputation tarnished by its ineptitude. There is a distinct possibility that Russia will become increasingly heavy-handed in its attempts to capture Ukrainian population centres as Ukraine’s united resolve to defend its land results in Russian casualties and reverses on the battlefield.

Total war

Ukraine’s response to the invasion has been nothing short of total. The entire country has been mobilised. Many have fled, but many more remain and are contributing to the fight.

Volunteer units dig trenches, and fortify buildings and strong points around the towns and cities they live in. Improvised tank traps have been built along likely approaches for Russian armour. Food kitchens have been set up all over the country as meals are cooked, then distributed to local volunteers.

Ukraine’s army has been dramatically expanded as reservists and volunteers swamp recruitment stations. Media teams on the ground report that newly formed units manning checkpoints and roadblocks have become more disciplined and professional, as the entire country focuses on one thing only – resisting the enemy.

Politically, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has excelled at getting his message across, inspiring resistance and sustained effort. Russian President Vladimir Putin, by contrast, seems isolated and out of touch, his inner circle now hammered by unprecedented sanctions.

The propaganda war has gone into full swing as social media is inundated with the very real images of suffering and stoic preparation and training by a civilian population determined to fight. Very few images are shown of regular Ukrainian military units. However, it is not enthusiastic civilians destroying columns of Russian armour but Ukraine’s armed forces that are doing the bulk of the damage to Russia. Little is coming out from the Russian side that is not a defence ministry handout.

Yet, despite Ukraine’s valiant efforts the Russians slowly advance. The capital, Kyiv, is being approached from two sides, Ukraine’s major cities are being contested, with Kherson in the south under Russian control.

The race is now on to pressure Russia to stop the conflict. The outside world is using severe sanctions and large arms transfers, and the Ukrainians themselves are attempting to inflict losses on a scale that will be unacceptable to Russia.

Even if Russia was to somehow win this war, the ensuing insurgency would ensure a constant stream of body bags back to the small towns and villages that still form Putin’s power base, further eroding any legitimacy he has left.",https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/3/9/total-war-how-ukraine-mobilised-a-country-as-russia-overreached-2

The package takes aim at a range of sectors including finance, transport and energy. It imposes export controls, includes new visa measures and adds more Russians to a sanctions list.

“The package of massive and targeted sanctions European leaders approved tonight clearly demonstrates that it will have maximum impact on the Russian economy and the political elite,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a news conference early Friday.

“Our unity is our strength,” she said. “The Kremlin knows this. And it has tried its best to divide us but it has utterly failed.”

More details are expected Friday. But in a series of tweets, von der Leyen said that the sanctions would affect everything from Russia’s ability to upgrade its oil refineries to the ability of businessmen and diplomats to obtain visas.

She said that the sanctions target 70 percent of the Russian banking market and ban the sale of aircraft to Russian airlines.

One question going into the talks was whether the E.U. would heed calls from eastern European countries to cut Russia off from the Swift global payment system. However, President Joe Biden said Thursday Swift was not part of the plan because, “that’s not the position the rest of Europe chooses to take” — suggesting they were overruled.

European leaders have warned for weeks of devastating sanctions, but have been divided on when and how to proceed. Some countries initially hoped to deter a Russian invasion by hitting the country with one big sanctions package, others pressed for an incremental approach.

There has also been public disagreement about whether certain sectors, such as energy, should be excluded because of the potential economic impact on Europe. However, the sight of tanks rolling into eastern Ukraine seemed to quiet the chatter.

On Tuesday, the E.U. announced a first round of penalties that targeted Kremlin officials, lawmakers, three banks and also restricted Russian access to E.U. financial and capital markets.

Putin invaded anyway, sending the bloc scrambling for next steps.

E.U. officials promised that the second tranche would be a tougher blow.

“These events mark the beginning of a new era. Putin is trying to subjugate a friendly European country. He is trying to redraw the map of Europe by force. He must and he will fail,” von der Leyen said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/24/russia-ukraine-attack-news/

Things are moving fast in Ukraine so here's a re-cap of the latest developments on the ground and reaction to Russia's invasion. Much of the information coming from both sides remains unverified but it is clear that Russia is mounting a major assault.

Russian missile strikes and explosions have been reported near major cities and targeting military infrastructure. Russia says it has destroyed more than 70 military targets.

The Ukrainian military claims to have shot down at least six Russian aircraft but this has not been confirmed.

Fierce fighting is reported in the east, where Russian forces are said to have attacked a hospital in the Donetsk region. There have been clashes in the port cities of Odesa and Mariupol, and in Kharkiv, in the north-east.

Russia appears to be in control of the Antonov airbase, around 15-20 miles outside Kyiv. But Ukraine says it is fighting back and a battle appears to be continuing there.

The number of overall casualties continues to be unclear. Dozens of military personnel and civilians are reported killed.
