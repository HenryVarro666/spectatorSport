Russian assets to be frozen

EU not cutting Russia off SWIFT for now -source

BRUSSELS, Feb 24 (Reuters) - European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to impose new economic sanctions on Russia, joining the United States and Britain in trying to punish President Vladimir Putin and his allies for unleashing a full-scale attack on Ukraine.

However, the bloc held back from taking the harshest measures sought by Ukraine and split over just how far to take the sanctions, leaving details to be worked out in the coming days.

Leaders of the 27-nation bloc lambasted Putin at an emergency summit in Brussels, with Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins describing him as ""a deluded autocrat creating misery for millions"".

The EU will freeze Russian assets in the bloc and halt its banks' access to European financial markets as part of what EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described as ""the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented"".

The sanctions will also target Russia's energy and transport sectors among others, and seek to stifle its trade and manufacturing with export controls.

""Our sanctions will hurt the Russian economy in its heart,"" said Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo.

But a sense of powerlessness was tangible after Western failed to to stop a war that they leaders had seen coming.

""We were not successful enough, not decisive enough, to prevent Russia from this step, which is a tragedy for Ukraine, a tragedy for Europe and a tragedy for Russia itself,"" said Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda.

There are differences within the EU over how far to go with sanctions, with countries that would face the biggest economic backlash keen to keep the most severe steps in reserve.

""Hopefully, we will make big strides tomorrow on how these sanctions will look specifically,"" said Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra. ""For the Netherlands, SWIFT is part of the discussion.""

'MASSIVE AND SEVERE CONSEQUENCES'

An EU diplomat said the bloc, like the United States, would stop short of taking steps to cut Russia off from the SWIFT global interbank payments system. read more

Ukraine and the EU's ex-Soviet Baltic states had been pushing to remove Russia from the system. But asked about SWIFT, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said: ""We need to keep sanctions ready for later times.""

Germany has already put approval of the Russian-owned Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline on ice.

In a statement agreed at the summit, EU leaders said the new round of sanctions ""will impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its action, in close coordination with our partners and allies"".

Russian assets in the EU would be frozen and Russian banks' access to Europe's financial markets would be blocked.

An EU diplomat said Italy, Germany and Cyprus were among those that preferred a step-by-step approach, while central European and Baltic states - those closest to Russia - wanted a harder stance.

""Russia needs to feel that the price of aggression is significant,"" said Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa, wearing a tie with the Ukrainian flag's yellow and blue colours.

The EU had already approved a first round of sanctions on Wednesday, including blacklisting Russian politicians and curbing trade between the EU and two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine whose independence Moscow has recognised. read more

The EU will also prepare a new aid package for Ukraine and new sanctions against Belarus, used by some of the Russian invaders to enter Ukraine.

Separately, the bloc also promised support to Moldova, another ex-Soviet republic where a pro-Western government is at odds with its former overlord Moscow.

""If he (Putin) can attack Ukraine, it could be any other European country. The democratic ideas, if they were to get to Russia, they would overturn his government. He is fighting for power,"" said Latvia's Karins.

Europe’s reserves stand at just 30 percent, and Europeans are already paying exorbitant prices for energy.

The European Union will block Russia’s access to critical technology and other markets as punishment for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, European President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday.

Von der Leyen made a brief public appearance to announce the new measures just hours after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sending troops across the border from several directions and bombing targets across the country.

Innocent people, von der Leyen said, “are dying of fear for their lives.”

She vowed the EU would respond forcefully.

“We will target the strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking the access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia,” von der Leyen said, reading from a prepared statement. “We will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets.”

“These sanctions,” she added, “are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin’s interests and their ability to finance war.”

The Commission presented a draft package of measures to ambassadors from EU countries on Thursday morning, according to three diplomats. The package includes export controls on technology — including technology with links to the oil and transport sector — and further sanctions on banks, other entities and individuals, the diplomats said.

However, the package does not include kicking Russia out of the SWIFT international payments system, according to diplomats. Baltic countries have called for such a step but Germany and Italy have been far more hesitant.

“SWIFT is not there for now, it needs a political decision. It’s for leaders to decide,” said one of the diplomats.

Standing next to von der Leyen, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell promised the penalties would constitute “the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented.”

The new penalties will be presented Thursday evening at an emergency summit of EU leaders.

“We will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernize,” von der Leyen said.

The punishment will build on an initial raft of penalties the EU approved Wednesday in response to Russia’s initial troop deployment into eastern Ukraine’s contested Donbass region. European Council President Charles Michel called the emergency EU leaders’ summit following that decision.

“Russia’s target is not only Donbass, the target is not only Ukraine,” von der Leyen said. “The target is the stability in Europe. And the whole of the international peace order.”

The first round of EU penalties went after several members of Putin’s inner circle, including his defense minister. It also targeted military commanders, prominent media personalities who trumpet Kremlin talking points, banking executives and state-controlled financial institutions.

The penalties overlapped with others imposed by the U.S. and U.K., while going father in some areas.

But the EU and its allies have yet to go after a number of more damaging targets, such as Russia’s lucrative energy sector, or its import of key technologies like semiconductors. Also not yet targeted for sanctions is Putin himself.

“These are among the darkest hours for Europe since the end of World War II,” Borrell said.

The EU statement said the sanctions cover:

the financial sector,

the energy and transport sectors,

dual-use goods as well as export controls and export financing,

visa policy,

additional sanctions against Russian individuals.

However, both the EU and US decided for the time being not to cut Russia off from the SWIFT global interbank payments system, as demanded by Ukraine.

What EU leaders said about the sanctions

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would target 70% of the Russian banking market and key state owned companies, including in defense.

The export ban would ""hit the oil sector by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries,"" von der Leyen said. The EU was also banning the sale of aircrafts and equipment to Russian airlines, she added.

The visa restrictions will see diplomats and business people no longer having privileged access to the European Union.

European Council President Charles Michel said the measures would have ""massive and severe consequences"" for Russia in response to the ""unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine.""

The sanctions, which come after Russia invaded Ukraine Thursday morning, had been billed by the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borell as ""one of the harshest packages of sanctions we have ever implemented.""

The EU approved a first round of sanctionsafter Russia recognized two separatist breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Those sanctions, which went into effect Wednesday, mainly took aim at Russian banks and lawmakers.

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told reporters upon his arrival at the summit that he was open for discussion on the topic, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was important to agree ""to those measures that have been prepared — and keep everything else for a situation where it may be necessary to go beyond that.""

How the EU reacted to Russia's invasion of Ukraine

Russia's attack Thursday drew widespread condemnation from Western powers, as social media videos emerged of people lining up at gas stations or grocery stores in several Ukrainian cities, with people faced with the decision of either staying put at their homes or fleeing the country.

European Commission President von der Leyen condemned the attack in the morning, calling it ""barbaric"" and accusing Russia's Putin of bringing ""war back to Europe.""

""With this package, we will target the strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key to Russia,"" von der Leyen said.

Sanctions would aim at weakening Russian economy and its ""capacity to modernize,"" she said.

""Sanctions would also freeze Russian assets in Europe and block Moscow's access to European financial markets,"" von der Leyen added.

Lithuania's President Gitanas Nauseda, who declared a state of emergency for two weeks hours after Russian attack on Ukraine, said EU member states would also discuss offering EU candidate status to Ukraine, a measure Kyiv has long sought.

Josep Borrell said he had summoned the Russian ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, in Brussels. The EU has demanded that Putin immediately withdrew troops from Ukrainian territory, EU foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stano said in a statement released earlier in the day.

""We will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia. We will weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernise,"" she said in a press conference in Brussels, speaking ahead of an emergency EU summit later in the day.

""We will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets,"" she added.

""These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war,"" she said.

The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, speaking alongside her, said he would coordinate evacuations of EU nationals and EU diplomatic personnel still in Ukraine.

He vowed to make Russia face ""unprecedented isolation"" on the world stage by reaching out to Europe's international allies.

Russia's assault on Ukraine has also prompted debate in Germany and further afield about sending weapons to Ukraine.

""I was against arms deliveries in order to keep channels of communication with Moscow open. That's over for now. What matters now is defence. Whatever #weapons we can provide, we must deliver to #Ukraine,"" Norbert Röttgen, a senior German MP tweeted.

""Innocent women and children are dying or fearing for their lives,"" von der Leyen also said Thursday, amid the first reports of casualties from Ukraine in international media.

Borrell called the events ""the darkest hours for Europe since the days of World War 2"". ""It's costing many lives, with unknown consequences ahead of us,"" he added.

""A major nuclear power has attacked a neighbouring country and is threatening reprisals against any other states that may come to its rescue,"" he said.

The EU, on Wednesday night, prior to Russia's attack, already adopted its first tranche of Russia sanctions by imposing visa-bans and asset freezes on 374 Russian individuals and four entities.

The EU's ""massive"" economic sanctions were drawn up last April in coordination with the US and the UK, when Russia began its build up of military forces around Ukraine, but have remained a closely guarded secret.

An EU sanctions options paper drafted in 2014, when Russia first attacked Ukraine, indicated how far EU leaders might be willing to go.

It outlined three scenarios: low-intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity.

The EU's 2014 ""high-intensity"" option named five steps: ""capital market restrictions""; ""prohibition of new investment in Russia""; ""strict application of EU regulatory rules to Russian assets in EU companies""; an ""import ban on gas""; and ""an import ban on oil"".

No leaders mentioned halting Russian gas or oil imports in the run-up to Thursday's events.

But according to research by the Kiel Institute for World Economy, a German think-tank, a Russia gas embargo by the EU and its allies, including the US, the UK, and Japan, would cost Russia 2.9 percent of its GDP and an oil embargo a further 1.2 percent, while doing little immediate harm to Europe.

""The medium-term economic consequences of trade embargoes would hit Russia much harder than the Western allies,"" Kiel's Hendrik Mahlkow said.",https://euobserver.com/world/154423

“We are working flat out on how the collateral damage of a decoupling from SWIFT can be limited in such a way that it hits the right people,” Germany’s Foreign Minister Anna Baerbock and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said.

“What we need is a targeted and functional limitation of SWIFT,” they added in a joint statement.

EURACTIV understand this effectively means Berlin has dropped its veto. However, it is not yet clear how the German government exactly aims to make the SWIFT restrictions more “targeted”.

Germany fears an economic backlash if Russia is ejected from the system used by thousands of banks to facilitate transactions globally.

The announcement came as Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda paid a visit to Berlin to urge Germany to support bolder sanctions against Russia.

“I came to Berlin to shake the conscience of Germany so that they would finally decide on truly harsh sanctions that will influence the Kremlin’s decisions,” Morawiecki told reporters outside Scholz’s office.

Both leaders said they will urge the EU to go further in their support for Ukraine.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had said he would be against including the SWIFT international payments system in new EU sanctions against Russia when speaking in Brussels at an EU summit on Thursday (24 February), insisting this option should be kept for later.

SWIFT has been one of the bones of contention when EU leaders met to discuss the second sanctions package on Russia, for which the option had not been on the table.

Eastern Europeans, Baltics and some Nordics, all indicated they favour a ban. EU members such as Germany, Italy and Austria, highly dependent on gas, had been reluctant to take such a step since European countries use SWIFT to pay for Russian gas.

Just as the previous two sanction packages, the decision requires unanimity among all 27 member states.

Earlier this week, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba expressed his anger and displeasure at EU reluctance, warning that the “European and US politicians would have blood on their hands if they failed to impose the heaviest toll on Moscow by cutting Russia from the so-called SWIFT payments system.” On Saturday, Kuleba said : “I urged to immediately introduce the third package of EU sanctions to stop Russian invasion.”

With Russian and Ukrainian forces clashing on the outskirts of Kyiv, and Western military officials saying they are less optimistic about whether the Ukrainian capital can withstand, the moment to discuss SWIFT might have arrived, several EU diplomats told EURACTIV.

“It is not unlikely that, provided all member states agree to consider the option, we could bring this on the way in the next few days if the situation in Ukraine further deteriorates, which it effectively already has, with Russian troops closing in on Kyiv,” one EU diplomat told EURACTIV.

The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said on Friday a decision on SWIFT could happen in the “coming days.”

According to EU diplomats, an extraordinary foreign ministers meeting is scheduled for Sunday evening (27 February) for 18:00 CET to discuss further sanctions, which could include a discussion among member states to consider throwing Russia out of SWIFT.

Opposition crumbles

In a communiqué issued earlier on Friday, EU finance ministers said they had asked the European Commission and the European Central Bank “to assess the consequences of cutting off Russian institutions’ access to the financial system even further. All options are on the table.”

France, who currently holds the EU Council presidency, said Paris would not be opposed in principle to cutting Russia from SWIFT.

“SWIFT is the financial nuclear weapon,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said after a meeting of EU finance ministers. “The fact remains that when you have a nuclear weapon in your hands, you think before you use it. Some member countries have expressed reservations, we take them into account.”

“France is not one of these countries, I want to say this very clearly,” he added.

“We are not reluctant to use all the necessary weapons, without exception, against the Russia of Vladimir Putin, but there must be a European consensus,” Le Maire said, noting that “it’s understandable that some countries” would consider the economic impact before adopting more extensive sanctions options.

Italy, which had been reluctant to take that step, will support any EU line on sanctions against Russia, including measures on the SWIFT global payment system, Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s office said on Saturday.

Draghi held a phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday, confirming his support for the step.

Cyprus, which has extensive business links with both Russia and Ukraine, was speculated to be among countries with reservations about quickly ejecting Moscow from SWIFT.

However, Cypriot Finance Minister Constantinos Petrides said on Saturday that “in the name of EU unity and solidarity to Ukrainian people, Cyprus has NOT objected to ANY EU sanctions including cutting Russia off SWIFT”.

“Everything is on the table.”

Partners are waiting

Western nations threatened to exclude Russia from SWIFT in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea, but stopped short of such an option.

Such a step from the Western side would mark a further escalation from the two concerted sanctions imposed by Western powers against Russia earlier this week, including rare sanctions aimed personally at Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

The United States, Canada and Britain reiterated on Friday (25 February) they could act to exclude Russia from SWIFT in a further round of sanctions aimed at halting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier this week, US President Joe Biden initially ruled out removing Russia from SWIFT despite calls to do so from a number of US lawmakers, world leaders and Ukrainian officials.

“Right now that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,” Biden quipped when announcing a batch of US sanctions on Thursday.

What would that mean in practice?

SWIFT, founded in 1973, is a member-owned cooperative based in Belgium that provides secure global financial messaging services and allows banks to execute payments and transfers of other financial instruments across national borders.

It links more than 11,000 institutions across more than 200 countries.

Exclusion from SWIFT would mean that there would be no possibility to execute transactions between Russia and most of the rest of the world with immediate effect. With the German government aiming for a “targeted” restriction, it is not yet clear how many transactions will be affected.

An exclusion from SWIFT would not directly affect bank transfers within Russia and between Russia and China. For both cases, parallel systems have been developed.

There are ways for banks to do international transactions without SWIFT, but they are expensive, complex, and require a high degree of interbank trust.

Meanwhile, more than half of Russian government revenues are generated through fossil fuel exports. Through an exclusion from SWIFT, most of these exports would not be paid anymore, which would lead to a deterioration of Russian government finances and could likely limit its ability to finance war efforts.

As Russia would not be able to be paid for its gas exports anymore, Moscow would most probably be forced to stop gas exports to Europe, which could cause a spike of already high gas prices, hitting the EU economy as a whole, but especially those countries that are highly dependent on Russian gas.

This would include several mainly Eastern European countries, Germany, and Italy.

Moreover, the cut-off from most international payments could throw the Russian economy into recession.

In the past, SWIFT has resisted calls to impose bans on certain countries, describing itself as neutral. But in 2012, the EU barred SWIFT from serving Iranian firms and individuals sanctioned in relation to Tehran’s nuclear programme.

According to expert, this has set a precedent for action against Russia.
