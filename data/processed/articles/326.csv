Russia said it struck military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in ""high-precision, long-range attacks,"" and local officials said missiles did strike the airfields or at least near them, killing several people. ""Three missiles hit our military airfield. There is one dead,"" Lutsk Mayor Ihor Polishchuk said on Facebook. He said the city's missile alert system ""did not work at all,"" and ""the military will work on this issue."" The alert system also failed to go off in Ivano-Frankivsk.

Regional administrator Yuriy Pohulyayko said the strikes on Lutsk killed two soldiers and injured six more. Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk are far from Russia's main offensives in Ukraine, and the presumptive goal was to hit Ukraine's MiG-29 fighter jets or runways being used to resupply Ukraine with weapons.

Russia hit three new cities on Friday, tweeted Ukrainian lawmaker Inna Sovsun. ""That's what I tell journalists who ask if I'm in a safe city. There's no safe city here.""",https://theweek.com/russo-ukrainian-war/1011190/russian-missiles-hit-western-ukrainian-cities-lutsk-and-ivano-frankivsk

BREAKING: Russian forces blow up a military airbase in Lutsk.

SHOCKING footage shows huge explosions rocking the Ukrainian city of Lutsk in the early hours of Friday, March 11, with a military airbase reportedly blown up as part of the airstrikes. Many people online are accusing Russia of using thermobaric bombs in Ukraine, which they believe is the case in this latest attack.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on March 11 that Russian troops have launched a high-precision, long-range attack on two military airfields in the Ukrainian cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk and both have been taken out of action, as per the Jerusalem Post.

Reports of airstrikes on the Lutsk military airbase circa 130km from Lviv in northwest Ukraine have been circulating on social media since March 11. Unverified video footage shows HUGE explosions and there have been reports of significant damage to the area around the blast as fire rage on.

According to local reports, several aircraft are secured at the base, while the missile attack is also believed to have hit the Lutsk aircraft repair plant “Motor”, said to be the only enterprise in Ukraine to repair RD-33 engines for the MiG-29.

Lutsk also has a major oil depot located near where the bombs dropped and a major fire has been reported at one of the facilities.

It is reportedly the first time that Lutsk, which is located only 90km from the Polish border, has come under Russian attack.

A statement from public utility company Lutskteplo, which is based in Lutsk, said that: “Due to the turbulence in Lutsk, two boilers on Karbyshev and Volodymyrska Streets have been suspended for an hour. The boilers will resume operation after the situation is stabilised.”

The mayor of the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, Ruslan Martsinkiv, has confirmed that explosions occurred at the city’s local airport overnight on March 10-11, and that the air raid alert system failed to warn of incoming missile strikes.

“The enemy struck at Frankivsk. Do not share photos and videos of the explosions. We're investigating why the alert system did not work,” he said in a video message posted on Facebook.

He added that the military and employees of the State Emergency Service were working on the spot.

The local transport authority, Elektroavtotrans, reported that ""vehicle traffic is temporarily restricted in the area of the airport and nearby vil-lages.”

Russian missile strikes also hit a Ukrainian military airfield of another western city, Lutsk, according to Yuriy Pohulyayko, the head of the Volyn Regional State Administration.

5,8d8cba24-c024-4c60-a74f-f5d1b55cefe6,[],,"MARIUPOL, Ukraine (AP) — Russian strikes hit near airports Friday in the western Ukrainian cities of Ivano-Frankiivsk and Lutsk, far from Russia’s main offensive, possibly indicating a new direction in the war.

The mayor of Ivano-Frankiivsk, Ruslan Martsinkiv, ordered residents in neighboring areas to head to shelters after an air raid alert. The mayor of Lutsk also announced an airstrike near the airport. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

New satellite photos, meanwhile, appeared to show a massive convoy outside the Ukrainian capital had fanned out into towns and forests near Kyiv with artillery pieces raised for firing in another potentially ominous movement.

The photos emerged amid more international efforts to isolate and sanction Russia, particularly after a deadly airstrike on a maternity hospital in the port city of Mariupol that Western and Ukrainian officials decried as a war crime.

The US and other nations were poised Friday to announce the revocation of Russia’s “most favored nation” trade status, which would allow higher tariffs to be imposed on some Russian imports.

Unbowed by the sanctions, Russia kept up its bombardment of the besieged southern seaport of Mariupol while Kyiv braced for an onslaught, its mayor boasting that the capital had become practically a fortress protected by armed civilians.

Three Russian airstrikes hit the eastern industrial city of Dnipro on Friday, killing at least one person, according to Interior Ministry adviser Anton Heraschenko. Meanwhile, Russian forces were pushing toward Kyiv from the northwest and east but were repulsed from Chernihiv as Ukrainian fighters regained control of Baklanova Muraviika, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in a statement.

The convoy seen in satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showed the 40-mile (64-kilometer) line of vehicles, tanks and artillery had been redeployed, the company said. Armored units were seen in towns near the Antonov Airport north of the city. Some vehicles moved into forests, Maxar reported, with towed howitzers nearby in position to open fire.

The Russian column massed outside the city early last week, but its advance appeared to stall as reports of food and fuel shortages circulated. US officials said Ukrainian troops also targeted the convoy with anti-tank missiles.

Still, the immediacy of the threat to Kyiv was unclear. A US defense official speaking on condition of anonymity said Russian forces moving toward Kyiv had advanced about 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) in the past 24 hours, with some elements as close as 15 kilometers (about 9 miles) from the city.

The official did not indicate if the convoy had dispersed or otherwise repositioned in a significant way, saying some vehicles were seen moving off the road into the tree line in recent days.

In Mariupol, a city of 430,000, the situation was increasingly dire as civilians trapped inside the city scrounged for food and fuel. More than 1,300 people have died in the 10-day siege of the frigid city, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Residents have no heat or phone service, and many have no electricity. Nighttime temperatures are regularly below freezing, and daytime ones normally hover just above it. Bodies are being buried in mass graves. The streets are littered with burned-out cars, broken glass and splintered trees.

“They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to mock it, to constantly bomb and shell it,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. He said the Russians began a tank attack right where there was supposed to be a humanitarian corridor.

On Thursday, firefighters tried to free a boy trapped in the rubble. One grasped the boy’s hand. His eyes blinked, but he was otherwise still. It was not clear if he survived. Nearby, at a mangled truck, a woman wrapped in a blue blanket shuddered at the sound of an explosion.

Grocery stores and pharmacies were emptied days ago by people breaking in to get supplies, according to a local official with the Red Cross, Sacha Volkov. A black market is operating for vegetables, meat is unavailable, and people are stealing gasoline from cars, Volkov said.

Places protected from bombings are hard to find, with basements reserved for women and children, he said. Residents, Volkov said, are turning on one another: “People started to attack each other for food.”

An exhausted-looking Aleksander Ivanov pulled a cart loaded with bags down an empty street flanked by damaged buildings.

“I don’t have a home anymore. That’s why I’m moving,” he said. “It doesn’t exist anymore. It was hit, by a mortar.”

Repeated attempts to send in food and medicine and evacuate civilians have been thwarted by Russian shelling, Ukrainian authorities said.

“They want to destroy the people of Mariupol. They want to make them starve,” Vereshchuk said. “It’s a war crime.”

The number of refugees fleeing the country topped 2.3 million, and some 100,000 people have been evacuated during the past two days from seven cities under Russian blockade in the north and center of the country, including the Kyiv suburbs, Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy told Russian leaders that the invasion will backfire on them as their economy is strangled. Western sanctions have already dealt a severe blow, causing the ruble to plunge, foreign businesses to flee and prices to rise sharply.

“You will definitely be prosecuted for complicity in war crimes,” Zelenskyy said in a video address, warning that “you will be hated by Russian citizens.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed such talk, saying the country has endured sanctions before.

″We will overcome them,” he said at a televised meeting of government officials. He did, however, acknowledge the sanctions create “certain challenges.”

In addition to those who have fled the country, millions have been driven from their homes inside Ukraine. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said about 2 million people, half the population of the metropolitan area, have left the capital.

“Every street, every house … is being fortified,” he said. “Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.”

On Thursday, a 14-year-old girl named Katya was recovering at the Brovary Central District Hospital on the outskirts of Kyiv after her family was ambushed as they tried to flee the area. She was shot in the hand when their car was raked with gunfire from a roadside forest, said her mother, who identified herself only as Nina.

The girl’s father, who drove frantically from the ambush on blown-out tires, underwent surgery. His wife said he had been shot in the head and had two fingers blown off.

Western officials said Russian forces have made little progress on the ground in recent days and are seeing heavier losses and stiffer Ukrainian resistance than Moscow apparently anticipated. But Putin’s forces have used air power and artillery to pummel Ukraine’s cities.

Early in the day, the Mariupol city council posted a video showing a convoy it said was bringing in food and medicine. But as night fell, it was unclear if those buses had reached the city.

A child was among three people killed in the hospital airstrike Wednesday. Seventeen people were also wounded, including women waiting to give birth, doctors, and children buried in the rubble. Images of the attack, with pregnant women covered in dust and blood, dominated news reports in many countries.

French President Emmanuel Macron called the attack “a shameful and immoral act of war.” Britain’s Armed Forces minister, James Heappey, said that whether the hospital was hit by indiscriminate fire or deliberately targeted, “it is a war crime.”

US Vice President Kamala Harris, on a visit to Ukraine’s neighbor Poland, backed calls for an international war-crimes investigation into the invasion, saying, “The eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities.”",https://www.timesofisrael.com/russia-expands-strikes-hitting-western-ukraine-airports-far-from-main-offensive/
