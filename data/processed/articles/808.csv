2,0162e2aa-c445-4108-978a-b3c8bbb138db,[],,"The Russian Federation Thursday announced its withdrawal from the Council of Europe (“the Council”). The country claimed that EU and NATO countries are using their absolute majority to continue to destroy the Council, of which Russia will no longer will be a part.

Russia joined the Council of Europe, a leading human rights organization of the continent, in 1996. President Boris Yeltsin declared a moratorium on death penalty for the countries’ policy to align with the ideology of the Council. In 1999, a constitutional court of the country had ruled that no death sentences could be imposed until the requirement of trial by jury was met in all regions of the federation. In the same year, President Yeltsin commuted 716 pending death sentences. This move was welcomed by the Council.

In 2009, the Constitutional Court decided to extend the moratorium on execution, which was due to expire in 2010, with Chechnya’s introduction of jury trial. To this day, however, the death penalty has not been explicitly abolished in the country and continues to be part of the penal code.

In light of the recent aggression and invasion against Ukraine by Russian forces, the Council suspended Russia’s right to representation in the Committee of Ministers. In the parliamentary assembly, the country was also suspended from the Council of Baltic Sea States.

In response to these sanctions, the Russian Federation decided to withdraw from the Council. In the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry, the country stated, “Russia won’t take part in transforming the oldest European organization by NATO members and those obediently following them in the EU into yet another site for chanting about the West’s superiority and grandstanding. Let them enjoy interacting with each other, without Russia.” Soon after, former President Dmitry Medvedev said that this withdrawal would be a suitable opportunity for the country to reverse its position on death penalty.

Russia’s membership in the Council has played a critical role in ensuring that the country continued to maintain a favorable position on the death penalty. Its withdrawal essentially means a denunciation of the the charter and the European Convention of Human Rights. Thus, the country would no longer be bound by the Council to maintain a moratorium on the death penalty, exponentially raising the chances of a return to capital punishment.",https://www.jurist.org/news/2022/03/russia-withdraws-from-council-of-europe/

Former President Dmitry Medvedev said Russia’s suspension from the Council of Europe was a “good opportunity” to reinstate the death penalty.

The Council of Europe suspended all Russian representatives from participation the day after President Vladimir Putin announced an invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The decision did not affect the European Court of Human Rights.

The Kremlin placed a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, which remains enshrined in Russian law, as a condition of Council of Europe membership in 1996.

Russia has announced it will withdraw from Europe’s oldest rule-of-law body, the Council of Europe, sparking questions over the future of the Kremlin’s moratorium on the death penalty.

“Russia will not participate in the transformation of the oldest European organization into another platform for invocations of Western superiority and narcissism by NATO and its obedient follower, the EU,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday.

“Let them enjoy talking to each other without Russia.”

The Foreign Ministry’s strongly worded two-paragraph statement did not indicate when Russia intended to withdraw from the 47-member organization.

Russia’s membership will expire at the end of fiscal year 2022, Senator Konstantin Kosachev, deputy chairman of the upper house of Russian parliament, told state media.

Kosachev said Russia’s exit from the Council of Europe entails a denunciation of its charter and the European Convention on Human Rights, which binds member states to abolish the death penalty.

The Kremlin echoed Kosachev’s assertion that Russia’s exit from the Council of Europe entails withdrawal from “all of its institutions.”

Human rights lawyer Pavel Chikov said Russia’s exit from the Council of Europe requires a new law to pass in parliament, after which its withdrawal would be finalized on Jan. 1, 2023, at the earliest.

“Only the committee of ministers can expel Russia earlier,” Chikov wrote on his Telegram channel.

Meanwhile, Chikov said the European Court of Human Rights will still be required to hear the estimated 15,000 claims filed by Russian nationals, as well as those lodged before Russia’s formal exit from the Council of Europe.

Chikov accused Russia’s Foreign Ministry and Senators Kosachev and Andrei Klimov of “making waves.”

He added that Russia’s exit from the Council of Europe does not automatically reinstate capital punishment.",https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/03/10/russia-quits-europes-rule-of-law-body-sparking-questions-over-death-penalty-a76854

It pointed out that “the European Council continues to violate its principles and common humanitarian laws in Europe.”

MOSCOW. March 10 (Interfax) - Russia's withdrawal from the Council of Europe does not mean that Russia will reinstate the death penalty, Federation Council Deputy Speaker Konstantin Kosachyov said.

""No, we have our own constitution and our own Constitutional Court. Decisions regarding death penalty are not only and not so much a matter of our obligations to the Council of Europe,"" Kosachyov told Interfax on Thursday when asked whether Russia's withdrawal from the Council of Europe might make the reinstatement of the death penalty in Russia possible.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said earlier that Russia had no intention to participate in the activities of the Council of Europe, which were being undermined by Western nations.

Speaking of the procedure of withdrawal from the Council of Europe, Kosachyov said that it was done on the basis of Article 7 of the Council of Europe Statute, at the initiative of the withdrawing party, which gives a respective formal notice to the Council of Europe secretary general.

""The membership is terminated at the end of the current fiscal year if the notice is sent within the first nine months of the year. Whenever a notice is sent within the last three months of a financial year, the membership is terminated at the end of the next fiscal year. The withdrawal mechanism envisages the simultaneous renouncement of the Council of Europe Statute and the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms [the European Convention on Human Rights],"" he said.

""The renouncement does not exempt the relevant country from obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights for any actions that might have resulted from a breach of these obligations and might have been committed before the renouncement date (Article 58.2 of the Convention),"" Kosachyov said.",https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/76164/

The decision follows the suspension of Russia’s rights of representation by the COE’s Committee of Ministers on February 25 – the day after the conflict started – which initiated Article 8 of the organisation’s statute.

Yesterday, Russia formally notified the COE’s Secretary General of its withdrawal under Article 7 of the statute, and of its intention to denounce the European Convention on Human Rights. Later the same day, the Parliamentary Assembly of the COE voted unanimously to exclude Russia as a member state.

For more than 18 years, EHRAC has been working with Russian human rights lawyers to bring cases to the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of victims of human rights abuses, including those arising from conflict, repression of civil society and discrimination.

Jess Gavron, EHRAC Legal Director, said: “Russia’s removal from the Council of Europe is a devastating blow to access to justice for Russian people, and those in territories controlled by Russia.

“EHRAC will continue to work with and support our Russian colleagues to seek alternative means to hold Russia to account for its actions in Russia and abroad through other avenues of international justice.”",https://ehrac.org.uk/en_gb/russia-set-to-leave-council-of-europe-and-denounce-european-convention-on-human-rights/

: 1958 (as Council of the European Economic Community) Location : Brussels (Belgium)

: Brussels (Belgium) Website: Council of the EU

In the Council of the EU, informally also known as the Council, government ministers from each EU country meet to discuss, amend and adopt laws, and coordinate policies. The ministers have the authority to commit their governments to the actions agreed on in the meetings.

Together with the European Parliament, the Council is the main decision-making body of the EU.

Not to be confused with:

European Council - quarterly summits, where EU leaders meet to set the broad direction of EU policy making

Council of Europe - not an EU body at all

What does the Council do?

negotiates and adopts EU laws , together with the European Parliament, based on proposals from the European Commission

, together with the European Parliament, based on proposals from the European Commission coordinates EU countries' policies

EU countries' policies develops the EU's foreign & security policy , based on European Council guidelines

, based on European Council guidelines concludes agreements between the EU and other countries or international organisations

between the EU and other countries or international organisations adopts the annual EU budget - jointly with the European Parliament

Composition

There are no fixed members of the EU Council. Instead, the Council meets in 10 different configurations, each corresponding to the policy area being discussed. Depending on the configuration, each country sends their minister responsible for that policy area.

For example, when the Council meeting on economic and financial affairs (the ""Ecofin Council"") is held, it is attended by each country's finance minister.

Who chairs the meetings?

The Foreign Affairs Council has a permanent chairperson - the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. All other Council meetings are chaired by the relevant minister of the country holding the rotating EU presidency.

For example, any Environment Council meeting in the period when Estonia holds the presidency will be chaired by the Estonian environment minister.

Overall consistency is ensured by the General Affairs Council - which is supported by the Permanent Representatives Committee. This is composed of EU countries' Permanent Representatives to the EU, who are, in effect, national ambassadors to the EU.

Eurozone countries

Eurozone countries coordinate their economic policy through the Eurogroup, which consists of their economy and finance ministers. It meets the day before Economic & Financial Affairs Council meetings. Agreements reached in Eurogroup gatherings are formally decided upon in the Council the next day, with only ministers of Eurozone countries voting on those issues.

How does the Council work?

EU ministers meet in public when they discuss or vote on draft legislative acts

to be passed, decisions usually require a qualified majority : 55% of countries (with 27 current members, this means 15 countries ) representing at least 65 % of total EU population

: You can watch the Council's public sessions live in all EU languages. When a Council meeting is public, so are its minutes and votes.

To block a decision, at least 4 countries are needed (representing at least 35% of total EU population)

exception - sensitive topics like foreign policy and taxation require a unanimous vote (all countries in favour).

- sensitive topics like foreign policy and taxation require a (all countries in favour). Simple majority is required for procedural & administrative issues

The Council and you

You can put general questions to the Council's public information service.

9,0162e2aa-c445-4108-978a-b3c8bbb138db,[],2022-03-10 11:57:19,"Russia announced it would no longer participate in the Council of Europe (CoE), days after the pan-European human rights body suspended Moscow’s rights of representation following the invasion of Ukraine.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement was published by the state-owned TASS news agency on Thursday (10 March) and accused NATO and EU countries of “undermining” the European body.

“Russia does not intend to put up with these subversive actions carried out by the collective West in line with the imposition of a ‘rules-based order’ to replace international law trampled by the United States and its satellites,” said the Russian Foreign Ministry.

“Russia will not participate in the transformation by NATO and the EU obediently following them of the oldest European organisation into another platform for incantations about Western superiority and narcissism. Let them enjoy communicating with each other, without Russia.”

The Russian move is likely a preemptive action to avoid a vote in which Moscow could suffer a humiliating expulsion as most members vehemently oppose the ongoing attack of Ukraine.

On 25 February, the day after the Russian army invasion of Ukraine, the Council of Europe suspended Russia’s rights of representation by a vote in which only Russia and Armenia voted in favour, while the representatives of Serbia and Azerbaijan did not attend.

However, this decision did not exclude Russia from the Council of Europe, and it remained party to relevant Council of Europe conventions, including the European Convention on Human Rights.

At the time, the Council of Europe stated that “it leaves communication channels open”, and the judge tasked with dealing with the Russian Federation in the European Court of Human Rights would continue dealing with cases issued against the country.

“Suspension is not a final measure but a temporary one”, the Strasbourg body said on 25 February.

In the meantime, Russia’s stay in the CoE became untenable in light of the atrocities committed by its army in Ukraine. On Wednesday, Russian forces bombed a maternity hospital in Mariupol, killing at least three, including a child.

On Wednesday, CoE representatives said they “condemn in the strongest possible terms the Russian Federation’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, an unjustified military attack of one member State of the Council of Europe against another Member State. We reiterate our unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.”

Facing overwhelming condemnation from almost all other members was likely too much for Moscow. Furthermore, on Saturday, 5 March, Russia issued a list of “unfriendly” countries, including many fellow members of CoE.

Meanwhile, Dmitry Medvedev, the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia, stated that the country’s departure from the human rights body would allow Russia to reintroduce the death penalty.
