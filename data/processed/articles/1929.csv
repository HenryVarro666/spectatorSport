Officials say many residents trapped without supplies

Mayor says remaining residents must be evacuated

LVIV, Ukraine, March 28 (Reuters) - Nearly 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol since Russian forces laid siege to it, a spokesperson for the mayor said on Monday.

It was not immediately clear how Mayor Vadym Boichenko had calculated the toll from a month of Russian bombardment that has devastated the city and trapped tens of thousands of residents without power and with few supplies.

Boichenko's office said 90% of Mariupol's buildings had been damaged and 40% destroyed, including hospitals, schools, kindergartens and factories.

About 140,000 people had fled the city on the Sea of Azov before the Russian siege began and 150,000 have exited since then, leaving 170,000 still there, according to its figures, which Reuters could not immediately verify.

Boichenko, who is no longer in Mariupol, said on national television earlier on Monday that about 160,000 civilians were still trapped in the city.

""People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe,"" he said. ""We need to completely evacuate Mariupol.""

Ukraine said it was impossible to create any safe corridors on Monday, citing intelligence reports about possible Russian ""provocations"" along the routes.

Russia, which invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, denies targeting civilians and blames Ukraine for repeated failures to agree on safe corridors for trapped residents.

""The Russian Federation is playing with us. We are in the hands of the invaders,"" Boichenko said.

The two sides are set to resume peace talks on Tuesday in Turkey. read more

STRATEGIC PRIZE

Mariupol is widely seen as a strategic prize as its capture could enable Russia to create a land bridge between Crimea, annexed by Moscow in 2014, and two separatist enclaves in eastern Ukraine.

People who have fled Mariupol have been describing how tough it was living for weeks under almost constant bombardment.

""There is no food for the children, especially the infants. They delivered babies in basements because women had nowhere to go to give birth, all the maternity hospitals were destroyed,"" a grocery worker from Mariupol who gave her name only as Nataliia told Reuters after reaching nearby Zaporizhzhia.

""I also found out today that my son's classmate's parents were torn apart right in the yard before his eyes.""

She said trapped residents had spent time looking for snow which they could melt to have water to wash their hands.

Valeriia, a 20-year-old student from Mariupol, said electricity, internet access, water and heating had been cut off on March 2. Soon afterwards, heavy fighting broke out nearby and part of his home was destroyed.

""Constant shooting, shelling. We were sitting in the corridor, we did not sleep or eat properly for several days. Because as soon as you get out of there, the shootings start, and you run back,"" she said.

She and her sister were given a ride out of the city by other residents who fled in a private car. They left their parents behind.

Sergiy, a metallurgy plant worker, recalled Grad rockets slamming into buildings and people being killed.

""There was a man walking by, this Grad, as cynical as it sounds, tore him to pieces, a corpse. I saw corpses lying around the city, you could see that a mine had exploded and shrapnel was hitting people,"" he said.

“Not everything is in our power,” Mayor Vadym Boichenko told CNN Monday. “Unfortunately, we are in the hands of the occupiers today.”

Boichenko said fewer than half of the city’s peacetime residents remained.

“According to our estimates, about 160,000 people are in the besieged city of Mariupol today, where it is impossible to live because there is no water, no electricity, no heat, no connection,” he said. “And it’s really scary.”

The apparent loss of Mariupol comes after nearly a month of heavy bombardment, and days of fierce street fighting.

The southern port city on the coast of the Sea of Azov has been the target of Russian ambitions since the start of the invasion last month, part of an effort to connect Russian forces in Crimea with forces in the separatist Donbas region to create one single front in Ukraine’s south.

In the process, the Kremlin has cut the city off from power, water and food, while shelling it from land and sea.

Alina Beskrovna, a Mariupol resident who escaped the city in a convoy of cars and made it to Poland, said that people in the city were melting snow for water and cooking on open fires despite the risk of bombardment, “because if you don’t, you will have nothing to eat.”

“Unfortunately, we are in the hands of the occupiers today.” said Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko. REUTERS

“A lot of people are just, I think, starving to death in their apartments right now with no help,” she said. “It’s a mass murder that’s happening at the hands of the Russians.”

Russian actions in Mariupol have drawn stern condemnation from the international community.

Some 300 people were killed a week later when Russian forces bombed a theater that was serving as a civilian shelter. The theater was marked with large letters spelling “children” in Russian.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinkin cited both attacks when he accused Russian forces of war crimes last week.

The apparent fall of Mariupol comes after a string of successes by the Ukrainian forces, who claim to have taken back suburbs around the capital city of Kyiv as well as Trostyanets, a town south of Sumy in the country’s northeast.

Ukrainian forces also broke the Russian’s hold on Kherson, north of the Crimean Peninsula, last week, though it is unclear if the Ukrainian forces have taken total control of the city.

Russia also claimed to have taken over Mariupol, the port city on the Sea of Azov in southeastern Ukraine. Mariupol has seen the worst fighting of the seven-week-long war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that peace talks with Moscow will be scrapped if the last Ukrainian troops in the besieged port city of Mariupol are killed.

While over 3,000 Ukrainian troops have died in the war, millions of civilians from the war-torn nation have been forced to flee the country.

Here are the top 8 developments in the Russia-Ukraine war:

1. ‘High-precision long-range’ weapons hit an armaments plant in Kyiv as Russian forces renewed scattered attacks on the capital city Saturday, killing one. The attack comes a day after Moscow warned it would renew strikes following two weeks of relative calm in the Ukrainian capital. Russian forces began withdrawing from regions around Kyiv last month, turning their focus on gaining control of the eastern Donbas region.

2. Moscow claims to have taken over the control of Mariupol, news agency Reuters reported. Russia said its troops had cleared the urban area of Mariupol and only a small contingent of Ukrainian fighters remained inside a steelworks in the besieged southern port on Saturday.

The claim is yet to be verified by global defence experts. If Moscow’s claims are correct, then Mariupol would be the first big city to fall to the Russians so far.

3. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Ukrainian media that the continuing siege of Mariupol could ruin attempts to negotiate an end to the war.

“The destruction of all our guys in Mariupol — what they are doing now — can put an end to any format of negotiations,” he was quoted as saying on Saturday by news agency AP. Zelensky further said that Ukraine needs more support from the West to have a chance at saving Mariupol.

4. Zelensky also repeated his warning over Russia’s use of nuclear weapons and said, “We shouldn't wait for the moment when Russia decides to use nuclear weapons, we must prepare for that,” in an interview to local media.

5. Meanwhile, in Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv, in the northeast of the country, a Russian missile strike on a residential district killed at least two people on Saturday and wounded 18 others, the public prosecutor's office said.

6. Russia on Saturday announced the death of an army general in battle after being among the forces battering Mariupol for weeks. Maj. Gen. Vladimir Frolov was buried in St. Petersburg after dying in battle, the governor said.

Ukraine has claimed that several Russian generals and dozens of other high-ranking officers have been killed during the war.

7. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman on Saturday, their second call since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin's statement said that the two discussed the ongoing conflict in Yemen as well as their joint work on an oil output agreement, known as OPEC+.

8. Many of the nearly five million people who have fled Ukraine will not have homes to return to, the United Nations warns. UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, says 4,836,445 million Ukrainians have left the country since the Russian invasion on February 24: up 40,200 on Friday's total.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

5,7250ea16-d824-4551-aad2-e091b1d80b4e,"['Yuras Karmanau', 'Associated Press', 'Adam Schreck', 'Cara Anna']",2022-04-11 15:51:56-04:00,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — The mayor of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol said Monday that more than 10,000 civilians have died in the Russian siege of his city, and that the death toll could surpass 20,000, with corpses that were “carpeted through the streets.”

Speaking by phone Monday to The Associated Press, Mayor Vadym Boychenko also said Russian forces brought mobile cremation equipment to the city to dispose of the bodies, and he accused Russian forces of refusing to allow humanitarian convoys into the city in an attempt to conceal the carnage.

Russian forces have taken many bodies to a huge shopping center where there are storage facilities and refrigerators, Boychenko said.

“Mobile crematoriums have arrived in the form of trucks: You open it, and there is a pipe inside and these bodies are burned,” he said.

The mayor’s comments emerged as Russia claimed that it destroyed several Ukrainian air-defense systems in what appeared to be a renewed push to gain air superiority and take out weapons Kyiv has described as crucial ahead of an expected broad new offensive in the east.

In one strike, Moscow said it hit four S-300 launchers near the central city of Dnipro that had been provided by a European country it did not name. Slovakia gave Ukraine just such a system last week but denied it had been destroyed. Russia previously reported two strikes on similar systems in other places.

The failure to win full control of Ukraine’s skies has hampered Moscow’s ability to provide air cover for troops on the ground, limiting their advances and likely exposing them to greater losses.

With their offensive in many parts of the country thwarted, Russian forces have relied increasingly on bombarding cities — a strategy that has left many urban areas flattened and killed thousands of people.

Ukrainian authorities accuse Russian forces of committing atrocities, including a massacre in the town of Bucha, outside Kyiv, airstrikes on hospitals and a missile attack that killed at least 57 people last week at a train station.

In Bucha on Monday, the work of exhuming bodies from a mass grave in a churchyard resumed.

Galyna Feoktistova waited for hours in the cold and rain in hopes of identifying her 50-year-old son, who was shot and killed more than a month ago, but eventually she went home for some warmth. “He’s still there,” her surviving son, Andriy, said.

In Mariupol, about 120,000 civilians are in dire need of food, water, warmth and communications, the mayor said.

Only those residents who have passed the Russian “filtration camps” are released from the city, Boychenko said. He said improvised prisons were organized for those who did not pass the “filtering,” while at least 33,000 were taken to Russia or to separatist territory in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the U.N. children’s agency said that nearly two-thirds of all Ukrainian children have fled their homes in the six weeks since Russia’s invasion began, and the United Nations has verified that 142 children have been killed and 229 injured, though the actual numbers are likely much higher.

Elsewhere, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he met Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for talks that were “very direct, open and tough.”

In a statement released by his office, Nehammer said his primary message to Putin was “that this war needs to end, because in war both sides can only lose.” Nehammer said he also raised the issue of war crimes committed by the Russian military and said those responsible “will be held to account.”

Austria is a member of the European Union and has backed the 27-nation bloc’s sanctions against Russia, though it so far has opposed cutting off deliveries of Russian gas. The country is militarily neutral and is not a member of NATO.

In other developments, the head of the separatist rebel government in Donetsk said Ukrainian forces have lost control of the port area of Mariupol.

“Regarding the port of Mariupol, it is now under our control,” Denis Pushilin, president of the Donetsk People’s Republic, told Russian state television, according to Russian news agencies. The claim could not immediately be confirmed.

The mayor said fighting continues.

“It is difficult, but our heroic military holds on,” Boychenko said. “There are fights in the port. Yesterday, our heroic warriors knocked out several positions of equipment and, accordingly, rebuffed the infantry.

Russia has appointed a seasoned general to lead its renewed push in the eastern Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014 and have declared independent states. Both sides are digging in for what could be a devastating war of attrition.

Russian forces will likely try to encircle the Donbas region from the north and the south as well as the east, said retired British Gen. Richard Barrons, co-chair of the U.K.-based strategic consulting firm Universal Defence & Security Solutions.

The ground in that part of Ukraine is flatter, more open and less wooded — so the Ukrainian ambush tactics used around Kiev may be less successful, Barrons said.

“As to the outcome, it’s finely balanced right now,” Barrons said. If the Russians learned from their previous failures, concentrated more force, connected their air force to ground forces better and improved their logistics, “then they might start to overwhelm the Ukrainian positions eventually, although I still think it would be a battle of enormous attrition.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded for more Western aid, saying his forces need heavier firepower. In a video address to South Korean lawmakers on Monday, Zelenskyy specifically requested equipment that can shoot down Russian missiles.

But those armaments could increasingly come under attack as Russia looks to shift the balance in the 6-week-old war.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the military used cruise missiles to destroy the four launchers Sunday on the southern outskirts of Dnipro. He said the military also hit such systems in the Mykolaiv and Kharkiv regions.

The Russian claims could not be independently verified.

The Pentagon said it had seen no evidence to support Russia’s claims. A senior U.S. defense official said Russia did conduct an airstrike Sunday on the airport in Dnipro, destroying some equipment, but the official said the U.S. has seen no indication that an air-defense system was knocked out.

Lubica Janikova, spokeswoman for Slovakia’s prime minister, denied Monday that the S-300 system it sent Ukraine had been destroyed. She said any other claim is not true.

Questions remain about the ability of depleted and demoralized Russian forces to conquer much ground after their advance on Kyiv was repelled by determined Ukrainian defenders.

Britain’s Defense Ministry said Monday that Ukraine has already beaten back several assaults by Russian forces in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions — which make up the Donbas — resulting in the destruction of Russian tanks, vehicles and artillery.

Western military analysts say Russia’s assault increasingly is focusing on an arc of territory stretching from Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, in the north, to Kherson in the south.

A residential area in Kharkiv was struck by incoming fire on Monday afternoon. Associated Press journalists saw firefighters putting out the fire and checking for victims following the attack, and saw that at least five people were killed, including a child.

Oleh Synyehubov, the regional governor of Kharkiv, said earlier Monday that Russian shelling had killed 11 people over the last 24 hours.

According to Reuters, Boichenko, who is no longer in the city, also said that Russia's siege of Mariupol has killed nearly 5,000 people and that 160,000 people remain trapped in the city without clean water or electricity. Mariupol had a pre-invasion population of over 400,000.

Ukrainian sources have accused Russian and Russian-backed separatist troops of forcibly taking thousands of Mariupol residents to Russia and of firing on proposed evacuation corridors.

Last week, Zelensky said over 4,000 people had been successfully evacuated from Mariupol. Pro-Russian separatists say they're evacuating 1,700 per day, per CNN.

The New York Times reported Sunday that Mariupol was ""close to falling."" According to the Times, Zelensky told the city's remaining defenders they may need to flee and said Ukraine's military cannot muster ""a sufficient number of tanks, other armored vehicles, and ... aircraft"" to ""break the blockade in Mariupol.""

Capturing Mariupol would be Russia's largest victory of the war.

The city has been the target of Russian attacks since the early days of the war. After troops besieged the city, hundreds of thousands of residents were trapped in the city without basic necessities such as food, power, and water.

“According to our estimates, about 160,000 people are in the besieged city of Mariupol today where it is impossible to live because there is no water, no electricity, no heat, no connection,” the mayor stated.

Russian attacks on Mariupol have destroyed 90% of residential buildings in the city

Ukrainian authorities estimate that Russian attacks have left 90% of residential buildings in Mariupol damaged or destroyed.

Additionally, seven hospitals have been damaged or destroyed. This amounts to the destruction of 90% of the hospital beds.

Before Russian troops invaded the city, Mariupol was home to over 400,000 people. According to Ukrainian figures, hundreds of thousands of people have fled the city, and around 30,000 have been deported to Russia.

Boychenko called for the entire city, which has nearly been reduced to rubble, to be evacuated on Monday. However, he claims that the Russian troops are preventing civilians from leaving the city.

“We need a complete evacuation from Mariupol…Our most important mission today is to save every life…there are 26 buses that have to go to Mariupol to evacuate, but unfortunately, they haven’t received permission to move,” he stressed.

Mariupol’s mayor called the situation in the city a “humanitarian catastrophe.”

Boychenko noted that Russian troops have not yet gained control of the city: “Today the city of Mariupol remains a Ukrainian city…Our military is doing everything to keep it that way in the future.”

He also argued that Russia’s attacks on the city amount to “genocide.”

“The task was to wipe the city off the face of the earth along with its inhabitants…This is genocide, there is no other way to call what is happening,” he said.

According to official figures from the Ukrainian authorities, around 2,100 civilians in Mariupol have been killed by Russian attacks, but Boychenko believes the real number is much higher and estimates it is actually around 5,000 people.

Ukraine prepared for talks with Russia

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that he is prepared to discuss the adoption of a status of neutrality as part of a peace deal with Russia.

As the next round of face-to-face negotiations between Ukraine and Russia take place this week in Turkey, Zelensky has told independent Russian journalists that important points are “security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state” that he is “ready to go for ….”

But he added that the proposal would have to go to a referendum and be guaranteed by third parties.

This month, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken accused Russia of “starving” cities in Ukraine. He invoked the memory of the brother of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Viktor, who died in infancy during the German siege of Leningrad during World War II.

“It is shameful,” Mr. Blinken said. “The world is saying to Russia: ‘Stop these attacks immediately. Let the food and medicine in. Let the people out safely, and end this war of choice against Ukraine.’”

Scholars of siege warfare say the tactic serves different purposes: to weaken enemies while avoiding clashes that can kill the besieging force’s own soldiers, or to freeze active fronts while attacking forces reposition. But the grueling nature of sieges — and how they use hunger to turn people’s own bodies against them — gives them a psychological power unique among war tactics, according to scholars and siege survivors.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/mariupol-ukraine-russia-war-food-water.html
