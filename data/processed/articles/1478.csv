Ukraine's talks with Russia

Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia may last several weeks, despite some changes in the negotiation process, said the adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office Mykhailo Podoliak in an interview with Bloomberg TV. He also noted that ""there are signs that Moscow's position has become more adequate.""

""Russia is using the peace talks with Ukraine as a 'smokescreen' to prepare for new 'horrific atrocities' and war crimes,"" said British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. I mean, if the country is serious about negotiations, it will not indiscriminately bomb civilians on this day,"" said Truss.

Atomic objects

Ukrenergo restored the high-voltage line of the Zaporizhzhia NPP – the Kakhovka substation, which was damaged by the Russian fascists. The line again ensures the stable operation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP.

The situation at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant is not controlled by the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate. The shift staff is hostages. Russia made the exclusion zone a springboard for the offensive.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Former British Prime Minister David Cameron is delivering humanitarian aid to Poland, collected for Ukrainians who have temporarily moved to the country.

The issue with the Slovak S-300 has been resolved.

At the request of NATO, Ukraine will receive the S-300 air defense system from Slovakia. Instead, Slovakia will receive American Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems from the Netherlands and Germany.

The UN delivered the first convoy of emergency humanitarian aid to Sumy. It is about 130 tons of humanitarian aid, including medicine, water, and food.

NATO has agreed on a mechanism for supplying air defense systems to Ukraine.

And German Development Minister Svenja Schulze announced the sending of heavy firefighting equipment and civil protection equipment to Ukraine.

400 rifles will be handed over to Ukraine by the American company KelTec. This is the first batch to be delivered to our country under NATO leadership.

Assistance to refugees and those who receive them

Scotland and Wales are ready to receive 4,000 refugees from Ukraine under the Homes for Ukraine program. This is stated in a joint statement by the governments of Scotland and Wales. The Homes for Ukraine program provides that refugees can agree on accommodation with individuals or legal entities, but the United Kingdom doesn't participate in the process.

The government plans to at least reimburse Ukrainian families who have accommodated IDPs for at least the cost of utilities.

According to the latest estimates of the UN Migration Agency, about 6.5 million Ukrainians have become internally displaced and 3.2 million have gone abroad due to the Russian war. This is almost a quarter of the population of Ukraine.

News from abroad

UNESCO supports Ukraine in preserving its cultural heritage and urges Russia to refrain from destroying and seizing its values. The relevant declaration on the protection of Ukraine's cultural heritage was adopted at the second extraordinary meeting of the UNESCO Committee for the Protection of Cultural Heritage in the event of an armed conflict on 18 March.

And this is a rally in Switzerland against the decision of the food giant Nestlé to stay on the Russian market. Thank you, friends! Your protest is proof that money that smells bad cannot be disguised with even the most delicious chocolate.

What's in Russia?

In Russian Bryansk, in one of the temples, people saw icons with the instructions: ""Russian soldier, your task is to wipe the Ukrainian nation from the face of the earth."" This is their ""Orthodox faith."" And in fact, it's ordinary fascism.

The Kadyrovites returned to Chechnya. During their stay in Ukraine, Chechen groups lost hundreds of troops and returned to Grozny on March 13, the SBU counterintelligence said.

Another high-ranking occupier also changed his location. He did not go home, but immediately to hell. Ukrainian fighters eliminated another Russian commander, Deputy Commander of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, Captain First Rank Andrey Paliy.

Meanwhile, the Finnish border shuttle business has resumed in Russia.

People from Finnish border towns again began to receive parcels and documents at their addresses by car or by minibus to take them to Vyborg, Leningrad Oblast, St. Petersburg, along with orders for medicines, household chemicals, coffee, and more. Gasoline, cigarettes, and all kinds of chemical fertilizers are brought back.

What can we hear from Belarus?

Dead and wounded servicemen of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Russian National Guard continue to be transported to Belarus from the territory of Ukraine. In the city of Gomel, all medical institutions with surgical departments are involved in the reception and treatment of wounded occupiers. A high death rate is recorded among the severely wounded Russian invaders.

Russian lies

Warning! In the photo above, there's another lie from the Russian fascists. Propagandists are spreading a fake map of the occupation of the occupiers on the territory of Ukraine. In the fictional picture, the Kremlin media described almost half of our country's area as occupied or blocked by Russian assassins. In fact, the occupiers continue to suffer significant losses and are stopped in many areas, according to the latest data from the General Staff of the Armed Forces.

Russia's Defense Ministry has said that the SBU has mined a city hospital in Dnipro and plans to blow up the building when a Russian plane is over the city. This is also, of course, a brazen lie. However, it may indicate what target the Russian freaks have chosen for the next bombing.

And the Center for Counteracting Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine reminds of simple and effective rules of information hygiene:

Lavrov accused Poland of wanting to seize Western Ukraine, Polish media write.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

Halliburton, one of the world's largest oil and gas service companies, is shutting down and halting business in Russia.

The United States has banned the maintenance of 100 liners used by Russia. The list includes the Aeroflot fleet and Roman Abramovich's planes. The press release says that the ban on aircraft maintenance, in particular abroad, provides for the actual cessation of international flights from Russia on these aircraft.

Life considering hostilities

The Cabinet of Ministers has decided to simplify all customs procedures during martial law, said Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal:

""No papers at customs. Excluding VAT, duties, and customs duties. On a declarative basis.""

Important! Russian intelligence takes 90% of information from Ukrainians from social media. Therefore, it is strictly forbidden to exhibit data/photos/videos about airstrikes, addresses of objects, and in general anything that the enemy can use against us.

Kyiv

Satellite imagery shows that the Russian occupiers are trying to dig in under Borodianka and Hostomel. Additional military equipment with earthen fortifications was also observed in Borodianka and Zdvyzhivka. It is unlikely that this will help the orcs not find themselves in the same land that they are now flipping through so carefully.

The man came out of the Irpin hell on foot and took two cows with him, he reached the town of Korostyshiv on his own. On the way, he was picked up by a truck and he reached a safe place, which was found by volunteers.

Heavy smog is observed in Kyiv and Kyiv region in the morning. However, the SES notes that there is no reason to panic. As of 7:00 am, no fires have been recorded in the Kyiv region in ecosystems, in particular in the Exclusion Zone and near the Chornobyl NPP. Adviser to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Denysenko wrote that the smoke over Kyiv appeared due to the burning of a landfill near Novy Petrivtsi, also due to windless weather.

The column of occupiers in the Mykolaiv region is destroyed!

The Head of the Regional Military Administration Vitalii Kim addressed residents of the region with a request to collect bodies of dead occupiers in bags. ""It's a myth is that they will turn into fertilizers and the seeds should be covered. No, it will be a long time and the corpse poison will interfere with our own sowing. Dogs don't eat much, and so do wolves,"" said Kim.

Zhytomyr region
