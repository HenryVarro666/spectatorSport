Denmark said Tuesday it is expelling 15 Russian ""intelligence officers"" registered as diplomats in the country following similar moves by a number of EU countries, including Germany and France.

The Russian citizens concerned will have 14 days to leave the country, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

""We have established that the 15 expelled intelligence officers have conducted spying on Danish soil,"" Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod told reporters after a meeting in parliament.

Denmark wished to send a ""clear signal"" that spying in the Nordic country was ""unacceptable,"" he said.

Russia's ambassador to Denmark was informed of the decision early Tuesday, where the government also expressed a ""strong condemnation of Russia's brutality against Ukrainian civilians in Bucha"".

""Deliberate attacks against civilians are a war crime,"" it said.

At the same time, Copenhagen insisted on maintaining diplomatic relations with Moscow.

""Denmark does not wish to break diplomatic relations to Moscow. The Russian ambassador and the rest of the embassy in Copenhagen are therefore not included in the expulsion,"" Kofod said.

Horrific images of corpses lying in the streets in the town of Bucha north-west of Kyiv, some with their hands bound behind them, following the Russian withdrawal have drawn international condemnation of Russia, and the EU is considering additional sanctions.

Moscow has denied responsibility, suggesting the images are fake or that the deaths occurred after Russian forces pulled out of the area.

But newly released satellite photographs taken by Maxar Technologies in mid-March, before the Russian withdrawal, showed what appeared to be bodies in some of the same places they were later found by Ukrainian troops and seen by journalists.

On Monday, France expelled 35 Russian diplomats, and Germany announced it had expelled a ""significant number"" of Russian envoys.

Italy, Denmark, Sweden and Spain have expelled a total of 73 Russian diplomats, prompting the Kremlin’s condemnation.

The Kremlin on Tuesday called the mass expulsions of Russian diplomats by a number of European countries a “short-sighted move” that will only complicate communication.

“Narrowing down opportunities for diplomatic communication in such an unprecedentedly difficult crisis environment is a short-sighted move that will further complicate our communication, which is necessary to find a solution,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, referring to the Russian war in Ukraine.

“And this will inevitably lead to retaliatory steps,” he added.

Spanish foreign minister Jose Manuel Albares said on Tuesday his country was expelling about 25 Russian diplomats and embassy staff “who represent a threat to the interests and security of our country”.

Sweden will expel three Russian diplomats for spying, according to Foreign Minister Ann Linde.

Earlier on Tuesday, Italy’s Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said in a statement that his country ordered the expulsion of 30 Russian envoys for national security.

“The measure is in agreement with other European and Atlantic partners and is necessary for reasons linked to our national security and in the context of the current crisis caused by the unjustified aggression against Ukraine on the part of the Russian Federation,” Di Maio said.

Meanwhile, Denmark said it expelled 15 Russian “intelligence officers” posing as diplomats, giving them 14 days to leave the country.

“We have established that the 15 expelled intelligence officers have conducted spying on Danish soil,” foreign minister Jeppe Kofod told reporters after a meeting in parliament.

Denmark wished to send a “clear signal” that spying on it is “unacceptable”, he said.

Strong condemnation

Russia’s ambassador to Denmark was informed of the decision on Tuesday morning, where the government also expressed its condemnation of “Russia’s brutality against Ukrainian civilians in Bucha”.

“Deliberate attacks against civilians are a war crime,” it said.

At the same time, Copenhagen insisted on maintaining diplomatic relations with Moscow.

“Denmark does not wish to break diplomatic relations with Moscow. The Russian ambassador and the rest of the embassy in Copenhagen are therefore not included in the expulsion,” Kofod said.

Horrific images of corpses lying in the streets in the town of Bucha northwest of Kyiv, some with their hands bound behind them, following the Russian withdrawal have drawn international condemnation of Russia, and the EU is considering additional sanctions.

Moscow has denied responsibility, suggesting the images are fake or that the deaths occurred after Russian forces pulled out of the area.

But newly released satellite photographs taken by Maxar Technologies in mid-March, before the Russian withdrawal, showed what appeared to be bodies in some of the same places they were later found by Ukrainian troops and seen by journalists.

Latvia, Estonia

Also on Tuesday, Latvia and Estonia each ordered the closure of two Russian consulates and told staff to leave their countries. The number of the personnel was not specified.

“The decision was taken in solidarity with Ukraine in its fight against the unprovoked and unjustified military aggression and war started by Russia,” Latvian Foreign ministry said in a statement.

The consulates in the Latvian towns of Daugavpils and Liepaja and Estonian towns of Tartu and Narva will have to close by the end of April. Staff will have to leave by that time, the statements of the ministries said.

Tuesday’s developments came after a string of moves against Russian diplomats in other European countries as well as the United States.

""This is another example of brutality, cruelty and war crimes, which apparently have taken place in Bucha,"" Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod told a press briefing.

The move comes after several other European Union countries including France and Germany on Monday said they would expel Russian diplomats.

Moscow, which claims images of executed civilians in Bucha were fake products of Ukrainian and Western propaganda aimed at discrediting Russia, said it would retaliate for the expulsion, RIA Novosti reported.

The Danish foreign ministry said that it did not want to cut diplomatic ties to Moscow and that the Russian ambassador and the rest of the embassy were not part of the expulsion.

The Danish Security and Intelligence Service said in a report earlier this year that the Russian embassy employed several intelligence officers involved in espionage.

According to a press release from the ministry, Russian Ambassador to Denmark Vladimir Barbin had been earlier informed of the expulsion of the ""intelligence officers working at the Russian embassy in Copenhagen.""

The expelled officers have 14 days to depart Denmark.

The Russian embassy in Denmark denies the accusations, claiming that the Danish move aims to further deteriorate relations between the two countries.

""It will not remain unanswered,"" wrote the Russian embassy in an email to the Danish news agency Ritzau.

In response, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Sputnik on Tuesday that Moscow will take retaliatory measures against Denmark over the expulsion of Russian diplomats. ■",http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/20220405/3dca9fe327c1493689c4600626dbff08/c.html

He said the move was “for national security reasons.”

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told the state-owned news agency TASS that there would be a response from Moscow to the expulsions, without giving details.

The country was later joined in expelling Russian diplomats by Denmark, Sweden, Latvia and Spain, a day after Germany and France did the same.

Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod tweeted: “Denmark will expel 15 Russian intelligence officers working at the Russian embassy in Copenhagen. They pose a threat to our national security. It’s in our mutual interests to maintain diplomatic ties, but we will not accept Russian espionage on Danish soil.”

Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde announced at a press briefing Tuesday that the country would also expel three Russian diplomats, because “they have not acted in accordance with the Vienna Convention and conducted illegal intelligence activities in Sweden.”

Linde did not rule out more diplomats being sent back to Moscow, but said such a decision would have to be examined in light of Sweden’s interests in keeping diplomats in Russia.

Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs announced that his country would close the two Russian consular posts in Daugavpils and Liepāja. “The diplomatic staff of those Consulates General are declared persona non grata in Latvia,” a statement read. Thirteen Russian diplomats are being expelled. Its Baltic neighbor Estonia expelled 14 staff from its consulates, including seven diplomats. They have until April 30 to leave the country.

Spain, meanwhile, said it would expel 25 Russian envoys, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said on Tuesday.

They are the latest European countries to expel Russian diplomats. On Monday, the German government made a similar move and sent 40 diplomats back to Moscow, while France kicked out 35 diplomats, saying that their activities were “against our national interests.”

On Tuesday, France’s EU Minister Clément Beaune said that the expulsions “were already discussed and looked at” in consultation with other countries including Germany, but that it was “not only directly related to [the atrocities committed by Russian troops in] Bucha.”

Beaune added that “in some territories, there are people presented as diplomats who were, or could be, threatening our essential interests.”

Lithuania, meanwhile, expelled on Monday Russia’s ambassador to Vilnius and recalled its top envoy to Moscow.

Denmark has decided to expel 15 Russian diplomats. This decision concerns Russian intelligence officers who have carried out espionage on Danish soil, said foreign minister Jeppe Kofod.

“We have established that the 15 expelled intelligence officers have carried out espionage on Danish soil. We have a very special security situation in Europe right now, and therefore the government thinks it is right that we take this decision now,” he told the press.

Denmark’s foreign minister refused to respond when asked about the type of espionage and when they discovered it. Kofod, however, revealed that the officers have been working under diplomatic cover at the Russian embassy in Copenhagen and now have 14 days to leave the country.

In the meantime, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde announced the expulsion of three Russian diplomats on the same grounds as her Danish counterpart.

Säpo (Swedish intelligence police) previously reported that a dozen Russian diplomats are engaged in illegal intelligence activities in Sweden.

“It is not an easy thing to expel diplomats. There are always consequences. Even for our own embassy. We must always weigh up our own interests, but that does not rule out the possibility of expelling others,” she said during the press conference.

Earlier that day, opposition and moderate party leader Ulf Krisstersson criticised the Swedish government for not expelling “the dozen or so Russian diplomats, who have been singled out as spies by the Swedish Security Service” in an interview with SvD.

The Danish and Swedish decisions came in the wake of recent reports from the Ukrainian town of Bucha, where it is believed Russia has committed war crimes against civilians.

“Together with a number of our closest allies, we are putting our foot down on the espionage carried out by identified individuals under cover of their diplomatic status,” Kofod added.",https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/denmark-sweden-expel-russian-diplomats-for-spying/
