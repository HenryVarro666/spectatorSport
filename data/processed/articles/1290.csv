The rouble has recovered more ground against the US dollar on Thursday in the wake of Vladiumir Putin’s decision to make “unfriendly countries” pay for Russian gas in the country’s currency.

It rose 1.5% to 96.7 to the dollar in early trade on Thursday after closing up 6% at 97.7375 per dollar on Wednesday.

The value of the rouble plummeted to as lows as 154 to the dollar in the first couple of weeks of the war after the US and its allies imposed sanctions on Russia and banned its central bank for intervening to prop up the currency.

Putin’s move is clearly intended to ensure that the rouble rises again as other countries use their currencies to buy roubles to pay for the natural gas. (Nearly all Russian gas purchases are made in euros and dollars by the way.) They may also have to ignore their own sanctions and sell things to Russia in order to earn roubles.

However, analysts painted some different scenarios for what might happen, including noting that the Russian gambit might just incentivise European countries to cut the umbilical cord of gas supplies more wquickly than they had already planned.

Rystad Energy’s senior analyst Vinicius Romano said:

Gas supply agreements are generally considered sacrosanct: and in an extreme scenario, insisting on rouble payments may give buyers cause to re-open other aspects of their contracts – such as the duration - and simply speed up their exit from Russian gas altogether. At face value this appears to be an attempt to prop up the Ruble by compelling gas buyers to buy the previously free-falling currency in order to pay. What is clear however, is that this has added another element of uncertainty to the already chaotic European gas market by complicating gas purchases that many countries have been reluctant to cut.

It may also accelerate attempts by the EU to strike a deal with the US to supply more liquefied natural gas when leaders meet in Brussels today. US president Joe Biden may announce more details on this on Friday. Russia supplies 40% of the EU’s collective gas needs, 27% of its oil imports and 46% of coal imports.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-humanitarian-convoy-seized-near-mariupol-says-zelenskiy-as-he-decries-constant-bombing-of-city

US sees Russia focusing on eastern Ukraine: Official

The United States assesses that Russia is prioritising eastern Ukraine’s Donbas, as opposed to Kyiv, in what could be an effort to build leverage in negotiations and cut off Ukrainian forces in the east from the rest of the country, a senior US defence official has said.

Russia said earlier that the first phase of its military operation was mostly complete and it would focus on completely “liberating” Ukraine’s breakaway eastern Donbas region.

The US defence official also said Russia was looking to send reinforcements from Georgia.

Switzerland’s government says it has adopted more EU sanctions against Russia after pledging to act in step with the bloc as it moves to financially punish Moscow.

“This means that all measures contained in the EU’s fourth package of sanctions have been implemented,” the country’s cabinet said in a statement.

However, the cabinet said it had decided not to implement the EU measure of March 1 suspending the broadcasting of Russian media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today.

“Despite the fact that these outlets are used to spread targeted propaganda and disinformation by the Russian Federation, the Federal Council is of the opinion that it is more effective to counter untrue and harmful statements with facts instead of preventing them from being broadcast,” it added.

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists detained, disappeared: UN

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or forcibly disappeared by invading Russian forces, the UN has warned, saying that some cases resembled “hostage-taking”.

The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR) said it had documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 22 local Ukrainian officials, 13 of whom had subsequently been released, since Moscow launched its attack.

At least 15 journalists and civil society activists “who vocally opposed the invasion” in several regions had also been taken, Matilda Bogner, OHCHR’s representative in Ukraine, said in a statement.

“This does seem to be a pattern that is occurring in areas that are occupied by the Russian Federation,” she said.

“Forces of the Russian Federation are going specifically to detain, and do not inform relatives and others where they are taking people … That does in some cases appear to be a form of hostage-taking.”

Moscow updates troop death toll, says 1,351 killed

Russia’s army has updated its troop death toll, saying 1,351 soldiers have been killed and 3,825 others wounded since the start of its offensive in Ukraine.

The new toll, announced at a Moscow briefing delivered by senior military officials, came several weeks after Moscow gave its first assessment of losses in the conflict on March 2.

At the time, Russia put the number of its forces killed at 498.

Kyiv says more than 16,000 Russian troops have been killed, while NATO officials have told Al Jazeera they believe the death toll on the Russian side amounts to between 7,000-15,000 personnel.

Russia says first phase of Ukraine ‘operation’ mostly complete

Russia has said the first phase of its “military operation” in Ukraine is mostly complete and that it will now focus on completely “liberating” eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

The Russian defence ministry said Russian-backed separatists now controlled 93 percent of Ukraine’s Luhansk region and 54 percent of the Donetsk region – the two areas that jointly make up the Donbas.

“The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which … makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,” Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, said.

The defence ministry added that it did not rule out storming Ukrainian cities that had been blockaded and said that Russia would react immediately to any attempt to close the airspace over Ukraine – something Kyiv has asked NATO to do, but NATO has resisted.

It said that Moscow’s offensive would continue until Russian forces had completed the tasks that had been set by Russian President Vladimir Putin, without saying what those tasks were.

Russia’s military had considered two options for its operation in Ukraine, one confined to the Donbas and the other on the whole territory of Ukraine, before opting for the latter, according to Rudskoi.

It added that those who surrender will be given amnesty, given “monetary rewards” for handing over equipment and weapons and allowed to make calls to family or friends to inform them of their circumstances.

Those who give up arms will be held as prisoners of war, but released and returned to Russia upon the cessation of hostilities, the article said.

Ukraine makes new effort to evacuate civilians from Mariupol

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has said she hopes some civilians trapped in Mariupol will be allowed to leave the city in private cars today.

“We will do everything in our power so that buses filled with Mariupol residents reach Zaporizhzhia today,” she added.

Mariupol, which is normally home to about 400,000 people, has been under heavy bombardment from Russian forces for weeks. Those trapped there have been sheltering in basements with little food, power or running water.

The agreement, unveiled by Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a news conference in Brussels, will see the US supply the bloc with at least 15 billion additional cubic metres of the fuel this year.

“This will replace the LNG supply we currently receive from Russia,” von der Leyen said.

She added the EU will work with member states to also ensure they can receive at least 50 bcm of additional LNG until 2030.

About 10 percent of the EU’s gas needs are met by production within the bloc. Russia typically supplies about 41 percent of the rest of the LNG used by its member states.

Thousands flee Boryspil

About 20,000 people have fled the Ukrainian city of Boryspil, its mayor has said.

In remarks aired on national television, Volodymyr Borysenko urged others to evacuate, saying the large number of civilians in villages nearby made it difficult for Ukrainian troops to clear Russian forces from the area.

The city’s outskirts are home to an international airport, located about 30km (19 miles) east of Kyiv.

59 percent of Russian missiles malfunctioned, downed or missed: Ukraine

Russia has launched some 1,200 cruise missiles since its invasion began, but 59 percent of them did not explode, were shot down or missed, Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces has said.

“Russia shot about 1,200 missiles, less than a half hit the target,” it said on Telegram.

“Others were either shot down by air defence forces, or hit wrong targets – mountains, forests, rivers,” it added. “They have imprecise missiles and crooked hands.”

A senior Pentagon official said earlier that Moscow was running out of precision-guided munitions and was increasingly likely to rely on other weapons.

Russian shelling kills 2 civilians in Luhansk: Governor

Indiscriminate Russian shelling has killed two civilians and caused multiple fires in the town of Rubizhne of the southeastern Luhansk region, the governor has said.

But the front line has not changed despite intensive overnight shelling of several towns in Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai wrote on Facebook.

A part of Luhansk has been controlled by pro-Russian separatists since 2014, and their “People’s Republic” became a springboard for the Russian invasion that began on February 24.

“The country must move toward peace, move forward. With every day of our defence, we are getting closer to the peace that we need so much,” the Ukrainian president said. “We can’t stop even for a minute. For every minute determines our fate, our future, whether we will live.”

Zelenskyy said he had made appeals to Western leaders gathered in Brussels earlier on Thursday “all for one reason – so that Russia understands that we need to achieve peace”.

US assesses up to 60% failure rate for some Russian missiles: Report

Three US officials have told the Reuters news agency that Russia is suffering failure rates as high as 60 percent for some of the precision-guided missiles it is using to attack Ukraine.

Reuters said the US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not provide evidence to support the assessment and did not disclose what precisely was driving high missile failure rates.

If true, the agency said, it could help explain why Russia has failed to achieve what most could consider basic objectives since its invasion a month ago, such as neutralizing Ukraine’s air force, despite the apparent strength of its military against Ukraine’s much smaller armed forces.

A government official in the northern city of Chernihiv has told The Associated Press news agency that a “catastrophe” is unfolding for the local population with Russian troops deliberately targeting food stores in a near-month-long siege.

An air attack this week destroyed a bridge over the Desna River, which was a crucial route to bring in food and other aid from Ukraine-controlled territory further south.

“Humanitarian help, medicines and food used to be delivered into the city via this bridge,” City Council Secretary Olexander Lomako told AP in an audio message.

He estimated that more than 130,000 people are left in the city out of a pre-war population of 285,000, but that Ukraine remains in full control.

The UK’s defence ministry says Ukrainian forces have launched raids against “high-value targets in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, including a landing ship and ammunition storage depots at Berdyansk”.

In its latest intelligence update, the ministry said such attacks will force the Russian military to “prioritise the defence of their supply chain and deprive them of much-needed resupply for forces”.

“This will reduce Russia’s ability to conduct offensive operations and further damage already dwindling morale,” it added.

Legislation removing “most-favoured-nation” trade status for Russia has been delayed in the US Senate at least until next week, after some Republicans raised concerns that its human rights provisions might be too broad.

HIGHLIGHTS

• Despite many operational challenges, UN agencies and humanitarian partners have reached around 890,000 people across Ukraine with multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance since 24 February. Assistance has mostly been provided in the east, with over 431,000 people reached in Kharkivska oblast.

• In Kyiv (Kyivska oblast, north) and Kharkiv (Kharviska oblast, east), the World Food Programme (WFP) and its partners have delivered nearly 1,270 tons of food to more than 521,000 affected people.

• The World Health Organization (WHO) is sending around 36 tons of medical supplies to Lviv (Lvivska oblast, west), with an additional 108 tons in the pipeline, while the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) delivered 13 tons of urgently needed reproductive health supplies, medicines and equipment to service providers in four oblasts.

• UN agencies and humanitarian partners are scaling up cash support. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has launched a large-scale cash programme for internally displaced persons (IDPs) that aims to reach around 360,000 people, while the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has rolled out cash-based assistance in several oblasts, planning to reach some 40,000 people in Zakarpatska oblast (west) alone.

• The Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster estimates that around 1.4 million people lack access to water in Ukraine, while access remains limited for another 4.6 million people. In Donetska oblast (east), the water situation remains critical, as the current supply from water reservoirs received by schedule is only projected to last till the beginning of April in the cities of Donetsk and Makiivka, and less than three weeks in neighbouring Horlivka.

• According to WHO, as of 25 March, the number of verified incidents of attacks on health-care facilities in Ukraine has risen to 72 – nearly 89 per cent of incidents recorded by WHO between 24 February and 25 March globally – resulting in 71 deaths and 37 injuries. WHO says almost 1,000 health facilities are close to areas experiencing active fighting or with a significant presence of the Russian Federation forces.

SITUATION OVERVIEW

General humanitarian situation. Just over a month since the start of the military offensive, civilian casualties, destruction of critical infrastructure and wide-scale forced displacement continue unabated, driving a significant increase in humanitarian needs. As of 24 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports 2,788 civilian casualties, including 1,081 killed, figures that are likely much higher and will continue to rise as hostilities rage on. In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (east), Government-controlled areas (GCA) continue to witness the greatest number of civilian casualties, with OHCHR reporting 957 casualties in GCA – including 285 killed and 672 injured – compared to 283 civilian casualties in the non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of these oblasts (59 killed and 224 injured). In the rest of Ukraine, OHCHR reports 1,548 civilian casualties.

Humanitarian needs. The key humanitarian needs remain access to adequate food, safe water, life-saving medicines and health services, as well as durable shelter solutions for IDPs and the growing number of people whose homes have been damaged or destroyed. The WASH Cluster estimates that around 1.4 million people lack access to water in Ukraine, while access remains limited for another 4.6 million people. In Donetska oblast, the water situation remains critical, as the current supply from water reservoirs received by schedule is only projected to last till the beginning of April in Donetsk and Makiivka, and less than three weeks in neighbouring Horlivka.

According to Mercy Corps, some of the hardest-hit areas in Ukraine only have enough food to last a few days, while others are becoming increasingly dependent on aid, the delivery of which remains unpredictable due to persistent access and security constraints. Mercy Corps estimates that at least 70 per cent of the population of Kharkiv and Sumy (Sumska oblast, north-east) – home to nearly 1.8 million people prior to the recent escalation – are now completely reliant on aid to meet their most basic needs.

Displacement and associated vulnerabilities. Since 24 February, around 10.2 million people have been forcibly displaced – roughly a quarter of the Ukrainian population – with the number of people moving across international borders surpassing 3.7 million. According to IOM, more than 30 per cent of displaced households include at least one person suffering from a chronic illness, while nearly 20 per cent include someone living with some form of disability.

The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) says around 4.3 million children – more than half of all children in Ukraine – have been forcibly displaced by ongoing fighting, generating significant risks to children’s safety and well-being. More than 60 per cent of IDPs surveyed by IOM report a child between 5 and 18 years of age in their household, while nearly 30 per cent report a child under the age of 5. Among the most vulnerable are the approximately 100,000 children in Ukraine residing in institutional care – half of whom with disabilities. Some of these institutions are attempting to move children and adolescents to safety either within Ukraine or across borders.

Unaccompanied and separated children face heightened risks of violence, abuse and exploitation. These risks are multiplied when children are displaced across international borders, increasing the possibility of children and adolescents falling victim to exploitation and trafficking. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child says that all unaccompanied or separated children must receive integrated social services to satisfy their multi-sectoral needs and ensure their protection, including health care, psychosocial support, nutrition, education, housing and legal aid, without discrimination.

Health situation and risks. According to WHO, as of 25 March, the number of verified incidents of attacks on health-care facilities in Ukraine has risen to 72 – nearly 89 per cent of incidents recorded by WHO between 24 February and 25 March globally – resulting in 71 deaths and 37 injuries, which account for almost 89 and 93 per cent of total deaths and injuries, respectively, arising from attacks on health care worldwide in just over a month. The destruction of critical health infrastructure and the disruption of medical supply chains pose a significant threat to the health and well-being of millions of people. Even where health facilities are functional, the danger of moving in areas experiencing ongoing fighting often pushes people to take the risk of foregoing medical care, leading to greater suffering and preventable deaths. WHO says close to 1,000 health facilities are close to areas experiencing active fighting or with a significant presence of the Russian Federation forces, significantly limiting access to life-saving medicines and health services.

As trauma-related injuries rise, what little resources and health staff capacity remain – many health workers themselves have been displaced or are unable to work – continue to be redirected toward caring for the wounded. Numerous hospitals have been repurposed to treat trauma victims, while approximately half of Ukraine’s pharmacies are reportedly closed amid active hostilities. Consequently, the already-stretched health system has even less capacity to ensure the continuation of essential services and primary health care, including sexual and reproductive health (SRH), the treatment of chronic illnesses and COVID-19.

COVID-19 vaccination and routine immunization campaigns have almost come to a halt across the country. Before 24 February, at least 50,000 people on average were being vaccinated against COVID-19 each day. Between 24 February and 15 March, however, only 175,000 people were vaccinated against the virus – around 40,790 fewer people on average being vaccinated daily. Between 23 February and 23 March, WHO reports that the seven-day average number of antigenrapid and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 tests fell by a staggering 88 and 96 per percent, respectively, suggesting considerable underreporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Over the same period, the number of beds available for COVID-19 patients decreased significantly as many were repurposed, with the largest decreases witnessed in Luhanska (east, 80 per cent), Volynska (north-west, 69 per cent) and Chernihivska (north, 56 per cent) oblasts.

Humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine. Ongoing hostilities in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts are generating significant humanitarian needs. Critical infrastructure and housing have been hard hit in both oblasts. In Luhanska oblast, on 23 March, more than 25 residential buildings, including at least 13 multi-storey apartment buildings, were reportedly damaged or destroyed in Kreminna, Lysychansk, Pervomaisk, Novodruzhesk, Sievierodonetsk and Voievodivka (GCA). As of 24 March, more than 95,300 users across 20 settlements are reportedly without electricity in Luhanksa oblast (GCA), while some 41,000 users remain without access to gas supplies in nearly 30 settlements. In the city of Kharkiv (Kharkivska oblast), municipal authorities say more than 1,140 buildings have been destroyed since the military offensive began. Of these, nearly 1,000 – around 87 per cent – are residential buildings, raising serious concerns about the shelter and protection situation in the worst-affected areas. On 24 March, a missile strike hit a shopping mall’s parking lot in the city, reportedly leaving at least six dead and another 15 injured, according to oblast authorities.

Meanwhile, in Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east), a humanitarian convoy sent by the Government of Ukraine carrying lifesaving aid failed to reach people in need on 24 March, remaining blocked outside the encircled city for three days. More than 2,340 people were evacuated through agreed-upon evacuation corridors on 24 March. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says a detailed agreement between Ukraine and the Russian Federation forces is urgently needed to properly evacuate civilians from Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands remain trapped without food, water, medicines, electricity or heating, with reports of people dying from starvation being of particular concern. While the civilian death toll in Mariupol cannot be assessed amid active hostilities, the city council reports that at least 300 people were reportedly killed following the bombing of the city’s drama theatre on 16 March.

Humanitarian situation in southern Ukraine. In Khersonska oblast, the number of people without access to water and electricity continues to grow, reaching approximately 51,250 on 23 March – an increase of more than 5,000 users in just 24 hours. Similarly, growing numbers of people are being cut off from natural gas supplies – commonly used for cooking and heating – with around 5,700 left without gas as of 23 March.

Evacuation of civilians. According to the Government of Ukraine, on 24 March, more than 3,340 people were evacuated through agreed-upon corridors. Over the last 29 days, Ukrainian Railways reports that it has evacuated around 3 million people from the most affected areas of the country toward the west, while some 430,000 have been transported abroad. On the other hand, the Russian Federation reports that around 420,000 people have crossed the border from Ukraine towards Russia since the escalation of hostilities, including 18,510 during the past 24 hours. This includes people who have reportedly been evacuated and those who have crossed the border seeking refuge on their own.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-1200-pm-eet-25-march-2022
