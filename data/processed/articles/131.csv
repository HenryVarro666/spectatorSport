One person was killed and another seriously injured after multiple strikes hit the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Monday, Oleh Syniehubov, the head of Kharkiv regional administration, said Tuesday.

Syniehubov said there were 65 instances of shelling against the city on Monday alone. He said fighting was going on in Izium, Balaklia and Dergachi, three towns in the region of Kharkiv.

Meanwhile, 600 residential buildings in the city had been destroyed in Russian attacks since the start of the war, Kharkiv’s mayor Ihor Terekhov said Monday, adding that the houses cannot be repaired.

“People actually lost their homes,” he said. “Fifty schools and a number of medical institutions, including maternity hospitals, were also bombed in Kharkiv.”

Elsewhere, Volodymyr Matsokin, the deputy mayor of Izium, said his city has been “under siege for two weeks, without water, without electricity, heat, food, medicine, communication.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-15-22/h_3799075fd4af25327b19f6496cbb1bc0

The new arms and equipment that US President Biden announced for Ukraine include:

S-300 long-range missile defense

Ukraine has had the ability to shoot down Russian aircraft and cruise missiles at relatively close quarters. Washington is arranging for it to acquire systems that can strike attacking aircraft from much farther away.

According to a military source, the systems are the Soviet/Russian-made S-300, which like the US-made Patriot system, is a fully automated, ground-based radar-and-missile launcher unit that can detect, track and fire at multiple incoming aerial threats at long distances.

Ukrainians already know how to operate the S-300, and the United States and a number of NATO countries possess the systems or components of them to supply Ukraine.

‘Kamikaze drones’

Washington will send Ukraine 100 Switchblade drones, essentially camera-equipped, remote-controlled flying bombs that can be directed by an operator to find and then, when ready, plunge onto a target, exploding on contact.

Dubbed “kamikaze drones,” Switchblades can extend the range of attack on Russian vehicles and units to beyond the sight of the user. That gives them an advantage over the guided heat-seeking missiles that Ukrainians have used against Russian tanks.

Anti-aircraft Stingers

The United States is also giving 800 more Stingers, which are shoulder-mounted infrared anti-aircraft missiles. The US provided Stingers to Afghan fighters in the 1990s to shoot down Russian helicopters; Ukrainians have used them effectively against Russian helicopters and slower, lower-flying fixed-wing attack aircraft.

‘Saint Javelin’

Western allies have already provided the Ukrainian army with some 17,000 lightweight, shoulder-launched, self-guided missiles which have become the weapon of choice in the ground war. These are being used with great effect to destroy armored vehicles at close quarters.

Among those, the US-made Javelin, with dual charges designed to defeat Russian tanks’ anti-missile defenses, has become legendary in its effectiveness. A popular Ukrainian song extols it and there is now even a viral depiction of “Saint Javelin,” an Eastern iconography-style image of a woman cradling the weapon. Biden said Washington will send 2,000 more javelin missiles to Ukraine.

Guns, ammunition, body armor

The new US arms provisions also include 7,000 other anti-armor weapons, thousands of machine guns, rifles, and grenade launchers, 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition fitting both Russian and NATO standards, and 25,000 sets of body armor and helmets.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-17-2022/

“Due to the Westerners’ Russophobic activity”, the Council of Europe is losing its reason for being, Zakharova said in a statement.

“By placing the service of the bloc’s interests above its own statutory objectives, the Council of Europe has been turned into an obedient instrument of the European Union, NATO and their satellites,” she added.

The findings come in a paper issued by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. It cited the IOM figures as “a good representation of the scale of internal displacement in Ukraine — calculated to stand at 6.48 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine as of March 16”.

Roman Catholic Pope Francis has denounced the “perverse abuse of power” on display in Russia’s war in Ukraine and called for aid to Ukrainians who he said had been attacked in their “identity, history and tradition” and were “defending their land.”

It came just days after Francis told the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, that the concept of a “just war” was obsolete since wars are never justifiable and that pastors must preach peace, not politics.

Ukraine war ups pressure for US oil; industry faces hurdles

In the oil fields of northern Montana, industry veteran Mac McDermott has watched crude prices whipsaw from $75 a barrel in January to more than $120 as Russia pressed its war in Ukraine, then down again when coronavirus worries in China raised the spectre of a global slowdown.

McDermott said his family-owned company will modestly increase drilling if oil prices stabilise. But for the next few months, he’s waiting on the sidelines and struggling to get enough workers to watch over roughly 100 oil wells the company operates. That includes some wells idled during the pandemic that he’s been trying to bring online since last year.

President Joe Biden’s move to ban Russian oil imports over its invasion of Ukraine was met with Republican demands to boost US production to address high petrol prices.

“By ignoring RT’s completely clean record of four consecutive years and stating purely political reasons tied directly to the situation in Ukraine and yet completely unassociated to RT’s operations, structure, management or editorial output, Ofcom has falsely judged RT to not be ‘fit and proper’ and in doing so robbed the UK public of access to information.”

Latest Western arms supplies for Ukraine ‘not escalatory’: Analyst

Richard Weitz, a defence and military analyst with Wikistrat in Washington, DC, says the latest weapons supplies pledged for Ukraine by the US and other Western countries do not amount to an escalation.

“The weapons under discussion are the same that Western powers have been providing the Ukrainian armed forces for months, anti-air missiles, anti-tank and armour missiles, other types of light weapons. The S-300 systems that the Slovaks may provide are already in the Ukrainian inventory, and Russia has more advanced S-400 and S-500 systems,” he told Al Jazeera.

“So it seems to me, this is in line with what the alliance has been doing, providing the Ukrainians with the weapons and the munitions they need to replenish the stocks they have lost and take advantage of Russian tactical errors. But it’s not an escalatory move.”

Russian Ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya has rejected reports of atrocities in Ukraine as “propaganda”.

Nebenzya described allegations that Russia is targeting hospitals and residential areas, including recent accusations that Russian forces bombed a theatre sheltering civilians in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, as “fakes”.

“The hyped-up campaign of lies and disinformation in Ukraine is reaching new and new heights,” Nebenzya told the Security Council.

US Congress moves to revoke Russia’s ‘most favoured nation’ trade status

The US House of Representatives has overwhelmingly approved legislation to revoke Russia’s “most favoured nation” trading status, bringing the US closer to imposing higher tariffs and restrictions on Russian imports.

The House’s 428-8 vote sends the bill, requested by President Biden, to the Senate for likely approval as soon as next week.

The bill also would allow Biden to impose more penalties on Russian officials under the US’s Global Magnitsky Sanctions law.

‘War is causing suffering well beyond Ukraine’s borders,’ says UK envoy

British Ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward has called on Russia to end the war, saying that the conflict is causing suffering worldwide, not just in Ukraine.

“President Putin’s war is causing suffering well beyond Ukraine’s borders,” Woodward told the UN Security Council.

“Thousands of students – many from nations around this table – have been caught up in the violence. The war is spiking food and energy prices, bringing further pain to countries in the developing world already suffering from the impact of COVID and famine and conflict and climate. Millions of refugees have been taken in by countries across Europe.”

More than 700 civilians killed so far in Ukraine, UN says

More than 700 civilians – including 52 children – have been killed in Ukraine since Russia invaded but the “actual number is likely much higher”, UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council.

She added that the UN human rights agency has recorded 726 deaths, as well as 1,174 people injured, including 63 children, between February 24 and March 15. DiCarlo did not specify who was to blame. “This demands a thorough investigation and accountability,” she said.

Blinken accuses Russia of committing ‘war crimes’

The US Secretary of State has accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine, echoing Biden, who on Wednesday called Putin a “war criminal”.

“Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime. After all the destruction of the past three weeks I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise,” Blinken told reporters.

Still, Blinken said US State Department experts are in the process of documenting and evaluating potential war crimes to help international efforts towards accountability.

KYIV

Russia’s relentless bombardment of Ukraine edged closer to central Kyiv as a series of strikes hit a residential neighborhood Tuesday, while the leaders of three European Union countries planned a bold visit to Ukraine’s capital and the number of people the war has driven from the country passed 3 million.

Large explosions thundered across Kyiv before dawn from what Ukrainian authorities said were artillery strikes, as Russia’s assault on the city appeared to become more systematic. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said barrages hit four multi-story buildings in the city and caused dozens of deaths.

The strikes targeted a western district of Kyiv, disrupting a relative calm that returned after an initial advance by Russian forces was stopped in the early days of the war. Tuesday’s shelling ignited a huge fire in a 15-story apartment building and spurred a frantic rescue effort.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko announced a new curfew for the city, saying it would run for 35 hours from 8 p.m. Tuesday until 7 a.m. Thursday

As Russia stepped up its assault on Kyiv, the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia set out for Ukraine’s embattled capital by train to show support for the country.

“The aim of the visit is to express the European Union’s unequivocal support for Ukraine and its freedom and independence,” Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said in a tweet. He was joined by Janez Jansa of Slovenia, Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Poland’s de-facto leader.

EU officials characterized the visit as one the central European leaders had undertaken independently despite security risks. The 27-nation bloc’s other leaders were “informed” of the trip but did not sanction it, EU officials said.

The International Organization for Migration said the number of people who have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24 passed 3 million on Tuesday. The U.N. has described the flood of people crossing into Poland and other neighboring countries as Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since World War II.

Russian and Ukrainian negotiators held a second day of talks as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reached its 20th day. The Red Cross and the United Nations refugee agency say millions of people face food and medicine shortages along with the immediate conflict threats of shelling and air attacks.

The Ukrainian government said new aid and evacuation efforts would take place Tuesday along nine corridors around the country, including the Kyiv region. But past attempts have repeatedly failed amid continued fighting.

One of the most desperate situations is in Mariupol, an encircled port city of 430,000 where local officials estimate a lethal siege has killed more than 2,300 people and left residents desperate for food, water, heat and medicine.

The Mariupol city council reported Tuesday that civilian evacuations were underway. The council said 2,000 civilian cars had managed to leave along a humanitarian corridor that runs for more than 260 kilometers (160 miles) west to the city of Zaporizhzhia.

The city council said another 2,000 cars were waiting to leave along the evacuation route. It was not immediately clear if the number of departed vehicles given Tuesday included 160 cars that left the day before.

Russia’s invasion has shocked the world, upended Europe’s post-Cold War security order and driven millions from their homes. Russia’s military is bigger and better equipped than Ukraine’s, but its troops have faced stiffer-than-expected resistance, bolstered by arms supplied by the West.

When Russia launched the war three weeks ago, fear of an imminent invasion gripped the Ukrainian capital, and residents slept in subway stations or crammed onto trains to flee. But as the Russian offensive bogged down, Kyiv saw a relative lull. U.S. officials say Russian forces were about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the center of the city as of Monday.

Fighting has intensified on Kyiv’s outskirts in recent days, and sporadic air raid sirens ring out around the capital.

The early morning artillery strikes hit the Svyatoshynskyi district of western Kyiv, adjacent to the suburb of Irpin, which has seen some of the worst battles of the war.

Flames shot out of the 15-story apartment building and smoke choked the air as firefighters climbed ladders to rescue people. The assault blackened several floors of the building, ripped a hole in the ground outside and blew out windows in neighboring apartment blocks.

Rescue workers said one person died and several were rescued but others remained inside.

“Yesterday we extinguished one fire, today another, it is very difficult,” said one young firefighter as he took a brief break outside the building, tears falling from his eyes.

“People are dying, and the worst thing is that children are dying. They haven’t lived their lives and they have already seen this, this is the worst,” said the rescuer, who gave only his first name, Andriy.

Shockwaves from an explosion also damaged the entry to a downtown subway station that has been used as a bomb shelter. City authorities tweeted an image of the blown-out facade, saying trains would no longer stop at the station.

A 10-story apartment building in the Podilsky district of Kyiv, north of the government quarter, was damaged by unspecified ammunition. Russian forces also stepped up strikes overnight on Irpin and the northwest Kyiv suburbs of Hostomel and Bucha, said the head of the capital region, Oleksiy Kuleba.

“Many streets (in those areas) have been turned into a mush of steel and concrete. People have been hiding for weeks in basements, and are afraid to go out even for evacuations,” Kuleba said on Ukrainian television.

In the country’s east, Russian forces launched more than 60 strikes overnight on Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, according to regional administration chief Oleh Sinehubov. The strikes hit the city’s historical center, including the main marketplace.

Sinehubov said fires were raging and rescuers had pulled “dozens of bodies of civilian residents,” from the ruins of destroyed apartment buildings.

Zelenskyy is seeking to extend martial law until April 24 and to require men ages 18 to 60 to stay in the country to fight. Ukraine’s parliament is expected to vote on the measure this week.

The Ukrainian leader appealed for more weapons to counter Russia’s military. He said Ukraine’s forces are rapidly using up weapons and other hardware supplied by Western nations, and he asked northern European leaders to “help yourself by helping us.”

As Russia struggled to gain ground in Ukraine, U.S. administration officials alleged that Moscow had asked China for help, and Beijing had signaled that it would be willing to provide both military support and financial backing to help stave off effects of Western sanctions.

Russia and China denied military assistance had been asked for or granted.

Talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators resumed Tuesday, after failing to make a breakthrough _ or to break down _ on Monday. The two sides had expressed some optimism about the negotiations, which Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said were discussing “ceasefire” and “withdrawal of troops from the territory of the country.""

With each day, the human cost of the grinding war continues to rise. The Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office released details of two deadly Russian attacks that took place Monday: an artillery strike that hit a university and open-air market in the northern city of Chernihiv, killing 10, and the shooting of a 65-year-old woman on a bus that was evacuating civilians from a Kyiv suburb.

The number of people killed in a Russian rocket attack on a TV tower in western Ukraine on Monday rose to 19, authorities in the Rivne region said Tuesday. A further nine people were injured in the strike on the TV tower in Antopol, a village about 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the border of NATO member Poland.

In Mykolaiv, a strategic southern city near the Black Sea where airstrikes killed nine people Sunday, residents braced for more attacks. Volunteers prepared food and sorted donated clothes at an abandoned naval yard that was turned into a support center for troops. Molotov cocktails were already on hand to take on invaders.

Svetlana Gryshchenko, whose soldier son was killed in the fighting, said it was “impossible to put into words” what was happening to the city.

“We are bombed during the day and during the night .. It’s a nightmare what Russia is doing on the territory of Ukraine,” she said.",https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/blasts-rock-kyiv-as-talks-with-russia-to-resume-172219

Units of the 120th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (MINSK) of the North-Western Operational Command of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus were transferred to the border areas with Ukraine.

The enemy did not conduct active offensive operations in the Polissya direction. Having suffered losses, the enemy, in violation of the norms of International Humanitarian Law, carries out chaotic mining of the area, creating dangerous living conditions for the civilian population of Ukraine. Along with this, the enemy regrouped, restoring the combat capability of the units defeated in previous battles. As a result of the effective actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the enemy suffers significant losses in manpower and equipment.

In the northern direction, the enemy concentrated its efforts during the day on reconnaissance. He has problems with providing troops with ammunition.

Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine

As of 10 a.m. CET on March 15, 2022, according to the Unified Register of Pre-Trial Investigations, as well as other sources that need confirmation, 97 children have died and more than 100 children have been injured since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began.

The actual number of dead and wounded children cannot be determined due to the inability to inspect the scene and the active hostilities of the occupying forces in Ukrainian cities.

Yesterday, Russian troops carried out artillery shelling of a kindergarten in Chuguev. A 15-year-old boy was killed.

In the city of Rubizhne (Luhansk region) Russian forces destroyed: an institution for visually impaired children “Kryshtalyk”, three schools, and a Multidisciplinary Hospital. Four people were killed in the shelling.

Such actions by the armed forces of the Russian Federation continue to grossly violate the fundamental rights of children - the right to life and health, guaranteed by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

“I call on the international community and international human rights organizations to help end the military attack on the Russian Federation.” – stressed Denisova.

Russian military terrorists kill children and unarmed Ukrainians on the streets of temporarily occupied settlements.

In the village of Mokhnatyn, near Chernihiv, Russians shot three local teenagers with machine gun from armored vehicle. Two of died boys were at the age of 17, one - 19. 17-years victims were twin brothers. The third, a 19-year-old boy, had his leg torn off and died.

In the village of Velyka Dymerka, Brovary district, Kyiv region, racist soldiers opened fire on civilians at a public transport stop - a woman was killed and a man was injured. They also opened fire on the homes of civilians, killing a man.

In the village of Zavorychi in the Kyiv region, two men were fatally injured and a woman was wounded by shrapnel.

In Bucha, the Russian military fired on residential buildings. A 65-year-old civilian was killed in the village of Vorzel in the Bucha district, and a 75-year-old woman and a man died of their wounds in Irpen.

Deliberate killing of civilians is a crime against humanity and a war crime as defined by the Statute of the International Military Tribunal and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and a violation of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.

These crimes cannot go unpunished and must be taken into account by the UN International Court of Justice as evidence in the case of Ukraine v. Russia on genocide charges.

“I appeal to the UN member states to speed up the establishment of a Special Tribunal to punish the crime of aggression against Ukraine.” stressed the Commissioner.

Russians criminals must sit on the dock of the Nuremberg tribunal!

Head of Donetsk Region Administration

Doctors and patients were taken hostages by Russian invaders in Mariupol.

One of the hospital employees managed to pass the information about it.

Quote:

""It is impossible to get out of the hospital. There is a heavy shooting, we sit in the basement. Vehicles have not been able to drive to the hospital for two days. High-rise buildings are burning around… Russians forced 400 people from neighbouring houses to come to our hospital. We can't leave.""

This is Mariupol's Regional Intensive Care Hospital. The other day, Russian invaders practically destroyed it - the floor slabs fell in the main building from the bombing. But hospital staff and patients continued to be in the basement adapted for work of doctors and treatment of patients.

The destruction was not enough for Russian fascists, they made hostages out of doctors and patients.

“I appeal to international human rights organizations to respond to these vicious violations of the norms and customs of war, to these blatant crimes against humanity.” stressed the Head of Donetsk Region Administration.

POLICY

President of Ukraine

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy took part in a meeting of representatives of the member states of the Joint Expeditionary Force chaired by Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson in the format of a video conference. During the event, the President of Ukraine presented his vision of how to stop Russian aggression and ensure lasting peace on the European continent.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that the world needs new security guarantees, as the old ones have proved their ineffectiveness.

“The Russian invasion of Ukraine destroyed everything that security in our region, and I am sure international security, was based on. The weight of the organizations we all hoped for. The force of international conventions. It has also called into question the world's most powerful alliance, NATO,” stressed the President of Ukraine.

According to Zelenskyy, NATO has not yet plucked courage to close Ukrainian sky for Russian missiles and planes. Russian troops continue to bomb peaceful Ukrainian cities and kill people, blow up houses, hospitals and schools.

Therefore, as the Head of State noted, European countries, especially those bordering Russia, are now not sure that the Alliance will not be afraid to react if Russian missiles and planes fly to them. After all, Russian state propagandists are already directly saying that the war against Ukraine is just the beginning, that other European countries will be next. This is also not denied in Kremlin.

“We emphasize that we need new formats of interaction, new determination. And if we cannot enter NATO's ""open door"", then we must work with communities available, communities that will help us. Like yours. And have some guarantees. We would like to have reliable guarantees that will work for us. And also for you,” noted the President of Ukraine.

“We suggested a way. The way for Ukraine to be able to protect its skies and its people on its own. I would like everyone to hear this, especially those countries that have borders with Russia. We do everything to get war planes. To get air defense,” he added.

The Ukrainian Head of State also stressed the need to increase sanctions pressure on Russia until its aggressive rhetoric and intentions change.

According to him, many global companies have not left the Russian market despite the imposition of tough sanctions against Russia. Some, having said they had left, are actually just waiting how this will end and when it will be possible to return.

“There is no international mechanism for influencing corporations today. If they ignore blood, the world can do nothing. And this is when the worst war since World War II continues. This needs to be addressed. Now. Before Russia goes further. The sanctions policy should be such that no one could even think of war. The question is not only in Russia - the question is in the future: what else can happen,” emphasized Zelenskyy.

According to him, the ban on the Russian fleet to use world ports, the complete disconnection of Russian banks from SWIFT, the recognition of Russia as a terrorist state, as well as embargo on any trade with Russia are needed.

“We emphasize that this is necessary for us, but it is also necessary for you. For the whole world, for peace in Ukraine and in Europe,” the President said and thanked the UK and every country that has taken a moral position.

The Ukrainian President stressed that the ""Russian military machine"" can still be stopped to end the killings and, most importantly, the destruction of democracies.

“I think we all know this practice and these tragedies: missiles and bombs, helicopters and tanks, saboteurs and cyberattacks - all that is in the arsenal of today's Russia. Everything will be directed against Europe if Ukraine does not survive. Therefore, I ask you: help yourself by helping us. You know what weapons we need. You know what means of protection we need. You know we crucially need airplanes. It would be extremely difficult for us without your efforts. I am grateful to you. But understand - we need more,” stressed Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

He said that Ukrainian defenders captured Russian equipment on the battlefield and sent it back against the enemy, as well as used old Soviet equipment that had not worked for decades. However, this is not enough, because, according to statistics, there is 1 Ukrainian tank per 100 Russian tanks, and 1 Ukrainian military per up to 30 soldiers of the occupying forces.

“That's why we really want you to help us. I am sure that you will be able to increase the volume and feel how it will strengthen your protection, your security together with ours. How this will make the world stable not only in our country, but also in your countries,” emphasized the President.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke in favor of strengthening the anti-war coalition and stressed that our strength lies in rapid action and solidarity.

“Our strength is in the truth. It is on our side. We can stop the war with Russia. So that peace, that Ukrainians strives for, will come. Peace that the world strives for,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy concluded.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki, Deputy Prime Minister of Poland Jarosław Kaczyński, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Petr Fiala and Prime Minister of Slovenia Janez Janša who arrived in Kyiv.

The President of Ukraine thanked the heads of government of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia for the support their countries provide to Ukraine, as well as for their personal visit to Kyiv.

""At a time when many ambassadors have left Ukraine in connection with the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation, these dignitaries, leaders of their beautiful independent European states, fear nothing, care for our fate more, and they are here to support us. This is a great courageous, correct and friendly step. And I am sure that with such friends, with such countries, with such neighbors and partners, we will really be able to win,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters after the meeting.

The President noted that the talks focused on security guarantees for Ukraine, strengthening sanctions against the aggressor state, as well as the prospects of Ukraine's membership in the European Union.

The interlocutors also touched upon plans to rebuild our country after the end of hostilities. In this context, international assistance in replenishing the relevant reconstruction funds already established by the Ukrainian government is important.

""We know for sure that everything we are discussing will reach the positive goal for our country, our security and our future,"" the President stressed.

Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine and Minister for Reintegration of Temporary Occupied Territories

Only 7 out of 9 negotiated humanitarian corridors worked.

On 15th March, 28 893 people were evacuated from sieged cities of Ukraine.

Mariupol corridor to Zaporizhzhia 20 000 people escaped via 4 000 private vehicles. 570 cars have already made their way to Zaporizhzhia, the rest are spending the night in Berdyansk and other towns in the oblast. In both Zaporizhzia and Berdyansk people are receiving necessary help.

Right now, Russian media attacks people who are fleeing Mariupol, making them tell in front of their cameras that Azov did not let them escape Mariupol; instead of respecting the people who spent two weeks under constant Russian artillery fire without food, water, and heating, Russian propagandists are preoccupied making more fake news.

The only reason why the Ukrainian military asked people to come back to Mariupol was the fact that Russians were firing at humanitarian corridors despite all agreements. As soon as it was proven that those corridors were safe, people were allowed to evacuate.

While foreign journalists die from Russian bullets attempting to deliver the truth about events in Ukraine, Russian propagandists are doing everything possible to create more lies.

Sumy region:

8 533 people evacuated: 6 950 from Sumy, 140 from Trostyanets, 113 from Lebedyn, 166 from Shostka, 1 084 from Konotop.

Kharkiv region:

320 patients and employees of the Oskilsk psychoneurological institution were evacuated.

Despite all agreements, the humanitarian convoy with buses for the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol — among whom are citizens of Greece and Turkey who do not possess private vehicles — remains blocked in Berdyansk.

Attempts to evacuate people from villages of Bohdanivka, Novobohdanivka, and Bobryk (Kyiv region) failed again due to systematic violations of the temporary cease fire by Russian forces.

Tomorrow, it is planned that the Mariupol humanitarian corridor continues operating and the evacuation of people from Izum begins.

Due to the all day long curfew in Kyiv and the settlements around the city, there will be no evaluation in Kyiv region.

Efforts are made to free the local government representatives held hostage by Russians. The mayor of Melitopol Ivan Fiodorov is still held hostage. The information about the location of Evgen Matvieev and Sergii Pryima, the officials from Dniprorudnyansk who were kidnapped by Russians on March 13, is being established.

Vereshuk is demanding the international community to pay more attention to Mariupol, to recognize Russia as a terrorist state, and to put more effort into freeing the civilians, doctors, nurses who are held hostage.

Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine

The terrorist state is planning mass deforestation of Ukrainian forests.

This was stated in a letter from Russian Defense Minister Shoigu to Putin.

The aggressor minister asks for permission for the total felling of Ukrainian ""forests, trees, shrubs and greenery."" It is planned to cut down ""any intensity and any age, regardless of ownership and category of land with the right to use the resulting wood.""

At the same time, wood that is not used for the needs of the Russian Armed Forces will be sold, with proceeds replenishing Russian economy.

Today, without exception, all forests in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine are in the highest risk zone.

Last time this happened on the territory of Ukraine was during the Nazi occupation.

The total felling of greenery is another terrible crime of the aggressors and is a manmade ecocide. The area, free of trees, turns into a poor landscape, becomes uninhabitable.

Such actions will lead to the transformation of Ukraine into a dead desert and cause a humanitarian crisis in Europe. Such actions will affect many countries around the world, to which generous gifts of Ukrainian land are exported.

According to Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, war crimes include widespread, long-term and serious damage to the environment.

“I call on the world community to apply all possible sanctions against the terrorist state of the Russian Federation to withdraw Russian racist troops from Ukraine and stop the atrocities on our land.” underlined the Commissioner.

Operational situation on the diplomatic front as for March 15, 7pm

Today, true friends visited Ukraine: Prime Ministers of Poland, Czech Republic and Slovenia, the Deputy Prime Minister of Poland for Security, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania, and the European Commissioner for the Environment. We hold hundreds of meetings every day in Ukraine and abroad to provide our country with the necessary military, financial and humanitarian assistance.

Sanctions:

The European Union, the Group of Seven countries, as well as Albania, Australia, Iceland, South Korea, Moldova, Montenegro, New Zealand, Northern Macedonia and Norway have revoked Russia's largest trade facilitation status. This deprives Russia of key trade advantages as a member of the WTO. In particular, states may unilaterally impose or increase tariffs on imports from Russia;

The United Kingdom has announced ban on the export of luxury goods to Russia, and has introduced new tariffs on imports of hundreds of key goods, which are 35 percentage points higher than current rates;

Canada has imposed sanctions on 15 other Russian officials for their role in waging war against Ukraine;

Zelensky says NATO’s Article 5 “has never been as weak as it is now”

In an address on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated his call to close Ukrainian airspace after a night of air alarms heard “almost all over” the country.

“Each of the more than 800 Russian missiles that have hit our country is an answer to a long-standing question about NATO — whether the doors of the alliance are really open for Ukraine,” Zelensky said while speaking from his office Tuesday afternoon.

“If they were open, if it was honest, we would not have to convince the alliance for 20 days to close the skies over Ukraine, to close from the death being brought by the Russian Air Force. But …they don’t hear or don’t want to hear us yet,” he added.

He went on to call out NATO’s Article 5, the principle of collective defense, “weak” as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues.

“Some states of alliance have intimidated themselves, saying that they can’t answer. That they cannot collide with Russian missiles and planes in the Ukrainian sky. Because this, they say, will lead to escalation, will lead to the Third World War. … And what will they say if Russia goes further to Europe, attacking other countries? I am sure the same thing they say to Ukraine. Article 5 of the NATO treaty has never been as weak as it is now. This is just our opinion,” he stated.

UN: World must not forget Afghanistan because of Ukraine

But my message coming here is, don’t forget the other situations, where attention and resources are needed and Afghanistan is one of them.

“The risks of distraction are very high, very high … Humanitarian assistance has to flow no matter how many other crises compete with Afghanistan around the world,” he added.

In response to Canada’s sanctions, Russia has blacklisted 313 Canadian nationals, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Foreign and Defense Ministers, Melanie Joly and Anita Anand, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday.

In response to the new sanctions hastily imposed by official Ottawa, which is apparently competing with Washington in Russophobic rage, and covering Russia’s top officials and practically all lawmakers, from March 15 Russia supplements its list of persons banned from entering the country with [Canadian] Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Foreign and Defense Ministers, Melanie Joly and Anita Anand.

Russia unveils sanctions response plan

The Russian government has prepared a list of measures aimed at tackling the impact of sanctions imposed by the US and its allies, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Tuesday.

The proposal includes more than 100 initiatives and measures, with the total amount of funding for their implementation estimated at about 1 trillion rubles ($9 billion).

“Under the instructions of [Russian President Vladimir Putin], a whole range of measures has been prepared, many of them are included in the draft priority action plan. This is a very flexible plan, and it will be constantly updated and issued in stages depending on the situation,” Mishustin stated.

According to the official, the initiative includes state support for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as systemic and state procurement companies.

Authorities plan to focus support for firms working in agriculture, tourism, culture, science, medicine, software development, catering, food production, furniture, clothing, and trade.

They also plan to offer Russia’s partners in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) the opportunity to raise the limit for duty-free import of goods within the framework of e-commerce. This would allow the maximum possible access to necessary resources and goods, Mishustin said, stressing that Ukraine-related sanctions would not hinder cooperation and integration within the union.

According to the prime minister, the draft plan is to be approved at the upcoming government meeting, and some of the measures will be introduced by the end of March.

Zelensky reiterates global call to close airspace & implement sanctions

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated his global call to close the airspace over Ukraine and for Canada and global allies to increase their efforts of implementing sanctions.

“I know you support Ukraine. We’ve been friends with you … but also I would like you to understand and I would like you to feel this, what we feel every day. We want to live and we want to be victorious. We want to prevail for the sake of life,” Zelensky said in an address via video to Canada’s parliament.

Can you imagine when you called your friends, your friendly nation, and you ask, ‘Please close the sky, close the airspace, please stop the bombing.’ How many more missiles have to fall on our cities until you make this happen? And they … express their deep concerns about the situation. When we talked with our partners, they said, ‘Please, hold on, hold on a little longer.’

Zelensky also added he has not heard a clear answer on becoming a NATO member.

“It’s dire straits, but it also allowed us to see who our real friends are over the last 20 days and as well, eight previous years,” he said.

“You’ve offered your help, your assistance, at our earliest request, you supply us with the military assistance, with humanitarian assistance, you imposed severe sanctions, serious sanctions. At the same time, we see that unfortunately, they did not bring the end to the war,” he added.

Zelensky noted “you all need to do more to stop Russia, to protect Ukraine and by doing that, to protect Europe from Russian threat.”

NATO chief expresses concerns over possible Moscow “false flag” operation in Ukraine

NATO is concerned that Russia might use chemical weapons in a “false flag” operation in Ukraine, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated on Tuesday.

Moscow’s “absurd” claims about biological labs and chemical weapon is part of a “long list of lies,” which causes worry about the possibility of such an attack, the NATO chief warned.

“They claimed they did not plan to invade Ukraine but they did. They claimed that they were withdrawing their troops, but then sent in even more. They claim to be protecting civilians, but they are killing civilians,” he said while speaking at a press conference in Brussels, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “brutal” invasion of Ukraine is “causing death and destruction every day.”

“It has shocked the world and shaken the international order,” he added.

Stoltenberg noted the alliance is “very closely monitoring Ukraine’s airspace and the border areas,” following recent incidents in Ukraine.

There is “always a risk for incidents and accidents,” when there is fighting going on close to NATO borders, he warned.

NATO, he stressed, would make “every effort to prevent such incidents and accidents and if they happen to make sure that they don’t spiral out of control and create really dangerous situations.”

NATO defense ministers will hold a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday.

US announces sanctions on 11 Russian military leaders

The Joe Biden administration targeted 11 Russian military leaders – some of whom have been involved in suppressing Russian protesters and dissent in occupied areas of Ukraine — with sanctions on Tuesday, in addition to new sanctions from the Treasury Department, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced.

Blinken said that “the Russian government has intensified a crackdown against its own citizens’ freedom of expression, including for members of the press, as well as freedom of association and peaceful assembly. Today in Russia, those who provide factual reporting on the invasion or criticize Putin face criminal charges.”

This action comes as the National Guard of Russia “has cracked down on Russian citizens who have taken to the streets to protest their government’s brutal campaign in Ukraine,” Blinken stated, adding that the list of Russian military officials hit includes Viktor Zolotov, the head of the National Guard.

“In addition, Zolotov’s troops are responsible for suppressing dissent in occupied areas of Ukraine. More broadly, the designation of these 11 senior Russian defense leaders continues our imposition of severe costs on Russia’s Ministry of Defense as it pursues its brutal military invasion of Ukraine, which has led to unnecessary casualties and suffering, including the deaths of children,” Blinken continued.

“The world has been transfixed as Russia has perpetrated a premeditated, unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine. Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine has resulted in widespread human suffering and casualties, including the deaths of innocent civilians, including children. Today, the Department of State is continuing to impose severe costs on Russian military leaders,” according to the State Department.

The State Department also announced new visa restrictions on 38 current and former Russian government officials believed to be involved in suppressing dissent in Russia and abroad; new sanctions on two of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) officers; visa restrictions on six individuals involved in attacks on Chechen dissidents living in Europe; and visa restrictions on 25 individuals responsible for undermining democracy in Belarus.

The latest additions to Russia’s “stop list” were announced by the Kremlin on Tuesday, and were described as a “counter reaction” to the “extremely Russophobic course taken by the current US administration.”

Appearing at the top of the 13-name list is Biden, followed by Blinken and Austin. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, CIA Director William Burns, and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki are also named. Further down the list, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Biden’s son Hunter – whose dealings with a Ukrainian energy firm have previously been questioned and criticized – are also included.

The new measures seek to apply additional pressure on Putin to reverse course and align with measures taken by Canada’s international partners. According to Global Affairs Canada, the sanctions demonstrate a global commitment to impose sweeping economic measures on the Russian leadership to weaken its ability to wage war on Ukraine.

“Canada will not relent in its support of Ukraine and its people. President Putin made the choice to [further] his illegal and unjustifiable invasion, and he can also make the choice to end it by immediately ending the senseless violence and withdrawing his forces. Canada will not hesitate to take further action should the Russian leadership fail to change course,” Joly said in the release.

“Ukraine has presented a demand to be considered a candidate country as others, as Moldavia, as Georgia. These demands will take their pace, their time, their procedures, but there are other countries who have been waiting for long, who have been fulfilling all its commitments, all the requirements, and now it’s time, and I hope when there is a will, there is a way, that these events will catalyse a quick answer,” Borrell told a joint press conference with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama.

“People actually lost their homes,” he said, adding, “Fifty schools and a number of medical institutions, including maternity hospitals, were also bombed in Kharkiv.”

Elsewhere, Volodymyr Matsokin, the deputy mayor of Izium, said his city has been “under siege for two weeks, without water, without electricity, heat, food, medicine, communication.”

Help yourself by helping us, Zelensky tells northern European leaders

Europe must protect its own security by helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told a meeting of Joint Expeditionary Force leaders in London via video link, urging them to send more weapons.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hosting a summit of Nordic and Baltic leaders to discuss European defence and security.

“We all are the targets of Russia and everything will go against Europe if Ukraine won’t stand so I would like to ask you to help yourself by helping us,” Zelensky told the leaders.

“You know the kind of weapon we need … without your support it would be very difficult I’m very grateful but I want to say that we need more … I do hope that you will be able to enhance that scope and you will see how this will protect your security, your safety,” he noted.

Beijing urges Washington to leave China out of US-Russia disagreements

Beijing calls on Washington to avoid damaging China’s interests when trying to settle its relations with Russia, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian stated on Tuesday.

On Monday, US State Department spokesman Ned Price raised concerns over alleged China’s attempts to use the Ukrainian crisis “to advance Beijing’s long-term interest in its competition with the United States” and warned Beijing that any support extended to Russia, including “helping to avert sanctions imposed by the US and its allies, “would have implications not only for China’s relations with the United States, but for “its relationships around the world.” “The Chinese side has repeatedly expressed its position regarding sanctions. Beijing discourages the use of sanctions to settle problems and even more opposes unilateral sanctions that lack international legal grounds,” Zhao said when asked if China feared that the US would impose sanctions on Beijing because of its support for Moscow amid the situation in Ukraine. The practice has proved that sanctions not only fail to solve existing problems, but also create new ones, and hinder the process of a political settlement, he added. We call on the US not to harm China’s legitimate rights and interests when handling its relations with Russia. China will continue to pursue normal trade and economic cooperation with Russia based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, he stressed.

Report: US looking to scrounge up soviet S-300s to deliver to Ukraine

The US State Department is ‘working to identify’ which countries have access to Soviet-made S-300 air defence system and brainstorming how they can be sent to Ukraine, sources said to be familiar with the matter have told CNN.

Sources further indicated that Washington was not sure at the moment where they would get the missiles used by the S-300.

The Joe Biden administration has faced requests from Congress to transfer a variety of heavy Soviet-built military equipment to Ukraine, including the aforementioned S-300s, as well as MiG-29 jet fighters.

Deputy FM: US trying to destroy relationship with Russia

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said that the US was trying to destroy relations with Russia. He added that Russia hopes that the US will understand that it is necessary to continue discussing strategic stability issues with Moscow. Russia not going to curtail contacts with the US; contacts continue, according to Ryabkov. Contacts have not been interrupted, and we are not initiating the curtailment of contacts with the United States. We understand the importance of discussing the topics that exist. But I would like to note that the initiatives to terminate the dialogue in a number of important areas have recently been implemented precisely from the American side. “This is their choice. I think that after some time in Washington, the realisation will come that, for example, strategic stability needs to be discussed. This is an issue that needs to be worked out, the subject is very complicated, and under the influence of the political situation, interrupting this business is about the same thing as declaring a ban on civil aviation flights. That is, people fell into hysterics, lost their self-control – and now they are taking such steps,” Ryabkov added. Russia and the United States hold diametrically opposed positions on Ukraine, Sergei Ryabkov said. “We have a diametrically opposed approach to what is happening in Ukraine. Everything that is happening now is largely a consequence of the policy that Washington has been pursuing for many years, which deliberately turned Ukraine into “anti-Russia”, deliberately deprived the Kiev authorities of the possibility of earlier stages to do at least something to implement the Minsk agreements,” Ryabkov told reporters.

Zelensky expresses frustration with NATO over no-fly zone refusal

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his frustration with NATO over the refusal to implement a no-fly zone as he addressed European leaders in London.

In a video call to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and representatives from the Joint Expedition Force countries gathered in Lancaster House, Zelensky said NATO had been “hypnotised” by Russia.

He added President Vladimir Putin’s invasion had undermined the European security infrastructure.

NATO was “the strongest alliance in the world” but “some of the members of this alliance are hypnotised by Russian aggression”.

We hear a lot of conversations about the third world war, that allegedly it could start if NATO will close the Ukrainian sky for Russian missiles and planes and therefore the humanitarian no-fly zone was not yet established.

“That allows the Russian army to bombard peaceful cities and blow up housing blocks and hospitals and schools. Four multi-storey buildings in Kyiv in the early morning were bombarded, dozens of dead,” he continued.

Zelensky stated it must be admitted that Ukraine will not be joining NATO.

“For years we have heard about allegedly open doors, but we have also heard that we cannot enter there, this is true, we must admit this,” he stressed.

Around 350,000 people still trapped in Mariupol

Around 350,000 people are still trapped in Mariupol, the city in southeastern Ukraine that has been besieged by Russian troops since March 1, Petro Andriushchenko, adviser to the Mariupol mayor, stated on Ukrainian television Monday.

Considering there are 540,000 residents and around 150,000 people evacuated in the first three days when it was still safe to do so, we estimate around 350,000 people to be stuck in Mariupol.

Multiple official attempts to establish safe corridors and evacuate civilians from Mariupol have failed in recent days. A large convoy of humanitarian aid that was meant to arrive on Sunday has still not reached the city as of Monday, according to officials.

“Most of the people are staying in the basements and shelters in inhumane conditions. With no food, no water, no electricity, no heating,” he said, adding that people were melting snow and dismantling the heating system to get water to drink.

Speaking about civilian casualties, Andriushchenko said the numbers obtained from the police and compiled by medical facilities were likely inaccurate. He added that, as of Sunday, 1,800 people were confirmed to have been killed.

Speaking on Monday, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office, claimed that the Russian bombardment of Mariupol has caused more than 2,500 deaths.

Red Cross hopes to evacuate civilians from besieged Sumy

The Red Cross is hoping to organise the evacuation of two convoys of some 30 buses with civilians out of the besieged northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy and their passage to a safe area.

He noted there had been delays with similar evacuations from Mariupol, where he said people are “essentially being suffocated in this city now with no aid’.

“We have now reached the three-million mark in terms of movement of people out of Ukraine,” Paul Dillon, spokesman for the UN’s International Organization for Migration, told reporters in Geneva.

Zelensky says world sees Russian military has “responsibility for war crimes”

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky stated the world sees what Russia is doing in Ukrainian cities and its military has “responsibility for war crimes.”

“Responsibility for war crimes of the Russian military is inevitable,” Zelensky said during a video address on Telegram early Tuesday.

“Responsibility for a deliberate humanitarian catastrophe in Ukrainian cities is inevitable,” he added.

Russia, he noted, will have to answer for disrupting evacuation corridors and for its actions in “Mariupol. Kharkiv. Chernihiv. Sumy. Okhtyrka. Hostomel. Irpin. In all our cities.”

Zelensky said Ukraine is working with “partners” on new restrictions that will be applied against the Russian state.

“Everyone who is responsible for the war. Everyone who is responsible for the destruction of democracy. Everyone who is responsible for repression against people. Everyone will get an answer. The answer of the world. And this is just the beginning,” he added.

UN: One child becoming a refugee every minute in Ukraine

Some 1.4 million children have now fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on February 24, meaning one child a minute has become a refugee, the UN has announced.

“On average, every day over the last 20 days in Ukraine, more than 70,000 children have become refugees, … essentially one child becoming a refugee every minute since the conflict started,” James Elder, spokesman for the UN children’s agency UNICEF, told reporters in Geneva.

EU adopts fourth set of sanctions against Russia

The EU has adopted the fourth round of sanctions against Russia, banning the export of luxury goods and import of steel products, as well as targeting new oligarchs.

The EU imposed a new set of sanctions against Russia “in response to its brutal aggression against Ukraine and its people,” the European Commission announced in a statement welcoming the decision of EU member states.

“These sanctions will further contribute to ramping up economic pressure on the Kremlin and cripple its ability to finance its invasion of Ukraine,” the statement reads.

European finance ministers have formally approved a fourth package of sanctions targeting more than 600 Russian nationals, in what French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called a “historical decision.”

It is the “fastest, strongest package of sanctions ever adopted by the European Union in its history,” the ministers said.

The names of the Russian individuals and entities included in the new round of sanctions were not disclosed.

“You will have a new ban on some exportation like luxury goods and we will withdraw to the Russian state, the most favored nation clause within the World Trade Organization, which will allow us — all the 27 member states — to increase the level of trade tariffs on all Russian goods,” Maire added.

The sanctions were expanded to include, “key oligarchs, lobbyist and propagandists pushing the Kremlin’s narrative on the situation in Ukraine as well as key companies in the aviation, military and dual use, shipbuilding and machine building sectors,” the European Council announced.

When asked if there would be further sanctions, Maire noted: “I can confirm to you what (French President) Emmanuel Macron said last week, all options remain on the table.”

British PM says west must end Russian energy ‘addiction’

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on Tuesday for the West to end its “addiction” to Russian energy, which he says allows President Vladimir Putin to “blackmail” the world.

Western leaders made a “terrible mistake” when they let Putin “get away” with Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and became more dependent on Russian energy, Johnson wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

As a result, “when he (Putin) finally came to launch his vicious war in Ukraine, he knew the world would find it very hard to punish him”, Johnson added.

The world cannot be subject to this continuous blackmail.

Britain is set to freeze the assets of dozens more oligarchs and businesses linked to Vladimir Putin after passing new laws to crackdown on foreign dirty money.

Reports suggest the government could use the powers granted in the Economic Crime Bill to sanction more than one hundred Russian oligarchs and organisations.

Hungary says energy supply is “red line” in terms of EU sanctions on Russia

The latest package of EU sanctions against Russia do not affect Hungary’s energy supplies and oil and gas group MOL can also continue crude production in the BaiTex field in Russia, Hungary’s foreign minister has said.

In a Facebook video, Peter Szijjarto stated it was important for the Hungarian government to maintain European unity on sanctions but “we have a red line which is the security of Hungarian energy supply”.

MoD: Russian armed forces take full control of Kherson Region

The Russian armed forces have taken full control of the entire territory of Kherson region during the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, the Russian Defence Ministry announced on Tuesday. The Russian Armed Forces will take measures against Ukrainian defense sector companies used by nationalists to repair weapons in response to the strike against Donetsk, official spokesman of the Russian Defense Ministry General-Major Igor Konashenkov told reporters. The defence ministry has urged Ukrainians working in these companies and residents of nearby houses to leave potentially dangerous zones.

Russians urged not to start panic buying

Russia announced on Tuesday there was no risk of a food shortage on the domestic market and cautioned consumers against rushing out to stock up on staples after the West slapped sanctions.

“There are no conditions for risks of a shortage or for a reduction in product range,” Deputy Prime Minister Viktoria Abramchenko said.

“It is not worth driving up artificial demand with purchases for the future. We will reorient the market and establish mutually profitable trade, expand our partnership network with friendly countries,” Abramchenko added.

Russia has already taken steps to safeguard its food market in light of Western sanctions.

Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on Monday signed an order banning the export of white and raw sugar until August 31, and banning wheat, rye, barley and maize exports to neighbouring Eurasian Economic Union states until June 30.

Three British former special forces officers ‘killed in air strike near Polish border’

The UK Foreign Office is urgently investigating reports that three British former special forces officers were killed in the Russian air strike at the Yavoriv base near the Polish border on Sunday.

Officials are understood to be liaising with Ukrainian authorities and international partners to establish further information.

According to the Daily Mirror, the three men killed by the cruise missile attack were not part of the foreign fighters unit that was being trained at the base, which is only six miles from the Polish border.

Their identities have not been revealed and it is not known which branch of special forces the men had served in.

Military experts stated the attack on Yavoriv – which left at least 35 people dead – was an attempt by Russia to warn off foreign fighters and halt the flow of military equipment from the West into Ukraine.

Two residential buildings hit by shelling in Kyiv

Two buildings in residential areas of Kyiv were hit by separate strikes early Tuesday morning, according to Ukrainian emergency services.

A private home in Osokorky — a district east of the city center — was hit by shelling just before 6 a.m. local time Tuesday, the emergency services announced in a statement.

A fire broke out in the two-story building but was put out shortly afterwards. No casualties were reported.

Shortly after the strike in Osokorky, a 10-story apartment building in Podil — north of the city center — was hit in another strike, causing a fire in the first five floors of the building.

One person was taken to hospital, according to the emergency services.

US announces sanctions against 11 Russian defense officials

The sanctions are being imposed, inter alia, against Russian Deputy Ministers of Defense Alexey Krivoruchko, Timur Ivanov, Yunus-Bek Evkurov, Dmitry Bulgakov, Yury Sadovenko, Nikolay Pankov, Ruslan Tsalikov and Gennady Zhidko.

The inclusion to the sanctions list means freezing of all assets in the US and ban for US citizens or companies for having business with people on the list, the statement notes.

Moscow: Biolabs in Ukraine pose threat to all Europe, not just Russia

Biolaboratories in Ukraine pose a danger not only to Russia but to the whole of Europe, Aleksey Polishchuk, the head of the Russian foreign ministry’s second CIS department, told Sputnik. “As for biolaboratories on Ukraine’s territory, they pose a danger not only to Russia but to the whole of Europe. Conducting Russia’s special operation in Ukraine is aimed, among other things, at stopping this threat,” Polishchuk said. Purpose of Russia’s operation in Ukraine is, among other things, to stop the threat posed by biolaboratories, Polishchuk continued. The Russian diplomat added that Moscow was forced to recognise the Donbass republics’ independence, but the decision on their possible return to Ukraine is up to LPR and DPR residents.

Report: US tells allies China is open to providing Russia with military support

US expresses ‘deep concerns’ over Russia-China ‘alignment’

The US expressed concern about “alignment” between Russia and China, following a meeting between senior US and Chinese officials in a Rome hotel where they discussed the war in Ukraine and other security issues for around seven hours.

Jake Sullivan, the US’s National Security Adviser, and Yang Jiechi, the Chinese Communist Party’s chief diplomat, met in Rome for what the White House described as a “substantial” session.

The White House said the two officials “underscored the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between the United States and China”.

A senior US official told reporters, on condition of anonymity, “We do have deep concerns about China’s alignment with Russia”.

They added that the meeting was a “very candid conversation”.

Bloomberg reported Monday citing unnamed sources, Sullivan is looking for an opportunity to have a phone call with Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev.

China tells US it regrets war in Ukraine but rejects “smear” over its position

China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, told Washington Beijing regrets the war in Ukraine but will not stand for any attempts to “smear” China over its position, according to a readout from the Chinese side.

Yang met with US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in Rome Monday amid the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The US has information suggesting China has expressed some openness to providing Russia with requested military and financial assistance as part of its war on Ukraine, a Western official and a US diplomat told CNN.

China has dismissed that as US “disinformation.”

“China always calls for respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and abides by the United Nations Charter and principles,” Yang told Sullivan, adding that Beijing will continue to promote peace talks and has provided “emergency humanitarian aid” to Ukraine.

Yang also said it is important to “straighten out the historical context of the Ukraine issue, get to the bottom of the problem’s origin, and respond to the legitimate concerns of all parties.”

Ukraine president asks Russian soldiers: “Why should you die?”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke directly to Russian soldiers in a video message uploaded to Telegram early Tuesday morning local time.

“Russian conscripts! Listen to me very carefully. Russian officers! You’ve already understood everything. You will not take anything from Ukraine. You will take lives. There are a lot of you. But your life will also be taken,” the president said.

But why should you die? What for? I know that you want to survive.

Zelensky added Ukraine is hearing Russian soldier’s conversations in intercepts.

“We hear what you really think about this senseless war, about this disgrace, and about your state. Your conversations with each other. Your calls home to your family. We hear it all. We draw conclusions. We know who you are,” he stated.

The Ukrainian President also offered Russian soldiers what he said was, “a choice” and “a chance.”

“On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance. Chance to survive. If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated. As people, decently. In a way, you were not treated in your army. And in a way, your army does not treat ours. Choose!” Zelensky noted.

Report: Russia requests food assistance & other forms of aid from China during war in Ukraine

Russia has requested both military and financial assistance from China amid the conflict in Ukraine.

Among the assistance Russia requested was pre-packaged, non-perishable military food kits, known in the US as “meal, ready-to-eat,” or MREs, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

The request underscores the basic logistical challenges that military analysts and officials say have stymied Russian progress in Ukraine — and raises questions about the fundamental readiness of the Russian military.

Forward-deployed units have routinely outstripped their supply convoys and open source reports have shown Russian troops breaking into grocery stores in search of food as the invasion has progressed.

One of the sources suggested that food might be a request that China would be willing to meet, because it stops short of lethal assistance that would be seen as provocative by the west.

The US has information suggesting China has expressed some openness to providing Russia with requested military and financial assistance as part of its war on Ukraine, a Western official and a US diplomat told CNN, and is conveying what it knows to its NATO allies.

It is not yet clear whether China intends to provide Russia with that assistance, US officials familiar with the intelligence tell CNN. But during an intense, seven-hour meeting in Rome, a top aide to US President Joe Biden warned his Chinese counterpart of “potential implications and consequences” for China should support for Russia be forthcoming, a senior administration official stated.

Report: Russia asked China for ‘five types of military equipment’

The Financial Times reported the US has told its allies that Russia asked China for five types of military equipment.

The British newspaper cited officials familiar with the content of the US diplomatic cables.

It said the US claims the Russian request included surface-to-air missiles, drones, intelligence-related equipment, armoured vehicles, and vehicles used for logistics and support.

Russia denies making any such request.

China has also denied claims by US officials that Russia had sought military assistance in Ukraine and accused Washington of spreading “malicious disinformation” that risked escalating the conflict.

“The US has repeatedly spread malicious disinformation against China on the Ukraine issue,” the Chinese embassy in London told Reuters in a statement.

“China has been playing a constructive role in promoting peace talks,” it added.

“The top priority now is to ease the situation, instead of adding fuel to the fire, and work for diplomatic settlement rather than further escalate the situation,” it continued.

Ukraine official: War could be over by May

An adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff says the war in Ukraine is likely to be over by early May when Russia runs out of resources to attack its neighbour.

“I think that no later than in May, early May, we should have a peace agreement, maybe much earlier, we will see, I am talking about the latest possible dates,” Oleksiy Arestovich stated in a video published by several Ukrainian media.

“We are at a fork in the road now: there will either be a peace deal struck very quickly, within a week or two, with troop withdrawal and everything, or there will be an attempt to scrape together some, say, Syrians for a round two and, when we grind them too, an agreement by mid-April or late April,” he added.

A “completely crazy” scenario could also involve Russia sending fresh conscripts after a month of training, he continued.

Japan freezes assets of 17 Russians

Japan has decided to freeze the assets of an additional 17 Russians, including billionaire Viktor Vekselberg and family members of banker Yuri Kovalchuk, who is a close confidant of the Russian president.

Altogether, Japan has now sanctioned 61 Russian individuals over Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.

White House: US not currently discussing importing oil from Venezuela

The White House has announced the US is not currently discussing importing oil from Venezuela, dampening speculation that Washington could look to Caracas for help amid concerns over global energy supplies due to the war in Ukraine.

“It’s not an active conversation at this time,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.

US President Joe Biden is looking for ways to relieve pressure on oil prices due to the conflict, after his administration last week announced a ban on imports of Russian oil and gas. Europe is also working to become less reliant on supplies from Moscow.

IRPIN, Ukraine — The bodies of Russian soldiers were scattered by the wreckage of charred military vehicles and shelled buildings. Twenty feet away, behind tanker trucks, Ukrainian volunteers stood watch, their eyes on a cement mixer about 500 yards away. Behind it were Russian troops on the edges of Bucha, the next town over.

This front line in Irpin, on Kyiv’s northwest outskirts, had not moved in two weeks despite the Russian military superiority. That itself was a victory for Commander Casper and his fighters.

“The Russians were trying to push forward,” said the short, burly unit leader who did not give his full name for security reasons but goes by a nom de guerre. “But they didn’t expect that the Ukrainians were waiting for them.”

When Russian forces seized control of a military airport in Hostomel, a few miles north of Irpin, on the first day of the war, many military observers expected a rapid takeover of Kyiv. But more than two weeks later, Russian troops have struggled to advance.

A visit to two active front lines — Irpin and near Brovary, northeast of the capital’s center — offered insights into the strategies, tactics and capabilities of Ukrainian forces defending Kyiv as well as apparent Russian tactical errors and miscalculations about Ukraine’s resistance.

On Tuesday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, announced a citywide curfew until early Thursday in what he called a “difficult and dangerous moment” as Russian forces intensify attacks.

The United States and as many as 20 other nations, mostly NATO and European Union members, have pledged to send Ukrainian forces significant shipments of weaponry, including Javelin antitank missiles, Stinger surface-to-air missiles, machine guns and sniper rifles. It’s unclear how many of these additional arms have reached Ukrainian forces in Kyiv, leaving them to rely on the arsenal at hand and adapt their tactics in the field.

“The Russians were not ready for unconventional warfare,” said Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and an expert on Russian defense policy. “They were not ready for unconventional tactics. They are not sure how to deal with this insurgency, guerilla-warfare-type situation.”

To be sure, most military analysts and Western officials still predict that Russian forces will eventually encircle Kyiv and push into the capital, possibly aided by airstrikes. While this could prove true, it’s far from clear whether Russia will prevail.

For the Ukrainian forces, this war is one of attrition. They appear to be trying to slow and wear down the Russian military, creating conditions for a stalemate on the outer boundaries of Kyiv. That would buy the Ukrainians time for other pressures on Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Off the battlefield, these include tightening international sanctions on Russia and diplomatic efforts for Russian concessions. On the fronts, Putin’s forces face more Western heavy weaponry delivered to Ukraine, and growing global outrage for killing civilians and bombing residential areas and hospitals — acts that could be war crimes.

In interviews, Ukrainian soldiers also said they capitalize on the Russians’ own flaws, including the use of predictable strategies, a lack of knowledge of local terrain and even a surprising unpreparedness for a grinding conflict. Reports have surfaced on social media and on battlefields of Russian soldiers running out of food, water and fuel for their vehicles. Some have reportedly surrendered after getting lost or losing morale. Russian military convoys have slowed down or halted because of mechanical failures.

“Ukraine’s main game is a game for time,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russian studies at the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) in Arlington, Va. “To try to do something else is going to waste a lot of military potential they have available. Are they in a position to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine? No. Are they in a position to win the war? Yes.”

Across the country, Ukrainian forces have fallen back to the cities, refusing to engage with Russian forces in rural areas, out in the open. While Moscow has gained control of southern cities such as Kherson and Melitopol, it is struggling to take over nearby Mariupol and other hubs across Ukraine, such as Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy.

That is also the case in the southern city of Mykolaiv, where, for more than a week now, Ukrainian forces have prevented a major Russian advance west toward the strategic port of Odessa.

In Kyiv, the seat of government, the stakes could not be higher.

So far, Ukraine’s defenders have blocked Russia’s primary effort: encircle and seize the capital, using the airfield in Hostomel as an air bridge for more tanks, armored vehicles and other weaponry. Ukrainian forces have shot down several Russian helicopters and so far have prevented a major Russian armored column from pressing into the capital. Meanwhile, a solid air-defense system has been mobilized against airstrikes and missile attacks.

“The biggest problem is that [Russia] didn’t organize a proper military operation,” Kofman said. “They thought they were just going to drive in and they weren’t going to get a fight. That led to a lot of disasters because they didn’t plan.”

Seesaw battles have unfolded in the areas of Hostomel, Bucha and Irpin — a possible harbinger of the street-by-street urban warfare that could envelop the capital if Russian forces break through.

On Saturday, large plumes of black smoke rose above the town of Bucha amid the incessant thuds of shells landing. “We have planted antitank mines everywhere,” Casper said with a laugh.

Battle for Brovary

Roughly 40 miles away, on the other side of the capital, Russian forces tried to push into Kyiv from the northeast. A column of tanks moved down a main highway toward the town of Brovary. As they passed a cluster of houses, the Ukrainian forces saw an opportunity.

They pummeled the convoy with artillery shells and antitank missiles, destroying or disabling several tanks and armored personnel carriers. Russian soldiers fled their vehicles and ran into the woods, according to videos posted on social media by Ukraine’s military. One tank slowly rolled to a halt, engulfed in flames. (The videos could not be independently verified but fit with descriptions of the battle provided by Ukrainian fighters and doctors treating the wounded.)

The ambush unveiled the Russians’ ineffective and, at times, inexplicable tactics, military analysts said.

The tanks and other military vehicles were crawling slowly on the open highway, making them an easy target. They also were bunched up close to each other, which allowed a single artillery shell to knock out multiple vehicles. There were also no dismounted infantry troops moving parallel in the woods or alongside the column to detect potential ambushes.

What was also surprising, analysts said, is that some of the tanks were generations old and not well-equipped, including the T-72, a Soviet-era tank that first entered production more than 50 years ago.

“It’s kind of bizarre seeing this,” said Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “Kyiv is the decisive mission, the decisive objective, and yet they are sending in some very old units to take it.”

The ambush also led to civilian casualties. The Russian soldiers who fled the convoy hid in nearby villages and shot anyone they deemed suspicious. Over the following two days, 23 civilians and soldiers arrived at the Brovary Central District Hospital, many with bullet wounds, said Valentin Baganyuk, the hospital’s director.

They included members of a family shot after they left their house. As the father drove, bullets hit his hand, blowing three fingers off, and wounded him in the head as well. His 14-year-old daughter was also struck. The father managed to drive to safety.

“The Russians targeted them as they tried to escape from their village,” Baganyuk said.

‘Line to defend’

Tucked inside the forests on the northwestern edges of Kyiv, Ukrainian artillery batteries have battered Russian positions inside Irpin and Bucha in attempts to slow a possible advance. The bridge connecting the capital to Irpin was demolished by Ukrainian forces to stop Russian armored vehicles from crossing.

As an added precaution, the road from the destroyed bridge into Kyiv’s center has been barricaded every 100 yards with large concrete blocks, tanker trucks, tires and sandbags.

On the other side of the bridge, at the entrance to Irpin’s center, volunteer armed groups have dug trenches on a hill with a commanding vantage point to strike Russian forces or attempt to ambush them.

In front of the hill, Ukrainian fighters wearing camouflage were positioned behind trees. Other fighters were inside buildings. They looked out on streets that Russians would need to use to move toward Kyiv.

“They have their own line to defend, and we have to keep our position,” said Igor Zadorozhny, 30, a former army officer now defending the city in an armed unit set up by Irpin’s mayor. “Right now, there is a stalemate.”

The conflict is a jumble of small confrontations, often at Ukrainian checkpoints, tit-for-tat artillery shelling and moments of heavy street battles.

“They attack our posts,” said Artiem, 34, a realtor-turned-soldier. “Then we attack them, and they run back.” Like all Ukrainian fighters interviewed by The Washington Post along the front lines, he declined to give his full name for security reasons.

He said Russian forces don’t know Irpin’s geography. At times, they make wrong turns or end up getting stuck on small streets in their tanks and armored vehicles. That has allowed Ukrainian fighters inside buildings to strike them.

The Russians “are disoriented in the city,” Artiem said.

Clutching a rifle, Zadorozhny, the former army officer, said Ukrainian forces were waiting for civilians to evacuate Irpin before “we start to clear the city” of Russians.

“They don’t have enough provisions, food, water,” he said, recounting reports from residents of Russian soldiers looting houses and stores. “They don’t have a lot of gasoline. They will get tired. And then we will go and drive them out.”

Local knowledge of the urban terrain was a major asset for Kyiv’s defenders, Zadorozhny said. “Everything, every stone, every tree is for us,” he said.

Another fighter, 32-year-old Roman, said residents have been providing intelligence to help target the Russians in areas where there is still cellphone reception.

“They are trying to take Kyiv, but they won’t,” Roman said. “Everything is helping us.”

‘Defend our positions’

With Russian ground forces slowed down, another question grows: Will Moscow escalate bombing Kyiv to pressure the government to surrender or flee? So far, the capital has largely escaped the intense barrage of airstrikes and shelling that have hammered cities such as Kharkiv and Chernihiv.

At Casper’s checkpoint, Russian forces have stepped up their attacks. Tanks fired between 20 to 25 shells, demolishing a large blue house next to the Ukrainians’ base on Friday. The Ukrainians didn’t fire back.

“Our goal is to defend our positions, not to attack the Russians,” Casper said.

Such a tactic is smart, military analysts said.

Ukraine’s military cannot compete with the might of Russian weaponry and needs to conserve a much smaller arsenal rather than waste resources on counteroffensives. Casper said they also wanted to keep the road from Bucha open to allow more civilians to flee. Firing back could turn the road into a battle zone, he said.

The Russians, he added, have sent teams to explode Ukrainian mines. But what if Russian tanks do roll down the road toward his checkpoint one day?

Casper smiled and walked to a warehouse. He came out with a British-supplied NLAW antitank missile and a rocket-propelled grenade.

“We know how to greet them,” he said, holding the weapons in his hands. “We have everything right here.”
