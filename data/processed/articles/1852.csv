Here’s more from the Reuters report: GCHQ, which gathers communications from around the world to identify and disrupt threats to Britain, has a close relationship with the U.S. National Security Agency and with the eavesdropping agencies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand in a consortium called “Five Eyes”. Russia’s defence ministry says its armed forces are professional and carrying out their duty in Ukraine with considerable success. It says the West has spread lies about the operation in an attempt to bring down Russia. The United States assesses that Russia is suffering failure rates as high as 60% for some of its precision-guided missiles, three U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence told Reuters. Putin was misled by advisers who were too scared to tell him how poorly the war in Ukraine is going and how damaging Western sanctions have been, U.S. and European officials said on Wednesday. The Kremlin made no immediate comment. Putin says the “special military operation” in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine.

Ukraine’s president said in a televised address to the nation on Wednesday that “for the moment there are just words, nothing concrete”. Zelenskiy said he talked to Joe Biden for an hour on another “very active diplomatic day”, thanking the US president for a new $1bn humanitarian aid package and an additional $500m in direct budget support. Zelenskiy said: “The support of the United States is vital for us. And now it is especially important to lend a hand to Ukraine, to show all the power of the democratic world.”

31 Mar 2022 23.55 Russia announces ceasefire in Mariupol The Russian defence ministry announced a local ceasefire on Thursday to allow civilians to be evacuated from Ukraine’s besieged port city of Mariupol, according to Agence France-Presse. A humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, via the Russian-controlled port of Berdiansk, would be opened from 10am (7am GMT), the ministry said on Wednesday. “For this humanitarian operation to succeed, we propose to carry it out with the direct participation of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross,” the ministry statement said. The Russian ministry asked Kyiv to guarantee the “unconditional respect” for the ceasefire through written notification to the Russian side, the UNHCR and ICRC before 6am (3am GMT) Thursday. Moscow also asked the Ukrainian army to commit to ensure the security of the bus convoys along the designated corridor. The ministry also said it had agreed to a proposal from Kyiv to open in the last 24 hours four new humanitarian corridors from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia.



31 Mar 2022 23.35 US President Joe Biden has promised to end the “nightmare” of Americans detained in Russia after meeting with the parents of a former US Marine imprisoned in Russia on Wednesday. US citizen Trevor Reed is serving a nine-year prison term in a penal colony some 500 km (300 miles) southeast of Moscow after being convicted of assaulting police officers while drunk in 2019. “President Biden met today with Joey and Paula Reed, the parents of Trevor Reed, who is wrongfully detained in Russia,” presidential spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. “During their meeting, the President reiterated his commitment to continue to work to secure the release of Trevor, Paul Whelan, and other Americans wrongfully held in Russia and elsewhere.” “We understand the pain felt by all of Trevor’s families and friends enduring the nightmare of his absence, which we are committed to bringing to an end.” US State department spokesman Ned Price earlier said that US diplomats are being denied access to Americans being held by Russia. Those include Reed and Paul Whelan, who are being held on what the United States says are false or trumped-up charges, and professional basketball Brittney Griner, who was detained in Moscow airport on 17 February 17 on charges of carrying vape cartridges that contained cannabis oil in her luggage.



31 Mar 2022 23.18 Rouble recovers to pre-war levels The Russian rouble has recovered to its pre-war value despite western sanctions on the country’s exports and financial systems. The currency was trading at 75.5 to one US dollar on Thursday morning, compared with almost 140 to the dollar at the beginning of March when it crashed with the onest of sanctions. That is actually better than it was on 22 February, two days before the invasion, when it was at 80 per dollar. A 200 rouble note. Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters Russia has bolstered the currency by raising interest rates to 20% – therefore encouraging investment in the rouble – and imposing capital controls which mean that people cannot swap roubles for other currencies. The Kremlin’s threat to make European gas importers like Germany pay for their supplies in roubles – thus boosting the currency’s value – has also helped. More help has come from China and India, which have increased the amount of Russian oil they are buying thanks to generous discounts from Moscow.



31 Mar 2022 23.15 A recent Russian military report appears to contradict Russia’s promise to withdraw its troops from Ukraine’s north following “meaningful” progress at peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday. Following the talks, Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”. The promises were seemingly made in good faith, however a recent report from Russia’s ministry of defence published in a Telegram post late on Wednesday states Russia is merely undertaking a “planned regrouping of troops” after successfully completing its military objectives in Kyiv and Chernihiv. The report, titled ‘highlights of the day’, reads: All the main tasks of the Russian Armed Forces in the Kyiv and Chernigov [Chernihiv] directions have been completed. A planned regrouping of troops is taking place in these areas, its goal is to intensify actions in priority areas and, above all, complete the operation to completely liberate Donbas.” A destroyed Russian tank seen in Trostyanets in the Sumy region of Ukraine. Photograph: Roman Pilipey/EPA Western and Ukrainian officials reacted warily to Russia’s claim, publicly voicing their scepticism. In an intelligence report published by Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces on Wednesday did note that Russian troops were withdrawing from the territory of Kyiv and Chernihiv but described the movement as merely “a rotation of individual units” with aims to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine. The report read: According to some indications, the Russian enemy is regrouping units to focus its main efforts on the east. At the same time, the so-called ‘withdrawal of troops’ is probably a rotation of individual units and aims to mislead the military leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and create a misconception about the occupiers’ refusal to plan to encircle the city of Kyiv.”

31 Mar 2022 22.25 A somewhat exasperated Zelenskiy has said peace talks with Russia are ongoing but nothing “concrete” has come out of them. The Ukrainian leader released another video address from the streets of the capital, saying Russia is continuing to mass troops near Donbas and any withdrawal form near Kyiv was due to Ukrainian resistance. “We know that this is not a withdrawal, but the consequences of... the work of our defenders,” he said. “But we also see that at the same time there is an accumulation of Russian troops for new strikes in Donbas. And we are preparing for this.” Watch Zelenskiy’s latest address in the video below. 00:58 Zelenskiy says peace talks will continue with Russia but nothing is concrete – video



31 Mar 2022 22.09 Ukraine neutrality would need to go to referendum in process that could take at least a year It could take at least a year for Ukraine to hold a referendum on its neutrality - a key Russian demand to end the war - according to the head of Ukraine’s delegation at peace talks with Russia. David Arakhamia told the Financial Times that the parties were close to agreement on the security guarantees and Ukraine’s EU bid, but urged caution about the prospects for a breakthrough. “All the issues” have been “on the table since the beginning” of negotiations but “lots of points — like in every single item there are unresolved points”, Arakhamia said. Any prospective deal would have to be agreed with the guarantors and ratified by their parliaments, Zelenskiy reiterated on Sunday. Ukraine would then put the deal to a national referendum where any decision would ultimately be made by the people of Ukraine. This would not occur until perhaps several months’ time before a possible change to constitution — a process that could require at least a year. The only resolved [issue] is the type of international guarantees Ukraine is looking for, but . . . we still have to get the approval from the guarantors otherwise the deal will never fly,” Arakhamia said. In a TV interview, Arakhamia said declaring neutrality would require three million signatures to be registered. “This is a big procedure that cannot take place outside of peaceful territory,” he said.



31 Mar 2022 22.01 Germany could ration power if gas standoff with Russia continues Martin Farrer Germany could ration power if a standoff over a Russian demand to pay for fuel with roubles disrupts or halts supplies.

Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, on Wednesday implemented the “early warning phase” of an existing gas emergency plan, where a crisis team from the economics ministry, the regulator and the private sector will monitor imports and storage. Habeck told reporters Germany’s gas supplies were guaranteed for now but urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption, saying that “every kilowatt hour counts”. A bus passes by the Adlershof gas-fired power station in Berlin on Wednesday. Photograph: Michael Sohn/AP If supplies fall short, Germany’s network regulator can ration gas, with industry first in line for cuts and preferential treatment for private households, hospitals and other critical institutions. Paying in Russia’s currency would undercut the effectiveness of western sanctions on the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine and Germany, which depends on Russia for much of its natural gas, is under pressure not to accede to the demand. Moscow is expected to make public its plans for rouble payments on Thursday, Reuters says, although it said it would not immediately demand that buyers pay for gas exports in the currency. As analysts waited for more clarity on the situation and whether Russia would cut off supplies, figures showed that March was the most expensive month for power prices in European history, analysts at Rystad Energy said on Thursday, breaking the record set in December for the big five European markets (Germany, France, Italy, UK, Spain).

Italy will end up with highest average prices, above €300 for the month of March.

UK, France and Spain are not far behind, all close to €300, and then a sizable gap down to Germany around €250 and the Nordics around €140.

31 Mar 2022 21.23 President Joe Biden’s administration is considering releasing 1 million barrels of oil a day for several months from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to reduce gasoline prices, two senior US officials have said. Biden is expected to give remarks on Thursday on his administration’s actions, the White House said, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and sanctions on Moscow have driven up the price of oil. The White House said Biden will deliver remarks at 1:30pm ET (5:30pm GMT) on “his administration’s actions to reduce the impact of Putin’s price hike on energy prices and lower gas prices at the pump for American families.” It did not give additional details.

The Biden administration is considering another release of oil from the SPR to help stabilise global energy markets that, if carried out, could be bigger than the sale of 30 million barrels earlier this month, a US source said on Friday. International Energy Agency member states agreed to release over 60 million barrels of oil reserves earlier in March, with 30 million barrels coming from the US SPR. The Biden administration is considering temporarily removing restrictions on summer sales of higher-ethanol gasoline blends as a way to lower fuel costs for US consumers, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Adding more ethanol to gasoline blends could potentially reduce prices at US gas pumps because ethanol, which is made from corn, is currently cheaper than straight gasoline.

31 Mar 2022 20.59 Belarus will allow companies to export potash fertiliser in response to western sanctions, starting on 6 April 6, RIA news agency reported, citing a government decision. Belarus is the world’s third-largest producer of the crop nutrient after Canada and Russia and state-owned Belaruskali is one of the world’s largest players, according to Reuters. RIA said the Belarus government would grant export licenses to Belaruskali and the Belarus Potash Co (BPC). Washington has given BPC clients until 1 April to wind down their business with the firm. This month, the European Union tightened existing sanctions on Belarus to completely ban potash exports while conceding they could still be sent to Russia or third countries. Landlocked Belarus previously relied on shipments from the Baltic Sea port of Klaipeda in Lithuania. Vilnius halted the use of its railway for Belarus exports from 1 February. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said on 21 March that the potash market would need to be discreet, like the arms trade, a local agency reported.



31 Mar 2022 20.38 Dan Sabbagh The Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, brings us this this analysis piece, asking: Why is Russia’s military regrouping and can Ukraine forces disrupt them? Russia’s announcement on Tuesday that it would “reduce military activity” around Kyiv and the nearby city of Chernihiv has been greeted with predictable scepticism, not least because shelling of both cities has continued. While some movement of troops from the north back to Belarus has been detected, these appear to be part of normal operational redeployments, and they do not yet definitively amount to a retreat. Ukraine’s general staff said overnight Russia was engaged in “probably a rotation of the separate units and aims at misleading”. If anything the shelling, with its consequences for civilians, is sadly to be expected: Russia will want to cover any halting of the ground offensive with firepower both to maintain uncertainty and keep Ukrainian forces tied down. And the capacity to bomb the city from a distance remains. Yet, it is obvious that Russia is, in the words of Konrad Muzyka, a military intelligence specialist and president of Rochan Consulting, “buying time” – as it seeks to refocus on the Donbas region and win a more conventional military victory in the east. The evident reality is that five weeks of near constant fighting north-west of the capital have utterly depleted Russia’s combat power. Across the board, Russian forces have suffered more than 10,000 casualties, the US now estimates – for a war that few of its troops expected or were properly prepared for. Read the full story below.

30 Mar 2022 19.55 Here’s a little more from Pentagon spokesman John Kirby’s briefing earlier. Kirby said the Pentagon agrees with assessments - mentioned earlier by White House director of communications Kate Bedingfield - that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not being fully informed about events in Ukraine. Kirby said the Pentagon saw this assessment as “disconcerting”. It’s his military. It’s his war. He chose it...the fact that he may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine, that’s a little discomforting. Kirby also said that an uninformed Putin could result in a “less than faithful” effort at ending the conflict through negotiations. If he’s not fully informed of how poorly he’s doing, then how are his negotiators going to come up with an agreement?” Kirby asked.

30 Mar 2022 19.25 Slovakia has said it will expel 35 Russian diplomats based on information provided by intelligence services. The move comes a day after fellow EU countries Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the Czech Republic all announced the expulsion of dozens of Russian diplomats suspected of spying. Other countries, including the United States and Poland, had earlier also expelled Russian diplomats. Slovakia will “reduce the staff of the Russian embassy in Bratislava by 35,” foreign ministry spokesman Juraj Tomaga told AFP. “We regret that following the previous expulsions of Russian diplomats in the last couple of years, the Russian diplomatic mission has not shown any interest in operating correctly in Slovakia,” he added. Slovakia, a member of the European Union, had already expelled three Russian diplomats for espionage earlier this month. Prime minister Eduard Heger showed his displeasure in a Facebook post headlined “Dasvidania,” or goodbye in Russian. My government will not tolerate having Russians in Slovakia, under diplomatic cover, leading massive espionage activities, corrupting our citizens, spreading disinformation and polarising our society.”

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Ukraine: Russian shelling hits evacuation convoy, one dead

One person was killed and four wounded when Russian forces shelled an evacuation convoy out of the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner Lyudmyla Denisova said.

Denisova said that there were ""civilian volunteers"" on the buses.

Denisova said Russian forces were ""denying any chance of evacuating peaceful citizens from besieged Chernihiv, essentially holding tens of thousands of people hostage without food, water or heat.""

Russia had previously announced it would draw down military activities around Chernihiv.

Pentagon: Ukraine stopped Russian convoy near Kyiv 'pretty quickly'

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby it was not clear if Russia's convoy of military vehicles to Kyiv, ""even exists"" anymore after failing to accomplish its mission.

The stalled convoy, which had once stretched some 40 miles (64 kilometers), became a symbol of Russia's battlefield difficulties and had been reportedly attacked several times by Ukrainian forces during the first weeks of the more than monthlong war.

""I don't even know if it still exists at this point... They never really accomplished their mission,"" Kirby told reporters, responding to a question about whether the Pentagon had any updates about the convoy.

""They never really accomplished their mission. They never really provided any supply of any value to Russian forces assembling around Kyiv,"" he added.

""The Ukrainians put a stop to that convoy pretty quickly.""

UN nuclear watchdog says Russian forces have left Chernobyl

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it has been informed by Ukraine that Russian forces have ""in writing, transferred control"" of the Chernobyl nuclear plant to Ukrainian authorities.

Energoatom, Ukraine's nuclear operator company, earlier reported that most of the Russian forces that were occupying the Chernobyl nuclear power station had left.

Energoatom said only a ""small number"" of Russian troops remained, but the majority were heading toward Belarus.

""The information is confirmed that the occupiers, who seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and other facilities in the exclusion zone, have set off in two columns toward the Ukrainian border with the Republic of Belarus,"" it said in a statement.

Russian troops were exposed to ""significant doses"" of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site around the now-closed Chernobyl plant, Energoatom said.

The troops ""panicked at the first sign of illness,"" which ""showed up very quickly,"" and began preparing to leave, the operator added.

The IAEA said it could not confirm that Russian forces had received high doses of radiation.

Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the US continues ""to see indications"" that Russian troops were departing from Chernobyl.

""But we don't see any indication that they're going be sent home,"" he told reporters.

Kirby said the troops' departure was ""not necessarily because of a health hazard or emergency at Chernobyl,"" but rather for repositioning to be ""resupplied and used elsewhere in Ukraine.""

Germany says sent over €80 million worth of weapons to Ukraine

German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Germany has delivered more than €80 million ($88.62 million) worth of weapons to Ukraine so far, ""and more are to follow.""

Berlin has come under fire over what critics say is not enough military aid to Kyiv, as compared to, for instance, Washington.

Earlier this month, the White House said US President Joe Biden was sending an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine.

According to the White House, the figure brings the total US security assistance to Kyiv to $1 billion in one week — and a total of $2 billion since Biden took office in early 2021.

Ukraine says Russian forces killed 148 children

Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Russian forces have killed 148 children during shelling and airstrikes.

According to the ministry, Russia has fired 1,370 missiles and destroyed 15 Ukrainian airports since the start of the invasion on February 24.

Over 10 million Ukrainians have been displaced by the war, the ministry said.

The figures could not be independently verified.

Biden says Putin 'seems to be self-isolated'

US President Joe Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be self-isolating and may have sacked some of his advisers.

""He seems to be self-isolated and there's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,"" Biden said. ""But I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time.""

Earlier, US and UK intelligence reports said Putin was being ""misled"" by his advisers about the developments of the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin denied the claim.

UN delivers aid to northern Ukraine, says south inaccessible

Osnat Lubrani, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, says supplies have been delivered for thousands of people in the country's northeast — but some encircled cities in the south of Ukraine remain difficult to reach.

Lubrani said food rations from the UN's partners will benefit nearly 6,000 people in Sumy and areas including Trostianets and Okhtyrka.

According to Lubrani, basic household items, including blankets and kettles from the UN refugee agency, will support 1,500 people. Sanitation kits will also help 6,000 people with hygiene and drinking water, she said.

The UN-facilitated humanitarian notification system with Ukraine and Russia enabled safe passage for the convoy to Sumy on Thursday, ""but this is clearly not enough,"" Lubrani said.

However, efforts to reach Mariupol, Kherson and other southern Ukrainian cities have been unsuccessful over the past month due to safety concerns.

Britain, allies to send more 'lethal aid' to Ukraine

British Defense Minister Ben Wallace said Britain and its allies have agreed to send more military aid to Ukraine.

""There'll be more lethal aid going into Ukraine as a result of today. A number of countries have come forward either with new ideas or indeed more pledges of money,"" Wallace told reporters.

He said the aid for Ukraine would include the provision of air and coastal defense systems, longer-range artillery and counter-battery capabilities, armored vehicles and wider training and logistical support.

The minister's statement came after he hosted over 35 international partners at the second International Defense Donor Conference for Ukraine (IDDCU).

""Today's donor conference demonstrates the international community's determination to support Ukraine in the face of President Putin's illegal and unprovoked invasion by Russian forces,"" Wallace said in a later statement.

Oil prices fall as Biden releases oil reserves

US President Joe Biden has announced the largest-ever release of US emergency oil reserve in a bid to bring down gasoline prices.

Prices have soared in recent weeks over fears of a major supply shortfall in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Following the news about Biden's move, oil prices tumbled. London's Brent crude and New York's WTI managed to pull back slightly in mid-afternoon trading but were both still more than 4% lower at prices well above $100 (€90) a barrel.

Biden said the US will release 1 million barrels of oil a day for the next six months.

""The scale of this release is unprecedented: the world has never had a release of oil reserves at this one million per day rate for this length of time,"" the White House said in a statement. ""This record release will provide a historic amount of supply to serve as bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up.""

US sanctions Russian tech firms

The US Treasury Department announced sanctions against a series of Russian tech firms, including Russia's largest chip maker.

The US Treasury said the sanctions are ""part of its crackdown on the Kremlin's sanctions evasion networks and technology companies, which are instrumental to the Russian Federation's war machine.""

IAEA chief arrives in Russia for talks

The International Atomic Energy Agency said its director, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has arrived in Russia's Baltic Sea exclave of Kaliningrad for talks with senior Russian officials.

The UN nuclear watchdog did not specify whom Grossi would meet on Friday.

Grossi arrived in Russia after visiting a nuclear power plant in Ukraine and held talks with top officials on efforts to ensure the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power plants.

There are 15 active nuclear reactors at four plants in Ukraine. Russia's military controls one of them, Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest nuclear power plant.

Red Cross team prepares for Mariupol evacuation

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its team has assembled in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with medicines, food, water, hygiene items and other essentials.

The team is preparing to take civilians out of the besieged port city of Mariupol.

""We're here because really, we hope to be able to facilitate safe passage for civilians desperately wanting to flee Mariupol,"" said Lucile Marbeau, a staff member with the ICRC team hoping to enter the city.

Russia has said it committed to a cease-fire along the route from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, and Ukrainian authorities said they were sending 45 buses to collect civilians from the city and provide aid to those who remain.

Julien Lerisson, deputy director of operations for the ICRC, said the organization has high-level agreement for the mission but is focused on making sure ""the order trickles down the chain of command,"" allowing the team to enter and leave Mariupol safely.

Western sanctions on Russia forced leasing companies to terminate contracts with Russian airlines for more than 500 aircraft. Over 400 of them remain in Russia, Reuters reported.

Russia bans entry of top EU officials, lawmakers

Moscow has imposed entry bans on representatives of the European Union in response to Western sanctions.

""The last package [of sanctions] doesn't need to be the final one, it should not be the final one,"" he told reporters,

Habeck added that he and French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire had ""identified additional points that could be included in a [sanctions] package.""

The German minister declined to elaborate on what those points might be.

Zelenskyy calls on Belgium to send arms to Ukraine

Speaking to Belgian lawmakers, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Belgium to deliver arms to help his people fight Russian troops, especially in Mariupol.

The Ukrainian leader called on Belgium to consider peace more important than trade with Russia.

""I think that peace is much more valuable than diamonds, than agreements with Russia, than Russian ships in the ports, more also than Russian oil and gas, so help us!

Zelenskyy went on to say that the besieged city of Mariupol, in southern Ukraine, remained with thousands of civilians without access to ""anything necessary to survive.""

""Today [Mariupol] is hell on earth... but no one has the determination to stop the disaster,"" Zelenskyy said via video call.

Macron calls for extended cease-fire in Mariupol

French President Emmanuel Macron's office said Russia's hourslong cease-fire on Thursday was not enough time to allow trapped residents to get out of — or aid into — the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

The city has been surrounded by Russian troops since the beginning of March, and its residents have been in dire humanitarian conditions.

On Thursday, the Ukrainian government sent 45 buses to Mariupol to get people out. It's still unclear if the mission was successful.

Putin says gas payments to be made via Russian accounts

Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that foreign countries open accounts with Gazprombank in order to continue receiving Russian gas.

Putin signed a decree stipulating that foreign buyers must transfer foreign currency to a special Gazprombank account. The bank would then act as intermediary, buying rubles on behalf of the gas buyer to transfer the payment in Russian currency to another special account.

If ""unfriendly"" countries fail to comply with Putin's order, Russian gas supplied would be cut off, he said.

Watch video 00:55 Putin: 'Purchasers have to open ruble accounts in Russian banks'

It came day after Germany said Putin had assured Chancellor Olaf Sholz in a phone call that gas payments could still be made in euros.

""De facto, for those who receive Russian gas, who pay for the deliveries, there is in fact no change. They just acquire rubles for the amount in currency which is stipulated in the gas contract,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday.

""Russia remains committed to all its obligations under existing contracts, both in quantity and in price,"" he said, adding that Putin and Scholz had discussed the system in detail a day earlier.

Conscription is a sensitive issue in Russia. Putin has denied on various occasions that Russia is ordering conscripts into Ukraine though on March 9, the Ministry of Defense acknowledged some conscripts had indeed been sent to invade Ukraine.

At the time, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin had ordered military investigators to punish those responsible for ordering conscripts into Ukraine, something he insisted had not been ordered despite the defense ministry's contradictory statement.

Summary of events in the Russian war in Ukraine on Wednesday

South Ossetian leader Anatoly Bibilov said that the breakaway republic wants to hold a vote on integration into the Russian Federation.

The head of the United Kingdom's eavesdropping agency, GCHQ, said Russia's President Vladimir Putin ""has massively misjudged the situation"" in Ukraine.

Russia's Defense Ministry reiterated its plan to focus forces on securing the separatist republics in the Donbas despite its forces continuing to bombard Kyiv and Chernihiv on Wednesday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that European companies could continue paying for gas in euros. Putin said the money would be paid into Gazprom Bank, which is not a subject of sanctions, and then transferred in rubles to Russia.

War in Ukraine fuels fears among draft-age Russian youths

As Moscow’s forces bog down in Ukraine, many young Russians of the draft age have been increasingly jittery about the prospect of being sent into combat.

Making those fears particularly acute is an annual spring conscription that begins on Friday and aims to round up 134,500 men for a one-year tour of military duty.

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu pledged at a meeting of the military brass this week that the recruits will not be sent to front lines or “hotspots”.

But the statement was met with scepticism by many in Russia who remember the separatist wars in the southern republic of Chechnya in the 1990s and the early 2000s, when thousands of poorly trained young men were killed.

“I don’t trust them when they say they won’t send conscripts into combat. They lie all the time,” said Vladislav, a 22-year-old who is completing his studies and fears he could face the draft immediately after graduation.

Ukraine hopes for ‘super modern’ equipment for air force

Ukraine’s ambassador to Japan, Sergiy Korsunsky, has told the media that the country might soon be able to better protect itself from Russian air attacks because it is expecting to get “super modern” equipment from the US and the United Kingdom.

“They still have superiority in air force, in airplanes and missiles, and we expect to begin to receive super-modern equipment from the United States and Britain to protect our skies and our cities,” Korsunsky said.

In a series of tweets on Thursday, Ukraine’s air force said it needed “Patriot systems from the US or the cheaper, more mobile NASAMS system from Norway”.

Both Patriot and NASAMS are surface-to-air missile systems.

To effectively protect 🇺🇦, the optimal solution would be Patriot systems from the 🇺🇲 or the cheaper, more mobile NASAMS systems from 🇳🇴. In addition, 🇺🇦 could also use more Soviet-era S-300 and BUK-M1 systems, which are also currently effective against the enemy. (16/16) — Ukrainian Air Force (@KpsZSU) March 31, 2022

New conscripts to join Russian armed forces

April 1 marks the spring draft in the Russian military.

Some 134,500 conscripts have been called up this time around, according to a presidential decree.

It is not clear what role conscripts might have played in the war in Ukraine.

Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that none of those called up would be sent to any “hotspots”.

The biannual draft is set to take in 134.5k conscripts starting April 1. However, the question is what will Moscow do with current conscripts due to be released from service. Many are in supporting roles, and some are in the war despite official promises they wouldn’t be. — Michael Kofman (@KofmanMichael) April 1, 2022

“Between 1,200 and 2,000 of these Russian troops are being reorganised into 3x Battalion Tactical Groups,” the defence ministry said in a Twitter post.

“It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion.”

Russia’s Gazprombank is the intermediary for rouble gas payments, Putin order says

President Vladimir Putin’s decree says that foreign buyers of Russian gas will have to use special accounts at the country’s Gazprombank to pay for the import of the energy source, the Reuters news agency reports.

Gazprombank would then transfer the rouble funds of the foreign gas buyer to Gazprom’s rouble accounts. The bank can open such accounts without the presence of a foreign buyer’s representative, according to Reuters.

OPEC sticks to modest boost in oil despite war jitters

OPEC and allied oil producers, including Russia, have decided to stick to a modest increase in the amount of crude they pump to the world despite Western pressure to step up production as a result of the war in Ukraine.

The group, known as OPEC+, said it would add 432,000 barrels per day in May, as it works to gradually restore production cuts made during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic. That’s slightly up from 400,000 barrels in previous months.

The alliance has been unmoved by pleas from oil-consuming countries to pump more oil as energy prices soar, fueling inflation worldwide. High prices have helped Russia – the world’s largest exporter – offset some of the impacts of Western sanctions.

Russian troops not withdrawing but regrouping, NATO says

Russian forces in Ukraine are not withdrawing but regrouping, NATO’s secretary-general has said in response to Moscow’s announcements about a scaling down of military operations around Kyiv and Chernihiv.

“According to our intelligence, Russian units are not withdrawing but repositioning. Russia is trying to regroup, resupply and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas region,” Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels.

“At the same time, Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering,” he added.

UK unveils new sanctions on ‘shameless’ Putin ‘propagandists’

The United Kingdom has announced a new wave of sanctions against “Russian propagandists and state media”.

The measures are aimed at 14 individuals and entities – including TV presenter Sergey Brilev and Kremlin-funded TV-Novosti, which owns the Russia Today news channel – and follow several previous rounds of sanctions over Moscow’s incursion into Ukraine.

“Britain has helped lead the world in exposing Kremlin disinformation, and this latest batch of sanctions hits the shameless propagandists who push out Putin’s fake news and narratives,” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement.

“We will keep on going with more sanctions to ramp up the pressure on Russia and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine. Nothing and no one is off the table.”

Putin likely ‘not fully informed’ on Ukraine, former UK ambassador says

Tony Brenton, the United Kingdom’s former ambassador to Russia, says it is “likely” that Putin has not been “fully informed” on the state of Russia’s offensive by his aides.

“Putin has been in withdrawal from the details of day-to-day government in Russia for the last two years, while he’s been worrying about COVID,” Brenton told Al Jazeera.

“So I think the likelihood is that he’s not been fully informed on the Russian military situation,” he added.

“And the subordinates around him – he has a rather limited number of people who have access to him – are almost certainly quite cautious about giving him the full details about how bad Russians are doing militarily, although he obviously knows enough that he has substantially altered Russia’s war aims.”

‘Hundreds’ of South Ossetians fighting in Ukraine: ex-separatist leader

The former leader of South Ossetia, a breakaway province in ex-Soviet Georgia, said “hundreds of fighters” have joined Russian forces in Ukraine, complaining they were treated as “cannon fodder”.

“I don’t doubt that the boys who already returned home could go back to the special operation zone and help complete the liberation of Donbas IF THEY FIND IT NECESSARY,” Eduard Kokoity wrote on Telegram on Wednesday.

South Ossetia broke away from Georgia in the 1990s. Its leaders said Georgia’s post-Soviet nationalist government violated the rights of Ossetians to use their language that is distantly related to Farsi.

Russia fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 and recognised the “independence” of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It now has large military bases there.

Ukraine says convoy of buses on its way to Mariupol

A convoy of Ukrainian buses has set out for the besieged, southeastern port city of Mariupol to try to deliver humanitarian supplies and bring out trapped civilians, the country’s deputy prime minister has said.

Iryna Vereshchuk said 45 buses were on their way to Mariupol after the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed Russia had agreed to open a safe corridor. Seventeen buses had already left for Mariupol from Zaporizhzhia, about 220km (136 miles) to the northwest, she added.

Another 28 were waiting for authorisation to pass the Russian checkpoint in Vasylivka, near Zaporizhzhia.

Mariupol’s mayor said this week that up to 170,000 residents were trapped there with no power and dwindling supplies. Previous attempts to organise safe corridors for civilians to evacuate from the city have failed.

UK intelligence chief says some Russian soldiers disobeying orders in Ukraine

The head of one of the UK’s intelligence agencies has said that some Russian soldiers in Ukraine have refused to carry out orders, adding Putin had “misjudged” the invasion.

Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) chief Jeremy Fleming said there was evidence that Moscow’s troops had low morale and were poorly equipped.

“We’ve seen Russian soldiers – short of weapons and morale – refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,” he said during a speech in the Australian capital Canberra.

“It’s clear he [Putin] misjudged the resistance of the Ukrainian people. He underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanize. He underplayed the economic consequences of the sanctions regime, and he overestimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory,” Fleming added.

Although Putin’s advisers were believed to be too afraid to tell the truth, the “extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime,” he said.

Shear']",2022-03-30,"Volunteers using sandbags to fortify the Princess Olga Monument in Kyiv on Wednesday.

Belying its claims of de-escalation, Russia increased bomb and artillery attacks in Ukraine on Wednesday and sent conflicting signals about the prospects for peace, suggesting new tensions in the Kremlin hierarchy about the course of the war.

The contradictory messaging came as a newly declassified U.S. intelligence assessment suggested that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had been misinformed about the war’s trajectory by subordinates, who were fearful of his reaction to the Russian military’s struggles and setbacks.

The intelligence, according to multiple American officials, showed Mr. Putin’s isolation and what appeared to be growing tension between him and the Ministry of Defense, including with his defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, who was once among the most trusted members of the Kremlin inner circle and had been rumored to be a possible successor one day to Mr. Putin.

It was not clear whether the release of the declassified intelligence was intended to sow anxiety within Mr. Putin’s circle as part of a broader information battle between the United States and Russia over Ukraine, the source of the worst tensions between the two nuclear powers since the Cold War. Nor was it clear if the intelligence was accurate.

But American intelligence officials have proved right so far in their assessments of Mr. Putin’s intentions toward Ukraine, beginning with the Russian troop buildup along its borders last year that culminated in the Feb. 24 invasion.

White House officials said that they had released the intelligence to share what they said was a “full understanding” of how Mr. Putin had miscalculated.

“We believe he’s being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions,” Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, told reporters.

Asked about the declassified assessment during a trip to Algiers, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said it was not surprising that Mr. Putin was ill-informed.

“One of the Achilles’ heels of autocracies,” he said, “is that you don’t have people in those systems who speak truth to power or who have the ability to speak truth to power. And I think that is something that we’re seeing in Russia.”

The latest assessment also appeared to track with the mixed messages from the Kremlin on Wednesday about peace talks with Ukraine this week in Istanbul. The chief Russian negotiator described them as promising, but was basically contradicted by the Kremlin’s top spokesman.

New Russian attacks in Ukraine, on the northern city of Chernihiv and the suburbs of Kyiv, also appeared to reflect disarray in Kremlin messaging, coming one day after the Russian military said it was de-escalating in those areas. They suggested that Mr. Putin might be stalling for time, redeploying his invasion forces elsewhere in the country and girding for a protracted conflict.

Mr. Putin’s ultimate aim, however, remains murky.

With the war about to enter its sixth week, its calamitous economic and humanitarian impact has widened. Germany has taken the first steps toward rationing natural gas, in anticipation of Russia potentially cutting off deliveries; the total number of Ukrainian refugees has surpassed four million — half of them children; and the United Nations is forecasting the most dire world hunger crisis since World War II. Ukraine and Russia are ordinarily major suppliers of the world’s wheat and other grains.

The Chernihiv region, which extends to the border with Belarus, appeared to have been targeted with intense Russian strikes early Wednesday, hours after Russia had vowed to sharply reduce combat in that area and near Kyiv. Both were early targets of the Russian invaders, who were stymied by intense and unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance.

“Yesterday, the Russians publicly stated that they were reducing their offensive actions and activity in the Chernihiv and Kyiv areas,” the Chernihiv governor, Vyacheslav Chaus, said in a statement posted on the Telegram social media app. “Do we believe that? Of course not.”

Mr. Chaus said that “civil infrastructure has been destroyed again” by Russian strikes. “Libraries, shopping malls and other facilities have been destroyed, and many houses have been destroyed,” he said. “Because, in fact, the enemy roamed Chernihiv all night.”

In Kyiv, the regional military administration said in a Wednesday post on its Telegram channel that “more than 30 shellings by Russian troops of housing estates and social infrastructure” in the Kyiv region had been recorded over the previous 24 hours.

The mixed messaging from Russia on Wednesday raised questions about whether progress in the peace talks was real.

The lead Russian negotiator in the talks, Vladimir Medinsky, said on Russia’s state television that they appeared to be verging on a breakthrough. Mr. Medinsky said Ukraine’s proposal to declare neutrality, among what he called other concessions, represented its readiness for “building normal and, I hope, good neighborly relations with Russia.”

That language clashed markedly with hard-line rhetoric emanating from Moscow, where supporters of the war, who do not consider Ukraine to be a legitimate country, denounced Mr. Medinsky’s diplomacy as bordering on traitorous.

“Any talks with Nazis before your boot is on their throat are perceived as weakness,” Vladimir Solovyov, a popular state television host, said on his YouTube show, reprising the Kremlin’s false characterization of the Ukrainian government. “You cannot meet with them or talk to them.”

And the Kremlin’s chief spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, was far more cautious in his own comments than Mr. Medinsky. He said that Ukraine’s willingness to put some proposals in writing was a “positive factor,” but that “we do not see anything very promising or any breakthroughs.”

Russia first signaled last week that it was recalibrating the aims of what Mr. Putin has described as a “special military operation” in Ukraine, no longer focusing on seizing Kyiv and other important cities in the north and west of the country but instead on securing the eastern region, known as the Donbas. Russian-backed separatists have been fighting there since 2014.

The Russian Defense Ministry has cast its decision to wind down military operations around Kyiv as a good-faith gesture of de-escalation, but it appeared to be an attempt to explain away a battlefield defeat.

On Wednesday, the ministry said Russian forces around Kyiv were “regrouping,” although that assertion could not be independently confirmed. And it claimed that all along, the aim of gathering forces near Kyiv had not been to take the city but to tie up and weaken Ukrainian troops in the area.

“All these goals were achieved,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that it would now focus on “the final stage of the operation to liberate” the Donbas area.

The secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, Oleksiy Danilov, said Wednesday that at least part of the Russian military’s assertions appeared to be accurate. Some Russian units were relocating to eastern Ukraine and “the enemy is intensifying its formations there,” he said.

But Mr. Danilov cautioned that it would be premature to conclude that Russia had abandoned a push toward the capital, even if it was relocating some troops.

In the Donetsk part of Donbas, fighting escalated on Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said in a statement, as Russian forces “intensified fire and assault operations” with air and missile strikes. Ukraine’s military also reported Russian shelling and bomb strikes in the eastern city of Kharkiv, one of the invasion’s early targets.

Casualties in the war are difficult to confirm. The United Nations, which keeps a daily tally, said Wednesday that at least 1,189 people had been killed so far, although that is almost certainly an undercount.

The possible legal consequences for Russia over its targeting of civilian structures in Ukraine — a potential war crime — moved forward on Wednesday with the formation of a United Nations panel of inquiry. The three-person panel, named by the U.N. Human Rights Council, will “establish the facts, circumstances and root causes” of any crimes arising from the invasion, the council said.

Amid the litany of negative news, there was one potential bright spot: A NASA astronaut returned to Earth on Wednesday with two Russian colleagues, suggesting that despite their antipathy over the crisis in Ukraine, the United States and Russia could still collaborate in space.

For almost as long, Russian and Ukrainian officials have been attempting to negotiate.

Those negotiations have yielded few firm results so far, especially as Russia continues to bombard Ukrainian cities. Still, the talking matters. Diplomacy is the only way this war will finally end, and the type of agreement that might end the fighting looks a lot clearer than it did even a month ago.

In the early days of the war, the talks made little apparent progress. Ukraine appeared to be demanding an immediate ceasefire, and Russian withdrawal of troops.

Russia, however, had pretty different ideas. It laid out some aggressive demands. Among them were: Ukraine’s neutrality and no membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); so-called “demilitarization and “denazification;” the protection of Russian language within Ukraine; and that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia and recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, the two regions in eastern Ukraine that Vladimir Putin had declared as independent on the eve of his full-scale invasion.

In recent days, some glimmers of optimism have emerged. Ukraine has put forward serious proposals, which is centered around a commitment to permanent neutrality and an agreement not to seek NATO membership, in exchange for security guarantees. Russia has also reportedly eased up on some of its previous demands, including “denazification” — a likely ruse for regime change — and “demilitarization,” a sign that Ukraine’s battlefield successes so far have pushed the Kremlin to possibly reconsider some of its most maximalist demands.

Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey’s foreign minister, who is helping to broker the talks, described the discussions earlier in the week as “the most meaningful progress since the start of negotiations.”

But these really are just glimmers of progress — and they might not be so long lasting. Russia, this week, promised to “drastically reduce” military activity around Kyiv and Chernihiv, in the name of “mutual trust,” though reports of shelling continued in those areas. Some, including US and NATO officials, have expressed skepticism that Moscow is sincere, and instead using talks to buy time, so it can regroup and refocus its offensive, potentially on areas in eastern and southern Ukraine. Since then, both Russia and Ukraine have downplayed the seriousness of the talks, even as negotiations resumed Friday.

And huge gulfs remain. Perhaps the most intractable problem may be the future of the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, and Donetsk and Luhansk, which Russia and Russia-backed militias control parts of. Ukraine is unlikely to agree to slice up its country. It is also hard to imagine Russia settling for less territory than it controlled the day before its invasion in February 2022.

Other issues will emerge, and concessions and proposals may shift depending on developments in the battlefield.

The prospect of a quick peace deal between Ukraine and Russia remains unlikely. Perhaps the best case short term is that both sides broker a ceasefire that includes a framework for an agreement, and then work the details out over time. But the war continues.

Ukrainian neutrality is likely to be the central component of any peace deal

A neutral Ukraine is likely to be central to any peace deal. In broad terms, that would likely mean Ukraine would have to agree to remain a nonnuclear power, abandon its ambitions of ever joining NATO and forego any NATO installations or troops on its territory, in exchange for some sort of security guarantees. Ukraine has indicated that it would put this issue to a referendum, which would propose changing the constitution to remove any NATO aspirations and accepting a status of permanent neutrality.

Both Ukraine and Russia may find something palatable in the idea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has previously acknowledged that Ukraine will not actually join NATO, but for now Ukraine remains committed to having the right to pursue European Union membership. Russia has what it sees as legitimate security concerns about NATO being on its borders, so a militarily neutral Ukraine may also be something Russia could accept, if keeping NATO out of Ukraine, and away from Russia’s borders, is an outcome Putin could spin at home. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said previously that a deal for a neutral Ukraine could be a “kind of compromise.”

Ukrainian neutrality, said Pascal Lottaz, assistant professor for neutrality studies at the Waseda Institute for Advanced Study, may be the only option “where all the parties — the Russians, the Ukrainians, and the US and NATO — would basically sit down and say, ‘Fine, we can accept that; fine, we can live with that.’”

But it will depend on the details. Ukraine committed to neutrality in the aftermath of the breakup of the Soviet Union; each of its swings away from neutrality was usually in response to Russian threats or aggression. Ukraine formally abandoned its neutral status in 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea and invaded Eastern Ukraine.

Putin has also gone far beyond NATO grievances, essentially denying Ukrainian statehood. At the outset of the war, he demanded the “demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine,” a false attack that is largely code for regime change. In other words, Putin’s maximalist position doesn’t really square with just accepting neutrality.

Battlefield losses and Ukraine’s resistance may have changed Moscow’s calculus. But that doesn’t change the bigger issue: Who trusts Putin now?

“There were probably at least a dozen international agreements that Russia signed with Ukraine that did commit Russia to respecting Ukraine’s December 1991 borders, yet, the Russian government has shown no importance to adhering to those obligations,” said Mark Kramer, director of the Cold War Studies Project at Harvard University’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.

If Ukraine agrees to a neutral status, it is likely to want some guarantees that it will stay that way. That is where the rest of the world comes in, likely the US and its allies. Ukraine has reportedly proposed Russia, Great Britain, China, the United States, France, Turkey, Germany, Canada, Italy, Poland, and Israel, as possible guarantors. A lot depends on what risks these guarantors are willing to tolerate — and whether that would be acceptable to Ukraine or Russia.

How strong these guarantees are matters. If they involve NATO allies committing to defending Ukraine in case Russia launches another full-scale invasion, that would be a lot like NATO’s Article 5 mutual self-defense pact in all but name. “Would the United States or other NATO countries be allowed to use military force if an agreement in the family is violated? That, I think, may be a bridge too far for the Russians at this point,” said P. Terrence Hopmann, a professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University.

But, Hopmann added, given the bad faith Putin has shown in negotiations, it will be difficult for Ukraine to accept neutrality without some serious security guarantees. Other experts said non-military mechanisms, like automatic sanctions or other penalties, are an option. Adding to the uncertainty: For Ukraine, it’s still risky to put its fate in the promises of outside powers, especially those like the United States, who, under some presidents, have shown their own willingness to break international agreements.

The big issues are going to be Crimea and the Donbas

In 2014, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula, and Russian troops invaded in support of separatists in the Donbas in eastern Ukraine. Russia has supported those separatists in an eight-year war with Ukrainian forces ever since.

Russia has insisted that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia. Ahead of Russia’s invasion in February, President Vladimir Putin declared two regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, as independent, and the Kremlin now wants Ukraine to do the same. However, they are asking those “republics” encompass the entire oblasts (basically, administrative regions), which is way more territory than Russia, or Russian-backed militias, currently control.

At least right now, this is an untenable demand for the Ukrainian government.

“No Ukrainian government, I think, would ever be able to do that and survive. And this government shows no indication of being willing to do so. And frankly, Russia hasn’t even won the territorial control piece on the battlefield yet,” Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at RAND said Tuesday during a discussion hosted by the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister Dmytro Kuleba has said that Ukraine will not trade “people, land or sovereignty.”

The Ukrainian government, however, countered with some proposals on how to handle these regions. On Crimea, it has proposed that its status be worked out over the next 15 years, with Ukraine vowing not to retake the peninsula by force in the meantime. On the Donbas regions, Ukraine has proposed that Zelenskyy and Putin work out the status in direct talks.

Those aren’t solutions, but Ukraine’s proposals at least suggest a willingness to negotiate. For Ukraine, there are potential political paths to address these territories’ status, including implementing referendums with international backing and observers, to ensure their legitimacy.

Russia, however, may be trying to force the issue on the battlefield, as it has indicated that it will now focus on operations in eastern Ukraine. This may, in part, be a recognition that its efforts to take Kyiv have failed, but it may also be an attempt to try to take more and more territory in this region to try to carve out a slice of Ukraine that extends from the Crimean peninsula up to territories in the east. Whether Russia will be successful — and what kind of devastation it might unleash to attempt to do that — is still unclear. And even if Russia seizes these areas, the citizens left behind after a brutal offensive may not be willing to accept that.

Demilitarization, denazification, and everything else

At the outset of negotiations, Russia put forward some pretty wild demands, specifically the demilitarization and “denazification” of Russia.

Denazification seemed mostly code for regime change, as Putin has sold Russia’s war at home as a “special military operation” to save Russian-speakers, who he claimed were being persecuted. He described the Ukrainian regime as controlled by “drug-addled Nazis.” (Zelenskyy is Jewish and has family who died in the Holocaust.) Exactly what demilitarization means is also unclear, but experts said it could mean limits on Ukraine’s offensive weapons or troop numbers. But the idea that Ukraine would give up its military after being invaded seems unfathomable, and, most neutral countries maintain armies for at least territorial defense.

There are some signs that Russia may be easing off those requests. The Financial Times reported Monday that a draft ceasefire document did not address those issues, and Zelenskyy previously said he would not discuss those terms with Russia.

Russia has also objected to policies that it sees as deliberately targeting Russian language, and wanted protection for Russian language. Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine is willing to discuss questions of the Russian language.

The hope is that some of these more extreme and unspecific demands will fall away, or Russia and Ukraine can work out some superficial solutions — like condemning Nazis — that would suffice. That would leave the still-thorny questions of neutrality and territorial control as the key facets of any deal.

Here, perhaps, is where the United States, Europe, and other allies come in. The West has imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia, and the pain is likely to deepen in time. The US has signaled that it is willing to support Ukraine in its negotiations, but sanctions relief may also be necessary leverage against Russia, the longer this war grinds on.

But any deal will be shaped, at least in part, by what happens on the battlefield. And Russia has not stopped waging war against Ukraine — but neither has it won.",https://www.vox.com/2022/4/1/23002085/peace-talks-ukraine-russia-war-turkey-neutrality
