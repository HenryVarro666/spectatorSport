The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

1,a046fdd9-a880-433c-8b10-71bcb49bf2de,[],2022-03-17 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON (AP) — An American man was killed in a Russian attack on the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, where he was seeking medical treatment for his partner. The death of Jim Hill was reported Thursday by his sister.

“My brother Jimmy Hill was killed yesterday in Chernihiv, Ukraine. He was waiting in a bread line with several other people when they were gunned down” by Russian military forces, his sister, Cheryl Hill Gordon, wrote on Facebook. “His body was found in the street by the local police.”

Ukrainian officials reported that 10 people were killed Wednesday in Chernihiv while standing in the bread line.

Chernihiv police and the U.S. State Department confirmed the death of an American but did not identify him. Hill was at least the second U.S. citizen to be killed in the conflict, after the killing of journalist and filmmaker Brent Renaud last week.

In poignant posts on Facebook in the weeks before his death, Hill described “indiscriminate bombing” in a city under siege and joked about wanting to appear “feeble-minded” if captured by the Russians.

Under a photo of himself he wrote on March 8: “me unshaven for 10 days. I am actually trying to look as old and feeble-minded (not hard) as possible in case they catch me. I am working on my Rainman accent ‘Oh Boy’...”

Hill, a native of Eveleth, Minnesota, who was living in Driggs, Idaho, identified himself as a lecturer at universities in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and Warsaw, Poland. He said he was in Chernihiv with his partner for her to receive medical treatment.

“We are staying on 3rd floor in Hospital. Most patients in basement bomb shelter. But cold down there and no internet,” he wrote on Feb. 26, two days after the invasion began.

Four days later, he said: “Nobody in Chernihiv is safe. Indiscriminate bombing. ... Ukrainian forces hold city but are surrounded. It’s a siege here. Nobody in. Nobody out.”

At least 53 people had been brought to morgues over the past 24 hours, killed during heavy Russian air attacks and ground fire in Chernihiv, the local governor, Viacheslav Chaus, told Ukrainian TV on Thursday.

Theatre blown up in besieged Mariupol

53 civilians killed in Chernihiv, governor says

Negotiators still far apart in talks - Western officials

Putin lashes out at ""traitors and scum"" at home

KYIV/LVIV, Ukraine, March 17 (Reuters) - Rescue workers dug survivors on Thursday out of the rubble of a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol which Ukraine said had been hit by a Russian air strike while people sheltered there from bombardments.

Russia denied striking the theatre. But its forces have blasted cities and killed many civilians in its assault on Ukraine, now entering its fourth week.

Mariupol has suffered the worst humanitarian catastrophe of the war, with hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in basements with no food, water or power as Russian forces pound it with artillery fire and air strikes.

A city mayoral adviser, Petro Andrushchenko, said the number of victims of the purported strike on the theatre on Wednesday was not known, but the shelter had held.

""Now the rubble is being cleared,"" he told Reuters by phone. ""There are survivors.""

Commercial satellite pictures showed the word ""children"" had been marked out on the ground in front of the building before it was hit.

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the allegation that Russia had bombed the theatre was a ""lie"", and repeated Kremlin denials that Russian forces have targeted civilians.

""Russia's armed forces don't bomb towns and cities,"" she told a briefing.

Mariupol city council later said more than 350,000 people were still sheltering in the city and 30,000 had left.

The assault on Ukraine started with troops crossing the border or landing by sea and air on Feb. 24. But Western countries say its expectations of a swift victory and the removal of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government have been dashed and its invasion force has got bogged down.

SIDES FAR APART

The war has settled into a grinding pattern of sieges of cities. The United Nations said 3.2 million civilians, mostly women and children, have now fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries. But the Russians have failed to capture a major city in the face of spirited resistance from Ukrainian forces.

British military intelligence said in an update on Thursday that the invasion had ""largely stalled on all fronts"", and Russian forces were suffering heavy losses.

A fourth straight day of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators took place by videolink but Western officials said the two sides remained far apart.

""Both sides are taking them (the talks) seriously but there is a very, very big gap between the positions in question,"" one official said.

An aide to Zelenskiy said Ukraine was sticking to its core position that it retain sovereignty over areas occupied since 2014 by Russian and pro-Russian forces.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown little sign of relenting, even though punitive Western sanctions are damaging his country's economy.

In a televised speech, he inveighed against ""traitors and scum"" at home who helped the West, and said the Russian people would spit them out like gnats.

Kyiv and its Western allies say Russia launched the war to subjugate a neighbour Putin calls an artificial state. Moscow says it is carrying out a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine.

On the diplomatic front, the White House said U.S. President Joe Biden would hold a call on Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as Washington tries to persuade Beijing not to provide support to Russia.

Ukraine's Zelenskiy addressed the German Bundestag by video link, pulling no punches in a speech that invoked the Holocaust and the Berlin Wall, and seemed intended to shame pro-Russian politicians in Germany, Moscow's main energy buyer. read more

""Every year politicians repeat 'never again',"" said Zelenskiy, who is of Jewish heritage, citing a slogan used to mark the Holocaust.

""And now we see that these words are simply worthless. In Europe a people is being destroyed, they are trying to destroy everything that is dear to us, what we live for.""

He accused Germany of helping to build a new wall ""in the middle of Europe between freedom and unfreedom"", by isolating Ukraine with its business ties to Russia and its earlier support for Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline it has since frozen.

BLOODY SHEET

Northeastern and northwestern suburbs of Kyiv have suffered heavy damage but the capital itself has held firm, under a curfew and subjected to deadly nightly rocket attacks.

A building in Kyiv's Darnytsky district was extensively damaged by what the authorities said was debris from a missile shot down early in the morning.

As residents cleared glass and carried bags of possessions away, a man knelt weeping by the body of a woman which lay close to a doorway, covered in a bloody sheet.

Viacheslav Chaus, governor of the region centred on the frontline northern city of Chernihiv, said 53 civilians had been killed there in the past 24 hours. The toll could not be independently verified.

Russia has assaulted Ukraine from four directions, sending two columns towards Kyiv from the northwest and northeast, pushing in from the east near the second biggest city Kharkiv, and spreading in the south from Crimea.

Ukrainian officials have said they think Russia is running out of troops to keep fighting and could soon come to terms with its failure to topple the Ukrainian government.

Moscow has said it is close to agreeing a formula that would keep Ukraine neutral, long one of its demands.

3,a046fdd9-a880-433c-8b10-71bcb49bf2de,[],,"Friday's daily intelligence assessment by the Institute for the Study of War - a US think tank - offers some insights into how Russian troops are faring in Ukraine.

The analysis draws largely on reports from the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

According to ISW, the invading forces may be attempting to establish ""a strict administrative and police regime"" in several areas, while also distributing food to civilians in order to maintain a positive image.

It adds that Russia continues to detain pro-Ukrainian civil servants, activists and others.

Those repressive measures come as Russia has ""significantly exhausted its human resources"" and is taking ""extreme measures in matters of staffing"", even allegedly dismissing a general for his performance.

Meanwhile, the think tank finds that Ukrainian forces have launched a successful counterattack near the encircled southern city of Mykolaiv, and halted the Russian advance into Kharkiv.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60774819

17 Mar 2022 14.32 Russia has been accused by the UK, the US, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway of war crimes in Ukraine, as Paris claimed that Vladimir Putin was only pretending to be interested in negotiating a peace deal, Daniel Boffey and Dan Sabbagh report. The six countries challenged Russia before a UN security council meeting as the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said there was now “very, very strong evidence” of war crimes being committed by Russian forces. “Vladimir Putin is behind them,” Truss said. It is ultimately a matter for the international criminal court to decide who is or isn’t a war criminal and for us to bring the evidence. Rescue workers continued this evening to search through the rubble for survivors of a Russian airstrike on a theatre in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol where hundreds of people had been sheltering. Officials said more than 20 people were killed and 25 injured in an airstrike on a school and community centre in Merefa, close to the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, in the early hours of Thursday morning. Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defence minister, described the pilot who bombed the theatre in Mariupol as a monster. The word “children” had been painted in large Russian script on the ground outside the red-roofed theatre building to warn off fighter jets.

17 Mar 2022 13.53 130 people rescued from Mariupol theatre – former governor Rescue efforts to find survivors of the Russian bombing of a theatre in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol have been hindered by the complete breakdown of social services in the city, according to the former Donetsk region head, Serhiy Taruta. Speaking in an interview on Ukrainian television, Taruta said he believed 1,300 people were in the building when it was bombed and 130 have so far been rescued.

Taruta said: People are doing everything themselves. My friends went to help, but due to constant shelling it was not safe. People are clearing away the rubble themselves. There is no rescue operation, because all the services that are supposed to rescue people, to treat them, to bury them, these services no longer exist. Authorities in Mariupol said it was still not possible to estimate the number of possible casualties from the attack. In an online statement, the city council said: Yesterday and today, despite continuous shelling, rubble is being cleared as much as is possible and people are being rescued. Information about victims is still being clarified. Photos of what's left of the destroyed Drama Theatre in Mariupol that the city's administration says was bombed by Russia.

17 Mar 2022 13.06 Dan Sabbagh Russia is struggling to make military progress in and around Kyiv, western officials said on Thursday afternoon, and “there is a question as to whether Moscow now intends to try to assault Kyiv or not”, Dan Sabbagh reports. An estimated 7,000 Russian troops have died in the fighting so far and 10% of the invading army’s equipment has also been destroyed, prompting questions as to whether the army on the ground has the will to continue fighting. I would be quite cautious in terms of my understanding of Russian intent on Kyiv, an official said, noting that Russian forces had been trying to encircle the Ukrainian capital for many days but had failed to make any real progress in either the north-west or the east. “I think there is a question as to whether Moscow now intends to try to assault Kyiv or not, and I don’t know the answer to that,” the official added. To do so, in my judgment, with or without bombardment, would be very costly. It may even be possible for Ukraine to fight Russia to a standstill, the official added, and the growing possibility of a military stalemate could help bring a successful conclusion to the ongoing peace negotiations on both sides. Britain and other western countries believe those discussions are becoming increasingly serious, but it remains unclear if Russia is “in a compromising mood” at the moment, after Vladimir Putin claimed on Wednesday night that it was possible “the pro-Nazi regime in Kyiv” could have “got its hands on weapons of mass destruction”.

Addressing German lawmakers via video link, Zelensky said: “We are separated by a wall. It is not a Berlin wall, it is a wall in the middle of Europe between freedom and bondage, and this wall is getting bigger with every bomb falling on Ukraine, with every decision not made for peace and that could help us. Why is this happening?”

Zelensky compared the Berlin Airlift during the Cold War to the current situation in Ukraine, saying: “The airspace was safe then but now we cannot build up an airbridge because Russian bombs and missiles are falling from the sky.”

Earlier in his address to the German Bundestag Thursday the Ukrainian president also explicitly referenced the post-Holocaust motto: ""never again.""

“Every year politicians say never again. Now I see that these words are worthless. In Europe a people is being destroyed,"" Zelensky said.

Some context: The appeal to German lawmakers is Zelensky’s latest address to a Western parliament, following video link speeches to the US Congress, British House of Commons and others. In each speech, he has tailored references to his audience, such as citing Pearl Harbor and 9/11 to the Americans and echoing Winston Churchill to the British.

“We asked what Ukraine can do to join NATO, to be guaranteed its security and we were told that the decision was not yet on the table,” Zelensky told the Bundestag, adding that refusing to let Ukraine join the EU was like new bricks being added to the wall.

Zelensky also condemned German businesses for having close ties with Russia, adding that economic sanctions had been implemented too late.

He acknowledged that Ukraine was, however, grateful to ordinary Germans who have supported the country, including “journalists reporting the truth and showing the evil that Russia has brought to us.”

“I am grateful to those who can look across walls,” Zelensky said as he ended his address to a round of applause and appealed to Scholz to “destroy this wall.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-17-22/h_94ff6fccada274b7ab025774f044a09a
