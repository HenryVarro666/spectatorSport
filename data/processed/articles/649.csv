The ruling clearly and unequivocally ordered Russia to immediately suspend the military operations Russia commenced last month and further directed Russia to ensure that anyone subject to its direction, including military or irregular armed units, take no steps in furtherance of such military operations.

The Court – which plays a vital role in the peaceful settlement of disputes under the UN Charter – stressed the need for States to act in conformity with their obligations under international law, including the laws of war. And the Court expressed deep concern about the extreme vulnerability of the civilian population of Ukraine, the numerous civilian deaths and injuries that have resulted from the Kremlin’s actions, and the significant material damage, including the destruction of buildings and infrastructure. The Court further noted its profound concern with the Russian government’s use of force and emphasized the Court’s acute awareness of “the extent of the human tragedy that is taking place in Ukraine” as well as the “continuing loss of life and human suffering.” The Court also observed that it did not possess any evidence substantiating Russia’s claims that genocide had been committed by Ukraine in the Donbas region.

We welcome the Court’s order and call on the Russian Federation to comply with the order, immediately cease its military operations in Ukraine, and to establish unhindered humanitarian access in Ukraine.

The United States will continue to act with our allies and partners in support of Ukraine.",https://www.state.gov/welcoming-the-international-court-of-justices-order-directing-the-russian-federation-to-immediately-suspend-military-operations-in-ukraine/

3,34a1da1c-3ef4-45a2-a8ef-df2c63b6e878,[],,"On March 16, by a vote of 13–2, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague issued a landmark ruling ordering the Russian Federation and its paramilitary forces to immediately suspend its military operations in the territory of Ukraine.

Only judges from the Russian Federation and China dissented. The ICJ is the United Nations’ court for resolving disputes between nations, established in June 1945 by the Charter of the United Nations and seated at the Peace Palace in The Hague, The Netherlands. With the provisional measures order, the World Court added its authority as principal judicial organ of the United Nations to international demands that Russia stop its invasion of Ukraine.

The Court’s Order vindicated the request of a team of lawyers, including Sterling Professor of International Law Harold Hongju Koh, who argued on behalf of Ukraine on March 7 in a suit filed against Russia at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague.

On Feb. 26, Ukraine requested an urgent decision ordering Russia to halt all military action after its invasion last week. The request argued that Russia had created a judicial dispute regarding the application and interpretation of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (“Genocide Convention”), which both Russia and Ukraine have ratified.

“Today’s ruling should strengthen the resolve of every country, and every international institution, now to reinforce the Court’s order, stop Russian aggression, sanction the perpetrators, and bring them to justice.”

—Professor Harold Hongju Koh

The Court granted all key elements of Ukraine’s request. Under today’s provisional measures order, Russian military and irregular armed groups supported by Russia are required to immediately suspend all military operations in the territory of Ukraine. The Court’s order recognizes the Ukrainian people’s urgent need for protection against Russia’s unlawful aggression and attacks on civilians. The Court’s order, which is legally binding under international law, orders Russia immediately to comply with the order.

“This is a landmark victory for Ukraine and international law,” Koh said. “The ruling presumptively repudiates Russia’s claims that it is acting lawfully to prevent genocide and recognizes that Putin and Russia are isolated outlaws in an interdependent world of international law. By finding prima facie jurisdiction, the ICJ ensures that the case before it will continue, where Ukraine will now have the opportunity to present in detail its claims and evidence, and seek full reparation for all the damage caused by Russia’s unlawful acts.”

Koh rejected the argument that the World Court has no enforcement authority.

“Of course, the same could be said for every court, including the U.S. Supreme Court,” he said. “Now that the ICJ has said what the law is, it has dispelled any veneer of legality around Putin’s actions. That brands him as an outlaw, further isolates him, and strengthens the case for further sanctions and accountability measures if he persists. Today’s ruling should strengthen the resolve of every country, and every international institution, to reinforce the Court’s order, stop Russian aggression, sanction the perpetrators, and bring them to justice.”

Koh is Sterling Professor of International Law at Yale Law School, where he has taught since 1985, and served as Dean from 2004­–09. He is one of the nation’s leading experts in public and private international law, national security law, and human rights. From 2009–13, he served as the 22nd Legal Adviser of the U.S. Department of State in the Obama Administration, and in 2021, he returned to the Office of the Legal Adviser at the start of the Biden Administration as Senior Adviser, the senior political appointee in that office.

WATCH THE HEARING in Ukraine v. Russian Federation [Professor Harold Hongju Koh’s closing begins at 2:40:08]

Russia had claimed “that acts of genocide have occurred in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts of Ukraine” as a basis for launching what it calls a “special military operation” against many Ukrainian cities. Ukraine’s application argued that “[t]he parties…have a factual dispute as to whether genocide, which is defined by Article II of the Genocide Convention, has occurred or is occurring in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts of Ukraine.” And that “the parties also have a legal dispute as to whether, as a consequence of Russia’s unilateral assertion that genocide is occurring, Russia has any lawful basis to take military action in and against Ukraine to prevent and punish genocide pursuant to Article I of the Genocide Convention.” The Court today found sufficient grounds to conclude that this dispute exists creating prima facie jurisdiction for the Court to proceed on the merits.

Russia declined to appear in the oral hearing held before the World Court on March 7, and the Court cast severe doubt on Russia’s claims in its ruling. Koh said, “Ironically, Russia’s lies gave prima facie jurisdiction to the Court, and authorized it to issue its important ruling against Russia today.”

In addition to Koh, Ukraine is represented before the ICJ by a team of litigators from Covington & Burling LLP, along with Professor Jean-Marc Thouvenin of Paris-Nanterre University. Ukraine’s Agents before the Court are Anton Korynevych, the Permanent Representative of the President of Ukraine in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, and Oksana Zolotaryova, Director of the International Law Department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. Koh was previously involved in a Ukrainian case against Russia at the ICJ in 2017, after the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reached out for legal advice. That earlier relationship led to Koh’s involvement in the current case.",https://law.yale.edu/yls-today/news/professor-koh-helps-win-world-court-ruling-ordering-russia-halt-ukraine-invasion
4,34a1da1c-3ef4-45a2-a8ef-df2c63b6e878,['Rfe Rl'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The 13-2 verdict called for the Russian Federation to immediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on February 24. Only Russian and Chinese judges dissented, according to reports.

The ruling is the first such verdict handed by an international court since the war in Ukraine began.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the news on Twitter, saying that ""Ukraine gained a complete victory in its case against Russia at the International Court of Justice. The ICJ ordered to immediately stop the invasion. The order is binding under international law. Russia must comply immediately. Ignoring the order will isolate Russia even further.""

What is the case?

Kyiv accuses Moscow of illegally trying to justify the war by falsely claiming genocide in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Ukraine's representative Anton Korynevych sought to get the ICJ to order Russia to ""immediately suspend the military operations.""

""Russia must be stopped, and the court has a role to play,"" Ukraine's representative Anton Korynevych told the court, which is based in The Hague.

Russia boycotted the ICJ's hearings earlier this month.

In a written filing, Moscow argued that the court ""did not have jurisdiction"" because Ukraine's request fell outside of the scope of the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention upon which it based its case.

Russia went on to say ""it was acting in self-defense"" to justify its invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine said the Genocide Convention, which both countries have signed, does not allow an invasion to prevent a genocide. There is no evidence of Ukraine committing or planning attacks that could be deemed crimes against humanity.

Does the case fall under the ICJ's jurisdiction?

The ICJ ruled that Ukraine's request fell under the court's jurisdiction.

The ICJ was set up after the World War II to rule on disputes between UN member states, based mainly on treaties and conventions.

The ICJ's rulings are binding, but it has no executive means to enforce them in countries.

The case is separate from a war crimes investigation in Ukraine launched by the International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate tribunal also based in The Hague.

The latest: Ukrainian forces struck the Russian warship Moskva with two Neptune missiles, causing it to sink, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday. The confirmation comes after dueling reports in which Ukrainian forces claimed a successful attack on the flagship vessel in Russia’s Black Sea fleet while Russian officials said the ship had experienced a fire.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

As Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba said on the air of the nationwide telethon, the ICJ ruling at the highest legal level documented Russia's illegal military actions in the territory of Ukraine. The text of the judgment also states that the Court did not find any evidence in favor of Russia's allegations that Ukraine committed a crime of genocide in its territory.

""That was one of the arguments of president Putin in justifying his military aggression against Ukraine. Today, it was completely shattered at the highest international level,"" Kuleba stressed.

Ukraine’s top diplomat added that the ICJ delivered its judgment within an unprecedentedly short time. If Russia fails to comply with it (and there is every reason to believe that it will), this will negatively affect the court's final ruling in the case, in particular in the context of determining the amount of compensation to Ukraine.

""Now anyone who wants to say that there is no Russian aggression, or that Russia is doing everything right – these arguments will be shattered by the decision of the UN International Court of Justice, which we received today.

As reported, Ukraine gained a complete victory in the case against the Russian Federation at the UN International Court of Justice. The Court ordered Russia to immediately stop the invasion of Ukraine.

The UN International Court of Justice ruled that Russia must stop firing and withdraw its troops; ordered Russia to take the following interim measures: to immediately terminate military operations launched on February 24, 2022, in the territory of Ukraine.

The Court recognized its jurisdiction to interpret the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Russia was denied closure of the case, the case will be considered on the merits.

The International Court of Justice, or ICJ, granted measures requested by Kyiv although many are sceptical that Russia will comply.

Two weeks ago, Ukraine asked the ICJ -- also known as the World Court -- to intervene, arguing Russia violated the 1948 Genocide Convention by falsely accusing Ukraine of committing one and using that as a pretext for the ongoing invasion.

""The Russian Federation shall immediately suspend the special military operations it commenced on 24 February 2022,"" the court's president, judge Joan E. Donoghue, said.

Countries that refuse to abide by court orders can be referred to the UN Security Council, where Russia holds veto power.

Still, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed it as a major breakthrough.

""Ukraine gained a complete victory in its case against Russia at the International Court of Justice,"" he wrote on Twitter.

""The ICJ ordered to immediately stop the invasion. The order is binding under international law. Russia must comply immediately. Ignoring the order will isolate Russia even further.""

The Kremlin not expected to comply

Moscow snubbed a hearing last week when lawyers for Ukraine told the court that Russia had started an ""unprovoked aggression"".

The invasion brought ""cities under siege, civilians under fire [creating a] humanitarian catastrophe and refugees fleeing for their lives,"" argued David Zionts, a Ukraine legal team member.

Earlier this week, Russia argued in writing that The Hague-based court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and that nothing in the convention forbids the use of force.

In a 13-2 decision, the court also told Moscow to ensure military units ""take no steps"" to further the conflict, which Russia refers to as a ""special military operation.""

The Russian and Chinese judges dissented.

The bar for granting provisional measures is low, says Melanie O'Brien, an associate professor of international law at the University of Western Australia and an expert on the Genocide Convention.

""The court was not being asked to make a decision on the real crux of the case,"" she told reporters in a briefing ahead of the ruling.

In January, the court ordered Myanmar to prevent genocide against the Rohingya people, a Muslim-minority group that has been persecuted in the country for years.

As with Wednesday's decision, the court also ordered Myanmar to preserve evidence of any crimes and submit regular reports to the court.

Earlier on Wednesday, the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, met with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a surprise meeting.

The pair discussed the court's ongoing investigation into possible war crimes in the country.

While the ICJ can hold states responsible, the International Criminal Court could prosecute individuals.

Since the 7 March hearing, Russia has intensified its military strikes on towns and cities across Ukraine, hitting civilian infrastructure across the country, including a deadly strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, and sending more than 3 million refugees fleeing across borders.
