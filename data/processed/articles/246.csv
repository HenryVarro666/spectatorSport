Russia’s special military operation against Ukraine has been going on for two weeks. Despite the onslaught from the Russian army, the resistance of the Ukrainian soldiers was also very fierce.

The two sides have launched many skirmishes in several cities. According to the latest information from the Ukrainian side, the Ukrainian army has just achieved a major breakthrough in a counterattack and has regained control of a city from the Russian army.

On March 10, a report by Alarabiya channel revealed that the Ukrainian army announced that it had regained control of the city of Derhachi, located northwest of Kharkiv city in the eastern region of the country. Before that, the Russian army fought fiercely in Kharkiv for more than ten days and took control of the city of Derhachi in the northwest of Kharkiv.

Also on March 10, Ukraine also announced that its armed forces defeated a Russian regiment near Kiev and killed its commander. “Almost the entire regiment perished in the battle.”

The Ukrainian side said that its intelligence officers overheard the conversation of Russian officers in the Brovary region. These officers said they were preparing to attack Kiev, and in conversations it was revealed that the Ukrainian armed forces had killed another Russian regiment commander.

The Ukrainian side has released the recording of the call. A soldier with the alias “Nitra” reported to “Udar” that the Ukrainian armed forces had almost defeated the 6th Regiment, resulting in heavy losses, including the regiment’s commander. According to the recording, the head of the Russian regiment was ambushed.

At dawn on March 10, during a battlefield briefing, announced by the General Staff of Ukraine that the Russian army continued the “offensive operation” to encircle Kiev and launch attacks on other fronts, targeting Izyum, Petrovsky, Sumy, Ocht Rika, Donetsk and the Zaporozhye regions.

Currently, it is not clear whether Ukraine’s claim to regain control of the city of Delhat is true or not, and the Russian military has not yet responded to this information.

It is noteworthy that last week, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the Ukrainian army will launch a counter-offensive to dislodge the Russian army, not just defensive operations.

In such difficult circumstances that Ukraine still dares to fight back, this may involve the support of the US and the West. On March 10, Ukraine’s Independent news agency revealed that the US Congress had agreed to provide Ukraine with additional aid of 13.6 billion USD.

Canadian Defense Minister Anita Anand also announced that it would provide Ukraine with an additional $50 million in military aid for lethal and non-lethal weapons. Aid, including military drones and other specialized equipment.

The fighting has been going on for two weeks, Ukraine announced on March 10, since the war began, Ukraine has killed and wounded more than 12,000 Russian troops, destroyed 56 fighter jets and 82 helicopters. Meanwhile, the Russian side asserted that their losses were “many times lower” than the opponent’s.",https://military-wiki.com/the-ukrainian-army-counterattacked-fiercely-regaining-control-of-derhachi/
