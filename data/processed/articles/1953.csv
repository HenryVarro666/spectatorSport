The remaining Ukrainian forces in the southern port city of Mariupol are still fighting, Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said today.

Mr Shmyhal told ABC's ""This Week"" programme that troops were defying Russia's demand to lay down their arms and surrender and still had control of some parts of the city.

""The city still has not fallen,"" Mr Shmyhal said.

Earlier today, Russia's defence ministry ordered Ukrainian forces in Mariupol to stop fighting, with Moscow claiming its forces had almost completely seized the port city.

However several hours after the morning deadline, there was no sign of surrender by Ukrainian fighters holed up in the Azovstal iron and steelworks - one of Europe's biggest metallurgical plants.

Mr Shmyhal also said that he and Ukrainian finance officials would seek more financial assistance this week during International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington.

""We need more money for executing our humanitarian and social obligations,"" Mr Shmyhal added.

""Now, only half of our economy is working. So we ask for financial support.""",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-russia-war-live-latest-news-putin-kyiv-invasion-12541713?postid=3626383

It is a warning - and a threat - issued by Ukrainian troops after three weeks of ferocious fighting for this city of 50,000.

It also serves as a reminder, amid the diplomatic chatter emanating from Istanbul, that the Ukrainian military remains steadfast and realistic after a number of positive-sounding pronouncements from the Kremlin's lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky.

We saw Ukrainian troops fortifying the local road system, building barricades with concrete and blocks of granite.

There were trucks loaded up with ammunition and anti-aircraft guns, driven in the direction of the front.

We also passed hundreds of troops, perched on the top of armoured vehicles, being transported in the same direction.

Izyum itself is now unreachable, and the villages that surround it have been flattened by Russian artillery and planes.

We saw bomb craters that were as big as a house in a village called Oskil.

In other developments:

• Russia troops have accidentally downed own aircraft and refused to carry out orders, spy chief to reveal

• Soldier who told Russian warship to 'go f*** yourself' gets bravery award

• Sky team discusses miraculous escape from Kyiv ambush for first time

• More than 40 Russian diplomats expelled from four countries over alleged spying

We stopped to talk to a small group of Ukrainian soldiers several kilometres from the front.

They told us we would need ""nine lives"" to make it to the city.

""It is impossible to get there. If you are talking about our last position [on the road to Izyum], everything that goes there explodes. I don't recommend it,"" explained a member of the tank crew called Kot.

""They shoot everything that they see, everything they can, but when we make contact with them, they run away, like f****** chickens.""

We found a general sense of confidence here, and it came as something of a surprise.

The Ukrainian military has made some limited gains over the past few days in places, and the unit members seemed to think they could win.

""The only thing [the Russians] can do is use rockets, 'grad' missiles, aviation, and that is all. When you start a battle with them, at that moment they run away.""

""Don't you feel vulnerable in that thing?"" I said, pointing to his tank. ""You can hear Russian planes circling overhead.""

But he replied: ""I don't care. It doesn't bother me. This is a great thing. So, they can fly and fight? But there will be a time when they run out of ammunition, and then we can talk, and we will talk differently.""

They may feel confident of success on the battlefield, but many residents in eastern Ukraine feel scared.

We saw hundreds of local residents heading west, in their own, self-organised convoys.

The cars have signs in the windows saying, ""children"" and ""people"".

But a spot in a convoy is not an option for the people of Izyum. The city is encircled by the Russians, with some 20,000 people thought to be stuck inside.

We met a man who managed to escape by foot. The decision to flee was made, he said, after Russian troops ransacked his apartment and took his photo away.

He did not want to reveal his identity, explaining that his relatives are still in the city.

""When they constantly drive, drive, drive around you, those tanks, tanks. Then bang, bang. They methodically shell the town, without even thinking of what they are shelling.""

He left the city as a member of a group of eight, swimming through an icy river, then walking for miles.

""We were shelled on the way there. No hits, thank God. There are craters and grad missiles sticking out everywhere. So far, so good. Everybody was alive, thank God.""

The damage here is extensive, touching everyone and everything, and the positioning and the pleas of the negotiating teams feel very far away.",https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/ukraine-invasion-ferocious-fighting-izyum-220100146.html

After more than four weeks of conflict, Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and signalled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions to focus on securing the Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army for the past eight years.

Russia is trying to split Ukraine in two to create a Moscow-controlled region after failing to take over the whole country, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence said.

The Russian-backed eastern Ukrainian rebel region of Luhansk said it may hold a referendum on joining Russia, drawing a warning from Kyiv that any such vote would have no legal basis and trigger a strong international response.

Russia continued its ""full-scale armed aggression"", while Ukrainian forces had repulsed seven attacks in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, the General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said.

Ukraine's deputy prime minister said Russian forces were ""militarizing"" an exclusion zone around the occupied Chernobyl power station.

The next round of face to face talks between Ukraine and Russia will take place in Turkey on March 28-30, a Ukrainian negotiator said on social media.

Top American officials said the United States does not have a policy of regime change in Russia, ramping up efforts to clarify President Biden's statement that President Putin ""cannot remain in power"".

The UN human rights office said 1,119 civilians had been killed and 1,790 wounded since Russia began its attack on Ukraine.",https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/LIVE-un-accuses-russia-of-creating-dire-humanitarian-crisis-nato-sets-up-battle-groups-1.10697935

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.
