Scores of Russian soldiers have been killed since fighting broke out roughly one month ago. But often, neither the soldiers nor their families are told where they will be been sent to fight.

So far, Russia's Ministry of Defense has only twice reported fatality figures relating to its troops. On March 25, authorities acknowledged a total of 1,351 Russian servicemen had been killed in Ukraine. Yet a NATO source cited in the Washington Post estimates roughly 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers could have fallen since February 24. On March 20, Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported 9,861 Russian deaths, citing the Ministry of Defense. The piece was quickly removed from the website, with editors claiming the newspaper had been hacked.

26-year-old staff sergeant Yevgeny was killed in the early days of the war near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. He had never taken part in combat operations before.

Despite losing her son Yevgeny, Natalya (not her actual name) argues the invasion of Ukraine is justified. Yet she thinks Russia's campaign amounts to a full-fledged war, rather than a ""special operation.""

DW decided to publish this interview with Natalya as a testimonial of a mother who lost her son to the Russian-led war on Ukraine. She makes claims about the origins of the war that contradict current developments. DW has decided to leave her answers unedited as they clearly show the effects of the longstanding propaganda of the Russian state.

DW: Natalya, how do you feel?

Natalja: It is very hard, it hurts deeply. It is not my fault, nobody will bring back my son.

When did Yevgeny enlist?

Right after his exams in 2014, he joined the army. He was sent to a special unit with the foreign military intelligence agency GRU. They offered him a contract but I convinced him not to sign up, as he would had to serve in conflict zones.

Afterwards, he made a living working for a security firm and applied to join the police force. He did not like the job, however and decided to return to the army. They took him back immediately, we had only one evening to say goodbye. Yevgeny served in the national guard. He liked it there, rising to become a team leader. His job was to disband protests in Moscow.

He became a father in 2017. He met his wife from his time at the security agency. She moved to join him in Moscow, and they married.

How did he end up being sent to Ukraine?

It was late January, around the 25th or 26th. My son called me, telling me they would be sent to the city of Smolensk [in western Russia, 80 kilometers from the Belarusian border] for drills with Belarus. I asked him: ""Are you lying? What drills?"" I went online to research the military maneuvers and found that a drill with Belarus had been conducted in the past. I kept searching, trying to find out where we are at war. I did not even think of Ukraine. The next day, I remembered the unrest in Ukraine.

Are you saying you understood you son was not being sent to participate in a military exercise?

Yes. I told Yevgeny I am not stupid and do not believe you are being sent to Smolensk. I kept researching more and realized that he would be going to Ukraine.

I wanted to dissuade him from going. I told him he may not return. He replied: ""What are you talking about!"" He had no idea where he was being sent. Either they brainwashed him, making him think they really were going to participate in drills. Or he knew what was coming but could not fathom what a bloodbath it would be. I suppose nobody expected that, not even Putin.

Were you in touch after he left?

He left on February 13. I jokingly asked him if he liked Smolensk and what kind of food they were eating. He laughed, telling me everything was fine.

The last time I heard from him was on the morning of February 24, when everything started. He wrote to me using a fellow soldier's WhatsApp account, telling me: ""Mum, war has broken out."" And I replied: ""My son, I can see it on television."" And he said: ""Can you imagine, an entire unit with our boys was killed at the border."" I asked: ""Where are you?"" To which he replied: ""I am in Smolensk, mum.""

I think he was somewhere near there. It was only from there near the border that he could have been flown to the airport [Hostomel, near Kyiv]. I told him: ""Hang in there, son."" And he wrote back: ""Alright, goodbye mum. I have to go. Tell my wife everything is fine."" Then, we never heard from him again.

What were those two weeks like when you had no contact with him?

I had my phone with me constantly. I spent days watching television, and reading on the internet. I thought maybe I would spot his face somewhere. I went to church everyday, lit a candle and prayed for him. But by then, he was long dead.

Yevgeny was in Hostomel on February 24. He did not die on February 27, as his death certificate says. He was killed much earlier, probably on the night between February 24 and 25.

What makes you think so?

I read online that our soldiers conquered Hostomel on February 24. All our boys were then sent there. But then they came under fire from Kyiv. Our boys were encircled and nobody came to their aid. They were shot at and bombed for a full day. Think about it, the airport is basically an open field.

On February 25, our soldiers regained control of Hostomel. On February 26, they found Yevgeny. But I was only informed on March 8. His unit called me around 1:30 p.m. and told me my son had died in a battle near Rostov [Rostov-on-Don, a city in southern Russia, some 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border]. I almost lost my mind.

Why did they say he died near Rostov-on-Don?

I do not know why they reported that. Maybe because his body was sent to a morgue in Rostov, and they had no verified information about his death.

Did you ever discuss Ukraine with your son in the past?

To be honest, no.

Do you understand why this war was begun?

I think if we had not started bombing them, the Ukrainians would have bombed us. We had no choice. But something went wrong, nobody saw it coming. Now that so many soldiers have died, we cannot stop. We need to press on until we achieve victory.

Do you understand why Russia is fighting in Ukraine? What was Yevgeny fighting for?

My son fought for us, for Russia and the Russians. So that we can keep using our phones, eat and drink like before. He did not die in vain, he died for us, so that we can lead long, happy lives, so that we don't have to live through war and that bombs fall on us.

In Russia, it is illegal to call this conflict a war. Do you regard this as a war or a ""special operation""?

I do not see this as a ""special operation."" This is a proper war. I am aware we are not supposed to call it that, but it is a war. It's a bloodbath.

Summary Towns and villages around Kyiv bear brunt of fighting

Ukrainian forces have largely held Russians at bay

Many residents have stayed on despite fierce clashes

Material damage extensive, but Ukrainians voice defiance

Russian setbacks around capital thwart wider objectives

LUKYANIVKA, Ukraine, March 29 (Reuters) - The burnt wreckage of two Russian tanks with blown off turrets and several armoured personnel carriers attest the ferocity of last week's clashes in Lukyanivka village just outside Kyiv. The charred corpse of a Russian soldier lies in a field nearby.

""There were mortars so strong that it was scary even in the cellar,"" local resident Valeriy Hudym told Reuters on Sunday, two days after Ukrainian soldiers seized back control of Lukyanivka in a five-hour battle with the Russians.

""Tanks were firing, artillery, and machine guns. Everything possible was there,"" Hudym said. Two Ukrainian soldiers, involved in the battle to retake the village, said the fighting was intense.

More than a month since Russia's invasion, the defence of Ukraine's capital Kyiv has played out in heavy clashes in places like Lukyanivka and the nearby town of Brovary to the east, Irpin and Bucha to the northwest and Makariv to the west.

When the histories are written such towns and villages may be minor details, but they are where the Russian advance has been halted, sometimes by small, mobile Ukrainian units wielding anti-tank weapons shipped in from abroad.

Moscow promised at peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that it would drastically scale back operations around Kyiv to help the dialogue.

In Lukyanivka, two hours' drive from the centre of Kyiv, residents recall warning Russian troops who had occupied their settlement to leave while they could.

""I have a neighbour called Svitlana. She told them openly to their face: 'Guys, go home. You will be killed here',"" Hudym said. Reuters was unable to independently confirm this.

The reversal in Lukyanivka has been repeated in areas around the northern half of the capital, as Ukrainian troops claw back territory lost in the first month of fighting in small battles, without scoring a decisive victory.

The Russian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the military situation around Kyiv.

But the small victories have dealt a psychological blow to a more powerful enemy and shown how nimble units with knowledge of the area can defend lines and even push them back, according to military experts.

They also serve strategic goals - to keep Russian artillery further from the city centre and prevent the invading army from fully encircling Kyiv, the experts said.

Cities including Kharkiv and Mariupol have suffered heavy bombardment as Russian ground advances stalled - part of what the Pentagon and other Western military officials describe as a sign of Russian frustration at the lack of progress.

Kyiv has also been struck by shells and missiles, and at least 264 civilians have been killed according to city authorities. But the scale of devastation, particularly to the city centre, is far smaller, according to witnesses.

Russia describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" with the aim of demilitarising its neighbour. It has denied targeting civilians.

In Lukyanivka, Reuters saw Ukrainian soldiers driving away two apparently serviceable Russian heavy tanks captured during the fighting.

""We knocked out the Russians. The Russians are now being moved a few kilometres away,"" said Marat Saifulin, from the Ukrainian ""Brotherhood battalion"" that took part in recapturing the village in an attack that lasted from noon until dusk.

SETBACKS AND RESISTANCE

CIA Director William Burns said in early March that the intention of Russian President Vladimir Putin was to seize Kyiv within two days of the start of the invasion on Feb. 24.

Putin and Russian officials have consistently said that Russia's military operation in Ukraine has gone according to plan.

However, two early setbacks suggested it would not be plain sailing for an available Russian force estimated by some diplomats before the war at around 190,000 troops. Russia has not given a figure for its deployment in Ukraine.

Russian paratroopers attacked Hostomel airport, a potential bridgehead northwest of Kyiv, on the first day of the invasion. But heavy fighting there slowed the Russian advance toward the capital, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Satellite imagery also captured a huge column of military hardware stretching 40 miles (64 km) and coming from a similar direction.

Seen by some Western defence officials as a major threat to Kyiv in the first days of the war, by March 10 it had largely dispersed, with some vehicles spreading into surrounding towns.

A senior U.S. defence official said in early March that Russia's advance on Kyiv, including the convoy, appeared to be stalling because of logistical problems including shortage of food and fuel, as well as low morale among some units.

Attacks by small units of Ukrainian troops on advancing tank columns, in some cases using shoulder-held anti-tank weapons such as the U.S.-made Javelin system, were also a factor in bogging down Russia's military machine.

To the east, in Brovary, a convoy of Russian tanks was repelled after several were destroyed in an ambush captured in dramatic drone footage released by pro-Ukrainian forces.

To the north in Bucha, near Irpin, the town's mayor filmed scenes of burnt out tanks and armoured vehicles still smouldering after coming under fierce attack.

In Irpin, Ukrainian forces destroyed a large bridge linking northwestern towns to Kyiv as a way of stalling the enemy's progress. On Monday, Irpin's mayor said Ukraine was back in full control. Reuters could not immediately verify his claim.

The result of the flexible defensive strategy and Russian shortcomings has been no major advances on Kyiv for several days.

In the city, where only half the peacetime population of 3.4 million remains, there have been signs of normal life returning to the streets, with some shops, restaurants and cinemas opening and people enjoying the spring sunshine in parks.

Hopes that the immediate threat to the capital may be receding were fuelled last week by the head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate.

He said that the first phase of the operation in Ukraine had largely been completed and that Russian forces would henceforth concentrate on the Donbass region in the east.

That appeared to chime with Western intelligence assessments that Russian forces had abandoned, at least for the moment, their active attempt to take Kyiv following heavy losses and unexpectedly stubborn Ukrainian defences.

PAYING PENSIONS, POOR MORALE

On many roads leading out of Kyiv, wrecked houses and debris show the price paid by those who decided to stay. Gas and electricity is often cut and there is no certainty about when and where the next missile might fall.

In Krasylivka village, 92-year-old Hanna Yevdokimova said the invasion was her third conflict after the Soviet-Finnish Winter War of 1939-1940 and World War Two, when she saw German troops march through the village.

Last week, her home was hit by missile wreckage. A twisted fragment of a Russian Kalibr missile lay 100 metres (328 ft) away in a neighbour's garden.

""What can I do? All I want is to rebuild so that I can die in my own home,"" she said.

Some residents of Lukyanivka said they spent nearly a month under Russian occupation as virtual prisoners in their own homes, their mobile phones confiscated and movement only permitted under armed escort.

Now they can come and go as they please amid badly damaged houses.

Near Makariv west of Kyiv, which is still contested, heavy shelling could be heard last week. Even so, the town's mayor Vadym Tokar travelled through surrounding villages wearing military fatigues and handing out pensions to the elderly.

Farmer Vasyl Chaylo, from Peremoha, described what he said were fearful Russian conscripts, short on rations and disciplined by tougher professional fighters.

""They are afraid. According to my observation, some of them perhaps do not want to fight and want to surrender, but they are kept in line by special forces,"" he said.

Chaylo added that he had asked tank crews who set up outside his house how long their dry rations would last and been told a week. ""They came to us on the eighth day and said that they had nothing to eat.""

Russia's defence ministry has acknowledged some conscripts have taken part in the conflict, after earlier denials by the Kremlin and military authorities. The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about rations.

Halyna Shybka, a former nurse in a military hospital in Kyiv for 25 years, ignored the entreaties of her grandchildren and remains with her husband Mykola in the house in Kalynivka, near the frontlines of Brovary, where they have lived in since 1974.

""They tried to persuade us in every way they could to leave with them, but I wanted to stay,"" she said, pouring cups of tea in her small kitchen, the sound of outgoing Ukrainian artillery fire rumbling in the background.

""This is our land, we're not going to leave.""

Editor's note Some images below may be disturbing due to graphic content. MOSHCHUN, Ukraine — Sgt. Anton Kolumbet, his black rifle slung over his shoulder, walked along a damp road, past flattened houses and the burned carcasses of cars. With a steady beat, artillery shells thundered in the woods, a symphony of war the 35-year-old soldier embraced with a zeal he couldn’t have imagined five weeks ago.

He walked past spent ammunition rounds that glistened in the rain and past other detritus of the violent battles fought in this once-peaceful village that is now an important front line in Ukraine’s war with Russia. Decomposing corpses of Russian soldiers and the bodies of at least two civilian men who appeared to have been shot lay scattered about.

A half-mile down the road was a cluster of trees. The Russians were on the other side, about a mile away.

“It’s safe. It is our artillery,” said Kolumbet, laughing as more booms thundered through the shattered and deserted hamlet on Tuesday. He said the Ukrainians were shelling the nearby airport in Hostomel. Russian forces had hoped to use that airfield in their assault on Kyiv, 20 miles to the southeast, but now they were stalled there in the middle of a bloody and grinding artillery fight.

In the second month of war, Ukraine’s front-line soldiers are more confident than they had expected to be when Russian forces invaded. In areas north of the capital, the Russian advance has been stopped, while in Moshchun and other areas, Ukrainian forces have mounted counteroffensives with American-made weapons such as the Javelin antitank missiles and pushed the invaders out of some towns and villages. Brutal clashes, mostly composed of tit-for-tat aerial bombardments, still take place daily, underscoring the war’s unpredictable turns.

But for now a military stalemate continues, which Ukrainian forces consider a major victory over Russia, whose initial objective was to take over the capital within days. So it was perhaps understandable that Moscow’s pledge on Wednesday to “drastically reduce attacks” on Kyiv was greeted with derision among Ukrainian soldiers in Moshchun.

“They agree to stop attacking Kyiv because they don’t have enough soldiers to do that, because we killed most of them,” said Kolumbet. “It’s like the fourth round, you are almost beaten to death and you just say ‘Let’s stop fighting.’”

“Everyone understands that the Russians’ main goal was the occupation of the capital,” he added. “Now, they are trying to put on what we call ‘a nice face with bad cards.’ ... You can see that the fighting here was very intense. But we won, and they retreated.”

A rare visit by journalists to this countryside village offered a glimpse of the brutality being inflicted in rural towns and villages outside Ukraine’s cities, where much of the war has unfolded. While the visit highlighted the weaponry, tactics and sheer resilience of the Ukrainian forces in preventing Russia’s military from pushing into the capital, it also underscored the fragility of the current military landscape and the war’s uncertain future.

On Wednesday, a day after the Russian pledge to reduce hostilities around Kyiv, their forces bombarded Moshchun and its surrounding forest with artillery and mortars, forcing a Washington Post photographer and translator to take cover in a bunker. Ukrainian authorities and residents said the attacks continued overnight and through Wednesday morning in the embattled city of Chernihiv and in or near other parts of Kyiv.

Kolumbet, wearing camouflage, spoke into his walkie-talkie to a comrade in the Ukrainian army’s 72nd Mechanized Brigade, Task Force Coyote.

“I am listening, proceed,” said the voice on the other end.

“We will come visit you soon,” said Kolumbet.

“We are waiting,” the voice replied.

Kolumbet’s mission on this day was mundane, yet key to the battle against the Russians: He was carrying batteries to use in his fighters’ radios, night-vision goggles, anything that needed power in a village with no working electricity.

Along the road, the destroyed houses revealed the village’s affluence. Some were mansions nestled behind walls with huge yards with swing sets and slides. An Audi sat in one driveway. In another, a BMW was peppered with shrapnel from a mortar.

“The rich people from Kyiv bought houses to spend their vacations here,” said Kolumbet. “This is a normal post-Soviet village where half of the population are old people who just live here and half the population are young people who bought houses.”

With a prewar population of around 1,500, the village was less than five miles from the airport in Hostomel. On the invasion’s first day, Russian forces landed at the airfield in an attempt to quickly surround and seize the capital and topple the government. The goal was to create an air bridge to funnel in tanks, armored vehicles and other weaponry to push into Kyiv.

In their way was Moshchun.

Six days into the invasion, the Russians captured the village and an armored column pressed further toward the northern suburbs of the capital. But the Ukrainians mounted a strong resistance, including shooting down several Russian helicopters, stalling the Russian offensive using guerrilla tactics.

The Russians remained inside Moshchun for nearly two weeks, according to Ukrainian troops at the village this week. Most residents fled, then the Russians were pushed out. But gruesome hints of their invading soldiers’ presence are still visible today in the largely abandoned village.

In one house, the corpse of a Russian fighter lay on a kitchen table. He appeared to have been injured in the leg and groin and apparently had been in the middle of surgery when he died, suggesting Russian forces had transformed the house into an emergency medical clinic.

In other corners of the village, there were at least 10 Russian corpses, most of their bodies intact, suggesting they had been killed in street-by-street fighting or possibly shrapnel from a mortar. Fleeing Russians appeared to have left behind gear, including a drenched, olive-green backpack that was filled with bullets. In one trench, Ukrainian soldiers found several large belts of unused Russian ammunition.

The few residents who stayed seemed shocked. Over two visits to the village, Post reporters saw only two civilian residents. One was Ivan Batsiura, 68, the owner of a small farm where he raised chickens and goats, who remained with his wife.

“We don’t want to leave our house,” said Batsiura, who had a mustache, glasses and a gray hat. He refused to speak about what happened inside the village and appeared still traumatized.

He walked into his house and came out with a framed photo of himself and his granddaughter, Dasha. He gave a Post translator a phone number for his daughter and son-in-law. He had not spoken to them since his birthday, on Feb. 27 — two days before the Russians arrived. There had been no cell reception, and he was cut off from the world.

“Can you call him to check if they are still alive?” said Batsiura, clutching the photo.

Kolumbet spotted an empty casing of a Russian-made rocket-propelled grenade lying on the ground. He knelt down to inspect it. It was a newer model, he said, and then guessed that the Russian who used it had probably been killed by his forces.

“And I can show you the guys who did it,” said Kolumbet, his voice rising excitedly. “They are over there.”

Steps away was a Ukrainian military position inside a large house. Yevgen Shkor entered the compound, a rocket-propelled grenade launcher strapped across his back. He initially didn’t want to fight, he said, but the circumstances convinced him.

“[I’m] provoked by seeing dead people who have nothing to do with this war,” said Shkor, a lean, muscular father of a teenager. “It provokes and somehow triggers this hatred and urge to destroy the Russians who came here. The more you see it, the more hate you feel and the more you want to kill them. I feel no pity for them whatsoever.”

Two weeks ago, intense clashes erupted in the village, as Ukrainian forces sought to push the Russians out. The Ukrainians first pounded the Russian forces with artillery and later deployed special forces units who battled the Russians street by street, said Vitaly Spys, 43, the commander of the position.

As in other battles around Kyiv, the Ukrainians used guerrilla war tactics, firing from trenches and ambushing the Russian forces who had little knowledge of the terrain, said Spys and other soldiers. Two things were different from other battles, they said. The special forces units engaged in the urban war were armed with American-made weaponry, especially Javelins.

“The tactical groups fighting on the streets had antitank missiles and ammunition from the United States,” said Spys. “They crashed enemy drones with the Javelins.”

Second, the Ukrainians blew up a dam, which flooded the river passing by the village. That also destroyed several pontoon bridges that the Russians were using to resupply their forces inside Moshchun and send in reinforcements, Spys and Kolumbet said in separate interviews. As a result, the Russian forces inside Moshchun were cut off from their forces on the other side, and they were eventually driven back across the river. Some of their armored vehicles sank in the water, said the Ukrainian soldiers.

“The explosion of the dam helped us,” said Spys. “At this time, the river is flooded and there’s not a chance of the [Russians] regaining this territory from this side through the river.”

But the Russians are still trying to retake Moshchun. They have planted mines and booby traps in the surrounding forests, and their snipers shoot at Ukrainians working to remove the mines, said Spys. Russian helicopters fly in and pound their positions every day, including earlier Tuesday morning, he said. The Russian artillery fire from Hostomel airfield seems to never end.

“We control the situation here, but there is constant fire from the enemy,” said soldier Oleksi Bevsluk, 35. “So we respond to them.”

Spys was more cautious in his assessment. “We are not sure we have 100 percent control,” he said, noting that there were still Russian “diversion groups” around the village, firing at this troops.

And the Russians still controlled the area on the other side of the river.

None of the Ukrainian soldiers interviewed in Moshchun trust Russia’s pledge to reduce its attacks. They are all on alert for more Russian bombardments — and the possibility that Moscow is making that pledge to allow more time to bring more reinforcements, military equipment and supplies through neighboring Belarus. The war, they say, is far from over.

“I don’t believe in any negotiations with Russia, ever,” said Kolumbet. “The only language that Russia understands is the language of force.”

On Wednesday, a Post reporter called the number Ivan Batsiura provided for his son-in-law, Mykhailo Danilchenko. He fled the battered city of Irpin, on Kyiv’s edges, with his family to the western city of Lviv. He said Batsiura’s daughter and granddaughter were both alive and safe.

They had been worried about Batsiura and his wife. Two weeks earlier, they had seen a video posted on social media of a Russian tank blown up in front of the couple’s yard, said Danilchenko.

“We are so grateful to God that he’s alive and well,” he said.

The pictures show columns of Russian armored vehicles forming up into columns and convoys, according to analysts with Rochan Consulting, a private aerospace and defense consulting firm which first noted the movements and shared their findings with The Daily Beast.

“Prior to the 25 March convoy formations, Russian ground forces were dispersed throughout the forested areas near Lubyanka and Hostomel. From there, Russian artillery would set up in nearby clearings to fire into civilian areas,” said Chris Biggers, an imagery analyst monitoring the conflict.

The area where radar-imaging satellites caught sight of the vehicles is close to Hostomel airport, where special operations troops from the Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) had tried and failed to capture the strategic airfield early on in the war.

While the withdrawal of some Russian forces offers relief for Ukraine, there’s still no evidence that Russia’s assault on Ukraine is winding down overall and it remains unclear whether the forces Moscow is pulling out now will be redeployed later on. Late Wednesday, Ukrainian and American officials said they believed Russian forces seen withdrawing from Ukrainian territory were leaving in order to reset, resupply, and redeploy towards other theaters.

Capella Space satellites first captured the pictures on March 26, two days before Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin claimed that Moscow would “drastically, exponentially, reduce military activity” around Kyiv following the failed attempt to encircle and capture the Ukrainian capital.

Fomin presented the withdrawal pledge as a diplomatic concession “to increase mutual trust and create the necessary conditions for further negotiations” but military experts believe the move is less a magnanimous gesture on Russia’s part and more of a bow to the reality of how poorly the Russian military’s effort to take the capital has fared.

In the case of Russian forces around Hostomel, Rochan Consulting analysts noted strike damage and scarred terrain near where Russian vehicles had previously been seen, suggesting that Ukrainian forces had managed to strike back at the attempted cordon of Kyiv.

Early on in the invasion, Russian troops streamed south across the border from Belarus and into the northwest suburbs of Kyiv in an apparent attempt to seize the city and decapitate the Ukrainian government’s leadership. Ukrainian forces reported finding Russian saboteurs and assassins who had snuck into the city as the VDV troops mounted their failed assault on Hostomel airport.

“ The whole night we listened to sirens. ”

In the weeks since the initial assaults on Kyiv failed to capture the city, satellite imagery has captured scenes of stalled Russian vehicles with little effort to move further into the capital region. Imagery collected by the satellite imaging company Maxar showed Russian armored vehicles near the scene of the recent retreat digging in and fortifying their positions with earthen berms rather than moving forward.

Last week, the Russian military’s General Staff implied that the attempt to seize Kyiv had never been an important part of Russia’s invasion and that the primary objective lay further east. Russian General Staff Main Operational Directorate head Sergei Rudskoi claimed, improbably, that the first phase of the conflict had completed successfully and that Moscow would begin to focus on “the main goal, liberation of Donbas,” where the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugank Peoples Republics along Russia’s border with Ukraine are located.

And while some vehicles may be on their way out of Ukraine, Russian forces are still attacking Kyiv. Hours after Fomin’s announcement of a claimed goodwill gesture towards Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said the city remained under siege. Reuters reported that Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko told European Union officials that “The whole night we listened to sirens, to rocket attacks and we listened to huge explosions east of Kyiv and north of Kyiv.”",https://www.thedailybeast.com/vladimir-putin-promised-russian-forces-would-retreat-from-kyiv-but-what-do-the-satellite-photos-show

Russian forces have been facing stiff resistance since the day it entered Ukraine more than a month ago. Since Russian forces were numerically superior and had sophisticated weapons, many thought the war will be over within a few days.

But that was not the case. The resistance against Russians kept getting stiffer as they marched towards capital Kyiv, which caused them to lose a lot of weapons and armoury.

Among them are tanks, which Russians have lost in a large number.

How many Russian tanks have been destroyed?

According to information released by Ukrainian armed forces on social media, Russia has lost more than 680 tanks.

Oryx, a military and intelligence blog which keeps a count of Russia's military losses in Ukraine based on photos from the warzone, says the Russian military has lost more than 2,000 armoured vehicles and 460 tanks.

American think tank Rand Corporation, along with the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), said in a release that Russia had more than 2,700 tanks before the Ukraine war began.

How has Ukraine been able to destroy so many Russian tanks?

A major part of the success came due to the weapons provided by the western countries, including the United States. The US supplied Ukraine with 2,000 anti-tank Javelin missiles when the conflict began and later sent 2,000 more.

The lightweight but lethal weapon has allowed the soldiers in Ukraine to inflict some serious damage to Russian tanks and artillery.

According to Lockheed Martin, the missile automatically guides itself to the target after launch (“fire and forget” system), allowing the gunner to take cover and avoid counterfire, or load a new missile.

It also has a gentler start, making it difficult for the enemy to see where it was launched from.

The Javelins explode at the top of the tank, where the armour is believed to be the weakest.

Apart from the US, the United Kingdom has sent NLAWs and Starstreak missiles, which has also helped the Ukrainians destroy Russian drones.

The US is now supplying 100 Switchblade anti-tank drones to Ukraine, the BBC reported.

Is this a fault of Russian tactics?

Phillips O'Brien, a professor of strategic studies at St Andrews University, told the BBC, “Some of those tanks were abandoned because they ran out of fuel. That's a logistical failure. Some got stuck in the spring-time mud, because the high command invaded at the wrong time of year.”

""Many tanks have been abandoned because of bad driving. Some have been driven off bridges. Others have been driven into ditches so that the tracks have come off. The ability of the troops to use their equipment has been lacking,” said Nick Reynolds, who works at think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).

Moreover, the Ukrainian government itself has been issuing instructions about how to destroy Russian tanks, which is being used by civilians who are taking part in the war.

According to Oryx report, half of the tanks that Russia lost were not destroyed or damaged by the enemy but captured or abandoned.",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ukraine-war-heres-why-russia-has-lost-so-many-tanks-2880939

Reports say Russia has 12,400 tanks which is the largest in the world with Ukraine possessing 2,586 tanks. Ukraine has 74 T-64 tanks against Russia's 2,000.

Ukraine also has 3,666 T-72 tanks however Russia has nearly twice that number at 9,950. Clearly as far as size is concerned the tank strength of the two countries is greatly mismatched.

Russia has in fact developed the T-14 Armata and has already produced 2,300 even since it was unveiled in 2015. It was battle-tested in Syria. It has state of the art laser-guided missiles with Kord 12.7mm and PKTM 7.62mm machine gun.

The T-14 can reportedly withstand nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. Russia currently has 20 T-14s which could prove to be a big hurdle for Ukraine's forces.

From the outset, Russia’s decision to invade was hard to understand; it seemed at odds with what most experts saw as Russia’s strategic interests. As the war has progressed, the widely predicted Russian victory has failed to emerge as Ukrainian fighters have repeatedly fended off attacks from a vastly superior force. Around the world, from Washington to Berlin to Beijing, global powers have reacted in striking and even historically unprecedented fashion.

What follows is an attempt to make sense of all of this: to tackle the biggest questions everyone is asking about the war. It is a comprehensive guide to understanding what is happening in Ukraine and why it matters.

1) Why did Russia invade Ukraine?

In a televised speech announcing Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine on February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the invasion was designed to stop a “genocide” perpetrated by “the Kyiv regime” — and ultimately to achieve “the demilitarization and de-Nazification of Ukraine.”

Though the claims of genocide and Nazi rule in Kyiv were transparently false, the rhetoric revealed Putin’s maximalist war aims: regime change (“de-Nazification”) and the elimination of Ukraine’s status as a sovereign state outside of Russian control (“demilitarization”). Why he would want to do this is a more complex story, one that emerges out of the very long arc of Russian-Ukrainian relations.

Ukraine and Russia have significant, deep, and longstanding cultural and historical ties; both date their political origins back to the ninth-century Slavic kingdom of Kievan Rus. But these ties do not make them historically identical, as Putin has repeatedly claimed in his public rhetoric. Since the rise of the modern Ukrainian national movement in the mid- to late-19th century, Russian rule in Ukraine — in both the czarist and Soviet periods — increasingly came to resemble that of an imperial power governing an unwilling colony.

Russian imperial rule ended in 1991 when 92 percent of Ukrainians voted in a national referendum to secede from the decaying Soviet Union. Almost immediately afterward, political scientists and regional experts began warning that the Russian-Ukrainian border would be a flashpoint, predicting that internal divides between the more pro-European population of western Ukraine and relatively more pro-Russian east, contested territory like the Crimean Peninsula, and Russian desire to reestablish control over its wayward vassal could all lead to conflict between the new neighbors.

It took about 20 years for these predictions to be proven right. In late 2013, Ukrainians took to the streets to protest the authoritarian and pro-Russian tilt of incumbent President Viktor Yanukovych, forcing his resignation on February 22, 2014. Five days later, the Russian military swiftly seized control of Crimea and declared it Russian territory, a brazenly illegal move that a majority of Crimeans nonetheless seemed to welcome. Pro-Russia protests in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine gave way to a violent rebellion — one stoked and armed by the Kremlin, and backed by disguised Russian troops.

The Ukrainian uprising against Yanukovych — called the “Euromaidan” movement because they were pro-EU protests that most prominently took place in Kyiv’s Maidan square — represented to Russia a threat not just to its influence over Ukraine but to the very survival of Putin’s regime. In Putin’s mind, Euromaidan was a Western-sponsored plot to overthrow a Kremlin ally, part of a broader plan to undermine Russia itself that included NATO’s post-Cold War expansions to the east.

“We understand what is happening; we understand that [the protests] were aimed against Ukraine and Russia and against Eurasian integration,” he said in a March 2014 speech on the annexation of Crimea. “With Ukraine, our Western partners have crossed the line.”

Beneath this rhetoric, according to experts on Russia, lies a deeper unstated fear: that his regime might fall prey to a similar protest movement. Ukraine could not succeed, in his view, because it might create a pro-Western model for Russians to emulate — one that the United States might eventually try to covertly export to Moscow. This was a central part of his thinking in 2014, and it remains so today.

“He sees CIA agents behind every anti-Russian political movement,” says Seva Gunitsky, a political scientist who studies Russia at the University of Toronto. “He thinks the West wants to subvert his regime the way they did in Ukraine.”

Beginning in March 2021, Russian forces began deploying to the Ukrainian border in larger and larger numbers. Putin’s nationalist rhetoric became more aggressive: In July 2021, the Russian president published a 5,000-word essay arguing that Ukrainian nationalism was a fiction, that the country was historically always part of Russia, and that a pro-Western Ukraine posed an existential threat to the Russian nation.

“The formation of an ethnically pure Ukrainian state, aggressive towards Russia, is comparable in its consequences to the use of weapons of mass destruction against us,” as he put it in his 2021 essay.

Why Putin decided that merely seizing part of Ukraine was no longer enough remains a matter of significant debate among experts. One theory, advanced by Russian journalist Mikhail Zygar, is that pandemic-induced isolation drove him to an extreme ideological place.

But while the immediate cause of Putin’s shift on Ukraine is not clear, the nature of that shift is. His longtime belief in the urgency of restoring Russia’s greatness curdled into a neo-imperial desire to bring Ukraine back under direct Russian control. And in Russia, where Putin rules basically unchecked, that meant a full-scale war.

2) Who is winning the war?

On paper, Russia’s military vastly outstrips Ukraine’s. Russia spends over 10 times as much on defense annually as Ukraine; the Russian military has a little under three times as much artillery as Ukraine and roughly 10 times as many fixed-wing aircraft. As a result, the general pre-invasion view was that Russia would easily win a conventional war. In early February, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley told members of Congress that Kyiv, the capital, could fall within 72 hours of a Russian invasion.

But that’s not how things have played out. A month into the invasion, Ukrainians still hold Kyiv. Russia has made some gains, especially in the east and south, but the consensus view among military experts is that Ukraine’s defenses have held stoutly — to the point where Ukrainians have been able to launch counteroffensives.

The initial Russian plan reportedly operated under the assumption that a swift march on Kyiv would meet only token resistance. Putin “actually really thought this would be a ‘special military operation’: They would be done in a few days, and it wouldn’t be a real war,” says Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the CNA think tank.

This plan fell apart within the first 48 hours of the war when early operations like an airborne assault on the Hostomel airport ended in disaster, forcing Russian generals to develop a new strategy on the fly. What they came up with — massive artillery bombardments and attempts to encircle and besiege Ukraine’s major cities — was more effective (and more brutal). The Russians made some inroads into Ukrainian territory, especially in the south, where they have laid siege to Mariupol and taken Kherson and Melitopol.

But these Russian advances are a bit misleading. Ukraine, Kofman explains, made the tactical decision to trade “space for time”: to withdraw strategically rather than fight for every inch of Ukrainian land, confronting the Russians on the territory and at the time of their choosing.

As the fighting continued, the nature of the Ukrainian choice became clearer. Instead of getting into pitched large-scale battles with Russians on open terrain, where Russia’s numerical advantages would prove decisive, the Ukrainians instead decided to engage in a series of smaller-scale clashes.

Ukrainian forces have bogged down Russian units in towns and smaller cities; street-to-street combat favors defenders who can use their superior knowledge of the city’s geography to hide and conduct ambushes. They have attacked isolated and exposed Russian units traveling on open roads. They have repeatedly raided poorly protected supply lines.

This approach has proven remarkably effective. By mid-March, Western intelligence agencies and open source analysts concluded that the Ukrainians had successfully managed to stall the Russian invasion. The Russian military all but openly recognized this reality in a late March briefing, in which top generals implausibly claimed they never intended to take Kyiv and were always focused on making territorial gains in the east.

“The initial Russian campaign to invade and conquer Ukraine is culminating without achieving its objectives — it is being defeated, in other words,” military scholar Frederick Kagan wrote in a March 22 brief for the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank.

Currently, Ukrainian forces are on the offensive. They have pushed the Russians farther from Kyiv, with some reports suggesting they have retaken the suburb of Irpin and forced Russia to withdraw some of its forces from the area in a tacit admission of defeat. In the south, Ukrainian forces are contesting Russian control over Kherson.

And throughout the fighting, Russian casualties have been horrifically high.

It’s hard to get accurate information in a war zone, but one of the more authoritative estimates of Russian war dead — from the US Defense Department — concludes that over 7,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the first three weeks of fighting, a figure about three times as large as the total US service members dead in all 20 years of fighting in Afghanistan. A separate NATO estimate puts that at the low end, estimating between 7,000 and 15,000 Russians killed in action and as many as 40,000 total losses (including injuries, captures, and desertions). Seven Russian generals have been reported killed in the fighting, and materiel losses — ranging from armor to aircraft — have been enormous. (Russia puts its death toll at more than 1,300 soldiers, which is almost certainly a significant undercount.)

This all does not mean that a Russian victory is impossible. Any number of things, ranging from Russian reinforcements to the fall of besieged Mariupol, could give the war effort new life.

It does, however, mean that what Russia is doing right now hasn’t worked.

“If the point is just to wreak havoc, then they’re doing fine. But if the point is to wreak havoc and thus advance further — be able to hold more territory — they’re not doing fine,” says Olga Oliker, the program director for Europe and Central Asia at the International Crisis Group.

3) Why is Russia’s military performing so poorly?

Russia’s invasion has gone awry for two basic reasons: Its military wasn’t ready to fight a war like this, and the Ukrainians have put up a much stronger defense than anyone expected.

Russia’s problems begin with Putin’s unrealistic invasion plan. But even after the Russian high command adjusted its strategy, other flaws in the army remained.

“We’re seeing a country militarily implode,” says Robert Farley, a professor who studies air power at the University of Kentucky.

One of the biggest and most noticeable issues has been rickety logistics. Some of the most famous images of the war have been of Russian armored vehicles parked on Ukrainian roads, seemingly out of gas and unable to advance. The Russian forces have proven to be underequipped and badly supplied, encountering problems ranging from poor communications to inadequate tires.

Part of the reason is a lack of sufficient preparation. Per Kofman, the Russian military simply “wasn’t organized for this kind of war” — meaning, the conquest of Europe’s second-largest country by area. Another part of it is corruption in the Russian procurement system. Graft in Russia is less a bug in its political system than a feature; one way the Kremlin maintains the loyalty of its elite is by allowing them to profit off of government activity. Military procurement is no exception to this pattern of widespread corruption, and it has led to troops having substandard access to vital supplies.

The same lack of preparation has plagued Russia’s air force. Despite outnumbering the Ukrainian air force by roughly 10 times, the Russians have failed to establish air superiority: Ukraine’s planes are still flying and its air defenses mostly remain in place.

“The Russian Army was not prepared to fight this war” —Jason Lyall, Dartmouth political scientist

Perhaps most importantly, close observers of the war believe Russians are suffering from poor morale. Because Putin’s plan to invade Ukraine was kept secret from the vast majority of Russians, the government had a limited ability to lay a propaganda groundwork that would get their soldiers motivated to fight. The current Russian force has little sense of what they’re fighting for or why — and are waging war against a country with which they have religious, ethnic, historical, and potentially even familial ties. In a military that has long had systemic morale problems, that’s a recipe for battlefield disaster.

“Russian morale was incredibly low BEFORE the war broke out. Brutal hazing in the military, second-class (or worse) status by its conscript soldiers, ethnic divisions, corruption, you name it: the Russian Army was not prepared to fight this war,” Jason Lyall, a Dartmouth political scientist who studies morale, explains via email. “High rates of abandoned or captured equipment, reports of sabotaged equipment, and large numbers of soldiers deserting (or simply camping out in the forest) are all products of low morale.”

The contrast with the Ukrainians couldn’t be starker. They are defending their homes and their families from an unprovoked invasion, led by a charismatic leader who has made a personal stand in Kyiv. Ukrainian high morale is a key reason, in addition to advanced Western armaments, that the defenders have dramatically outperformed expectations.

“Having spent a chunk of my professional career [working] with the Ukrainians, nobody, myself included and themselves included, had all that high an estimation of their military capacity,” Oliker says.

Again, none of this will necessarily remain the case throughout the war. Morale can shift with battlefield developments. And even if Russian morale remains low, it’s still possible for them to win — though they’re more likely to do so in a brutally ugly fashion.

4) What has the war meant for ordinary Ukrainians?

As the fighting has dragged on, Russia has gravitated toward tactics that, by design, hurt civilians. Most notably, Russia has attempted to lay siege to Ukraine’s cities, cutting off supply and escape routes while bombarding them with artillery. The purpose of the strategy is to wear down the Ukrainian defenders’ willingness to fight, including by inflicting mass pain on the civilian populations.

The result has been nightmarish: an astonishing outflow of Ukrainian refugees and tremendous suffering for many of those who were unwilling or unable to leave.

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, more than 3.8 million Ukrainians fled the country between February 24 and March 27. That’s about 8.8 percent of Ukraine’s total population — in proportional terms, the rough equivalent of the entire population of Texas being forced to flee the United States.

Another point of comparison: In 2015, four years into the Syrian civil war and the height of the global refugee crisis, there were a little more than 4 million Syrian refugees living in nearby countries. The Ukraine war has produced a similarly sized exodus in just a month, leading to truly massive refugee flows to its European neighbors. Poland, the primary destination of Ukrainian refugees, is currently housing over 2.3 million Ukrainians, a figure larger than the entire population of Warsaw, its capital and largest city.

For those civilians who have been unable to flee, the situation is dire. There are no reliable estimates of death totals; a March 27 UN estimate puts the figure at 1,119 but cautions that “the actual figures are considerably higher [because] the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.”

The UN assessment does not blame one side or the other for these deaths, but does note that “most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and airstrikes.” It is the Russians, primarily, who are using these sorts of weapons in populated areas; Human Rights Watch has announced that there are “early signs of war crimes” being committed by Russian soldiers in these kinds of attacks, and President Joe Biden has personally labeled Putin a “war criminal.”

Nowhere is this devastation more visible than the southern city of Mariupol, the largest Ukrainian population center to which Russia has laid siege. Aerial footage of the city published by the Guardian in late March reveals entire blocks demolished by Russian bombardment:

In mid-March, three Associated Press journalists — the last international reporters in the city before they too were evacuated — managed to file a dispatch describing life on the ground. They reported a death total of 2,500 but cautioned that “many bodies can’t be counted because of the endless shelling.” The situation is impossibly dire:

Airstrikes and shells have hit the maternity hospital, the fire department, homes, a church, a field outside a school. For the estimated hundreds of thousands who remain, there is quite simply nowhere to go. The surrounding roads are mined and the port blocked. Food is running out, and the Russians have stopped humanitarian attempts to bring it in. Electricity is mostly gone and water is sparse, with residents melting snow to drink. Some parents have even left their newborns at the hospital, perhaps hoping to give them a chance at life in the one place with decent electricity and water.

The battlefield failures of the Russian military have raised questions about its competence in difficult block-to-block fighting; Farley, the Kentucky professor, says, “This Russian army does not look like it can conduct serious [urban warfare].” As a result, taking Ukrainian cities means besieging them — starving them out, destroying their will to fight, and only moving into the city proper after its population is unwilling to resist or outright incapable of putting up a fight.

5) What do Russians think about the war?

Vladimir Putin’s government has ramped up its already repressive policies during the Ukraine conflict, shuttering independent media outlets and blocking access to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. It’s now extremely difficult to get a sense of what either ordinary Russians or the country’s elite think about the war, as criticizing it could lead to a lengthy stint in prison.

But despite this opacity, expert Russia watchers have developed a broad idea of what’s going on there. The war has stirred up some opposition and anti-Putin sentiment, but it has been confined to a minority who are unlikely to change Putin’s mind, let alone topple him.

The bulk of the Russian public was no more prepared for war than the bulk of the Russian military — in fact, probably less so. After Putin announced the launch of his “special military operation” in Ukraine on national television, there was a surprising amount of criticism from high-profile Russians — figures ranging from billionaires to athletes to social media influencers. One Russian journalist, Marina Ovsyannikova, bravely ran into the background of a government broadcast while holding an antiwar sign.

“It is unprecedented to see oligarchs, other elected officials, and other powerful people in society publicly speaking out against the war,” says Alexis Lerner, a scholar of dissent in Russia at the US Naval Academy.

There have also been antiwar rallies in dozens of Russian cities. How many have participated in these rallies is hard to say, but the human rights group OVD-Info estimates that over 15,000 Russians have been arrested at the events since the war began.

Could these eruptions of antiwar sentiment at the elite and mass public level suggest a coming coup or revolution against the Putin regime? Experts caution that these events remain quite unlikely.

Putin has done an effective job engaging in what political scientists call “coup-proofing.” He has put in barriers — from seeding the military with counterintelligence officers to splitting up the state security services into different groups led by trusted allies — that make it quite difficult for anyone in his government to successfully move against him.

“Putin has prepared for this eventuality for a long time and has taken a lot of concerted actions to make sure he’s not vulnerable,” says Adam Casey, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan who studies the history of coups in Russia and the former communist bloc.

Similarly, turning the antiwar protests into a full-blown influential movement is a very tall order.

“It is hard to organize sustained collective protest in Russia,” notes Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard who studies protest movements. “Putin’s government has criminalized many forms of protests, and has shut down or restricted the activities of groups, movements, and media outlets perceived to be in opposition or associated with the West.”

Underpinning it all is tight government control of the information environment. Most Russians get their news from government-run media, which has been serving up a steady diet of pro-war content. Many of them appear to genuinely believe what they hear: One independent opinion poll found that 58 percent of Russians supported the war to at least some degree.

Prior to the war, Putin also appeared to be a genuinely popular figure in Russia. The elite depend on him for their position and fortune; many citizens see him as the man who saved Russia from the chaos of the immediate post-Communist period. A disastrous war might end up changing that, but the odds that even a sustained drop in his support translates into a coup or revolution remain low indeed.

6) What is the US role in the conflict?

The war remains, for the moment, a conflict between Ukraine and Russia. But the United States is the most important third party, using a number of powerful tools — short of direct military intervention — to aid the Ukrainian cause.

Any serious assessment of US involvement needs to start in the post-Cold War 1990s, when the US and its NATO allies made the decision to open alliance membership to former communist states.

Many of these countries, wary of once again being put under the Russian boot, clamored to join the alliance, which commits all involved countries to defend any member-state in the event of an attack. In 2008, NATO officially announced that Georgia and Ukraine — two former Soviet republics right on Russia’s doorstep — “will become members of NATO” at an unspecified future date. This infuriated the Russians, who saw NATO expansion as a direct threat to their own security.

There is no doubt that NATO expansion helped create some of the background conditions under which the current conflict became thinkable, generally pushing Putin’s foreign policy in a more anti-Western direction. Some experts see it as one of the key causes of his decision to attack Ukraine — but others strongly disagree, noting that NATO membership for Ukraine was already basically off the table before the war and that Russia’s declared war aims went far beyond simply blocking Ukraine’s NATO bid.

“NATO expansion was deeply unpopular in Russia. [But] Putin did not invade because of NATO expansion,” says Yoshiko Herrera, a Russia expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Regardless of where one falls on that debate, US policy during the conflict has been exceptionally clear: support the Ukrainians with massive amounts of military assistance while putting pressure on Putin to back down by organizing an unprecedented array of international economic sanctions.

On the military side, weapons systems manufactured and provided by the US and Europe have played a vital role in blunting Russia’s advance. The Javelin anti-tank missile system, for example, is a lightweight American-made launcher that allows one or two infantry soldiers to take out a tank. Javelins have given the outgunned Ukrainians a fighting chance against Russian armor, becoming a popular symbol in the process.

Sanctions have proven similarly devastating in the economic realm.

The international punishments have been extremely broad, ranging from removing key Russian banks from the SWIFT global transaction system to a US ban on Russian oil imports to restrictions on doing business with particular members of the Russian elite. Freezing the assets of Russia’s central bank has proven to be a particularly damaging tool, wrecking Russia’s ability to deal with the collapse in the value of the ruble, its currency. As a result, the Russian economy is projected to contract by 15 percent this year; mass unemployment looms.

There is more America can do, particularly when it comes to fulfilling Ukrainian requests for new fighter jets. In March, Washington rejected a Polish plan to transfer MiG-29 aircraft to Ukraine via a US Air Force base in Germany, arguing that it could be too provocative.

But the MiG-29 incident is more the exception than it is the rule. On the whole, the United States has been strikingly willing to take aggressive steps to punish Moscow and aid Kyiv’s war effort.

7) How is the rest of the world responding to Russia’s actions?

On the surface, the world appears to be fairly united behind the Ukrainian cause. The UN General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the Russian invasion by a whopping 141-5 margin (with 35 abstentions). But the UN vote conceals a great deal of disagreement, especially among the world’s largest and most influential countries — divergences that don’t always fall neatly along democracy-versus-autocracy lines.

The most aggressive anti-Russian and pro-Ukrainian positions can, perhaps unsurprisingly, be found in Europe and the broader West. EU and NATO members, with the partial exceptions of Hungary and Turkey, have strongly supported the Ukrainian war effort and implemented punishing sanctions on Russia (a major trading partner). It’s the strongest show of European unity since the Cold War, one that many observers see as a sign that Putin’s invasion has already backfired.

Germany, which has important trade ties with Russia and a post-World War II tradition of pacifism, is perhaps the most striking case. Nearly overnight, the Russian invasion convinced center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz to support rearmament, introducing a proposal to more than triple Germany’s defense budget that’s widely backed by the German public.

“It’s really revolutionary,” Sophia Besch, a Berlin-based senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, told my colleague Jen Kirby. “Scholz, in his speech, did away with and overturned so many of what we thought were certainties of German defense policy.”

Though Scholz has refused to outright ban Russian oil and gas imports, he has blocked the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and committed to a long-term strategy of weaning Germany off of Russian energy. All signs point to Russia waking a sleeping giant — of creating a powerful military and economic enemy in the heart of the European continent.

China, by contrast, has been the most pro-Russia of the major global powers.

The two countries, bound by shared animus toward a US-dominated world order, have grown increasingly close in recent years. Chinese propaganda has largely toed the Russian line on the Ukraine war. US intelligence, which has been remarkably accurate during the crisis, believes that Russia has requested military and financial assistance from Beijing — which hasn’t been provided yet but may well be forthcoming.

That said, it’s possible to overstate the degree to which China has taken the Russian side. Beijing has a strong stated commitment to state sovereignty — the bedrock of its position on Taiwan is that the island is actually Chinese territory — which makes a full-throated backing of the invasion ideologically awkward. There’s a notable amount of debate among Chinese policy experts and in the public, with some analysts publicly advocating that Beijing adopt a more neutral line on the conflict.

Most other countries around the world fall somewhere on the spectrum between the West and China. Outside of Europe, only a handful of mostly pro-American states — like South Korea, Japan, and Australia — have joined the sanctions regime. The majority of countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America do not support the invasion, but won’t do very much to punish Russia for it either.

India is perhaps the most interesting country in this category. A rising Asian democracy that has violently clashed with China in the very recent past, it has good reasons to present itself as an American partner in the defense of freedom. Yet India also depends heavily on Russian-made weapons for its own defense and hopes to use its relationship with Russia to limit the Moscow-Beijing partnership. It’s also worth noting that India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has strong autocratic inclinations.

The result of all of this is a balancing act reminiscent of India’s Cold War approach of “non-alignment”: refusing to side with either the Russian or American positions while attempting to maintain decent relations with both. India’s perceptions of its strategic interests, more than ideological views about democracy, appear to be shaping its response to the war — as seems to be the case with quite a few countries around the world.

8) Could this turn into World War III?

The basic, scary answer to this question is yes: The invasion of Ukraine has put us at the greatest risk of a NATO-Russia war in decades.

The somewhat more comforting and nuanced answer is that the absolute risk remains relatively low so long as there is no direct NATO involvement in the conflict, which the Biden administration has repeatedly ruled out. Though Biden said “this man [Putin] cannot remain in power” in a late March speech, both White House officials and the president himself stressed afterward that the US policy was not regime change in Moscow.

“Things are stable in a nuclear sense right now,” says Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on nuclear weapons at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. “The minute NATO gets involved, the scope of the war widens.”

In theory, US and NATO military assistance to Ukraine could open the door to escalation: Russia could attack a military depot in Poland containing weapons bound for Ukraine, for instance. But in practice, it’s unlikely: The Russians don’t appear to want a wider war with NATO that risks nuclear escalation, and so have avoided cross-border strikes even when it might destroy supply shipments bound for Ukraine.

In early March, the US Department of Defense opened a direct line of communication with its Russian peers in order to avoid any kind of accidental conflict. It’s not clear how well this is working — some reporting suggests the Russians aren’t answering American calls — but there is a long history of effective dialogue between rivals who are fighting each other through proxy forces.

“States often cooperate to keep limits on their wars even as they fight one another clandestinely,” Lyall, the Dartmouth professor, tells me. “While there’s always a risk of unintended escalation, historical examples like Vietnam, Afghanistan (1980s), Afghanistan again (post-2001), and Syria show that wars can be fought ‘within bounds.’”

If the United States and NATO heed the call of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to impose a so-called “no-fly zone” over Ukrainian skies, the situation changes dramatically. No-fly zones are commitments to patrol and, if necessary, shoot down military aircraft that fly in the declared area, generally for the purpose of protecting civilians. In Ukraine, that would mean the US and its NATO allies sending in jets to patrol Ukraine’s skies — and being willing to shoot down any Russian planes that enter protected airspace. From there, the risks of a nuclear conflict become terrifyingly high.

Russia recognizes its inferiority to NATO in conventional terms; its military doctrine has long envisioned the use of nuclear weapons in a war with the Western alliance. In his speech declaring war on Ukraine, Putin all but openly vowed that any international intervention in the conflict would trigger nuclear retaliation.

“To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside: If you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history,” the Russian president said. “I hope you hear me.”

The Biden administration is taking these threats seriously. Much as the Kremlin hasn’t struck NATO supply missions to Ukraine, the White House has flatly rejected a no-fly zone or any other kind of direct military intervention.

“We will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine,” Biden said on March 11. “Direct conflict between NATO and Russia is World War III, something we must strive to prevent.”

This does not mean the risk of a wider war is zero. Accidents happen, and countries can be dragged into war against their leaders’ best judgment. Political positions and risk calculi can also change: If Russia starts losing badly and uses smaller nukes on Ukrainian forces (called “tactical” nuclear weapons), Biden would likely feel the need to respond in some fairly aggressive way. Much depends on Washington and Moscow continuing to show a certain level of restraint.

9) How could the war end?

Wars do not typically end with the total defeat of one side or the other. More commonly, there’s some kind of negotiated settlement — either a ceasefire or more permanent peace treaty — where the two sides agree to stop fighting under a set of mutually agreeable terms.

It is possible that the Ukraine conflict turns out to be an exception: that Russian morale collapses completely, leading to utter battlefield defeat, or that Russia inflicts so much pain that Kyiv collapses. But most analysts believe that neither of these is especially likely given the way the war has played out to date.

“No matter how much military firepower they pour into it, [the Russians] are not going to be able to achieve regime change or some of their maximalist aims,” Kofman, of the CNA think tank, declares.

A negotiated settlement is the most likely way the conflict ends. Peace negotiations between the two sides are ongoing, and some reporting suggests they’re bearing fruit. On March 28, the Financial Times reported significant progress on a draft agreement covering issues ranging from Ukrainian NATO membership to the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine. The next day, Russia pledged to decrease its use of force in Ukraine’s north as a sign of its commitment to the talks.

American officials, though, have been publicly skeptical of Russia’s seriousness in the talks. Even if Moscow is committed to reaching a settlement, the devil is always in the details with these sorts of things — and there are lots of barriers standing in the way of a successful resolution.

Take NATO. The Russians want a simple pledge that Ukraine will remain “neutral” — staying out of foreign security blocs. The current draft agreement, per the Financial Times, does preclude Ukrainian NATO membership, but it permits Ukraine to join the EU. It also commits at least 11 countries, including the United States and China, to coming to Ukraine’s aid if it is attacked again. This would put Ukraine on a far stronger security footing than it had before the war — a victory for Kyiv and defeat for Moscow, one that Putin may ultimately conclude is unacceptable.

Another thorny issue — perhaps the thorniest — is the status of Crimea and the two breakaway Russian-supported republics in eastern Ukraine. The Russians want Ukrainian recognition of its annexation of Crimea and the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions; Ukraine claims all three as part of its territory. Some compromise is imaginable here — an internationally monitored referendum in each territory, perhaps — but what that would look like is not obvious.

The resolution of these issues will likely depend quite a bit on the war’s progress. The more each side believes it has a decent chance to improve its battlefield position and gain leverage in negotiations, the less reason either will have to make concessions to the other in the name of ending the fighting.

And even if they do somehow come to an agreement, it may not end up holding.

On the Ukrainian side, ultra-nationalist militias could work to undermine any agreement with Russia that they believe gives away too much, as they threatened during pre-war negotiations aimed at preventing the Russian invasion.

On the Russian side, an agreement is only as good as Putin’s word. Even if it contains rigorous provisions designed to raise the costs of future aggression, like international peacekeepers, that may not hold him back from breaking the agreement.

This invasion did, after all, start with him launching an invasion that seemed bound to hurt Russia in the long run. Putin dragged the world into this mess; when and how it gets out of it depends just as heavily on his decisions.",https://www.vox.com/22989379/russia-ukraine-war-putin-zelenskyy-us-nato-explainer-questions

Olena Koval saw the text message when she turned on her phone on March 8. Her husband Viktor, also called Vitya, was dead.

Olena and her family lived in Bucha, a city of 37,000 roughly 30 kilometers northwest of Kyiv and about 3 kilometers from the military airport in Hostomel. Advancing Russian forces had sought control of Bucha early in the war. The battle for Bucha devastated the city and its inhabitants and Olena, a 43-year-old healthcare lawyer, watched it happen. Relentless shelling trapped people in their homes and shelters. There was no electricity and no gas, which meant no heat in the frigid winter.

Like many in Bucha, Olena kept her phone off to save the battery, only turning it on occasionally to check for texts or calls.

The shelling had eased when Olena received the text message about her husband. She didn’t know how he died, but she knew she needed to try to recover Viktor’s body.

For years, Olena, Viktor, 48, and their son, Olexii lived in at Sklozavodska Street 9 in Bucha. When there were celebrations at Maidan Square, in Kyiv’s center, they could see the fireworks from their apartment window.

Because of a spinal disability, walking up and down the stairs had become difficult for Olena. She and Viktor, who was an engineer, bought land nearby and built a two-story house that would be accessible for Olena. They moved into their new home at Vesennya Street 32, in 2019, and planned for Olena’s parents to move in with them.

Everything changed on February 27, when Russian soldiers came to Bucha.

Olena, Viktor, and 24-year-old Olexii were at home. Viktor’s nephew’s wife, Oksana, who was seven and a half months pregnant, was also staying with them.

When the shooting and shelling started, the family, concerned about Oksana, decided to move back into their old apartment because it was right next to an outpatient clinic.

As they left the house, their neighbor, Dmytro Mukhin came by with his family of five, asking for help. The Mukhins didn’t have a bomb shelter and needed a safe place to stay nearby, as Dmytro’s mother walked with difficulty. Viktor offered them the shelter in his backyard and led Mukhin’s family to the house.

Olena, Olexii and Oksana made their way to Sklozavodska Street.

That was the last time Olena saw her husband.

Over the next few days, the shooting and shelling became so intense that Bucha residents could no longer leave their houses. “We felt like hostages,” Olena said.

Olena watched the destruction of the city from her apartment window. First, a shell hit the nine-story apartment building at Yablunska Street 17. The building caught fire, and the sixth through ninth floors burned. Then Olena’s parents’ apartment building on Sklozavodska 4 was hit, then building number 6. Olena could also see houses burning in the distance: “There was no water, so no one was putting fires out. Houses just burned, until they burned to the ground.”

Sometimes the shelling died down, but snipers were always around. On March 4, Russian forces hit the water tower and the gas plant[YG1] , leaving Bucha residents without heating, gas, or water.

It was 14 degrees below zero Celsius, with snow on the ground. “We stayed inside, wore layers and layers of clothes to keep warm. We had no water, electricity, practically no phone reception. If there were humanitarian corridors open, we had no way of finding out,” Olena said.

By March 4, Russian forces were everywhere in Bucha. They drove tanks and armored vehicles through people’s fences and parked them in residential backyards. There were military vehicles at every house, near every apartment building. “We saw them [military vehicles] driving down the street [Sklozavodska], shooting randomly at windows,” Olena said. “They were just shooting.”

Russian soldiers went from house to house, breaking doors and windows, searching and questioning people. Olena saw them taking people’s clothes and shoes, changing, and dumping their own clothes on the street.

They heard reports of extrajudicial killings and civilians shot while trying to get water.

Olena had no way of reaching Viktor or the Mukhins. The house was nearby, but going there was too dangerous.

On March 6 the shelling died down long enough for the residents of Sklozavodska Street to step outside for the first time in days. People rushed to break fences, dismantle a children’s playground – anything made of wood to start a fire and cook a hot meal. Some residents went to get water from a nearby well, but there were so many people that after 30 minutes, the water ran out.

On March 8 Olena walked to a spot on a hill outside her apartment building, where she could sometimes get just enough reception to check her messages. When she turned her phone on, the text message with the news about Viktor arrived. She understood her neighbor, Dmytro Mukhin had sent it.

***

Olena didn’t know how her husband died but knew that she had to get his body. She started walking down Sklozavodska Street. She turned on to Yablunska Street. She walked slowly, leaning on her cane. She reached a kindergarten called “Shket”. From there, it was only a few minutes to the house.

A Russian soldier was sitting on the kindergarten’s roof. He told Olena to stop or he would shoot. She said she needed to get her husband’s body and if he wanted to shoot at an unarmed woman with a cane, so be it.

She kept on walking.

“Then I saw our house. One wall was hit with a shell and burned. All the windows were broken, some window frames torn out.” Mukhin’s house was also damaged. “They had a balcony and beautiful French windows, floor-to-ceiling. The balcony was smashed and the windows were gone. Curtains were fluttering in the wind.”

Olena and Viktor’s possessions – bedsheets, plates, pillows – were scattered through the yard.

Two Russian soldiers caught up with Olena as she was about the enter her house. They told her that if she took another step, she would end up lying next to her husband.

“They were very young, 18 or 20. Necks sticking out of the collars.” Olena said. “Really, just kids, not men. But with Kalashnikovs.”

The soldiers walked Olena back to Yablunska Street and told her to stand facing away from her house. One of them shot a gun at her feet, marking a line of bullet holes on the road. “See this line? Walk along it, do not sway,” he told her. “If you veer left or right, you are dead.”

Dmytro Mukhin spoke very fast, when I asked what happened to Viktor.

He said that it happened on March 5, at around 1 p.m.

“It was quiet, so we got out of the shelter, [went to the house] and were on the ground floor, in a room. And then [shelling] hit the house, two direct hits, one after another. We all fell to the floor. Two or three minutes later we heard glass breaking outside, then loud steps. Someone was yelling: “Check the second floor!” Vitya moved, he got up, there was automatic gunfire and he fell, screaming in pain. He yelled: “Please don’t shoot! I am wounded, there are civilians here, children, don’t shoot.”

“The [soldiers] started banging on the door. We opened and they walked in. There were 4 or 5 of them, I don’t even remember now. Their clothes were very dirty, some of them had St. George [orange and black striped] ribbons on their helmets. They told us to get outside, one by one. We went into the yard. We said, there is a wounded man there, please help him. They refused. They said they had no bandages or medicines. We stood there for 30 or 40 minutes while they searched the house. Then they came outside, told us to go in and stay there, and left. We went inside. We tried to help Vitya. He was still alive, lying where we left him.

“We cut his sweater open and saw that there was a surface wound on this chest, no entry bullet wound, and I thought for a moment that it was not so bad. But when we turned him over, we saw three bullet holes around his left shoulder blade. His sleeve was soaked through, and the blood pooled on the floor under him. We tried to stop the bleeding with the bedsheet. He was struggling to breathe.”

Viktor died 20 minutes later.

Dmytro and his family put him on a mattress and dragged him to the boiler room, which was the coldest room in the house. They spent two more nights sheltering in Viktor and Olena’s house before fleeing Bucha.

Dmytro’s voice was calm but it shook a little when he said he felt responsible for what happened. “If I hadn’t asked them for help, Vitya might have still been alive.”

The next morning Olena, together with her sister, Halyna, attempted again to get Viktor’s body. They got as far as Yablunska Street when they saw a tank on the road. The women stopped and raised their arms. A Russian soldier got out of the tank and yelled at them to turn around and go back. The women returned to the apartment building.

A neighbor told them about a possible evacuation that day. Olena realized that this was likely the last opportunity to get her family out.

The evacuation point was in the city center, five kilometers away. Olena could not walk that far and they didn’t have a car. Olena and her sister stood on the road and waved down passing cars to get rides for her parents, her son, and themselves.

They waited for hours at the evacuation point while Russian soldiers checked people’s phones and rummaged through their things. When they were finally able to leave, Olena said, they drove past her house on Vesennya Street, where their whole family was going to live together, and which was now severely damaged. They drove past abandoned cars, bodies on the side of the road, a volunteer bus riddled with bullet holes, a bicycle on the ground with a man’s body next to it.

Olena still doesn’t know what happened to her husband’s body. Someone told her that he might have been buried in a mass grave. Before she left Bucha, Olena sketched their house on a small piece of paper, marking with a star the room where Viktor’s body was. She left the paper with a neighbor.

“Maybe someone will pass that piece of paper to someone else, who will find him and give him a proper burial,” she said.",https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/30/devastation-and-loss-bucha-ukraine

Also, The White House said Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misinformed by his top advisers about military developments in Russia, a development that the Pentagon labeled as ""disconcerting.""

""We have seen over the last 24 hours the repositioning of a small percentage of the troops and the battalion tactical groups that Russia had arrayed against Kyiv,"" Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said Wednesday. ""Probably in the neighborhood of 20% of what they had, they are beginning to reposition some of those troops.""

Specifically, Kirby said the Russian troops near the Hostomel airport north of the city have been seen moving north towards Belarus. The airport had been the scene of heavy fighting from the opening hours of Russia's invasion.

Separately, a senior U.S. defense official said some Russian troops had also been seen moving out of the Chernobyl nuclear facility. However, it remained unclear if they would all be leaving.

Some of those troops are being moved into Belarus, said Kirby, who added that none of the units have been seen returning to their home bases.

""If the Russians are serious about de-escalating, because that's their claim here, then they should send them home, but they're not doing that, at least not yet,"" Kirby said. ""That's not what we're seeing.""

Kirby said he was intentionally using the term reposition instead of a withdrawal to describe the movement of Russian forces ""because the way it's being spun by the Ministry of Defense is that they're that they're pulling back and they're trying to de-escalate and depressurize the situation and we just don't believe we haven't seen any evidence of that.""

Instead, Kirby said the U.S. assesses that the Russians are ""going to refit these troops, resupply them, and then probably employ them elsewhere in Ukraine.""

A senior U.S. defense official said U.S. intelligence believes that Russia may intend to shift some of these troops towards the fight in the Donbas region, which would be in line with public statements from Russian officials that they want to make that region a priority of their operations.

Even as some of the Russian troops around Kyiv move away, Kirby and the rest have established defensive positions. Kirby noted that Russian forces continue to launch missiles and artillery at the city and surrounding suburbs.

Kirby said that without getting into intelligence, the Pentagon concurred with comments in news reports attributed to a U.S. official that Putin is not being fully advised of Russia's performance on the battlefield in Ukraine.

""We would concur with the conclusion that Mr. Putin has not been fully informed by his Ministry of Defense at every turn over the last month,"" Kirby said Wednesday.

Kirby described that assessment as ""disconcerting"" and ""an issue of concern.""

""The fact that he may not have all the context, that he may not fully understand the degree to which his forces are failing in Ukraine, that's a little discomforting, to be honest with you,"" Kirby said.

""If he's not fully informed of how poorly he's doing, then how are his negotiators going to come up with an agreement that is enduring? Certainly one that respects Ukrainian sovereignty,"" he added.

""The other thing is you don't know how a leader like that is going to react to getting bad news,"" Kirby said. '",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/20-russian-troops-kyiv-repositioning-pentagon-day-35/story?id=83768455
10,3536fb7e-0f53-410f-910b-bbc59ccc1905,['Dan Sabbagh'],2022-03-28 00:00:00,"Russia’s military may have announced a change of plan at the end of last week to focus on the “liberation of Donbas”, but the apparent decision reflected the reality that Moscow’s initial multi-front invasion plan has failed in the face of dogged resistance from Ukraine.

The advance on Kyiv became bogged down after less than a week, particularly to the north-west of the city. If Ukraine’s declaration that it has retaken the heavily contested town of Irpin’ on Monday is correct, the advance may now even be going into reverse.

But the capital, for all its political significance, has not been the focus for a week or more. Russia has already refocused its efforts on the east, recognising that its forces were too spread out, that morale is tumbling and that it is sustaining heavier than expected losses.

Western officials estimate that Russia has lost at least 20 battalion tactical groups – the smallest operating unit of its forces, with an average size of 800 at full strength – out of an original invasion force of 115 to 120. They are “no longer combat-effective”, one said on Friday.

Already, day after day, Russian forces, with Chechen fighters at the forefront, have been grinding forward into the ravaged southern port city of Mariupol, where perhaps 160,000 residents are enduring the worst of wartime conditions.

“Mariupol will fall,” said Mathieu Boulegue of the Chatham House thinktank. “And this will probably happen in a few days.” His comments reflect the grim reality of Russia’s encirclement of the city, whose defenders are gradually running out of food and ammunition.

For Kyiv is it is a alarming prospect, which is partly why the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had pleaded at Thursday’s Nato summit for gifts of tanks to “try to relieve Mariupol and to help the thousands of Ukrainian fighters in the city”.

A Russian victory in Mariupol would in turn free up about 6,000 troops to turn to what could be the defining objective of the war – encircling Ukraine’s best military forces to the north.

These are the Joint Forces Operation (JFO) units, 10 brigades at the start of the war, which have been facing the occupied Donbas region since 2015. That includes occupying a network of first world war-style trenches along the “line of contact” at Ukraine’s eastern edge.

To some extent, the effort has already begun, with Russian forces trying to bypass the already besieged city of Kharkiv to the north, and break through by capturing Izium. Boulegue, however, believes that Russia’s forces are sufficiently exhausted from the first phase of fighting that they will need “a phase-two pause” before trying “phase three, the pincer”.

Russia is trying to generate reinforcements both from remaining military reserves, forces brought in from Syria, Armenia and elsewhere, plus fresh conscripts, whose operational usefulness is limited. These may amount to 10 battalions, western intelligence estimates, or half of those lost.

There is also evidence that other Russian forces, the “most battered units deployed to Ukraine”, are now being withdrawn from the battlefield and sent to Russia to recuperate, according to Konrad Muzyka, an open-source intelligence analyst.

One example was revealed by satellite imagery, he said, which showed there were “no Russian troops at Hostomel airport” – a heavily contested military base north-west of Kyiv still under Russian control.

Russia will slow its tempo in the east only for as long as it is forced to. The key question is whether it can succeed in enveloping Ukraine’s land forces in due course. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), questions whether Moscow’s forces can do so given their halting performance so far, and the defensive success Ukraine has had with anti-tank and other weapons it has received from the west.

“Even by revising their military objectives to be more modest, it isn’t clear whether they can successfully encircle Ukrainian forces of the JFO. In fact, I consider it unlikely,” Reynolds said.

His Rusi colleague Jack Watling said in a recent paper that to survive in the east, Ukrainian forces needed to “prevent the Russians from being able to concentrate their efforts on one axis at a time” by continuing to counter-attack in and around Kyiv.

In other words, Russia’s new strategy is to try to concentrate its forces to achieve a breakthrough. Ukraine, meanwhile, has to find a way of making the invaders’ original multiple-front offensive continue to work against itself, by keeping the fighting spread out.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/as-russia-tries-to-focus-its-offensive-ukraine-seeks-to-scattergun
