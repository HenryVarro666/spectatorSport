The proposals would also include a 15-year consultation period on the status of annexed Crimea and could come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, the negotiators told reporters in Istanbul. read more

The proposals are the most detailed and concrete that Ukraine has aired publicly. They also envisage security guarantees along the lines of the NATO military alliance's Article 5, its collective defence clause. Poland, Israel, Turkey and Canada could among the potential security guarantors.

""If we manage to consolidate these key provisions, and for us this is the most fundamental, then Ukraine will be in a position to actually fix its current status as a non-bloc and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality,"" said negotiator Oleksander Chaly.

""We will not host foreign military bases on our territory, as well as deploy military contingents on our territory, and we will not enter into military-political alliances,"" he said, in comments broadcast on Ukrainian national television.

""Military exercises on our territory will take place with the consent of the guarantor countries.""

There was enough material in the current Ukrainian proposals to warrant a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Ukrainian negotiators said, adding they were awaiting Russia's response.

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met in Turkey on Tuesday for the first face-to-face talks in nearly three weeks, with Ukraine seeking a ceasefire without compromising on territory or sovereignty as its forces have pushed Russians back from Kyiv.

1,a9fde210-e9f0-445c-bbf1-3ec743c6eb05,['Dan Bilefsky'],2022-03-31 00:00:00,"But Ukraine’s request, which took many in Washington by surprise and sent the pulses of some American diplomats racing with alarm, has raised questions as to how such an arrangement would work and whether it would ever really be palatable for the Kremlin.

The senior Ukrainian negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, told the Turkish broadcaster NTV on Thursday that security guarantees could help end the war. He said so-called guarantor countries would have legal obligations under international law to provide weapons, military personnel or financial help if conflict involving Ukraine erupted. He said preliminary talks were already underway with the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Turkey, and asserted that those countries had shown willingness to accept the terms.

“This is the meaning of this pact: A country who considers to attack will know that Ukraine is not alone, and other countries are with Ukraine with their armies and their weapons,” he said.

But such an arrangement would face many hurdles, not least of which is the reluctance of Western powers to become ensnared in armed conflict with Russia. It is not clear that any of the countries cited by Mr. Podolyak have signed on to such guarantees or would do so. Mr. Podolyak’s assertions about their willingness to defend Ukraine against Russia in the future have also not been confirmed.

Above all, the prospect of outside countries committing to Ukraine’s defense echoes one of the main concerns that Russia invoked before invading Ukraine. The Kremlin has fumed over the idea of Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, joining NATO. The country’s request for security guarantees evokes the alliance’s collective defense doctrine: that “an armed attack” against any of the allies in Europe or North America “shall be considered an attack against them all.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/world/europe/ukraine-security-guarantees.html
2,a9fde210-e9f0-445c-bbf1-3ec743c6eb05,[],2022-03-31 14:38:12+05:30,"Western officials are balking at Ukraine’s proposal for a NATO-style mutual-defense pledge that could draw their military forces into a war with Russia, even as they expressed some receptiveness to the idea of international security guarantees as part of a deal to end hostilities.

At peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, Ukrainian negotiators handed Russia a detailed proposal of a neutral status for Ukraine with its security guaranteed by the U.S., U.K., France, Turkey, Germany, Canada, Poland and Israel. The Ukrainian proposal would ask countries to respond to a violation of its sovereignty the way members of North Atlantic Treaty Organization would act under Article 5, the alliance’s mutual-defense promise.

“That’s what we call Ukrainian NATO,"" said Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia, the majority leader in the country’s parliament, in an interview in Istanbul. “So we get neutrality but our idea is to get fortified neutrality status.""

President Biden has yet to comment on the proposal, but White House communications director Kate Bedingfield declined to say Wednesday whether the U.S. would be willing to serve as a security guarantor for Ukraine.

“We are in constant discussion with Ukrainians about ways that we can help ensure that they are sovereign and secure,"" she said. “But there is nothing specific about security guarantees that I can speak to at this time.""

A number of Western leaders have expressed support for some form of security guarantees for Ukraine, yet none have articulated what those would look like. Their reluctance to embrace a key plank of Ukraine’s blueprint—the notion of a NATO collective defense mechanism—shows how far apart all sides remain in finding a negotiated end to the war.

U.S. lawmakers also appeared skeptical of the proposal. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat and co-chair of Ukraine Caucus, said he thought the proposal was a “little premature,"" adding that he doesn’t trust Russia.

Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said such a proposal might be possible, but would be a long way off. “You know, we already did that,"" said Mr. Risch, referring to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, when Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees. “How’s that working?

U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab also expressed skepticism over a proposal to provide a security guarantee to a non-NATO member. “We’ll consider anything [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky says he needs very carefully,"" Mr. Raab said Wednesday on BBC radio. “But we’re not going to, I think, replicate unilaterally the NATO commitments that apply to NATO members.""

Other countries named as possible guarantors of Ukraine’s security expressed interest in the idea, but avoided committing to the proposal.

Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz told Mr. Zelensky that Berlin was “broadly willing"" to act as a security guarantor for Ukraine as part of a peace deal, a German government spokesman said Wednesday. It is, however, too early to discuss such commitments, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said.

A senior German government official later clarified that the discussion was in an early stage, and it included a proposal for a group of countries including Russia to guarantee Ukraine’s security as part of a peace agreement under which Kyiv would declare independence of any military alliances, including NATO.

The German official said that the Ukrainian proposal was yet to be fleshed out, and that it could only work if Russia was part of it.

France is open to supporting a form of neutrality for Ukraine with its security guaranteed by several countries, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The person cautioned, however, that France is unwilling to sign up for a security guarantee that includes a mechanism similar to NATO’s Article 5. Much will also depend on the details of Ukraine’s neutrality, including the status of its national army, the person added.

Russia likely wouldn’t agree to any arrangement that requires France and other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council to guarantee Ukraine’s security, the person said.

Moscow’s support would be required for any agreement to end the war, and it is unclear that the Kremlin would accept Kyiv’s proposal. “No one said that the sides have made headway,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of the talks in Istanbul, declining to discuss specific proposals. “We can’t point to anything particularly promising.""

The Ukrainian government, however, seems set on a proposal that would provide strong security guarantees from western countries.

“The activation mechanism is even stronger than NATO. In NATO if something happens you have to do the consultations first,"" said Mr. Arakhamia, the Ukrainian negotiator. “There is no mention of how long it might take. Considering how fast things are going on, we put 72 hours max. So within 72 hours, all the guarantors have to figure out what’s going on, if it’s aggression or special operation or war, they have to provide military assistance or armies.""

Crimea and Donbas—two Ukrainian regions Russia occupies—wouldn’t be a part of the guarantees, said Mr. Arakhamia. Those territories would be excluded until their status is settled in separate negotiations, he said.

Ukrainian officials proposed on Tuesday that the status of Donbas would be negotiated by the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, while Crimea would be subject to a 15-year period of negotiations on a separate track.

Ukraine first proposed Turkey, a NATO member, as a guarantor of its security on March 17. Turkey has good relations with Ukraine and has been playing a mediating role in the Russia-Ukraine crisis, hosting two rounds of peace talks.

The Turkish government hasn’t endorsed or opposed the proposal but has offered broad support for the peace negotiations.

Turkey has also sold armed drones to Kyiv, which have played an instrumental role in Ukraine’s resistance to Moscow’s invasion, striking invading Russian convoys and mobile air defenses.

While Turkey has strongly condemned the Russian invasion, it has also chosen not to impose sanctions on Russia, opting to preserve its relationship with Moscow in order to act as a mediator.

Mr. Arakhamia said Israel, a non-NATO member, could also be a party to the proposed security guarantees.

“Potentially Israel because they also have a strong army. It’s good for us to have expertise for this defensive country. They also have neutral status. They can mobilize their reserve army within one day I think,"" he said.

Israel appears unlikely, at least for now, to support the proposal.

“At this point, Israel is not in the position to provide a security guarantee to Ukraine,"" a senior Israeli official said. “We will be willing to assist in reaching an agreement through trust-building measures and other efforts.""",https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/ukraine-proposal-for-nato-style-security-guarantee-greeted-with-skepticism-11648717116189.html

""What the Russian troops are doing to Mariupol is a crime against humanity, which is happening in front of the eyes of the whole planet in real-time"", Zelensky told Danish parliamentarians.

According to the United Nations agency, 3.9 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the Russian invasion began last month. UNHCR said the daily outflow rate of refugees was 40,000 per day.

""There were no military ambitions in Mykolaiv, the people in Mykolaiv presented no threat to Russia. And even then, like all the Ukrainians, they became the targets for the Russian troops"", Zelensky said adding, ""seven people were killed, 22 were wounded, and people are still going through the rubble.""

Watch: Russia & Ukraine begin talks in Istanbul to stop fighting in Ukraine

Reports say Mariupol has been heavily bombarded by Russian forces in the past few weeks with water, electricity and food running low even as several thousand civilians remain trapped in the city. A Ukrainian official said at least 5,000 people have already died due to continued Russian shelling.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's negotiator said if the security guarantee system works out then Ukraine will agree to neutral status.

The negotiator said neutral status would include not having foreign military bases while adding that a referendum in Ukraine would be needed on terms of agreement with Russia.

""We want an international mechanism of security guarantees where guarantor countries will act in a similar way to NATO's article number five -- and even more firmly,"" David Arakhamia, a Ukrainian negotiator said.

Russian and Ukrainian negotiators began their talks in Istanbul at the Dolmabahce palace in Istanbul on Tuesday amid attacks in Ukraine even as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan who hosted the event urged ""an end to this tragedy"".

The Russian negotiator said ""meaningful"" talks were held with Ukraine officials.

Turkish foreign minister Mevlut said he was ""encouraged for a ceasefire as soon as possible"" while adding, ""We have seen that they have achieved some progress, they reached consensus.""

Russia's deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin said his forces are ready to scale down fighting near Kyiv and Chernihiv to create a conducive atmosphere for the dialogue process.

US to move troops and aircraft to Eastern Europe

US armed forces are moving aircraft and soldiers to Eastern Europe, Defense Department spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.

This includes a unit of around 200 marines which has been moved to Lithuania from Norway, Kirby said.

Ten F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets and a few C-130 Hercules transport planes, as well as some 200 associated soldiers, will be brought to Eastern Europe from the US. Kirby said that they would be moved shortly but that their precise destination remained unclear.

US says some Russian troops leaving Kyiv region

Following the announcement earlier on Tuesday that Russia would cut back on its military actions around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that the US believed some Russian troops had already left.

""Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yes, we think so. Small numbers,"" Kirby told reporters.

""But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over,"" he added.

Biden voices skepticism over Russia's pledge to cut activities

US President Joe Biden said he wasn't convinced that Russia's promise to cut back military operations around Kyiv will lead to a significant change in the conflict.

""We'll see if they follow through,"" he told reporters after holding a phone call with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

""There seems to be a consensus that let's just see what they have to offer.""

Russian negotiators pledged to scale back hostilities near Kyiv and the city of Chernihiv during talks with Ukraine in Turkey on Tuesday.

France says no Mariupol humanitarian mission possible 'at this stage'

The conditions for carrying out a humanitarian operation sought by France to help civilians in the besieged port city of Mariupol have not been met ""at this stage,"" French President Emmanuel Macron's office said.

The French leader spoke to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in a phone call on Tuesday.

Macron had outlined the mission sought alongside Turkey and Greece to Putin, who said ""he was going to think about it"" before responding, an Elysee Palace official said.

Mariupol has been one of the worst struck cities since the start of the Ukraine war with the local mayor saying it is now ""on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe.""

The Russian president also told Macron that Ukrainian ""nationalists"" in besieged Mariupol must lay down their arms.

""It was stressed that in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city (Mariupol), Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms,"" the Kremlin said in a statement about the call.

The two presidents also discussed Russia's decision to request payments in rubles for Russian gas supplies to the EU, the statement added.

Russia-backed Donetsk considers joining Russia

The head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic — a part of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014 — has said the region will consider joining Russia, according to the Donetsk News Agency.

""As for joining the Russian Federation, as for this wish and drive, they have been obvious since 2014 — the wish to be in Russia,"" Denis Pushilin said.

Moscow recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics on February 24, just days before Russian troops invaded Ukraine.

Pushilin's comments come two days after Russian-backed rebels in Luhansk said they may hold a referendum on joining Russia. Kyiv said such a move would not have legal basis and warned of an international response.

Snake Island soldier receives medal

The Ukrainian soldier, whose comments to a Russian warship went viral, has returned home.

Roman Hrybov was taken prisoner by Russian forces while he was serving on the so-called Snake Island (Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian), a small island in the Black Sea.

A recording of Hrybov telling a Russian warship to ""go f*** yourself"" went viral.

The Ukrainian troops stationed on the island were at first presumed to have been killed in an attack. It later turned out they had been taken captive and were exchanged for Russian prisoners.

The Ukrainian military shared a picture of the soldier receiving a medal on social media. They said he has returned to ""his native Cherkasy region.""

Russia files two cases against Google over banned content

Russia has filed two legal cases against Alphabet Inc, which owns Google, for failure to remove banned information from its YouTube video-sharing platform, the country's communication regulator said on Tuesday.

Roskomnadzor accused the tech giant of blatantly promoting false content about Russia's invasion, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation.""

It said YouTube had become one of the key platforms in the ""information war"" against Moscow.

The regulator added that Google could be fined up to 8 million rubles ($91,533; €82,500), or as much as 20% of the company's annual revenue in Russia for repeat offenses.

Russia has blocked Google News and restricted access to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram

US skeptical of Russian gestures

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken questioned the seriousness of Russia's claims of progress at the Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey on Tuesday.

""I've not seen anything to suggest that this is moving forward in an effective way because we have not seen signs of real seriousness"" from Russia, Blinken said during an official visit to Morocco.

""There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does. We're focussed on the latter,"" he added.

""If they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate ""only,"" in quotation marks, the eastern part of Ukraine and the southern part of Ukraine can succeed, then once again they are profoundly fooling themselves,"" CNN quoted Blinken as saying.

He once again called on Russia to end the fighting and said the Ukrainians were engaged in negotiations ""with a gun literally to their heads.""

UK calls for 'complete withdrawal' of Russian troops from Ukraine

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for a full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, his spokesperson said.

Asked about Russia's promise to scale back their armed forces around the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv, the spokesman said: ""We will judge [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words.""

""There has been some reduction in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, largely because Ukrainian forces have been successfully pushing back the Russian offensives in the northwest of the city,"" he told reporters.

""But fighting continues. There's heavy bombardment in Mariupol and other areas. So we don't want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.""

Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said the Netherlands has expelled 17 Russian ""intelligence officers"" who were ""undercover as diplomats.""

""These intelligence officers are a threat to the security of [the Netherlands],"" Hoekstra wrote on Twitter.

""Experience shows that Russia does not leave such measures unanswered. We cannot speculate on that, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared for various scenarios that may occur in the near future,"" he said in a statement.

Shortly after the Dutch announcement, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes said Belgium was also expelling 21 Russian diplomats for actions related to espionage or unlawful influence peddling.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney later said Ireland was expelling four Russian diplomats whose activities have not been ""in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behavior.""

Poland approves law to ban Russian coal imports

Polish government spokesman Piotr Muller said the Cabinet has adopted draft legislation that will allow a ban on imports of Russian coal.

""We don't want these imports to be possible any longer, although we realize that there's a risk related to the fact that the European Union has not approved such actions to date,"" Muller told reporters in Warsaw.

Generally, the whole EU has to agree on sanctions imposed in the bloc, and Brussels could potentially punish members states acting unilaterally.

Russian representatives not welcome at Buchenwald commemoration

German officials have told Russian and Belarusian diplomatic representatives that they are not welcome at the commemoration for the 77th anniversary of the liberation of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Nazi concentration camps.

""We have informed the consular representations in writing that they are not welcome at the events,"" director of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, Jens-Christian Wagner, said on Tuesday.

One reason for the move was the death of the 96-year-old Buchenwald camp survivor Boris Romanchenko.

Romanchenko, who had previously served as vice-president for the international committee of survivors for the two camps, was killed by Russian bombardments in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in mid-March.

The Nazi camps were liberated by US troops on April 11, 1945, shortly before the end of the Second World War.

Amnesty International accuses Russia of war crimes in Ukraine

Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of the human rights organization, told DW that Amnesty has been ""documenting an escalation of human rights and humanitarian law violations, including the indiscriminate or deliberate targeting of civilians.""

""Russia's crackdown on freedom of speech started before the aggression against Ukraine,"" Callamard said. She pointed to ""the shrinking space for independent media and dissenting voices,"" which she said goes back to at least 2021.

She added that disinformation and propaganda are part of the war, making it difficult to keep track of what is actually going on.

Callamard also insisted that ""the standards that are applied to … Ukrainian refugees are applied across the board to others.""

""As we speak right now, there are refugees stuck between Belarus and Poland who are denied entry into Poland,"" she added, saying that the failure to support those refugees mean that the west was ""losing a war of values.""

She added that as an outcome of the war, many countries will experience food shortages and skyrocketing prices, exacerbated by the failures of governments to ""build back better"" after the coronavirus pandemic. ""That is the betrayal of 2021,"" she told DW.

Russia-Ukraine talks conclude in Istanbul

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators concluded face-to-face peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, with the Ukrainian side saying that there have been enough developments to have a meeting between the presidents of the two countries.

Russia said the talks were ""constructive,"" raising hopes that there could be progress toward ending the war.

However, Russian top negotiator Medinsky said a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is possible only if a deal has been approved by the foreign ministries of both countries.

Following the talks, Ukrainian negotiators told reporters that Kyiv would agree to a neutral status if a security guarantee system is put in place. They said, under the new system, Israel, Poland, Canada and Turkey could be among Ukraine’s security guarantors.

The neutral status would include not hosting any foreign military bases on Ukrainian territory.

There needs to be full peace across Ukraine for any final agreement with Russia to come into force, the Ukrainian side stressed, adding that a referendum would be needed in Ukraine on the terms of any final deal.

They also proposed holding consultations with Russia on the status of Crimea.

The talks on Tuesday lasted around four hours with occasional breaks. It is unclear if the discussions will continue for a second day.

Russia says rules for gas payments in rubles will be ready in days

""No one will supply gas for free, it is simply impossible, and you can pay for it only in rubles,"" Peskov told reporters on Tuesday.

He added that ""all modalities are being developed so that this system is simple, understandable and feasible for respected European and international buyers.""

Peskov's remarks came a day after Germany said the G7 nations rejected Putin's demand to pay for Russian gas in rubles. Berlin said the demand was a breach of the pre-agreed terms and conditions.

Speaking via video link, Zelenskyy said of the Russian invasion that ""the brutality is more violent than what we have seen during World War II.""

The Ukrainian leader has so far made online speeches to lawmakers in several countries, including the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan, among others.

Russian rocket hits Mykolaiv government building

A Russian rocket strike on Tuesday destroyed a regional government building in the southern city of Mykolaiv, local authorities said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the missile strike killed at least seven people and wounded 22.

""We're clearing the rubble. Half the building was destroyed. My office was hit,"" local governor Vitaliy Kim said in a video statement.

Mykolaiv, a key port, has been under heavy assault for weeks, along with other southern port cities like Kherson and Mariupol.

Peace talks focusing on security guarantees, cease-fire, says Zelenskyy adviser

Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has said that the ongoing talks in Turkey between Ukraine and Russia are focusing on security guarantees for Ukraine and a cease-fire.

""Only with this agreement can we end the war in a way that Ukraine needs,"" he said. Podolyak added the two sides were also discussing alleged breaches of the rules of war.

Russia says the military's main task is now to 'liberate' Donbas

Russia's defense minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that Ukraine's military capacity had been seriously degraded, the Interfax news agency reported. ""The combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus the main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas.""

Shoigu's assertion came despite Ukraine's unexpectedly strong resistance since the war began last month, which has seen Russia fail to take any major cities, and stall in advancing along multiple fronts.

However, Shoigu reiterated statements made last week by officials that the Russian military had completed the main objective of the first phase of its invasion.

The minister also stressed the change in Russia's war aims, underlining that the main task of the Russian military is now to ""liberate"" Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, part of which has been under the control of Russian proxies since 2014.

Furthermore, he warned the West that Moscow will respond appropriately if NATO supplies fighter aircraft and air defense systems to Ukraine.

Russia resumes LNG exports through the Sea of Azov

Russia on Tuesday resumed exports of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) through the Sea of Azov, with a Comoros-flagged gas tanker expected to be loaded at the port of Temryuk, the port operator said.

The tanker, bound for the Bulgarian port of Burgas, would mark the first time since the start of Russia’s Ukraine invasion that LNG is exported through the waterway.

Russian authorities had banned ship movements in the region following the outbreak of the war.

IAEA chief in Ukraine to talk about nuclear safety

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has arrived in Ukraine to hold talks with senior officials on how to ensure the safety of the nation's nuclear facilities.

""The military conflict is putting Ukraine's nuclear power plants and other facilities with radioactive material in unprecedented danger,"" Mariano Grossi, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog said in a statement.

He added that ""there have already been several close calls. We can't afford to lose any more time.""

Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors at four active power plants, and also is home to the decommissioned Chernobyl plant, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster. Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl and of the largest active power plant, at Zaporizhzhia.

Ukraine says it's resuming evacuations from conflict-affected areas

Ukraine said Tuesday it was reopening humanitarian corridors and evacuating civilians from war-scarred regions after a one-day pause over what Kyiv called possible Russian ""provocations.""

""Three humanitarian corridors were agreed for today,"" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a video statement posted on Telegram, a day after announcing their closure citing intelligence reports.

US to deploy fighter jets to Germany to boost NATO posture

The United States is deploying six Navy EA-18G Growler aircraft to the Spangdahlem airbase in Germany to bolster NATO's defense posture, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said.

This is ""to bolster readiness and NATO's collective defense posture and further increase air integration capabilities with our Allied and partner nations,"" he said during a conference call.

Kirby stressed that the aircraft were not intended to be used against the Russian military in Ukraine, but were intended to strengthen NATO's eastern flank and serve as a deterrent against Russia.

Kirby added that some 240 Navy personnel, consisting of pilots and maintenance crew, will also be stationed to maintain the aircraft.

The aircraft, developed by the US firm Boeing, are used in electronic warfare to counter adversaries by offering tactical jamming capabilities besides offering land and naval defense.

Kirby stressed that the EA-18G Growler aircraft were intended to strengthen NATO's eastern flank and serve as a deterrent against Russia

Russia, Ukraine talks begin in Turkey

Talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators to end the conflict have started in Istanbul. Addressing the negotiators, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said both Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are ""valuable friends.""

""We have entered a time when talks need to yield concrete results,"" he stressed, calling for an immediate cease-fire.

""A fair peace will not have a loser and continuing the conflict benefits no one,"" he underlined.

US says Asia complying with Russia sanctions

The US has said Asian nations and firms are complying with export controls imposed on Russia by the West due to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Some companies are even ""self-sanctioning,"" Matthew Borman, US Commerce Department deputy assistant secretary for export administration, was quoted by Reuters as saying on Tuesday.

""The restrictions have been in place for roughly a month, a little bit over a month, and we certainly haven't seen any indication that there's non-compliance, in fact, we've seen the reverse,"" he said.

""I think there's also a fair amount of additional self-sanctioning, if you will, by multinational companies operating in Russia,"" the official added.

""We know that Russia is quite dependent upon foreign supplies for some key inputs like semiconductors so I think it will be relatively readily apparent if there is non-compliance and the task will be to trace that back to its origin.""

IAEA: Kharkiv nuclear facility intact despite shelling

The Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi said that the ""small amount of nuclear material"" at the Kharkiv nuclear research facility ""remained intact"" despite shelling.

In a statement, Grossi said, ""Ukraine said the building, its thermal insulation and the experimental hall were damaged, but the neutron source, that contains nuclear material used to generate neutrons for research and isotope production, was not.""

Australia announces first Magnitsky sanctions

Australia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Marise Payne announced the country's first Magnitsky-style sanctions.

The newest sanctions will target ""Russian individuals responsible for the corruption that Sergei Magnitsky uncovered and those complicit in his subsequent mistreatment and death.""

In a press release, the Australian government explained Magnitsky was ""a Ukrainian-born Russian lawyer and tax advisor,"" who ""uncovered widespread corruption by Russian tax and law enforcement officials. He was imprisoned and mistreated, and died in custody in November 2009, after being refused medical treatment.""

The Australian Foreign Ministry said, ""In this first tranche, the Government will honour Mr Magnitsky and all who defend the rule of law, with targeted sanctions and travel bans against 14 Russian individuals responsible for the serious corruption that he exposed and a further 25 Russian perpetrators and accomplices of his abuse and death.""

Zelenskyy: Situation tense despite some victories

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the situation remains tense despite some Ukrainian victories following Russia's invasion of his country on February 24.

Russian forces have been repelled from the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation published via his Telegram channel.

Zelenskyy said Russian forces are attempting to regroup amid heavy losses

However, fighting continues in Kyiv as well as in other parts of the country.

Russian troops remain in control of Kyiv's northern suburbs. The situation remains ""very difficult"" in the Chernihiv, Sumy, Donbass and southern regions.

Zelenskyy added that further tightening of sanctions on Russia to include oil supplies to Europe were only likely to take place if Russia makes use of chemical weapons in its war effort.

""There are no words for that,"" Zelenskyy said.

Summary of Monday's events in Ukraine-Russia crisis

Ukrainian and Russian delegations are due to meet in Istanbul on Tuesday.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he made separate calls to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin that were progressing in a ""positive direction.''

He did not give more detail but added that he would meet Ukrainian and Russian delegations ahead of their talks.

Ukraine's foreign minister Dmtryo Kuleba said a cease-fire was the most his country could hope for from the latest peace talks with Russia.

""The minimum program will be humanitarian questions, and the maximum program is reaching an agreement on a cease-fire,"" Kuleba said. ""We are not trading people, land or sovereignty.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia expected no breakthrough at the talks.

The Financial Times reports in exchange for giving up on its plan to join NATO, Ukraine will be free to join the EU.

Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning earlier this month after a meeting in Kyiv, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported.

The WSJ report said Abramovich, who accepted a Ukrainian request to help negotiate an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and at least two senior members of the Ukrainian team, were affected.

Ukrainian authorities said Russian missiles struck another fuel depot in the northwest of the country. More than 1,000 Russian mercenaries connected to the Wagner Group are deployed in eastern Ukraine, UK military intelligence said.

Russia's Novaya Gazeta newspaper said it would stop publishing until the war in Ukraine ends. The leading independent publication, edited by Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov, said it was taking the step after receiving a second warning from the media regulator Roskomnadzor.

If a media outlet receives two warnings from the communications regulator, a court can shut it down.

Meanwhile, the G7 rejected Russia's demand for gas payment in rubles.

ISTANBUL — Ukrainian negotiators in Turkey said Tuesday they had offered a detailed peace proposal to their Russian counterparts, exchanging military neutrality for security guarantees, as Moscow said it would “drastically reduce” military activity near the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv “to increase mutual trust and create the necessary conditions for further negotiations.”

The declarations signaled a rare moment of optimism nearly five weeks into the bloody invasion. But U.S. and other Western leaders were skeptical, saying they would judge Russia by its actions and not its words. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Russia’s movement of troops away from Kyiv appeared to be minimal, and numerous explosions were heard in the city Tuesday night.

“We’re not convinced that the threat to the capital city has been radically diminished,” Kirby said.

The centerpiece of the Ukrainian proposal was a pledge that the country would give up its bid to join NATO in exchange for a security system guaranteed by international partners including the United States, Turkey and others. Ukrainian negotiators likened the offer to Article 5 of NATO’s charter, which ensures the alliance’s collective defense.

The guarantor parties — including European countries, Canada and Israel — would provide Ukraine with military assistance and weapons if it were attacked, the negotiators said. Ukraine, in turn, would ensure it remained “nonaligned and nonnuclear,” although it would retain the right to join the European Union.

The Ukrainian proposal also offered a 15-year timeline for negotiations with Russia over the status of Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014.

Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey’s foreign minister, said the discussions amounted to “the most meaningful progress since the start of negotiations.” Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s lead negotiator, characterized the talks to reporters afterward as a “substantive conversation.” In separate comments, however, he left open the possibility of additional attacks in northern Ukraine.

“De-escalation in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions does not mean a cease-fire,” Medinsky said, according to Russia’s state-run Tass news agency. “There is still a long way to go to prepare an agreement between Russia and Ukraine on mutually acceptable terms. The Russian Federation will put forward counter-initiatives after studying Ukraine’s proposals.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said late Tuesday that news from the negotiations was “positive” but that Kyiv has “no reason to trust” Moscow’s claim that it will curtail its attacks. “These signals do not silence the explosion of Russian shells,” he said in his nightly video address.

The Kremlin also signaled it will keep fighting for Mariupol, a key southern port city, saying that unless “Ukrainian nationalist militants” stop resisting and lay down their arms, it will be difficult to “resolve the acute humanitarian situation” there.

Reaction from the United States was mixed, even as Moscow’s pledge to reduce military activity prompted a drop in oil prices and boosted U.S. stock markets.

President Biden, speaking at the White House, said that he and other world leaders were waiting to see what Russia does next, and would keep pressuring Moscow through economic sanctions and by sending aid to Ukraine.

“We’ll find out what they do, but, in the meantime, we’re going to keep strong the sanctions,” Biden said. “We’re going to continue to provide the Ukrainian military with the capacity to defend themselves, and we’re going to continue to keep a close eye on what’s going on.”

On March 29, President Biden said it remains to be seen whether Russia follows through with any actions to scale down its military operations in Ukraine. (Video: Reuters)

Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at a news conference with his Moroccan counterpart in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, said Russia’s brutal, month-old military offensive has left little room for optimism. “There is what Russia says and what Russia does,” he said. “We’re focused on the latter, and what Russia has been doing is the brutalization of Ukraine and its people.”

The governor of the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv said that the regional administration building was struck by a missile Tuesday morning, marking the largest Russian attack on the city’s downtown since the start of the war.

Mykolaiv, a city of about 500,000 some 70 miles from Odessa on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, has held the front line against Russian forces for weeks. The Ukrainian military’s stand there has delayed any plans for the strategic port of Odessa, which hasn’t faced a major attack since the start of the war.

Vitaliy Kim, the governor of the broader Mykolaiv region, shared a photo of the government building, where his office is located, on his Telegram channel. There was a large hole through the center of the structure. Rescue operations were ongoing, Kim said, but most people who work there already had been evacuated. Eight civilians and three soldiers were reported missing.

“They waited until people got to work to hit it,” Kim said on Telegram. “And I overslept.”

North of Kyiv, Ukrainian soldiers working in dusty trenches told a small group of visiting reporters that there had been shelling a few days earlier, but the area had been largely quiet for the previous two days. More than 95 percent of Irpin, a Kyiv suburb, is now under Ukrainian control, said Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrsky, the commander overseeing the defense of Kyiv.

Ukrainian forces have pushed toward the borders of the Chernihiv and Zhytomyr regions, north and west of Kyiv, he said. Chernihiv has come under intense Russian attack in recent weeks, with power largely cut off.

Ukrainian military officials said in a Facebook post that it appeared Russian troops north of Kyiv had pulled back north to Chernobyl and into Belarus to “restore combat capability.” The officials warned, however, that once Russia completes “the regrouping and strengthening of troops,” the actions against Kyiv could resume.

The Pentagon’s top officer overseeing U.S. troops in Europe, Gen. Tod D. Wolters, said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Tuesday that he could verify reports of Russian forces pulling back in the area around Kyiv. But at a briefing for reporters later in the day, Kirby suggested Russia was carrying out a repositioning, not a “real withdrawal.”

“No amount of spin can mask what the world has witnessed over the past month, and that’s the courage and the military prowess of Ukraine’s armed forces and its people, which are proving to be more than Russia bargained for in its unprovoked and unjustified invasion,” Kirby said.

The Pentagon is again adding U.S. troops in Eastern Europe, Kirby said, redeploying several hundred Marines who had just concluded a training exercise in Norway to Lithuania and possibly other countries. The group includes about 10 F/A-18 jets, C-130 cargo planes and other equipment, he added.

Before Tuesday’s talks, Russia and Ukraine had sought to temper expectations of a breakthrough, after previous talks failed to produce an agreement. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the delegations from Ukraine and Russia the he hoped the negotiations would lead to a cease-fire, saying “the whole world is waiting for benevolent and good news from you.”

Outside the palace, the international press corps, barred from the meeting hall, crowded on a narrow sidewalk, perching laptops on shrubbery and watching convoys roll in. Inside the hall, a sighting of Roman Abramovich, a Russian oligarch who faces sanctions in Europe, added to the intrigue: A day earlier, an associate of his said the oligarch suspected he was poisoned at a previous round of talks, along with members of the Ukrainian delegation.

The Kremlin denied any connection to the alleged incident, which has not been independently confirmed by The Washington Post. Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the allegation as “part of the information sabotage” of the West. But in comments to a Ukrainian news channel, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, advised anyone at the negotiations “not to eat or drink anything, and preferably avoid touching any surface.”

In comments to reporters, Ukrainian delegates said that any agreement struck with Moscow would be subject to a popular referendum. Some of the thorniest issues, including the status of Ukrainian regions occupied by Russia, would have to be worked out by Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, they said.

But Ukrainian negotiators suggested the day’s events had provided a possible path forward.

Oleksandr Chaly, a member of Ukraine’s delegation, said talks with Russia would continue in the next two weeks. Consultations have already begun with the guarantor countries, which could be invited to send representatives to the upcoming negotiations, he said.

After the Ukrainian and Russian leaders reached a “final agreement,” they would hold a multilateral conference where a deal would be signed, Chaly said.

Diplomacy faced new challenges elsewhere, as several European Union countries announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats.

Belgium expelled 21 Russian diplomats based in the embassy in Brussels and the consulate in Antwerp, the country’s Foreign Ministry said. The ministry said the individuals were working for Russian intelligence services.

The Netherlands expelled 17 Russian diplomats for allegedly using diplomatic cover to do intelligence work. Ireland said it had asked four Russian diplomats to leave, saying their conduct was not in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behavior.

Other critics contended the Kremlin’s statement represented a retreat by Russia as it continues to suffer serious losses and fail to make significant headway since its invasion of Ukraine last month.

Biden, asked at a briefing about Russia’s pledge at backing off key Ukrainian cities, replied, “We’ll see. I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.

“I had a meeting with the heads of state of four allies in NATO — France, Germany, the United States and Great Britain — and there seems to be a consensus that let’s just see what they have to offer,’’ the president said.

A Biden administration official later told CNN, “We believe any movement of Russian forces from around Kyiv is a redeployment, not a withdrawal, and the world should be prepared for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine.

“It also does not mean the threat to Kyiv is over,” the official warned. “Russia has failed in its objective of capturing Kyiv and failed in its objective of subjugating all of Ukraine, but it can still inflict massive brutality on the country, including Kyiv.”

Earlier in the day, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin had announced, “Given that the talks on the preparation of an agreement on the neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine have moved into a practical field … a decision has been made to radically, by several times, reduce the military activity in the areas of Kyiv and Chernihiv.’’

The Kremlin official said the pledge was meant “to increase trust.” But some military analysts described the move as a relatively empty gesture, given that Russia has failed to take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, which it had reportedly expected to swiftly do.

Russian despot Vladimir Putin’s forces also have struggled to make headway in many other regions, to the point where the Kremlin said Friday it was considering limiting its invasion to the Donbas region in the east.

“Does ‘we’ll drastically reduce military operations around Kyiv’ = ‘we’re getting our ass kicked, transitioned to a hasty defense?’” tweeted retired US Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a former commander of American forces in Europe.

Lawrence Freedman, an emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College in London, was more blunt.

“Add to dictionary of military euphemisms,” he tweeted. “De-escalation = retreat.”

Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed doubts about Russia’s professed dedication to the peace process, too.

“There is what Russia says, and there is what Russia does. We’re focused on the latter,” Blinken said at a press conference.

Ukrainian TV noted that the latest round of peace talks in Istanbul, Turkey, this week began with “a cold welcome” and no handshake — as Russian missiles continued to batter several Ukraine cities.

Russian invasion of Ukraine as of March 24, 2022.

Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was seen at the talks — a day after reports emerged that he was poisoned while serving as a go-between during earlier mediations.

The poisoning was believed to have been the work of Kremlin hardliners opposed to any negotiated settlement with Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal has reported.

Abramovich — the billionaire owner of UK Club World Cup soccer champions Chelsea — was reportedly poisoned alongside several Ukrainian delegates, all suffering peeling skin on their faces and hands, constant and painful tearing, and red eyes after a meeting in Kyiv earlier this month.

The Kremlin confirmed that Putin’s longtime ally has been playing an unofficial mediating role.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Abramovich has been “ensuring certain contacts between the Russian and Ukrainian sides” and that his role was approved by both countries.

Peskov denied the reported poisoning, calling the allegations part of an “information war.”

Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, claimed Tuesday that Ukraine and Russia had made “the most meaningful progress” yet in terms of potential peace.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told both camps that they had a “historic responsibility” to stop the hostilities.

“We believe that there will be no losers in a just peace. Prolonging the conflict is not in anyone’s interest,” Erdogan said as he greeted the two delegations.

The talks came as:

Air-raid sirens sounded before dawn across Ukraine, and a missile struck an oil depot in the western Rivne region overnight, the second attack on oil facilities in an area that had been spared the worst of the fighting.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was reportedly holed up in a nuclear bunker in the Ural Mountains, according to investigative outlet Bellingcat, which tracked the flight records of Russian elites. The Kremlin denied the suggestion, according to the Financial Times.

It surfaced that notorious, Prada-wearing, alleged Chechen war criminal Ramzam Kadyrov was promoted to lieutenant general in the Russian army — and dispatched to the besieged Ukraine city of Mariupol to try to shore up flailing Russian troops, according to reports.

Several European nations announced that they were expelling Russian intelligence agents working under diplomatic cover. The Netherlands booted 17 Russians, Belgium threw out 21, and Ireland sent four alleged spies packing. The Czech Republic gave one Russian diplomat 72 hours to leave the country.

On Tuesday morning, an explosion hit an administration center in Mykolaiv — blasting a gaping hole in the nine-story building, killing 12 and injuring 33, according to CNN. Regional Gov. Vitaliy Kim said most people escaped the building and that rescuers were searching for a handful of missing people.

“It’s terrible. They waited for people to go to work” before striking the building, he said. “I overslept. I’m lucky.”

Ukraine’s military said it had noted Russian withdrawals around Kyiv and Chernihiv, though the Pentagon said it could not corroborate the reports. Ukrainian forces said they have made gains in resisting Russian troops in the Kyiv suburbs in recent days, retaking the city of Irpin as well as towns in the nation’s northeast.

The Ukrainian negotiators said they had proposed a status under which the country would not join alliances or host bases of foreign forces but would have its security guaranteed by several other countries in terms similar to “Article 5,” NATO’s collective-defense clause. The clause means an attack on one member represents an attack on all.

Ukraine named Israel and NATO members Canada, Poland and Turkey as countries that could help provide such guarantees to help protect it.

The proposals would include a 15-year consultation period on the status of Russian-annexed Crimea and could come into force only in the event of a complete ceasefire, the Ukrainian officials told reporters in Turkey.

Ukraine’s proposals were the most detailed and concrete that Kyiv has announced publicly since Russia launched its invasion Feb. 24.

“If we manage to consolidate these key provisions, and for us this is the most fundamental, then Ukraine will be in a position to actually fix its current status as a non-bloc and non-nuclear state in the form of permanent neutrality,” Ukrainian negotiator Oleksander Chaly said.

“We will not host foreign military bases on our territory, as well as deploy military contingents on our territory, and we will not enter into military-political alliances,” he said, adding that military exercises would take place with the consent of the guarantor countries.

The Ukrainian officials said there was enough material in their proposals to warrant a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin.

Before the latest talks, Zelensky said his country was prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, and was open to compromise over the contested eastern region of Donbas.

More than a month into the war, the biggest attack on a European nation since World War II, more than 4 million people have fled abroad.

Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have also been killed, with officials in the hardest-hit city of Mariupol claiming at least 5,000 people — including about 210 children — have died there alone from the fighting.

Western intelligence believes Putin’s ground forces have become bogged down because of the stronger-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, combined with Russian tactical missteps, poor morale, shortages of food, fuel and cold weather gear and other problems.

But Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu insisted Russia had largely completed the first phase of its so-called “special “special operation” and had degraded Ukraine’s military capabilities.

It is unclear whether the negotiations will continue the next day.The Associated Press quoted Ukraine's military as saying it had noted Russian troops' withdrawals around Kiev and Chernihiv.Turkey said Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers were expected to meet in the next phase to set a mutual understanding and set the stage for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Medinsky said after the talks that Russia suggested a meeting between Putin and Zelensky could be arranged concurrently with the initialing of a bilateral treaty by the two countries' foreign ministers, according to TASS.Yang Jin, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European, and Central Asian Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that the words of Ukrainian and Russian negotiators, as well as the latest remarks from officials and diplomats on both sides, demonstrated both parties have a strong will and urgency to resort to a political solution.Russia has now concentrated its troops in the Donbass region and Yang predicted that in the next phase, Russia will seek to solve the conflict mainly through political channels with a military method as a supplement.Ukraine, after suffering enormous losses, also understood pledges NATO and the US made were unreliable and their assistance was far from enough to enable Ukraine to confront Russia, Yang said.In a Sunday interview, President Zelensky said Ukraine was carefully considering ""neutrality"" as long as third parties can provide security guarantees for Ukraine, stressing ""sovereignty and territories are priorities"" in the talks.The latest progress of the Russia-Ukraine talks has surprised some observers to some extent, but Chinese analysts also said a final ceasefire is too ambitious a goal to achieve, and they remain cautious since the matter about sovereignty is the most difficult part.Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""Since Zelensky's remark of neutrality and non-nuclear status for Ukraine is based on sovereignty and territorial integrity, that would mean Russia's withdrawal from the Donbass region, including Lugansk and Donetsk, which Russia had recognized as independent states.""A compromise about the sovereignty matter on either side is unlikely in the near future, Cui said, citing the US and the EU's new round of sanctions on Russia.During US President Joe Biden's Europe visit, the two sides agreed on a deal on liquefied natural gas (LNG) amid a new round of sanctions mainly on Russian energy, despite the hefty bills for the EU.Financial Times, citing four individuals briefed on the discussions, said the draft ceasefire document did not include three of Russia's initial core demands - ""denazification,"" ""demilitarization,"" and legal protection for the Russian language in Ukraine.A significant progress can only be made when there is an arrangement for the status of Lugansk and Donetsk that both sides can accept, Cui said.Yang said there is a lot of work to be done on how the neutrality of Ukraine will be realized, which country will be the third-party guarantor, and what kind of mechanism will be established to ensure Ukrainian security.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202203/1257144.shtml
