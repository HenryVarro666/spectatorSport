Lt. Col. Azatbek Omurbekov, thought to be around 40, was first identified by InformNapalm, a Ukrainian volunteer group that monitors Russia’s military and special services.

It shared his home address as well as email and telephone number, calling him the “military villain” behind the massacre in Bucha, the suburb of Kyiv where bodies have been left strewn in the street or thrown into mass graves.

The group IDed Omurbekov as leading the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, which the war-torn nation’s Ministry of Defense also blamed online for “committing war crimes” in Bucha.

The decorated military leader was blessed by an Orthodox priest in November, ahead of his deployment to Ukraine, according to the Times of London, which noted his “Butcher of Bucha” nickname.

“History shows that we fight most of our battles with our souls,” Omurbekov reportedly said following the service, which was led by the bishop of Khabarovsk.

“Weapons are not the most important thing. The church is a place where we can take Communion and prepare for the coming events,” he said at the time, according to the UK Times.

“With the blessing of the Almighty, we hope to achieve the same things that our forebears achieved.”

Omurbekov was previously also awarded a medal for outstanding service in 2014 by Dmitry Bulgakov, the deputy Russian defense minister, the UK paper said.

Ukraine’s defense ministry also printed a list of suspected members of the Russian death squad, vowing that “all war criminals will be prosecuted for crimes against the civilians of Ukraine.”

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, addressing the UN Security Council on Tuesday, called for officers to be held accountable in war crime prosecutions “similar to the Nuremberg tribunals” which followed World War II.

“The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes in Ukraine,” he said.

“Anyone who has given criminal orders, or carried them out by killing our people, will be brought before a tribunal.”

The Nuremberg trials in Germany, along with the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in Japan, tried and found guilty numerous military leaders accused of war crimes during the second world war.

Zelensky noted that Nazi political leaders had also been held accountable.

“I would like to remind Russian diplomats that men like von Ribbentrop did not escape punishment; Adolf Eichmann also did not go unpunished,” he said. Both were executed for their roles in enabling the Holocaust.

The harrowing scenes of bodies littering Bucha have sparked the greatest condemnation in more than a month of war, with several Western leaders joining Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in calling it genocide.

Zelensky fought back tears as he toured the Kyiv suburb Monday, and highlighted it during his powerful speech to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, accusing Russia of committing “the most terrible war crimes” since World War II.

“These are war crimes, and this will be recognized by the world as genocide,” Zelensky said in Bucha on Monday, adding Russian troops “treated people worse than animals.”

Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov called the Russian troops in Bucha “utterly inhuman” and compared them to Nazis, the UK Times noted.

“This is what the SS troops used to do in the past,” he said. “This evil simply cannot go unpunished. Our intelligence is consistently identifying all invaders and killers. All of them! And each killer will at his own time get what he deserves.”

Despite mounting evidence, Russia continued on Tuesday to deny the massacre, accusing Ukraine of staging the scenes as propaganda to escalate opposition to invading forces.

The Kremlin initially claimed it could not have been Russian forces because they had left Bucha at the end of last month.

However, satellite images released Tuesday showed bodies clearly strewn in the streets as early as March 18, when Russian forces were still there — and meaning some have been there for weeks.

Many of the dead still remain in black bags in 45-foot-long trenches dug as mass graves.

“We brought people here from the streets because the dogs were trying to eat the bodies,” local priest Andriy Holovin told the Telegraph.",https://nypost.com/2022/04/05/ukraine-activists-say-they-idd-azatbek-omurbekov-as-butcher-of-bucha/

According to their intelligence, Omurbekov is the leader of the 64th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, which the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence has claimed online is responsible for committing war crimes’ in Bucha.

According to The Times, Omurbekov was blessed by a Russian Orthodox priest in November before he was deployed in Ukraine early this year.

Russia continues to deny the massacre, alleging that Ukraine has staged the scenes in order to increase opposition to invading forces.",https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/ukrainian-activists-say-they-have-identified-butcher-of-bucha-20220406
4,58f13c02-4fa0-4d58-b443-5c023f9909b7,[],,"In an impassioned address to the Security Council today detailing the death and destruction caused by Russian forces in Moscow’s war against Ukraine, the President of that country challenged members to uphold international law or disband the United Nations, calling for the convening of a global conference in Kyiv to determine how to reform the world security system.

The Council also heard briefings from the Secretary-General and two other senior United Nations officials on the political and humanitarian situations in Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking via videoconference, said that the most terrible war crimes since the Second World War are being committed in his country. Likening their actions to those of Da’esh, he said Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities, creating mass starvation, shooting columns of civilians trying to escape hostilities, blowing up shelters and creating conditions in their temporarily occupied territories to ensure that most civilians are killed. The massacre in Bucha is only one of many examples of what the occupiers have perpetrated for 41 days, in Mariupol, Kharviv and dozens of other communities. Hatred by the aggressor is supported at the State level and exported through a system of propaganda, seeking to provoke a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa, Asia and elsewhere, he added, stressing that the security which the Council must guarantee simply “is not there”.

Emphasizing that the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, especially Article I — to maintain international peace and security — are being violated, he asked: “What is the point of all other Articles? […] Are you ready to close the United Nations? Do you think that the time for international law is gone?” If not, “you need to act immediately”. To support peace in Ukraine, the Council must either remove the Russian Federation from the organ as an aggressor and source of war, so it cannot block decisions made about its own war, or the Council can “dissolve yourselves altogether” if there is nothing it can do other than engage in conversation. “Ukraine needs peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace,” he insisted.

The Charter must be immediately restored and the system reformed so that the veto power does not represent the right to die, and so there is fair representation in the Council of all world regions, he said. If tyranny in places from Syria to Somalia had received a response, it would have ceased to exist, and an “honest peace” would have prevailed. A war against Ukrainian citizens would not have been launched. Instead, the world watched, and turned its eyes away from the occupation of Crimea, the war against Georgia, the taking of Transnistria from the Republic of Moldova and the preparations of Russian troops for another war near the border. The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice and charged with war crimes in Ukraine, before a tribunal similar to the one created in Nuremburg.

He then proposed the convening of a global conference in Kyiv to determine how to reform the world security system, establish guarantees for the recognition of borders and the integrity of countries, and to assert the rule of international law. Stressing that the laws set in 1945 in San Francisco for the creation of a global security organization will remain elusive without reforms, he said “we must do everything within our power to pass on to the next generation an effective United Nations”, with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and force aggressors to peace. For its part, Ukraine stands ready to provide a platform for an office of a newly updated security system, he said, proposing the creation of a “U24 office” specializing in preventive measures to maintain peace.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres described the war in Ukraine as one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order and the global peace architecture, because of its nature, intensity and consequences. “We are dealing with the full-fledged invasion, on several fronts, of one Member State of the United Nations, Ukraine, by another, the Russian Federation — a permanent member of the Security Council — in violation of the United Nations Charter, and with several aims, including redrawing the internationally recognized borders between the two countries,” he said.

The Russian offensive has also led to massive displacement and increases in the prices of food, energy and fertilizers; disrupted supply chains; and put more pressure on many developing countries that were already on the verge of debt collapse. “For all these reasons, it is more urgent by the day to silence the guns,” he emphasized, noting that he had asked the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, to travel to the Russian Federation and Ukraine to press for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire.

Mr. Griffiths, also Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, addressing the Council via videoconference from Geneva, recounted his recent trip to Moscow, noting that the Secretary-General had charged him with bringing both sides together to explore specific and sustained ways to reduce suffering. On 4 April, during “long and frank” exchanges with Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey V. Lavrov and his Deputy, Sergey V. Vershinin, and separately with the Deputy Minister for Defence, he discussed humanitarian convoys, including the four which have already been able to move. He outlined possibilities for building on this cooperation, sharing suggestions for mutually agreed upon military freezes to allow for evacuations of civilians and for the safe passage of life-saving aid.

While his counterparts assured him of their intent to carefully study these ideas, he said he came away from these meetings believing that “we have a long road ahead of us — but it must be travelled, and we will travel it”. He expressed hope of traveling to Ukraine on 7 April to lead discussions with senior Government officials on these same issues, and to see first-hand the humanitarian response. Updating the Council on the situation on the ground, he said that, over the last six weeks, at least 1,430 people have been killed, among them over 121 children — figures which are likely a “serious underestimate”. Homes, bridges, hospitals and schools have been damaged and destroyed, while almost 11 million people have been forced to flee — more than 4.2 million of whom are now refugees in neighbouring countries and beyond. In total, over a quarter of Ukraine’s population has fled.

Rosemary Dicarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, noting that the number of civilians killed has more than doubled since her 17 March briefing, said: “The devastation wrought on Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities is one of the shameful hallmarks of this senseless war.” The war is also threatening Ukraine’s future, with early assessment projections by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) suggesting that, if the war continues through 2022, 18 years of hard-won socioeconomic gains in Ukraine could be rolled back. While there has been a reported reduction of Russian troops and attacks around Kyiv and Chernihiv, such moves should not be merely tactical, repositioning forces for renewed attacks, she said, pointing out that the General Assembly has twice called for Russian forces to fully withdraw from Ukrainian territory and cease all military operations.

Diplomatic efforts to end the war, including direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives, have continued, she said, commending Turkey for hosting these discussions, as well as the efforts of many others engaging with the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Welcoming the willingness for continued engagement to reach a mutual understanding, she said this requires good faith and earnest efforts, stressing: “Any progress in the negotiations should be translated quickly into action on the ground.”

In the ensuing discussion, most Council members expressed shock at the images of corpses coming out of Bucha while the Russian Federation’s representative argued that those images are fake and were staged.

The representative of the United States said that the heart-wrenching stories that will never get to be heard are the ones of those in the images from Bucha. Based on available data, her delegation determined that the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine. Describing how the Russian Federation is sending Ukrainians to its “filtration camps”, she condemned Moscow’s literal disrespect for human rights. The United States seeks suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council as that country uses its membership as a platform for its propaganda.

Albania’s representative, also backing the call for the Russian Federation’s suspension from the Human Rights Council and noting this is the fourteenth meeting on Ukraine since 31 January, said the Russian Federation’s imperial dreams have gone nowhere. Kyiv has proved “too hard to swallow”. Describing Bucha as “an open-air graveyard”, he said it is impossible to convince anyone that the destroyed tanks cluttering the roads or the civilians killed in arbitrary executions are staged scenes. “You may muzzle media back home, but you cannot fool satellite images,” he said. “These are facts, hard and sickening proof of the atrocities committed.” The Russian Federation has cancelled itself from international law, “but the law will pursue it”, he assured, deploring that the Russian Federation has become the world’s most sanctioned country in history and an international pariah to the point it is forced to seek support from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria.

Likewise, the Head of the European Union delegation, in its capacity as observer, welcomed the International Court of Justice’s provisional steps ordering Moscow to immediately suspend military operations, as well as the International Criminal Court Prosecutor’s investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the work of the independent Commission of Inquiry. He described the European Union’s assistance to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General in the collection and preservation of evidence of war crimes, assuring: “It is clear, there will be accountability.” The bloc has adopted sanctions against Moscow, its financial and defence sectors and those individuals enabling and financing the aggression.

The Russian Federation’s representative retorted that Ukraine’s President is laying blame at the feet of the Russian military, criminally staging events when, in fact, Ukrainian civilians were killed by their own radicals. As it turns out, Russian forces should not have withdrawn from Bucha. Describing flagrant inconsistencies being promoted by Ukraine and the Western media, he cited recordings of Ukrainian radicals shooting civilians. To the video presented by the Ukraine delegation to the Council, he responded that the corpses “in no way” resemble those who reportedly had been on the ground for four days.

The only dilatants who could fall for this fake are Western countries, who, in fact, do not care about Ukraine, he said, imploring Ukraine’s President to recognize that his country is only a pawn in the geopolitical game against the Russian Federation. President Zelenskyy should find a solution, because “we came to Ukraine to bring long-awaited peace to the blood-soaked land of Donbas”. He called for cutting out the malignant Nazi tumour that is consuming Ukraine and would, in time, consume the Russian Federation, urging Mr. Zelenskyy not to allow the West to achieve its goals.

China’s delegate said that the disturbing images from Bucha must be verified before jumping to conclusions and accusations. Citing the negative impact of sanctions against the Russian Federation on developing countries, he said such measures are not effective and only expedite the spillover effects. Indiscriminate sanctions are tantamount to weaponizing the world economy, he pointed out, adding that smaller countries should not be caught between the great Powers and must not be forced to take sides. He urged the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members to engage with the Russian Federation head-on to establish a balanced, effective and sustainable security framework in the region. Beijing will play a constructive and responsible role in that regard.

Kenya’s representative recounted that, in April 1994, even as genocide engulfed Rwanda, there were members of the Council contesting the horrifying truth that a million people were being murdered. “We should stand warned that the inability of the Council to establish the facts and attribute responsibility may enable the risk of escalation into far worse crimes,” he stressed.

In a similar vein, Brazil’s delegate warned against the Council becoming “a bystander of the shocking consequences of the conflict”. So far, the organ is failing in its role to foster a constructive dialogue between the parties, with the aim of brokering an effective peace settlement to this conflict. “We deeply regret that the Security Council has not been able to speak with one voice throughout this crisis,” he said.

The United Arab Emirates’ delegate urged the Council not to forget the impact of war on a nation’s cultural heritage and identity, expressing concern over the dozens of cultural sites that have been damaged and calling on all sides to refrain from such wilful destruction. She also expressed alarm over how the war is affecting the 1.2 billion people in 47 developing countries who are at risk due to rising food prices and looked forward to efforts by the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance.

Also speaking today were the representatives of Gabon, Ireland, Mexico, India, France, Norway, Ghana and the United Kingdom.

The meeting began at 10:05 a.m. and ended at 1:10 p.m.

Letter Dated 3 April from Russian Federation Requesting Meeting on 4 April

VASSILY A. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) asked about his delegation’s two requests to convene a meeting on 4 April in connection with the horrific provocation by Ukrainian forces in Bucha. The United Kingdom’s delegation, as Council President, considered it was possible to “blatantly violate” the Council’s rules, marking the second time it issued a decision that was not coordinated with anyone. “This is an outrageous situation,” he stressed, asking the United Kingdom on what basis it decided it could act in such a manner, in contravention of existing norms and rules, and stressing that it should have instead convened a meeting and addressed the advisability of his delegation’s request through a vote. He pointed out that during its Council Presidency, the Russian Federation did not refuse any of the six meetings on Ukraine. He demanded an explanation for the decision and expressed hope the United Kingdom would not challenge any future requests.

BARBARA WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ) clarified that her delegation, as Council President, did not in fact reject the Russian Federation’s request. It had indeed received the letter on 3 April requesting the meeting and, in line with the obligation of the Presidency to schedule a meeting, proposed to either schedule it alongside today’s meeting — which is well within the 48-hour limit, the convention — or to hold the meetings sequentially. The Russian Federation turned down both proposals. Her delegation shares the view this is an urgent situation, and it offered either to hold a separate meeting today, or to combine a meeting with the current one. She noted that the presidency made its decisions in line with the Council’s provisional rules of procedure and that it had received no other complaints from Council members.

Mr. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) replied that his delegation has evidence that “this was no less than 24 hours before” the meeting that it had requested. “This is confirmed in documents,” he said, nonetheless expressing hope that her comments reflect the fact that the presidency will not refuse Member State requests for meetings.

Ms. WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ) noted that her delegation, as Council President, will not refuse to hold meetings in the future.

Briefings

ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, said that the war in Ukraine is one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order and the global peace architecture, founded on the Charter of the United Nations, because of its nature, intensity and consequences. “We are dealing with the full-fledged invasion, on several fronts, of one Member State of the United Nations, Ukraine, by another, the Russian Federation — a permanent member of the Security Council — in violation of the United Nations Charter, and with several aims, including redrawing the internationally recognized borders between the two countries,” he said. He said he will never forget the horrifying images of civilians killed in Bucha and had immediately called for an independent investigation to guarantee effective accountability. He was also deeply shocked by the personal testimony of rapes and sexual violence that are now emerging. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has spoken of possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law.

The Russian offensive has also led to massive displacement and increases in the prices of food, energy and fertilizers; disrupted supply chains; and put more pressure on many developing countries that were already on the verge of debt collapse. “For all these reasons, it is more urgent by the day to silence the guns,” he emphasized, noting that he had asked the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, to travel to the Russian Federation and Ukraine to press for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire. But as Secretary-General of the United Nations, it is his duty to call the attention of the Council to the serious damage being done to the global economy, and particularly to vulnerable people and developing countries, he stressed. United Nations analysis indicates that 74 developing countries, with a total population of 1.2 billion people, are particularly vulnerable to spiking food, energy and fertilizer costs. Debt obligations take up some 16 per cent of developing countries’ export earnings. In small island developing States, the figure is 34 per cent and rising.

Some countries are moving from vulnerability into crisis, and signs of serious social unrest are emerging, as the flames of conflict are fuelled by inequality, deprivation and underfunding. “With all the warning signals flashing red, we have a duty to act,” he said, noting that the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance he set up in March has made some initial recommendations for the consideration of Member States, international financial institutions and others. He urged all countries to keep markets open, resist unjustified and unnecessary export restrictions, and make reserves available to countries at risk of hunger and famine. “This is not the time for protectionism. Humanitarian appeals must be fully funded,” he said, stressing: “People caught up in crisis around the world cannot pay the price for this war.” While the use of strategic energy stockpiles and additional reserves could help to ease the energy crisis in the short term, the only medium- and long-term solution is to expedite the deployment of renewable energy, which is not impacted by market fluctuations.

“The war in Ukraine must stop — now,” he said, stressing the need for serious peace negotiations, based on Charter principles. Expressing deep regret over the divisions that have prevented the Council from acting not only on Ukraine, but also on other threats to peace and security around the world, he urged the Council to do everything in its power to end the Ukraine war and to mitigate its impact, both on the suffering people of Ukraine and on vulnerable people and developing countries worldwide.

ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said that the security situation in Ukraine has seriously deteriorated since her 17 March briefing. The number of Ukrainian civilians killed has more than doubled; Ukrainian cities continue to be mercilessly pounded, often indiscriminately, by heavy artillery and aerial bombardments; and hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in encircled areas under nightmarish conditions. “The devastation wrought on Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities is one of the shameful hallmarks of this senseless war,” she said. The horror deepened this past weekend, as shocking images emerged of dead civilians, some with hands bound, lying in the streets of Bucha, the town near Kyiv formerly held by Russian forces. Many bodies were also found in a mass grave in the same locality. Reports by non-governmental organizations and media also allege summary executions of civilians, rape and looting in the Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions.

Diplomatic efforts to end the war, including direct talks between Ukrainian and Russian representatives, have continued, she said, commending Turkey for hosting these discussions, as well as the efforts of many others engaging with the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Welcoming the willingness for continued engagement to reach a mutual understanding, she said this requires good faith and earnest efforts, stressing: “Any progress in the negotiations should be translated quickly into action on the ground.”

While there has been a reported reduction of Russian troops and attacks around Kyiv and Chernihiv, such moves should not be merely tactical, repositioning forces for renewed attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns, she said, pointing out that the General Assembly has twice called for Russian forces to fully withdraw from Ukrainian territory and cease all military operations. Noting the reported withdrawal of Russian forces from around the Chernobyl nuclear site, she said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports that this will hopefully allow it to conduct an assistance and support mission to provide technical advice and to deliver equipment, where necessary, as soon as possible. All Ukraine nuclear sites must be fully protected and secured, and military operations in or around these locations must be avoided.

Expressing grave concern over the persistent use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area in or near populated areas, she said such weapons are causing most civilian casualties, as well as massive destruction of civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings, hospitals, schools, water stations and electricity systems. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has received credible allegations that Russian forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times. Allegations that Ukrainian forces have used such weapons are also being investigated. Emphasizing that indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes, she said: “The massive destruction of civilian objects and the high number of civilian casualties strongly indicate that the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution have not been sufficiently adhered to.”

As of 4 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a total of 85 attacks on health‑care facilities causing at least 72 fatalities and 43 injuries, she said. Seriously concerned about reported cases of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances of persons who have been vocal against the Russian invasion, she called for their immediate release. She also pointed to allegations of conflict-related sexual violence perpetrated by Russian forces, including gang rape and rapes in front of children. The United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine continues to seek to verify all these allegations, she said, noting disturbing videos depicting abuse of prisoners of war on both sides.

“The many credible allegations of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, from the areas recently retaken from Russian forces, must not go unanswered,” she said, supporting efforts to examine these allegations and gather evidence, and stressing the need for accountability and justice. Gravely concerned about the risk of human trafficking, as one quarter of Ukraine’s population is displaced, she said suspected and verified cases are surfacing in the surrounding countries, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

The war is also threatening Ukraine’s future, she said. Early assessment projections by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) suggest that, if the war continues through 2022, Ukraine faces the prospect of losing 18 years of socioeconomic progress. This would set the country — and the region — back decades and leave deep long-term social and economic fissures, she said, highlighting UNDP’s work to preserve Ukraine’s hard-won development gains, including helping the Government to sustain essential governance structures, basic services and livelihoods, such as through cash-based assistance. The war has damaged Europe’s security architecture; its economic repercussions are evident far from the battlefield, she said, warning that the longer the war continues, the greater the risk of it further weakening global peace and security institutions and mechanisms. “This war was started by choice. There is no inevitability to it or to the suffering it is causing,” she said, adding: “The United Nations is ready to do everything within its means to help bring it to an end.”

MARTIN GRIFFITHS, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, addressing the Council via videoconference from Geneva, said that, over the last six weeks, at least 1,430 people have been killed, among them over 121 children — figures which are likely a “serious underestimate”. Homes, bridges, hospitals and schools have been damaged and destroyed, while almost 11 million people have been forced to flee — more than 4.2 million of whom are now refugees in neighbouring countries and beyond. In total, over a quarter of Ukraine’s population has fled.

He said the ground and air offensives and counteroffensives are making life nearly impossible for civilians, with families, the elderly, women and children trapped by the fighting. For more than five weeks, the people of Mariupol have been caught up in fighting, while other cities — including Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv — remain cut off from essential goods and services. “Perilous conditions are hampering our efforts to access civilians — or for them to access us,” he stressed. “Civilians must be allowed to move to safer areas without the fear of attacks”. He called on all parties to protect civilians and allow impartial humanitarian organizations safe, rapid and unimpeded access to all civilians in need, wherever they are in Ukraine.

For its part, the Organization and its partners are making every effort to dramatically increase support, he said. Six thousand volunteers from the Ukraine Red Cross, together with those from local non-governmental organizations in eastern Ukraine, are working tirelessly to provide a lifeline to communities. The World Food Programme (WFP) meanwhile has reached more than 1.3 million people with cash and food assistance and plans to reach around 2.5 million people in this month. Health partners report more than 180 tons of medical supplies were delivered, with another 470 tons on the way, addressing the health needs of 6 million people.

He also announced that, after much effort, in the past day another convoy was dispatched from the humanitarian coordination hub in Dnipro to Severodonetsk — in the far east. “Today, food, winter clothing, non-food items, medicine and hygiene kits were offloaded to the Ukraine Red Cross and will reach the hands of those in most need in Severodonetsk,” he assured. Following notification to both parties, four convoys in total have provided critical support to people in some of the cities with ongoing fighting. Several more are planned. “While these are initial steps, it gives us a basis to now expand, taking our efforts to scale,” he said.

Reiterating his concern over the growing number of reports of human trafficking, sexual violence, exploitation and abuse in Ukraine and the region — many of which overwhelmingly impact displaced women and children — he said the United Nations is bolstering protection and gender-based‑violence services to provide specialized care for survivors. These services are being designed and carried out in collaboration with Ukrainian civil society organizations, he added.

He went on to recount his recent trip to Moscow, noting that the Secretary‑General had charged him with bringing both sides together to explore specific and sustained ways to reduce suffering, including by pursuing a humanitarian ceasefire. On 4 April, during “long and frank” exchanges with Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergey V. Lavrov and his Deputy, Sergey V. Vershinin, and separately with the Deputy Minister for Defence, he discussed humanitarian convoys, including the four which have already been able to move. He outlined possibilities for building on this cooperation, sharing suggestions for mutually agreed upon military freezes to allow for evacuations of civilians and for the safe passage of life-saving aid.

While his counterparts assured him of their intent to carefully study these ideas, he said he came away from these meetings believing that “we have a long road ahead of us — but it must be travelled, and we will travel it”. On 7 April, he expressed hope of traveling to Ukraine to lead discussions with senior Government officials on these same issues, and to see first-hand the humanitarian response.

On that point, he said the humanitarian response since February has been scaled up, allowing his team to meet the needs of 1.4 million people. Stressing that funding must not be diverted from other crises, he said conflict, climate shocks and COVID-19, compounded by soaring food and fuel costs, could push another 47 million people into severe food insecurity. The total number of people who will not know where their next meal comes, could be driven to 325 million — by far the highest in recent history and well over double what it was less than three years ago.

He closed by reminding the Council of what it already knows: “The world cannot afford this war.” He called on the Council — and all Member States with influence — to support the pursuit of peace and alleviation of humanitarian suffering, for the sake of the people of Ukraine and those around the world who cannot afford to bear the burden this war will impose on them.

Statements

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, President of Ukraine , briefing the Council via videoconference, said he had returned from Bucha on 4 April, an area newly liberated from Russian troops. Stressing that “there is not a single crime they would not commit there”, he recounted how they sought and purposely killed anyone who served Ukraine, including women outside their houses, and then burned the bodies. Addressing the Council today in honour of the deceased, those who were shot in the head after being tortured and others who were thrown into wells, crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars, those whose limbs were cut off and tongues pulled out because the aggressors did not hear what they wanted to hear.

He said these actions are no different than those of Da’esh, except that they are being perpetrated by a member of the Security Council, one that is destroying borders and taking away the rights of countries that are self‑determined, in constant pursuit of a policy to destroy ethnic and religious diversity. Hatred by the aggressor is supported at the State level and exported through a system of propaganda, seeking to provoke a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa, Asia and elsewhere. He said the security which the Council must guarantee simply “is not there” and that the global institution established to prevent aggression “simply cannot work effectively”. While the world can now witness Russian military actions in Bucha, it has yet to see what those troops have done in other occupied Ukrainian cities. “Geography might be different, but cruelty is the same, crimes are the same,” he assured. “Accountability must be inevitable”.

He recalled Article I of the Charter of the United Nations, stating that the purpose of the United Nations is to maintain peace. With this foundational document being violated, starting with Article I: “What is the point of all other Articles?”, he asked, drawing attention to the most terrible war crimes being committed since the Second World War. Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities, deliberately creating mass starvation, shooting columns of civilians trying to escape hostilities, blowing up shelters and creating conditions in their temporarily occupied territories to ensure that most civilians are killed. The massacre in Bucha is only one of many examples of what the occupiers have perpetrated for 41 days in Mariupol, Kharviv and dozens of other communities.

The response by the Russian Federation is always the same, he said, most evidently on display after its downing of a Malaysian Airlines flight over Donbas or during the war in Syria: “They will blame everyone just to justify their own actions,” and offer different versions of events to obfuscate what is true, he said. They will say all videos are staged. However, it is 2022: There is evidence and satellite images. Full, transparent investigations can be conducted, maximum access can be granted for journalists and maximum cooperation extended with international institutions, with involvement by the International Criminal Court to establish truth and full accountability. “Every Member State of the United Nations should be interested in this,” he said, in order punish those who believe they can get away with anything.

He described Russian leaders as the colonizers of ancient times, who need Ukraine’s wealth and who have deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to their own country and abducted children. He accused the Russian Federation of wanting to “turn Ukrainians into silent slaves” and openly stealing everything, “starting with food and ending with gold earrings that are pulled out and covered with blood”. He warned that “we are dealing with a State that is turning the veto of the United Nations Security Council into the right to die”, undermining the global security architecture. If it continues, countries will rely only on the power of their own arms to ensure security, rather than international law and global institutions.

Going forward, he offered options. The United Nations can be simply closed. “Are you ready to close the United Nations? Do you think that the time for international law is gone?”, he asked. If not, “you need to act immediately”. The United Nations Charter must be immediately restored and the system reformed so that the veto does not represent the right to die, and so there is fair representation in the Council of all world regions. Determination is needed. The massacres from Syria to Somalia, from Afghanistan to Yemen and Libya should have been stopped long ago. If tyranny had received a response to the war it had waged, it would have ceased to exist, and an “honest peace” would have prevailed. A war against Ukrainian citizens would not have been launched.

Instead, the world watched, he said, and turned its eyes away from the occupation of Crimea, the war against Georgia, the taking of Transnistria from the Republic of Moldova and the preparations of Russian troops for another war near the border. The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice and charged with war crimes in Ukraine, brought before a tribunal similar to the one created in Nuremburg. Recalling that Holocaust organizer Adolf Eichmann did not go unpunished, he said “it is time to transform the United Nations”.

He proposed the convening of a global conference in Kyiv to determine how to reform the world security system, establish guarantees for the recognition of borders and the integrity of countries, and to assert the rule of international law. Stressing that the laws set in 1945 in San Francisco for the creation of a global security organization have not been achieved, and will remain elusive without reforms, he said “we must do everything within our power to pass on to the next generation an effective United Nations”, with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and force the aggressors to peace. “The power of peace must become dominant.”

For its part, Ukraine stands ready to provide a platform for an office of a newly updated security system. He proposed the creation of a “U24 office” that specializes in preventive measures to maintain peace and recalled his country’s evacuation of more than 1,000 people from Afghanistan at its own expense, taking in people of different nationalities and ethnic groups, without distinction. “We helped all of them,” he emphasized, conveying its moral right to propose reform of global security system.

Now, decisions are needed from the Security Council in support of peace in Ukraine, he said. He recommended either removing the Russian Federation as an aggressor and source of war, so it cannot block decisions made about its own war, and then exerting utmost efforts to establish peace. Or the Council can “dissolve yourselves altogether”, he said, urging its members to admit if there is nothing they can do other than engage in conversation. “Ukraine needs peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace,” he insisted. He then asked them to watch a video.

Ms. WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ), speaking in her national capacity, then thanked President Zelenskyy for his leadership in wartime and the extraordinary fortitude and bravery of the Ukrainian people during the unprovoked and illegal invasion.

LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD ( United States ) gave her own account of the refugee crisis in parts of Europe, noting that she returned last night from her trip to the Republic of Moldova and Romania. Behind bombed‑out buildings are destroyed lives, she said, telling the stories of three Ukrainians she spoke to. They are just a few among the more than 10 million people displaced, of whom about 4 million people left Ukraine, she stressed. Commending the “big heartedness” of the neighboring countries that host them, she said the United States has committed $1 billion in new humanitarian funding to support these refugees and is welcoming 100,000 refugees from Ukraine to her country. The heart-wrenching stories that will never get to be heard are the ones of those in the images coming out of Bucha. Based on available data, her delegation determined that the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine. Describing how the Russian Federation is sending Ukrainians to their “filtration camps”, she condemned Moscow’s literal disrespect for human rights. The United States seeks suspension of the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council. Moscow uses its membership in that organ as a platform for its propaganda. Recalling 141 Member States voted in the General Assembly against the Russian aggression, she said “now is the time to match those words with action”, she said.

FERIT HOXHA ( Albania ), describing the events described by President Zelenskyy as “revolting”, commended Ukrainians for their heroic resistance and resilience. “You have the world on your side,” he said. “Slavia Ukraine.” Noting that this is the fourteenth meeting on Ukraine since 31 January, he said the Russian Federation’s imperial dreams have gone nowhere. Kyiv has proved “too hard to swallow”. While the Russian army is in disarray, it has not stopped its shelling and bombardments, leaving behind unspeakable horrors and soul-crushing images: executions of people with a bullet in the neck, or with their hands tied behind their backs; people shot on their bicycles. There are images of mass graves and looted homes, acts that are usually only attributed to thugs. He described Bucha as “an open-air graveyard”, noting that, time and again, the Council has heard that the Russian Federation is not to blame. Yet, it is impossible to convince anyone that the destroyed tanks cluttering the roads or the civilians killed in arbitrary executions are staged scenes.

“You may muzzle media back home, but you cannot fool satellite images,” he said, or non-governmental organizations on the ground. “These are facts, hard and sickening proof of the atrocities committed.” These crimes, verified by Human Rights Watch, call for answers, investigations, accountability and justice. The Russian Federation has the obligation to abide by the laws of war, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions and its First Additional Protocol, and the International Court of Justice opinion that it must halt its military activities. The Russian Federation has cancelled itself from international law, “but the law will pursue it”, he assured. He expressed support for the call to suspend the Russian Federation from participating in the Human Rights Council, noting that it has blocked the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Mission in Ukraine, denying the international community of the eyes it needs there and leading to more war crimes and humanitarian disasters. Indeed, it is out-gunned and out-numbered by the Ukrainian resistance. It has become the world’s most sanctioned country in history and an international pariah to the point it is forced to seek support from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria.

EDWIGE KOUMBY MISSAMBO ( Gabon ) said that one day of war is one day too many. While the conflict is in its sixth week, the number of displaced people now exceeds the 10 million mark, including nearly 4 million refugees in neighbouring countries. This is a frightening humanitarian catastrophe, with transregional knock-on effects, she said. Expressing concern about reports of atrocities in Bucha, she stressed the urgent need for a United Nations to carry out an independent probe into the incidents. The Security Council should not lose sight of its responsibility to restore peace and security by offering an alternative to war. This war has gone on too long, she said, calling for a ceasefire, and the creation of the conditions for the safe, unfettered deployment of humanitarian aid to the populations in distress. Expressing her country’s appreciation to the neighbouring countries of Ukraine, she asked that the same welcome be granted to all people in distress without distinction of origin or of race, including African nationals and students.

Mr. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ) said the Emergency Relief Coordinator should know better than anyone the efforts being made by his country to organize humanitarian corridors. Without any participation from Ukraine, the Russian Federation saved 123,500 people in Mariupol. Over 600,000 have been evacuated to the Russian Federation since the special operation began. “We’re not talking about coercion or abduction,” he clarified, adding that their voluntary decisions are supported by videos on social media. To Ukraine’s President, he said: “We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military,” which are uncorroborated by eye-witnesses. Recalling the many hopes tied to the President’s election, as he had pledged an end to the war in Donbas and protection for its Russian-speaking inhabitants, he said “we were on the verge of correcting injustices” sparked by the events at Maidan in 2014. However, those hopes failed to materialize, as the President now calls people in Donetsk and Luhansk a subspecies, repeating remarks by his predecessor who said those people would “rot in their basements”. He accused the Ukrainian President of launching a linguistic inquisition against Russian speakers in the region, and being responsible for the explosions occurring across Ukraine “because there was, unfortunately, no other way to bring peace to the Donbas”.

He went on to blame Ukraine’s President for refusing to comply with the Minsk agreements. To claims that there are no Nazis in Ukraine, he retorted: “Not only are they there, they are running the show”, calling Ukraine’s national heroes Nazi collaborators, responsible for the killing of Russians, Ukrainians, Poles and Jews. While Ukraine’s President pretends not to acknowledge Ukrainian Nazis, they are often young people and “they’re not concealing it”, he said. They decorate their clothes with swastikas and give Nazi greetings to one another. There are many in the national battalions, including the Azov battalion. And they are not just killing Russian prisoners and soldiers; they are killing their own people, showing unrivalled cruelty by using civilians as human shields. Reading out testimonials about cruelty of Ukrainian nationals, including from a grandmother who said the Azov battalion did not allow her to leave her basement, and offering accounts of girls who were stripped naked and had their jewellery stolen, he went on to describe Ukrainians in Mariupol who since 25 February have taken up armed positions and fired against residential buildings. When asked why they were taking these actions, he said Ukrainian soldiers replied that they would do so until they destroyed the Russian spirit. It was the Donetsk people’s republic forces who helped one woman escape.

He accused Ukraine’s President of laying blame at the feet of the Russian military, criminally staging events when, in fact, Ukrainian civilians were killed by their own radicals. As it turns out, Russian forces should not have withdrawn from Bucha. Describing flagrant inconsistencies being promoted by Ukraine and the Western media, he cited recordings of Ukrainian radicals shooting civilians. To the video presented to the Council, he responded that the corpses “in no way” resemble those who reportedly had been on the ground for four days. The only dilatants who could fall for this fake are Western countries, who in fact do not care about Ukraine. He implored Ukraine’s President to recognize that his country is only a pawn in the geopolitical game against the Russian Federation and questioned how people could sink to such depths of cruelty, notably laid bare by the Azov battalion. He expressed hope President Zelenskyy would find a solution, because “we came to Ukraine to bring long‑awaited peace to the blood-soaked land of Donbas”. He called for cutting out the malignant Nazi tumour that is consuming Ukraine and would, in time, consume the Russian Federation, urging President Zelenskyy not to allow the West to achieve its goals. He must make decisions that are right for his country.

GERALDINE BYRNE NASON ( Ireland ) stressed that the world has witnessed a level of destruction not seen in Europe in many years, pointing particularly to the shocking images of civilians lying dead in the streets of Bucha and piled into improvised mass graves. There can never be impunity for such crimes, she said, calling for full investigation and prosecution by domestic and international courts, including the International Criminal Court. Noting that her country will continue to support such efforts, she called for accountability and justice for the victims and survivors of this war. “We at this table share that responsibility in face of such atrocities,” she said, calling on the parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law. Pointing to increasing allegations of sexual violence by Russian soldiers, she stressed that conflict-related sexual violence can constitute a war crime and that the perpetrators of such crimes must be held accountable. Echoing the Secretary-General’s call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, she highlighted the spillover effects of the war throughout the world, including deterioration of food security, surging energy prices and increasing poverty, with the most vulnerable and impoverished in developing countries to suffer the most.

RONALDO COSTA FILHO ( Brazil ) echoed calls for an independent and thorough investigation of the recent human rights violations in Ukraine, while reiterating pleas for a broad, effective and immediate cessation of hostilities. Noting that Brazil supported the General Assembly’s recently adopted resolution on the country’s humanitarian situation, he said the Council “must not become a bystander of the shocking consequences of the conflict”. So far, the organ is failing in its role to foster a constructive dialogue between the parties, with the aim of brokering an effective peace settlement to this conflict. “We deeply regret that the Security Council has not been able to speak with one voice throughout this crisis,” he said, adding that it should support civilians wishing to flee to safety and urging the parties to grant safe passage. Meanwhile, there can be no politicization of humanitarian actions nor selective application of international humanitarian law, and geopolitical objectives must not supersede the quest for peace nor prolong the suffering caused by war.

MARTIN KIMANI ( Kenya ) said the continued contestation of the truth about Bucha — even as the world beholds civilians murdered with their hands tied behind their back — “is the surest sign that we stand on the precipice”. In April 1994, even as genocide engulfed Rwanda, there were members of the Council contesting the horrifying truth that a million people were being murdered. “We should stand warned that the inability of the Council to establish the facts and attribute responsibility may enable the risk of escalation into far worse crimes,” he stressed. What started as a special military operation is now a war which has led to thousands of dead civilians and millions of refugees, and no one can doubt that there are flagrant violations of international law, international humanitarian law and the Charter of the United Nations under way in Ukraine. Condemning the unjustifiable actions undertaken in recent weeks, he called for an impartial and prompt United Nations investigation into the atrocities committed in Bucha and urged the parties to make clear to their military officers that they will be held to account for their actions. He also called for the urgent safe passage of civilians, especially from Mariupol, Kherson and other besieged cities.

JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ ( Mexico ) recalled that, through two General Assembly resolutions, the international community has sent a strong, clear message against the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Noting that the International Court of Justice also demanded the immediate suspension of military operations on Ukraine territory, he said it is up to the United Nations to ensure compliance with the Court’s decisions. All mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes established by international law must be used towards that common goal. Strongly condemning the atrocities committed in Bucha, he said the international community must protect the civilian population. Mexico supports the Secretary-General’s call for prompt, impartial investigations to identify the perpetrators. It will also closely follow the work of the International Criminal Court, which is investigating alleged international crimes committed in Ukraine, as well as the Commission on Inquiry, created for the same purposes by the Human Rights Council. The efforts of the international community to deal with the humanitarian crisis are only temporary, he said, stressing that the solution must be an immediate cessation of hostilities and a political agreement.

T.S. TIRUMURTI ( India ) said that since the Council last discussed Ukraine, the security and humanitarian situations have only deteriorated. Describing recent reports of civilian killings in Bucha as deeply disturbing and condemning them unequivocally, he called for an independent investigation and expressed his hope that the international community will continue to respond to Ukraine’s humanitarian needs. India supports calls urging for safe passage guarantees to deliver essential humanitarian and medical supplies and has been sending aid to Ukraine and its neighbours. It continues to call for the immediate cessation of violence and an end to hostilities. “When innocent human lives are at stake, diplomacy must prevail as the only viable option,” he stressed, taking note of the parties’ ongoing efforts in that regard. Also voicing concern that the impact of the crisis is being felt beyond the region with increasing food and energy costs - especially for many developing countries – he said it is in everyone’s interest to work constructively, both within and outside the United Nations, towards an early resolution to the conflict.

ZHANG JUN ( China ) welcomed the round of talks between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, urging the international community to create space for diplomacy, instead of creating obstacles and adding fuel to the fire. His country attaches great importance to humanitarian aid, calling on parties to the conflict to abide by the principle of civilian protection. Calling for neutrality and impartiality in humanitarian assistance, he said civilians should be spared from any violence. Turning to the disturbing images from Bucha, he said they must be verified before jumping to conclusions and accusations. Citing the negative impact of sanctions on developing countries, he said such measures are not effective and only accelerate the spillover effects. Indiscriminate sanctions are tantamount to weaponizing the world economy, he pointed out, deploring that more than 30 years after the end of the cold war, geopolitical risks remain. Stressing the need to uphold sovereignty of States, he said that smaller countries should not be caught between the great Powers and must not be forced to take sides. He urged the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members to engage with the Russian Federation head-on to establish a balanced, effective and sustainable security framework in the region. China’s only goal is peace, and Beijing will play a constructive and responsible role in that regard.

NATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL ( France ), stressing that the war of aggression has reached a new threshold of horror following events in Bucha, Borodianka and Motyiyn, condemned in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russian forces, which could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Moscow has added to its disgrace that of invoking lies and denial. She urged the Council not to give in to hatred and to instead take action, first and foremost by maintaining the strongest possible pressure on Moscow to compel it to end its war, which is compromising global security. Stressing that France, with its European partners, will continue to support Ukraine, she said credible, independent inquiries must be allowed to judge these actions. She called on the sides to cooperate with the International Criminal Court and the Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry. International humanitarian law must be respected, and civilians and humanitarian personnel protected. Noting that the European Union has mobilized €500 million in urgent support, she said all efforts must be made to achieve a cessation of hostilities. After this is secured, France will support Ukraine’s authorities in seeking a political solution, while maintaining dialogue with the Russian Federation. She also called on the Russian people to find ways to express their opposition to the aggression and to break the logic of hatred.

MONA JUUL ( Norway ), stressing that the need for peace in Ukraine could not be more urgent, said her delegation is appalled by the reports emerging from the areas around Kyiv and other regions. “We are deeply shocked by the atrocities committed against civilians in places that have been held by Russian forces, including Bucha,” she added, citing evidence of mass graves, as well as the destruction of homes, schools, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. “Russia is desperate to hide the truth about the war,” she said. However, atrocities must be investigated and those responsible must be brought to justice. She welcomed the establishment by the Human Rights Council of a Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine and urged the International Criminal Court to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, while urging Moscow and anyone holding evidence to fully cooperate with those investigations. Norway has called for a negotiated solution to end the war, in view of the massive suffering and displacement, the global implications of the conflict and the fact that reconstruction will take decades.

HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN ( Ghana ) echoed concerns raised over the prolongation of the war in Ukraine and the increasing humanitarian cost arising from the unjustified aggression by the Russian Federation. Expressing grave concern over reports of alleged gross violations of international humanitarian law and international criminal law, including emerging reports and images of killings and human rights violations, he echoed the call for an independent, impartial and thorough investigations to establish facts and to hold all perpetrators accountable. The killing of children, the elderly, medical personnel, humanitarian workers and journalists is particularly deplorable, he said, condemning such acts unreservedly. Calling for restraint by all sides and emphasizing the urgency of an unconditional nationwide cessation of hostilities, he urged the Council to focus its attention on confidence-building measures that facilitate a negotiated settlement, and on the wider question of European security on the basis of international law and other internationally agreed frameworks.

LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH ( United Arab Emirates ) said the briefings delivered today are a reminder of the rapidly deteriorating conditions in Ukraine, with the rising death toll a grim reflection of the human cost of war. To the shocking images emerging from Bucha, and the crimes they entail, she said: “We must establish what has happened here,” underscoring the imperative that “we do not get caught up in a war of narratives”. Existing mechanisms must be able to conduct investigations and she voiced support for an independent investigation. With the war now in its sixth week, an immediate cessation of hostilities is imperative. The United Arab Emirates views ongoing negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv as “a very positive development” and remains hopeful that they can translate to de‑escalation on the ground. She urged others to support these efforts, noting that establishing a viable humanitarian ceasefire could offer a bridge to broader negotiations. The priority must be to alleviate civilian suffering. The Council must continue to reaffirm the need for all parties to abide by their international humanitarian law obligations, and to the principles of distinction and proportionality.

Difficulties for providing humanitarian access must be urgently addressed. Stressing that false narratives and disinformation cause real harm for humanitarian organizations, she said technology has only increased the scale and speed of harmful information in reaching audiences online. She also urged the Council not to forget the impact of war on a nation’s cultural heritage and identity, expressing concern over the dozens of cultural sites that have been damaged and calling on all sides to refrain from such willful destruction. She expressed alarm over how the war is affecting the 1.2 billion people in 47 developing countries who are at risk due to rising food prices and looked forward to efforts by the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance.

Ms. WOODWARD ( United Kingdom ), Council President for April, speaking in her national capacity, recalled that the United Nations was created in the wake of a European war of aggression that laid waste to Europe and engulfed the world. Yet, the world is seeing another war of aggression in Europe, hearing again today about the devastating impact of the Russian Federation’s unilateral and illegal military action on Ukraine, on surrounding countries and the region, and on the security and prosperity of the wider world. Now, as the Russian Federation is forced into retreat from areas around Kyiv, the brutality of the invasion is laid bare, she said, noting the horrific images from the towns of Bucha and Irpin of civilians deliberately killed in areas from which Russian forces have recently withdrawn. These acts, and all other credible incidents, must be investigated as war crimes. Her country fully supports the work of the International Criminal Court and the work of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General and other national prosecutors. “As we and so many others have said so many times, all of this could be stopped if the Russian Federation ends this war now,” she said.

Mr. NEBENZIA ( Russian Federation ), taking the floor again, pointed again to the events in Bucha, which led to far-reaching conclusions by Western countries. All units of the Russian armed forces fully withdrew on 30 March from Bucha as a gesture of good faith. During the time when the town was under Russian control, not a single civilian suffered from any kind of violence. People moved around freely and used their cellphones. The Russian army supplied 450 tons of humanitarian assistance to the towns in Kyiv Oblast. People were not prevented from leaving the towns to the north. The southern areas of Bucha, including residential areas, were shelled around the clock by Ukraine forces. On 31 March, the mayor of Bucha confirmed that there were no more Russian soldiers left in town; he did not mention any people being shot with hands tied. It is hard to believe that the mayor would not have noticed 280 corpses on the street. In an eight-minute video about a mop-up operation by Ukraine’s police on 2 April, there were no bodies of civilians on the street. Testimonies of crimes by the Russian armed forces appeared on the fourth day after their withdrawal.

He expressed displeasure at how these Ukrainian videos were picked up by Western media and human rights organizations that claim to be impartial, adding that, if bodies were out in the open for several days, they would have shown signs well known to forensic specialists. The New York Times even went further to report that the bodies had been there since 20 March. In videos circulated by Ukraine, there were many bodies wearing a white armband. White armbands were worn by civilians after the entry of Russian forces. In one of the videos posted on social media by Ukraine radicals, there is a call to shoot anyone not wearing a blue armband. One member of the municipal council of Bucha stated, in an interview by Medusa, that she did not see the Russian armed forces execute civilians and that the Ukrainian armed forces are guilty of most violations.

He warned that Ukrainian disinformation and staging experts are preparing staged videos for future release by Western media, predicting that there will be a further horrible provocation similar to the one about Bucha. The aim is to depict Russian soldiers as murderers and rapists, he said, adding that modern technology allows for the creation of any video. To his United States counterpart, he said her country’s crusade to expel the Russian Federation from the Human Rights Council was a manipulation, reminding other delegations that the United States left that organ when it criticized United States soldiers in Afghanistan.

SERGIY KYSLYTSYA ( Ukraine ) said that his Russian counterpart decided to quote from an interview in Medusa, but failed to quote the interview in full. The woman he had quoted said that Russian soldiers gave dry rations, and after lowering them, they tossed grenades into the basement. This is Moscow’s idea of humanitarian assistance. He asked the Russian representative how Russians got to the level of cruelty of the Nazis and when they started enjoying acting like Nazis by killing civilians, attempting to redraw internationally recognized borders and deciding to resolve the Ukrainian issue in the way that Adolf Hitler attempted to resolve the Jewish issue. “I’m appalled over your cynical and outright lie that you don’t hit civilian targets,” he said. “You hit civilian targets and you killed civilians.”

He said that, at a press conference the Russian Federation gave on Monday, Mr. Nebenzia stated that civilians were killed by the Russian army. In Mr. Nebenzia’s mind, a hospital destroyed by the Russian army on Monday was a military target and a child killed there was a Ukrainian nationalist. However, Ukraine will win and so will the world. If there is anything to thank the Russian representative for, it is his acknowledgement of a “war” the Russians waged against Ukraine, not a “special military operation”. That confession should impact the United Nations assessment of what is happening in the centre of Europe. Mr. Nebenzia should be reminded that former German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop denied any knowledge of concentration camps and racial extermination policies, but was found guilty by the Nuremberg war crime tribunal, adding: “We all know what happened to him on 16 October in 1946.”

OLOF SKOOG, Head of the European Union delegation, speaking in its capacity as observer, said the Russian Federation’s war of aggression is in a blatant violation of international law, the Charter and the “acquis” of OSCE, jeopardizing the rules-based order, as well as European and global security. Stressing that the images from Bucha are a “stain on our common humanity”, he demanded that Moscow immediately stop its military aggression, unconditionally withdraw all forces from Ukraine’s entire territory and fully respect its territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognized borders, as demanded by General Assembly resolution A/ES-11/1.

Accusing the Russian Federation of directing attacks against civilians and targeting civilian infrastructure, he welcomed the International Court of Justice’s provisional measures ordering Moscow to immediately suspend military operations, as well as the International Criminal Court Prosecutor’s investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the work of the independent Commission of Inquiry. He described the European Union’s assistance to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General in the collection and preservation of evidence of war crimes, assuring: “It is clear, there will be accountability.” The European Union has adopted sanctions against Moscow, its financial and defence sectors and those individuals enabling and financing the aggression. It has mobilized € 1.1 billion in emergency aid, on top of the €2.4 billion in humanitarian, emergency and early recovery assistance provided to Ukraine since 2014. And in the largest operation under the Civil Protection Mechanism, 29 European countries, together with Norway and Turkey, have sent over 13,000 metric tons of medicines, hospital equipment, ambulances and firefighting equipment, food aid and energy supplies. A Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund also has been set up to channel support to post-war reconstruction, he added, calling for an immediate ceasefire, safe passage for civilians and uninterrupted humanitarian access.",https://www.un.org/press/en/2022/sc14854.doc.htm
5,58f13c02-4fa0-4d58-b443-5c023f9909b7,['Address Volodymyr Zelensky'],2022-04-06 13:44:07+00:00,"Dear Mrs. President!

Dear Mr. Secretary General!

Dear members of the Security Council and other participants of the meeting!

Thank you for the opportunity.

I am sure that all the representatives of the UN member states will hear me today.

Yesterday I returned from our city of Bucha, recently liberated from the troops of the Russian Federation.

It is difficult to find a war crime that the occupiers have not committed there.

The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our state.

They executed women outside the houses when approaching and simply calling someone alive.

They killed whole families – adults and children. And they tried to burn their bodies.

I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased everyday. Everyday, in the morning.

The memory of the killed civilians.

Who were shot in the back of the head or in the eye after being tortured. Who were shot just on the streets.

Who were thrown into the well, so that they die there in suffering.

Who were killed in apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Who were crushed by tanks in civilian cars in the middle of the road. For fun.

Whose limbs were cut off, whose throat was cut. Who were raped and killed in front of their own children.

Their tongues were torn out only because they did not hear from them what they wanted to hear.

How is this different from what the ISIS terrorists were doing in the occupied territory?

Except that it is done by a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

It destroys the internal unity of states.

Destroys state borders.

Denies the right of more than a dozen peoples on two continents to self-determination and independent state life. Pursues a consistent policy of destroying ethnic and religious diversity.

Inflames wars and deliberately wages them in such a way as to kill as many ordinary civilians as possible. To destroy as many ordinary peaceful cities as possible. To leave in the country where it sends its troops only ruins and mass graves. You’ve seen it all.

Promotes hatred at the state level and seeks to export it to other countries through its system of propaganda and political corruption.

Provokes a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa and Asia, and will certainly end in large-scale political chaos in countries where food price stability is a key factor of domestic security.

So where is the security that the Security Council must guarantee? There is no security. Although there is a Security Council, as if nothing happened.

So where is the peace that the United Nations was created to guarantee?

It is obvious that the key institution of the world, which must ensure the coercion of any aggressors to peace, simply cannot work effectively.

Now the world has seen what the Russian military did in Bucha while keeping our city under occupation. But the world has yet to see what they have done in other occupied cities, in other occupied areas of our country.

Geography may be different, but cruelty is the same. Crimes are the same.

And responsibility must be inevitable.

Ladies and Gentlemen!

I would like to remind you of the first article of the first chapter of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? To maintain peace. And to force to peace. Now the UN Charter is being violated literally from the first article. And if so, what is the point of all other articles?

Today, it is as a result of Russia’s actions on the territory of my state, on the territory of Ukraine, that the most heinous war crimes of all time since the end of World War II are being committed.

Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes.

They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation in them. They are deliberately shooting at columns of civilians on the roads who are trying to escape from the territory of hostilities.

They are even deliberately blowing up shelters where civilians are hiding from air strikes. They are deliberately creating conditions in the temporarily occupied territories so that as many civilians as possible are killed there.

The massacre in our city of Bucha is just one, unfortunately, of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for 41 days.

And there are many other such places that the world has yet to find out the full truth of: Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Borodyanka and dozens of other Ukrainian communities, each of which is like Bucha.

I know, and you know very well, what the representatives of Russia will say in response to the accusations of these crimes. They have said this many times. The most illustrative was after the downing of a Malaysian Boeing over Donbas by Russian forces with Russian weapons. Or during the war in Syria.

They will blame everyone, just to justify themselves. They will say that there are different versions, and which of them is true is allegedly impossible to establish yet. They will even say that the bodies of those killed were allegedly “planted”, and all the videos are staged.

But. Now is the year 2022. There is conclusive evidence. There are satellite images. It is possible to conduct a full, transparent investigation.

That is what we are interested in.

Maximum access of journalists. Maximum cooperation with international institutions. Involvement of the International Criminal Court. Full truth, full responsibility.

I am sure that every state in the UN system should be interested in this. For what? In order to punish once and for all those who consider themselves privileged, consider themselves unpunished. Hence, to show all other potential war criminals in the world that they will inevitably be punished as well. If the biggest is punished, everyone will be punished.

Why did Russia come to Ukraine, tell me?

I will answer. Russia’s leadership feels like colonizers – as in ancient times. They need our wealth and our people. Russia has already deported tens of thousands of our citizens to its territory. Then there will be hundreds. It abducted more than two thousand children. Simply abducted thousands of children. And continues to do so. Russia wants to turn Ukrainians into silent slaves.

The Russian militaries are openly looting the cities and villages they have captured. This is looting of the highest scale. They steal everything from food to gold earrings they just rip out with blood.

We are dealing with a state that turns the right of veto in the UN Security Council into a right to kill.

Which undermines the whole architecture of global security.

Which allows evil to go unpunished and spread the world. Destroying everything that can work for peace and security.

If this continues, the finale will be that each state will rely only on the power of arms to ensure its security, not on international law, not on international institutions.

Then, the UN can simply be dissolved.

Ladies and Gentlemen!

Are you ready for the dissolving of the UN? Do you think that the time of international law has passed?

If your answer is no, you need to act now, act immediately.

The power of the UN Charter must be restored immediately.

The UN system must be reformed immediately so that the right of veto is not a right to kill. So that there is a fair representation of all regions of the world in the Security Council.

The aggressor must be forced to peace immediately. Determination is needed. The chain of mass killings from Syria to Somalia, from Afghanistan to Yemen and Libya should have been stopped a long time ago to be honest.

If tyranny had ever received such a response to the war it had unleashed that it would have ceased to exist and a fair peace would have been guaranteed after it, the world would have changed for sure.

And then, perhaps, we would not have a war, a war in my country. Against our nation, the Ukrainian nation. Against people.

But the world watched and did not want to see the occupation of Crimea, or even before – the war against Georgia, or even earlier – the alienation from Moldova of the entire Transnistrian region. It also didn’t want to see how Russia was preparing the ground for other conflicts and wars near its borders.

How to stop it?

Immediately bring the Russian military and those who gave them orders to justice for war crimes in Ukraine.

Everyone who gave criminal orders and fulfilled them by killing people will face a tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials.

I want to remind Russian diplomats that a man like von Ribbentrop has not avoided punishment after World War II.

And I also want to remind the architects of Russia’s criminal policy that punishment has reached Adolf Eichmann as well.

None of the culprits will escape. No one.

But the main thing is that today is the time to transform the system, the core of which is the United Nations. To do this, we propose to convene a global conference. And we ask to do it already in peaceful Kyiv – in order to decide.

How we will reform the world security system.

How we will really guarantee the inviolability of universally recognized borders and the integrity of states.

How we will ensure the rule of international law.

It is now clear that the goals set in San Francisco in 1945 during the creation of a global international security organization have not been achieved. And it is impossible to achieve them without reforms.

Therefore, we must do everything in our power to pass on to the next generations an effective UN with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and thus guarantee peace.

Prevent aggression and force aggressors to peace. Have the determination and ability to punish if the principles of peace are violated.

There can be no more exceptions, privileges. Everyone must be equal. All participants in international relations. Regardless of economic strength, geographical area and individual ambitions.

The power of peace must become dominant. The power of justice and the power of security. As humanity has always dreamed of.

Ukraine is ready to provide a platform for one of the main offices of the updated security system.

Just as the Geneva office specializes in human rights, just as the Nairobi office specializes in the field of environmental protection, the Kyiv U-24 Office can specialize in preventive measures to maintain peace.

I want to remind you of our peaceful mission in Afghanistan. When, at our own expense, we Ukrainians evacuated more than a thousand people from this country. And it was the hottest phase. But people needed help – and Ukraine came. Just like other states.

We evacuated people of different nationalities, different faiths. Afghans, citizens of European countries, USA, Canada. We did not distinguish who needs help, whether these are our people or not. We saved everyone.

If every time there was a need everyone in the world was confident that help would come, the world would be definitely safer.

Therefore, Ukraine has the necessary moral right to propose a reform of the world security system.

We have proven that we help others not only in good times, but also in dark times.

And now we need decisions from the Security Council. For peace in Ukraine. If you do not know how to adopt this decision, you can do two things.

Remove Russia as an aggressor and a source of war from blocking decisions about its own aggression, its own war. And then do everything that can establish peace.

Or show how you can reformat and really work for peace.

Or if your current format is unalterable and there is simply no way out, then the only option would be to dissolve yourself altogether.

I am convinced that you can do without the third option.

Ukraine needs peace. We need peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace.

And finally, I’m asking you to watch the video. A short one.

A video of what has come to replace your power because someone alone can abuse his rights.

This is what impunity leads to.

If possible – watch this video. Because there is no opportunity for everyone to come to us and see it. So watch it.

Thank you.",https://prorhetoric.com/are-you-ready-for-the-u-n-to-be-dissolved-do-you-think-that-the-time-of-international-law-has-passed/

Russia has veto power over all UN resolutions as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, known as the P5. He recently blocked one calling for an immediate end to the invasion of Ukraine.

The UN can send peacekeepers to war zones and support the military action of its members if the P5 agrees. However, the international body is rocked by a growing rivalry between the West, Russia and China.

The divisions were still apparent on Tuesday, with Britain and the United States condemning Russia’s atrocities, while China and the United Arab Emirates – a non-permanent member of the council – avoided any criticism of Moscow.

In his address, Mr. Zelensky castigated the UN for failing to prevent the massacres in Syria, Somalia, Afghanistan and Libya. If “tyranny” had been countered earlier by the UN, then his country would not be at war now, he said.

He proposed convening a world conference in Kyiv to reform the global security system, adding, “It’s time to transform the United Nations system.”

Mr Zelensky said any Russian military leader or politician who gave an order that led to carnage in his country should be brought before a tribunal “similar to the Nuremberg tribunals”.

He said: “I would like to remind Russian diplomats that Von Ribbentrop did not escape punishment for crimes after World War II. Moreover, I remind you that Adolf Eichmann did not go unpunished.”

Mr. Zelensky showed the 15 members of the Security Council a 90-second graphic video of the aftermath of Russian atrocities, including dead women and children, burned bodies and victims in mass graves.

He said: “Russian troops are deliberately burning Ukrainian towns to ashes with artillery and airstrikes. They deliberately block cities, creating mass starvation. They deliberately shoot at columns of civilians on the road trying to flee the hostilities. They even deliberately blow up shelters where civilians are hiding from airstrikes.

The Russians deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians and abducted more than 2,000 children, he said.

Mr Zelensky added: “Russia wants to turn Ukraine into silent slaves.”

Grim evidence continued to emerge of massacres by Russian forces on the outskirts of kyiv.

Ukrainian officials said the bodies of more than 400 civilians were found in towns around the capital.",https://www.theautimes.com/volodymyr-zelensky-tells-un-act-now-to-stop-russia-or-disband/

In an impassioned virtual address to the UN Security Council, the Ukrainian president said Russia's veto on resolutions gave it a “right to kill”.

He said Russia should be kicked off the Security Council or that the UN should simply dissolve itself, because the entire structure of global security established in 1945 had failed.

Russia had been allowed to commit the “most terrible war crimes we have seen since the Second World War”, Mr Zelensky said, “sowing death” and acting like a “coloniser from ancient times”.

He added: “It’s clear that the world’s key institution, that is supposed to force any aggressor into accepting peace, simply cannot effectively operate.”

Mr Zelensky said the actions of Russian troops were “no different from other terrorists” such as Islamic State.

But he said: “Here it is done by a member of the United Nations Security Council.

“Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to close the UN? Do you think the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, you need to act immediately. The system must be reformed immediately, so the veto is not the right to kill.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/05/volodymyr-zelensky-tells-un-act-now-stop-russia-dissolve/
