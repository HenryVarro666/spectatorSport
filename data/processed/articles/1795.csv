Blinken says US supporting Ukraine to increase pressure on Moscow

The United States wants to see the war in Ukraine “come to an end as quickly as possible” and is supporting Ukraine to increase pressure on Russia, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.

“That’s exactly why we’re making sure that we’re doing everything we can to support Ukraine and to give them the assistance that they need to put pressure … on Russia,” Blinken said.

Blinken said he believed Ukraine can also win the war because “success” and victory is “holding on to the sovereignty and independence of their country”.

“The problem is it may take time, and in the meantime, tremendous death and destruction. But what is so powerful here is that the Ukrainians have made it very clear that they will not subjugate themselves to Vladimir Putin’s will.”

Twitter moves to limit reach of Russian government accounts

Twitter has introduced new measures against Russian government accounts in a bid to reduce the effect of official propaganda on the social network.

“We will not amplify or recommend government accounts belonging to states that limit access to free information and are engaged in armed interstate conflict — whether Twitter is blocked in that country or not,” Twitter said in a statement.

The company said it will also remove tweets posted by government or state-affiliated media accounts that share media that depict prisoners of war in the context of the conflict in Ukraine.

What does this mean? We won’t recommend these accounts, and we won't amplify them across the Home Timeline, Explore, Search, and in other places on Twitter. This measure drastically reduces the chance that people on Twitter see Tweets from these accounts unless they follow them. — Yoel Roth (@yoyoel) April 5, 2022

The secretary-general also rejected Russian assertions that the atrocities were staged.

During the same hearing, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the conflict in Ukraine could last for years, adding that “NATO, the United States, Ukraine and all of the allies and partners that are supporting Ukraine are going to be involved in this for quite some time”.

“We are concerned that the Ukrainian side has decided to demand that in case of signing the agreement … all combat actions must be stopped in several days and Russian armed forces must leave Ukraine,” he said in televised remarks.

“After this, there would be an alleged referendum, ratification in the parliament. There is a strong possibility that when the ratification and referendum give a negative result, we’ll need to start negotiation process anew. We don’t want to play such cat and mouse.”

5:30 am: Senate to vote on revoking Russia's trade status, oil ban

The US Senate will take up legislation Thursday to end normal trade relations with Russia and to ban the importation of its oil. Both bills have been bogged down in the Senate, frustrating lawmakers who want to ratchet up the US response to Russia’s war with Ukraine.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Russian President Vladimir Putin needs to be held accountable for what Schumer said were war crimes against Ukraine.

NASA astronaut says Russian crew 'blindsided' by response to yellow and blue flight suit

NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei on how Ukraine crisis impacted partnership with Russians April 5, 2022 01:26 HOUSTON — NASA’s record-setting astronaut Mark Vande Hei says he and his Russian crewmates focused on their mission, not the “heartbreaking” news unfolding in Ukraine, while serving aboard the International Space Station. His 355-day spaceflight ended last Wednesday with a landing in Kazakhstan. He returned to Earth in a Russian Soyuz capsule with cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov, the latter of whom also spent a year in orbit. In his first news conference back on Earth, Vande Hei said Tuesday that he did not shy away from the topic with his Russian crewmates while aboard the space station. “They weren’t very long discussions, but I did ask them how they were feeling and sometimes I asked pointed questions. But our focus really was on our mission together.” Vande Hei also cleared up any misunderstandings about the yellow-with-blue-trim flight suits worn by their Russian replacements when arriving at the space station last month. Those were the school colors of their university, Vande Hei said from NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, and not meant as a political statement. “The folks who wore them had no idea that people would perceive that as having anything to do with Ukraine ... I think they were kind of blindsided by it.” Share this -

Von der Leyen said the E.U. would also propose further penalties against individuals and was working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports. Share this -

Russia accused of blocking Egypt-bound ship carrying Ukrainian wheat The Ukrainian embassy in Cairo has accused Russia of blocking a ship loaded with Ukrainian wheat from moving after the goods were purchased by Egypt. The ship, EMMAKRIS III, remains docked in the Ukrainian port of Chernomorsk in the Black Sea, according to ship tracking information verified by NBC News on Tuesday. The Russian embassy in the Egyptian capital denied the claims, instead accusing Ukrainian authorities of preventing ships from leaving the port. Egypt is one of three countries, along with Indonesia and Bangladesh, that import about a third of the wheat that Ukraine exports, according to the International Grains Council. Share this -







Sweden to expel 3 Russian diplomats for spying, foreign minister says Sweden will expel three Russian diplomats for spying, Foreign Minister Ann Linde said on Tuesday, joining a number of European countries that have expelled Russian diplomats in recent days. “It is because they are not following the Vienna Convention and they are undertaking illegal intelligence-gathering operations,” Linde told reporters. France, Belgium and the Netherlands have recently expelled Russian diplomats over alleged spying activity. The moves coincide with outrage across the continent over reports of the discovery of mass graves and of civilian killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha following the retreat of Russian soldiers, conducting what Moscow calls its “special operation” in Ukraine. “It is obvious that war crimes have been committed,” Linde said. The Kremlin denies any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha. Share this -







Japan’s top envoy brings back 20 Ukrainians from Poland Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi returned from Poland on Tuesday with 20 Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s ongoing war on their country as Tokyo seeks to play a greater role in international support for Ukraine. During three days in Poland, Hayashi visited facilities for Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw and held talks with Polish officials, international humanitarian organizations and civil groups to assess how Japan can provide support. He said the visit ""renewed my resolve"" that Japan should ""cooperate with international society and provide the utmost assistance."" Japan has an extremely strict refugee policy and has been reluctant to fully accept migrant workers, making its offer to accept Ukrainians unusual. However, the government has carefully called them evacuees and it is still unclear if the Ukrainian situation will change its immigration policy. Tokyo expects the 20 evacuees will stay in Japan for at least six months, and will provide further support if needed, said Deputy Justice Minister Jun Tsushima, who was traveling with Hayashi. Tokyo has previously accepted about 300 other Ukrainians, all relatives of about 2,000 Ukrainian residents in Japan who arrived on their own since the Russian invasion began. Share this -

Zelenskyy says negotiations with Russia still necessary despite events in Bucha Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that the country still needed to negotiate an end to the war, even after the reports of atrocities and attacks on civilians in Bucha and other cities around the capital. “I think I have no other choice,” he told journalists in a press conference aired on Ukrainian television. “We cannot fight constantly,” he added. “It does not suit us, and we need security guarantees.” Still, he said, ""I think this is a great tragedy in general, because all of us, as I consider myself a part of society, will see even the possibility of negotiations as a challenge."" He also said “Russia may return,” and the country must prepare for that. Any agreement must include security guarantees from other countries, as well as clear sanctions policies in the event of further aggression after this war ends, he said, echoing comments he’s made in previous weeks. Zelenskyy on Monday visited Bucha, where he claimed that at least 300 civilians had been killed. Share this -







Red Cross says team that was detained trying to reach Mariupol has been released The International Committee of the Red Cross said a team that was stopped and held by police in Manhush during a bid to reach Mariupol has been released. In a statement on Tuesday, the ICRC said the team was released on Monday evening after being ""held by police"" in the nearby town, about 12 miles west of Mariupol. Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk had previously said the Red Cross team was being held by “the occupation authorities,"" according to Reuters. The ICRC said the team would return its focus to ""continuing the humanitarian evacuation operation."" The group has been trying to reach Mariupol since Friday to help the trapped residents of the besieged city. However, Vereshchuk said that despite Russia's agreement to open humanitarian corridors, Russian forces have been blocking those trying to reach Mariupol to help facilitate evacuations and provide aid. The ICRC said Monday's incident showed just how ""volatile and complex the operation to facilitate safe passage around Mariupol has been."" Share this -







U.N. General Assembly could vote on Russia suspension from Human Rights Council this week The United Nations General Assembly could vote on whether to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council as early as Thursday, according to the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. The U.S.-led proposal is set to be introduced to the Security Council on Tuesday, and may reach the General Assembly ""as soon as possible — this week, and possibly as early as Thursday,"" Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in an interview with NPR's Michel Martin on Monday. “It’s more than symbolic, and it does have force because it continues what we have started, and that is to isolate Russia and to call them out for what they’re doing,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. She added that the U.S. will continue to ""look at every option we have on the table to call Russia out, to isolate Russia, to unify the world against Russia."" Russia is one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and wields the right to veto its resolutions. The push for a vote to see the country suspended from the Human Rights Council comes after Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of killing and torturing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha, near Kyiv.

Chernihiv cut off from heat supply after heavy fighting, official says Residents in Chernihiv have been left without access to heat due to ""damage to critical infrastructure"" during fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces, the head of the local regional state administration has said. In a Telegram post Tuesday, Vyacheslav Chaus said electricity, water and gas supply were ""partially working."" However, he said there was ""no heat supply.""

It comes as Russian troops have reportedly pulled out of areas around Chernihiv and Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Britain's defense ministry said Tuesday that Ukrainian forces had retaken key terrain in the north of Ukraine.

Seven humanitarian corridors to open Tuesday, Ukraine says Seven humanitarian corridors to evacuate residents from cities in the south and east of Ukraine were set to open Tuesday, the country’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said in a message posted on Telegram. The besieged southern port city of Mariupol was included in the list, with residents scheduled to go to Zaporizhzhia in their own vehicles rather than buses. However, safe routes out of the city have come under fire or been blocked in recent weeks making evacuations difficult or impossible, and Vereshchuk offered little reason for hope Tuesday. “Despite the promises of its leadership, the occupying forces do not allow anyone to travel to Mariupol,” she wrote on the Telegram post. Seven buses were planned to help evacuate residents of Manhush, just east of Mariupol. Russian forces blocked Red Cross representatives on Monday, according to Vereshchuk. “After negotiations, they were released at night and sent to Zaporizhia,” Vereshchuk said. Share this -

It comes after soldiers forced Russian forces to retreat from areas around the city of Chernihiv and around the capital, Kyiv, the ministry said Tuesday in its latest intelligence report. The ministry said that low-level fighting is ""likely to continue"" in parts of the recaptured regions, but is expected to ""diminish significantly over this week"" as Russian forces continue to withdraw.

You can be fairly certain the Kremlin will trot out the same narrative it has in response to previous sanctions - that the West is looking for any excuse to sanction Russia.

Vladimir Putin said last week the West has been waging an economic war against Russia for years in order to undermine its development.

He is trying to tell the Russian people they are, in effect, the victims here and there is no causal relationship to what's happening in Ukraine.

In his words, Western sanctions are the price Russia must pay for freedom and independence.

The Kremlin's narrative is that this is not a war - it's a special military operation designed to defend the interests of Russian-speaking people living in the east of Ukraine.

But increasingly the Kremlin is portraying Ukraine as the real aggressor.

It is trying, Russians are told, to acquire nuclear weapons, it's trying to develop biological ones, there's evidence, people here are told, that Ukraine wants to try and use those kinds of weapons against Russia.

Regarding the footage out of Bucha, some Russians are seeing that, but they're being told that it's fake news.

It's very difficult to get access to any other sources of information, even social media channels - many of them have been blocked here.

And so many Russians believe what they're being told.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60991746/page/7
