ANKARA

Turkey has once again reiterated its proposal to host a leader-level meeting between Russian and Ukrainian presidents during a phone conversation between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on March 17.

Erdoğan pointed out that reaching consensus on some issues may require talks at the leadership level and repeated his offer to host Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Istanbul or Ankara, a statement by the Turkish Presidential Communications Directorate said.



The two leaders discussed the latest developments in the conflict between Russia-Ukraine and the humanitarian situation on the ground, the statement said.

Erdoğan told Putin that Ankara had kept its sincere approach to maintaining peace between Russia and Ukraine from the very beginning.

If a permanent ceasefire is declared, it would pave the way for a long-term solution, Erdoğan told the Russian leader, expressing his wish for positive results from the talks between the two warring sides.

Erdoğan underlined that “the war would not benefit any side and diplomacy should be given an opportunity.” He also emphasized the need to observe the humanitarian situation on the ground and to operate the humanitarian corridors effectively and smoothly in both directions,” the statement said.

Presidential spokesperson İbrahim Kalın outlined some of the demands voiced by Putin in an interview with BBC.

One of them is an acceptance by Ukraine that it should be neutral and should not apply to join NATO. Ukraine would have to undergo a disarmament process to ensure it wasn’t a threat to Russia. There would have to be protection for the Russian language in Ukraine, and demand for “de-Nazification” was on the agenda.

Putin said that it would need face-to-face negotiations between him and Zelensky before an agreement could be reached on these points, Kalın told the broadcaster.

“Mr. Kalın was much less specific about these issues, saying simply that they involved the status of Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, parts of which have already broken away from Ukraine and stressed their Russianness, and the status of Crimea,” BBC reported.

Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşğlu had a phone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart on March 18.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has asked Turkey to be a guarantor of any future deal with Russia, along with the U.N. Security Council’s five permanent members and Germany, Çavuşoğlu earlier said.

“Ukraine made an offer on the collective security agreement: P5 [the U.N. Security Council’s five permanent members], Turkey and Germany,” the Turkish foreign minister said during a visit to the Ukrainian city of Lviv on March 17.

“I saw that the Russian Federation had no objection and could accept such an offer,” he added, referring to his meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow on March 16.

Turkey, which has close ties with Ukraine and Russia, has tried to position itself as a mediator in the three-week-old conflict.

Last week, it hosted the first high-level meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers in the southern resort city of Antalya since the war began.",https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-putin-discuss-recent-developments-in-ukraine-war-172304

Accordingly, the first four demands are not too difficult for Ukraine to meet. On the other hand, the second category is where the difficulty lies.

Kalın told BBC that Putin explained Russia's demands for a peace deal to Erdoğan in the call. One of those ""acceptable"" demands, according to Kalın, is an acceptance by Ukraine that it should remain neutral and not apply to join NATO. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has already conceded this.

The other three demands in this category are that Ukraine will have to undergo a disarmament process to ensure it wasn't a threat to Russia. There would have to be protection for the Russian language in Ukraine. He also demanded the so-called ""denazification"" of the country.

On the other hand, there are some demands from Putin that will be difficult for Ukraine to accept, according to Kalın. These demands include the status of some regions in eastern Ukraine, specifically the regions of Donbass and Crimea, threatening the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

""Although Mr. Kalın didn't go into detail, the assumption is that Russia will demand that the Ukrainian government should give up territory in eastern Ukraine. That will be deeply contentious,"" BBC reported.

According to Kalın, these last demands require face-to-face meetings between Putin and Zelenskyy.

""Mr. Putin had apparently been clear and concise in everything he said,"" Kalın added.

Erdoğan Thursday continued his diplomatic efforts for a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine, reiterating his offer to host Putin and Zelenskyy for talks to resolve the crisis.

In the phone call, Erdoğan and Putin discussed the latest developments in Ukraine and the humanitarian situation on the ground, according to a statement by the Turkish Presidency's Directorate of Communications.

Erdoğan told Putin that a permanent cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine would pave the way for a long-term solution between the two warring countries, the statement said.

He said Turkey maintains the ""sincere approach it had been displaying since the very beginning in order for peace to be ensured between Russia and Ukraine.""

""Pointing out that the war would benefit no one, and that diplomacy should be given a chance, President Erdoğan drew attention to the need to attach importance to the humanitarian situation on the ground and operate the humanitarian corridors effectively in both directions,"" the statement read.

In a separate phone call, Erdoğan discussed the humanitarian situation and latest developments in Ukraine with his Romanian counterpart Klaus Iohannis.

He said Turkey has been ""exerting great efforts in order for peace to be ensured between Russia and Ukraine"" while also providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine and its neighbors, including Romania, who are facing an influx of refugees.

The two leaders agreed to enhance ""cooperation and coordination in the management of the forced migration caused by the war, as well as measures with regard to the repercussions of this process on various sectors,"" the Directorate of Communications said.

Hopes for a cease-fire between Ukraine and Russia have increased a little more, Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu also said Thursday after meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart in the city of Lviv.

As part of Turkey's ongoing efforts to broker peace between the two sides, Çavuşoğlu arrived in Ukraine after talks a day earlier with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow.

In his meeting with Dmytro Kuleba, Çavuşoğlu reiterated Turkey's ""support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine"" and reaffirmed that Ankara will continue its ""efforts to end this war and achieve a lasting cease-fire,"" said a Foreign Ministry statement.

Addressing a news conference, he said Turkey's support for Ukraine was a natural result of its principled policy, alliance and strategic partnership.

The Russia-Ukraine war, which started on Feb. 24, has drawn international condemnation, led to financial restrictions on Moscow and spurred an exodus of global firms from Russia.

At least 780 civilians have been killed and 1,252 injured in Ukraine since the beginning of the war, according to the United Nations, which has said that conditions on the ground make it difficult to verify the true number.

Around 3.2 million people have also fled to neighboring countries, the U.N.'s refugee agency said.

Turkey has been one of the countries leading efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has affected millions of civilians. Turkey says it can facilitate peace talks between Ukraine and Russia but says that a cease-fire and humanitarian corridors are needed first.

Maintaining its neutral and balanced stance, Turkey continues its diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the Ukraine conflict, urging all sides to exercise restraint. While Ankara has opposed international sanctions designed to isolate Moscow, it also closed its straits to prevent some Russian vessels from crossing.

NATO ally Turkey borders Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. Since the beginning of the conflict, Ankara has offered to mediate between the two sides and host peace talks, underlining its support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Having recently called Russia’s invasion an unacceptable violation of international law, Turkey has carefully formulated its rhetoric not to offend Moscow, with which it has close energy, defense and tourism ties.",https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/putin-lists-specific-demands-from-ukraine-in-his-call-with-erdogan

Erdogan has been in contact with Russian and Ukrainian officials throughout the invasion of Ukraine. Ibrahim Kalin, an adviser to Erdogan and his spokesman, listened in on the call with Putin, and spoke with BBC News world affairs editor John Simpson about what they discussed.

Kalin said Putin sounded clear and concise during the conversation, and had two categories of demands. Ukraine could meet the first four rather easily, Kalin said. Ukraine would have to stay neutral and not apply to NATO, Kalin stated, and would have to undergo a disarmament process and protect the Russian language in the country. Ukraine would also have to agree to go through ""de-Nazification.""

Zelensky is Jewish and had several relatives die in the Holocaust. Asking for the government to go through ""de-Nazification"" is ""deeply offensive"" to Zelensky, Simpson wrote, ""but the Turkish side believes it will be easy enough for Mr. Zelensky to accept. Perhaps it will be enough for Ukraine to condemn all forms of neo-Nazism and promise to clamp down on them.""

Kalin was much more vague when describing the more contentious demands, only saying they involved separatist areas of eastern Ukraine and Crimea. The assumption, Simpson wrote, is that Putin will say Ukraine must give up the territory held by separatists and formally accept that Crimea, which was illegally annexed in 2014, is officially part of Russia.

Putin told Erdogan that when discussing these demands, he will want to hold an in-person meeting with Zelensky, Kalin said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin shared his demands for ending the war in Ukraine with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during a phone call on Thursday, according to the BBC.

Ibrahim Kalin, a leading adviser to Erdogan who listened in, told the BBC about the call and the details of Putin's demands shortly after it ended. Kalin said some of the demands would be easier for Ukraine to agree to than others.

First, Putin is seeking assurance from Ukraine that it will remain neutral and not seek to join NATO. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday his country ""must admit"" it wouldn't join NATO, a concession that could serve as an opening for peace talks with Russia.

Kalin told the BBC that Putin also wants Ukraine to complete a disarmament process, protect the Russian language in the country, and engage in ""de-Nazification."" It's unclear exactly what the de-Nazification demand would include, but Putin has repeatedly cited this as a reason for the war, despite the fact that Ukraine is a democracy and its president is Jewish.

The more challenging demands involve the status of Crimea and the Donbas region, according to Kalin, with Putin saying he would need to meet with Zelenskyy in person to discuss this. Specifics were not given about these demands. Crimea has been occupied by Russia since 2014 and Donetsk and Luhansk — two separatist regions in the Donbas — have been recognized by Russia as independent states.

The demands Kalin said Putin shared with Erdogan align with those outlined by the Kremlin last week, as reported by Reuters. Russia told Ukraine it would immediately cease its military operations if Kyiv met their conditions, including changing it's constitution to ensure neutrality, acknowledging Crimea as belonging to Russia, and acknowledging Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Reuters those demands had been relayed to Ukraine.

On Wednesday, Zelenskyy laid out his own demands for peace talks with Russia after officials from both countries said they were making progress.

""My priorities in the negotiations are absolutely clear: the end of the war, security guarantees, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country,"" he said.",https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-shares-demands-ending-war-ukraine-turkey-2022-3

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu met his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Lviv on Thursday, one day after his visit to Moscow where he met Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov.

In taped remarks, Çavuşoğlu said: “If an agreement is achieved about the issues that we see a rapprochement about, there is a possibility that two leaders can come together,"" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelensky.

Çavuşoğlu also said his hopes for a ceasefire increased after meeting with both parties, although “it is hard to talk about it when it comes to war.”

There are also demands for Ukraine to undergo a disarmament process to make sure there's no threat to Russia and protection for Russian as a language in Ukraine, reports said.

Another demand was said to be about 'de-Nazification' which is deeply offensive to Zelensky, who is Jewish himself.
