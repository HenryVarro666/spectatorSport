For the city’s remaining residents, the metro system has now become more than just a shelter.

It is home to hundreds of the city’s men, women and children.

And their beloved pets.

Together they sleep and eat in the train carriages, next to the ticket machines and on the platforms under high street fashion adverts.

While some sit on their phones, others do their laundry and mothers feed their babies.

But underneath the snowy streets, another danger is spreading.

One that Nastya is all too aware of.

SICK GIRL, NASTYA SAYING: “There is a virus circulating around here, and I got it.

REPORTER ASKING: “Do you have a temperature?”

NASTYA ANSWERING: “I don’t know. Perhaps, I have a temperature.”

REPORTER ASKING: “Is it cold here?”

NASTYA ANSWERING: “It’s warm in the carriage, but it’s quite cool on the platform itself.”

REPORTER ASKING: “How long have you been staying here?”

NASTYA ANSWERING: ""Around 7-8 days.”

Talking to our reporter, Nastya says she is longing for the war to be over so she can go home and sleep.

“I’m scared for my home, for the homes of my friends, very scared for the whole country, and scared for myself of course.”

For Kharkiv’s residents, the priority is now surviving the bombing.

The city that has suffered some of the heaviest shelling since the Russian invasion began last month.

According to the local governor, Russian forces have shelled residential areas of the city 89 times in one day.

Valentyna, an elderly woman nearby, recalls the moment her apartment building was hit by shelling, describing the smoke and panelling falling down.

During the bombing, an institute containing a nuclear laboratory was also hit, the local governor said on Friday.

Though he maintained there was no danger to the civilian population yet.

Kharkiv’s Mayor also said 48 schools had been destroyed in the city, which has a peacetime population of about 1.4 million.

The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, said over 2.3 million people have fled Ukraine following Russia's invasion, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"" to ""de-Nazify"" the country. It denies targeting civilians.",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/im-scared-life-inside-kharkivs-144918898.html

11 Mar 2022 04.37 Putin has approved 16,000 volunteers from the Middle East to fight in Ukraine With more details of Vladimir Putin’s comments on welcoming volunteers to fight in Ukraine, Reuters reports that the Russian president today approved bringing thousands of fighters from the Middle East to fight against Ukraine. At a meeting of Russia’s Security Council, defence minister Sergei Shoigu said there were 16,000 volunteers in the Middle East who were ready to come to fight with Russian-backed forces in eastern Ukraine in the breakaway Donbass region.

Putin said: If you see that there are these people who want of their own accord, not for money, to come to help the people living in Donbass, then we need to give them what they want and help them get to the conflict zone. He also told Shoigu that he approved Javelin and Stinger missles captured by the Russian army in Ukraine being handed to Donbass forces. “As to the delivery of arms, especially Western-made ones which have fallen into the hands of the Russian army - of course I support the possibility of giving these to the military units of the Lugansk and Donetsk people’s republics,” Putin said.

“Please do this.”

11 Mar 2022 04.33 EU to double spending on military support for Ukraine to €1billion Daniel Boffey The EU will double the amount it is spending on providing military support to Ukraine to €1billion, it has been announced at a leaders’ summit on Versailles. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said agreement among the 27 leaders had not been difficult to secure. He said: Everyone was completely aware that we have to increase our military support to Ukraine to increase the pressure on Russia.

11 Mar 2022 04.23 Lithuanian president says 'flavour of disappointment' over EU not fast tracking Ukraine's membership Daniel Boffey Lithuania’s president Gitanas Nausėda said there was a “flavour of disappointment” to the decision by the EU leaders at a summit in Versailles not to offer Ukraine a fast track to EU candidate status in their response to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s request. Speaking as he arrived at the second day of the meeting, Nausėda said he believed that “more could be done” but that other member states had different concerns among their electorates to which they needed to answer. He said that he expected the EU to come back to the issue. He said: I wish Ukraine gets candidate status now. But it was not possible to get it today. But probably it will come back to this issue later on. Some countries have domestic agendas, opinion of society, and they have to care about it. But more could be done. Very slight flavour of disappointment but we made also a very important step and we go forward. In a statement published in the early hours of Friday the leaders had said: On 28 February 2022, exercising the right of Ukraine to choose its own destiny, the President of Ukraine submitted the application of Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. The Council has acted swiftly and invited the Commission to submit its opinion on this application in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties. Pending this and without delay, we will further strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership to support Ukraine in pursuing its European path. Ukraine belongs to our European family.



11 Mar 2022 04.20 What do latest movements of Russian convoy near Kyiv mean? Peter Beaumont Analysis from the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont, reporting from Lviv, of the latest movements of the Russian convoy near Kyiv: With evidence from the latest satellite images from Maxar Technologies that the 40-mile (64-kilometer) Russian convoy that had been approaching the capital Kyiv - including tanks, trucks and artillery – has now been dispersed and redeployed, what does it mean? In the last few days we’ve seen Russian tanks attempting to move forward towards Brovary from the north east and the redeployment of the 40 mile convoy to the west with Russian forces operating some 60k to the west of Kyiv on the main E40 east west motorway. The question with the convoy to the north west was whether it was “stalled” as western defence analysts have claimed – suggesting they had expected it to assault Kyiv – or was regrouping to take up positions and besiege the Ukrainian capital. With armoured units seen in towns near the Antonov airport in Hostomel to north of the cit, and with vehicles moving into forests, with towed howitzers positioned ready to fire, it looks increasingly likely that Russian forces are preparing a siege from both sides of the river Dnieper. What is not yet clear is whether the Russian ambition is to close the encirclement of Kyiv to the south or leave that exit open. Still, the immediacy of the threat to Kyiv is still unclear. A US defence official speaking on condition of anonymity said Russian forces moving toward Kyiv had advanced about 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) in the past 24 hours, with some elements as close as 15 kilometers (about 9 miles) from the city. A more intense bombardment of Kyiv from the armour gathered outside would be in keeping with recent Russian tactics around Mariupol and Kharkiv. While the Russian military may view a siege as a less risky option, given the effectiveness of the Ukrainian resistance, it is not risk free. Ukrainian use of Turkish supplied combat drones has been effective and Russian positions taken outside the city for shelling would be vulnerable to drones and other attacks.

11 Mar 2022 04.16 More than 2.5m people have fled Ukraine, says UN The UN migration agency reports that as of today more than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine. Of the total, the International Organisation for Migration said that 116,000 were third-country nationals. The majority of refugees, around 1.5 million people, have fled to Poland. Officials in Warsaw, where around 300,000 refugees have arrived, have called on all countries to do more to help Ukrainians. Monika Beuth-Lutyk, a spokesperson for the mayor of Warsaw, told Sky News: “I think we should all do more. The real problem is before us.” Asked whether the UK should be doing more, she said: “I am afraid that this is just the beginning - so I think you could today think about your offer for them if you can provide something for them that would be really welcome.”



11 Mar 2022 04.00 Jailed Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, has called for anti-war protests in cities including Moscow on Sunday. “Mad maniac Putin will most quickly be stopped by the people of Russia now if they oppose the war,” he wrote on Instagram, reports Reuters. “You need to go to anti-war rallies every weekend, even if it seems that everyone has either left or got scared...You are the backbone of the movement against war and death.” According to protest monitoring group OVD Info, 13,908 people have been detained at anti-war demonstrations in Russia since the start of the invasion of Ukraine. Navalny, who posts on social media through his lawyers and allies, was jailed last year after returning to Russia having been treated in Germany for a poison attack with a nerve agent during a visit to Siberia in 2020. Russian authorities said they did not carry out the attack.

Kyiv — Ukrainian authorities announced yet another effort Friday to evacuate civilians from the cities hardest hit by Russian artillery. The government hoped to at least get some humanitarian aid into the worst affected areas, as Russia looked poised to make a new push to take major cities, including Kyiv.

CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports residents are running for their lives from Ukraine's capital. Just a month ago, Kyiv was a thriving European metropolis home to almost 3 million people. Now, hunkering down, hiding out and hoping the worst won't happen is no longer an option.

""The snipers have taken over my house,"" said Valentina, a school teacher. ""They're shooting in the direction of my son's house, my only son.""

Not everyone gets away. Terrifying scenes have been unfolding in the neighborhoods of Irpin and Bucha, just a few miles from central Kyiv. Ukrainian officials say about 2,500 civilians have been killed since Russia launched its invasion 16 days ago.

New satellite images of the huge Russian military convoy north of the capital suggest it might finally be on the move again after being stalled for days by logistical issues and fierce Ukrainian resistance. The troops appear to be repositioning in preparation for a possible assault on, or siege of the capital.

As D'Agata reports, that's exactly what the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest, has been subjected to for days. But Russia has paid a heavy price. The bodies of Russian soldiers litter the ground around Kharkiv, and after two weeks of ferocious battle and relentless artillery fire, Russia still hasn't taken control.

A regional official said Friday that Russian forces had shelled residential areas of Kharkiv 89 times in just 24 hours, with some of the strikes hitting an institute containing a nuclear laboratory that Russia claimed several days ago was being prepared by Ukrainian forces for a staged ""provocation.""

Kharkiv Governor Oleh Synegubov said there were ""no threats to the civilian population yet"" from the strikes that hit the nuclear facility specifically, but as D'Agata reports, Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been no match for Russia's artillery and aerial bombardment.

Civilians in Kharkiv and other battered cities report seemingly indiscriminate killing, with targets, including hospitals and residential neighborhoods. After a strike on a maternity and children's hospital Wednesday in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol drew international condemnation of Russia — and a denial from Moscow — Governor Synegubov said Friday that a health facility in his region had been struck.

He said a psychiatric hospital near the town of Izyum, about 50 miles southeast of the city of Kharkiv, was hit by Russian fire in a ""brutal attack on civilians."" The Reuters news agency quoted him as saying that about 70 people had been evacuated from the facility, which housed 330. He said emergency services were working to assess casualties.

The onslaught of artillery fire and airstrikes is President Vladimir Putin taking advantage of the West's refusal to risk a direct confrontation with Russia by imposing a NATO-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine. He's used the tactic before, most recently in Syria, where his forces surrounded and then destroyed entire cities to beat rebel fighters into submission.

But D'Agata says when it comes to Russia's ground assault in Ukraine, the Ukrainian forces have two advantages: They're fighting on their own turf, and they're determined to defend every inch of it.

One Ukrainian soldier holding a line on the edge of Kharkiv said the Russian forces he was up against — who were only about half a mile from his position — were using outdated tactics.

""They're fighting like the soldiers of 1941,"" he said. ""They attack in, just like, in front, they don't do any modern maneuvers. Yeah, they have a lot of people, a lot of vehicles and tanks, but we fight in our land and we protect our families. So, it doesn't matter how they fight, we fight like lions and they won't win!""

With multiple cities now under siege, D'Agata says the top priority for Ukrainian authorities is again to attempt to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in catastrophic conditions without food, water or electricity, and in brutal sub-freezing temperatures.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-news-war-russian-convoy-satellite-images-kyiv-kharkiv-mariupol/
