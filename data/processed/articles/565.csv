Guterres tweeted: “The war in Ukraine not only has a dramatic impact on the lives of civilians but also has global repercussions. Developing countries already in dire situations can simply not afford skyrocketing prices of food, fuel and other essential goods.”

Prof. Herman Musahara, an economist who is a senior member of the at Economic Policy Research Network (EPRN) in Rwanda, on Wednesday gave The New Times his views on the impact of the conflict which is now “the talk of everybody from Twitter spaces to the UN Security Council” and also noted that the impact is certainly global now as stated by the UN chief.

Musahara said: “Like the crisis of 1973 the most affected sector is energy and commodity prices. The price of a barrel is now, for the foreseeable future, above $100. So, definitely we get imported inflation. Wheat, barley and corn prices are going up also. Russia and Ukraine account for 30 per cent of global supply. These are intermediate goods and the UN Secretary-General is right with imported inflation and, after the Covid-19 impact, developing countries, children and women will feel the effect of what is happening there.”

“The supply chains like during the Covid-19 have started being disturbed. Trade and financial systems are not affected by the conflict only but also by the sanctions by the US and the NATO partners. Imports of raw materials and final goods will be expensive and make lives [hard] in developing countries which are still struggling to recover from Covid-19.”

Musahara also said there is a possibility of resources being diverted.

“You can expect that grants on support and even education on youth, children and poor will now go to victims of the conflict.:

The East African Community (EAC) on March 2 issued a statement stating that it was deeply concerned by the ongoing conflict between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Ukraine. The bloc called for restraint and an immediate ceasefire by the two sides to avoid further loss of life and damage to property. At the time, the regional bloc shared the deep concern earlier expressed by the African Union Commission on the reported discrimination of Africans seeking safe exit from the conflict zone in Ukraine.

According to reports, around 4.5 percent of the population has left Ukraine, less than two weeks after Russia’s invasion began, on February 24. On Tuesday, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said two million people have fled from the war in Ukraine, country of approximately 44 million people.

Most refugees head to neighboring countries including Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova and Poland.

Grandi reported that UNHCR is supporting coordination of the humanitarian response.

The UN refugee chief called for the international community to step up to provide more support for refugees and host communities, particularly in Moldova where some 250,000 people found refuge.

“All European states must continue to show generosity. Other countries, beyond Europe, also have an important role to play to help people in need and share the international responsibility for millions of refugees,” said Grandi.

While in the region, the UN refugee chief also raised concerns about discrimination and racism against some communities fleeing Ukraine.

According to media reports, Russia and Ukraine earlier agreed on the need for humanitarian corridors to deliver aid and help civilians exit besieged Ukrainian cities, in the first apparent sign of progress in talks between the warring sides.

“We welcome public communications by the two sides regarding their intention to facilitate safe passage for civilians out of conflict areas including Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy,” UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric on Tuesday told journalists during his daily briefing in New York.

1,e4ae40df-8f47-4b29-aec1-38b75208d416,[],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"Presenting the latest UN Human Rights Council-mandated report on the nearly 11-year-old conflict at a virtual press conference in Geneva, Paulo Pinheiro, Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, described the “devastating” impact on communities.

Half the country displaced

“Hundreds of thousands have been killed, more than half of the pre-war population – somewhere in the order of 22 million - have been displaced. More than 100,000 are missing or forcibly disappeared. Syria’s cities and infrastructure have been destroyed. Today the poverty rate in Syria is an unprecedented 90 percent; 14.6 million people in Syria depend on humanitarian aid.”

In Syria’s northwest, many Syrians forced from their homes “are still living in flimsy tents, stuck in snow, rain, mud,” Mr. Pinheiro continued, before insisting that “some actors seem to spend more energy on preventing aid to get to them, rather than facilitating it”.

Although parts of Syria are no longer subject to active fighting, communities remain caught between warring parties and exploited by armed actors, Mr. Pinheiro said.

In the abyss

He added: “Make no mistake that violence against civilians continues across the country, from bombardment in the northwest, north and northeast, to targeted killings, unlawful detention and torture…These are the abysses faced by the Syrian people.”

According to the report, covering the period July to December 2021, there were increased bombardments in the northwest of the country and skirmishes between the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeast.

The Commission documented “grave violations of fundamental human rights and international humanitarian law by parties to the conflict, including war crimes and ongoing patterns of crimes against humanity.

“In Idlib and western Aleppo in the northwest, residential areas were also shelled indiscriminately from the ground by pro-government forces.”

Ukraine food factor

Previous reports by the Commission of Inquiry have warned about a worsening humanitarian situation across Syria because of fighting and insecurity, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has heightened concerns that critical wheat imports may now be affected, said Commissioner Hanny Megally: “We’re already seeing inflation at 140 per cent at the beginning of this year (and) it’s gone up.

“We’re seeing the State already beginning to ration. We’re seeing the prices of commodities, basic commodities and fuel going up…Most of Syria’s imported wheat is coming from Ukraine or Russia, so we are very concerned that the war in Ukraine will have a bad impact on Syria.”

Sanctions review

With Syria “teetering on collapse”, the Commissioners urged a review of sanctions imposed on Syria on a country-by-country basis.

“Sanctions …should facilitate humanitarian assistance (but) this is not really working very well,” said Mr. Megally, who warned that many countries were so fearful of breaching the embargoes that they were practising “overcompliance”, leaving Syrian communities short of essential commodities.

Findings from the latest report from the Commission of Inquiry include 14 attacks “by Syrian and Russian forces in northwest Syria”, Mr. Pinheiro said.

“Over these past few months, scores of children were killed, including on their way to school; and the last functional medical centre in Jabal al Zawiya was rendered inoperable.”

Festering conditions in Al-Hol

Longstanding concerns also remain over the detention in Al Hol camp of tens of thousands of women and children, believed to be the families of former ISIL fighters, in Syria’s northeast.

“The conditions in Al Hol are absolutely appalling, and the number of children and other numbers of mostly women who are detained-cum-interned there,” said Commissioner Lynn Welchman of the notorious camp complex in Syria’s northeast.

“It’s a dreadful situation, humanitarian-wise and security-wise. And it’s one of the things that we are most concerned about in terms of what’s happened…In some cases, it could at least be addressed by third nations who are able to take back their nationals, with their children.”

The Commission of Inquiry has repeatedly called for UN Member States to repatriate nationals who went to participate in the Syrian conflict.

“The camp residents are under constant risk of being injured, killed, or trafficked. More than 90 murders and 40 attempted murders have occurred in Al Hol alone in the past year,” said Mr. Pinheiro. “We are repeating our call for Member States to bring home their women and children from the camps.”",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113592

3,e4ae40df-8f47-4b29-aec1-38b75208d416,[],,"President Biden announced today that the United States was banning all imports of Russian oil, gas and coal, the latest in a series of severe economic sanctions being waged against President Vladimir Putin for his unprovoked war in Ukraine. The United Kingdom also announced its own plan to phase out Russian oil and oil products by the end of the year.

But breaking ties with Russia’s energy supply is the easy part. It’s what comes next that will be difficult, policy experts say. And exactly how Western countries choose to shift away from Russian fossil fuels will have major implications for the climate.

As the Ukraine conflict puts a squeeze on an already volatile energy market, it is reigniting a decades-old argument over the importance of energy independence and the role renewable energy, such as solar and wind, should play in achieving it.

In the United States, those in the debate have largely fallen into two camps. On one side, two senators from fossil-fuel producing states—Joe Manchin, D-W.Va, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska—are leading an effort to replace Russian energy imports by increasing domestic production of oil and gas.

On the other side, a group of climate hawks in the House have joined up with Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., to propose alternative legislation that would also ban Russian imports, but require the United States to replace them with renewable energy over time.

Similarly in Europe, which is far more dependent on Russian oil than the U.S., climate campaigners are urging their lawmakers to hasten the transition to renewable energy and not to increase oil drilling in the Northern Sea as they implement new restrictions on Russian energy.

Just 3 percent of crude oil imports into the U.S. came from Russia last year. Still, U.S. lawmakers are warning the already high energy prices could get even higher. Rising gasoline prices—which hit an average of $4 per gallon in the U.S. this week—are putting massive political pressure on government leaders to find quick solutions for consumers, even if they come at the expense of long-term environmental goals.

Energy analysts say that could be a major problem for the clean energy transition, which is already struggling to meet expectations.

For example, dozens of nations pledged to reduce their dependence on coal power last fall at a major international climate summit. But coal has made a comeback, largely because of Asian countries seeking cheap fuel options amid rising global energy prices. Similarly, development of new solar, wind and hydroelectric energy last year fell far behind what’s needed to meet President Biden’s goal of creating a carbon-free power grid by 2035.

“The energy transition was already in trouble—80 percent of the world’s energy is still from fossil fuels,” Dieter Helm, an economist and professor of energy policy at Oxford university, told the Financial Times.

In the short term, Helm believes both the United States and the European Union will increase their domestic production of oil and gas, moves that will most certainly create new challenges for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years.

U.S. production of oil and gas have only increased under President Biden and are expected to hit record highs in 2022 and 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At a press conference announcing the U.S. ban this morning, President Biden said, if anything, the Ukraine conflict should be persuading governments to more quickly transition to renewable energy.

Complicating matters further, China is considering buying or increasing stakes in Russian energy and commodities companies. That news is sure to drive another wedge into the already difficult global climate talks, in which countries have struggled so far to find common ground on how to address climate change and who exactly will pay for the efforts.

Last week, hundreds of climate scientists from around the world released their latest update on the state of global warming, and their report was grim. The world is already experiencing irreversible climate change and humanity isn’t moving nearly quickly enough to adapt, the landmark report said.

António Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, didn’t hold his punches when he spoke about the report and what he thought it would mean if the world fails to transition to clean energy quickly enough.

“Delay is death,” Guterres told the room of U.N. delegates in Geneva last week. “It is essential to meet the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. Science tells us that it will require the world to cut emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.”

Russia’s top energy official threatened to cut off natural gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, as Europe drew up plans to limit its reliance on Russian energy, while the U.S. edged closer to banning oil imports. Fresh talks Monday between Ukrainian and Russian officials made only limited progress on negotiating a cease-fire.

Oil closed in New York at the highest in a decade and the war has effectively shut off more than a quarter of global wheat exports. In Washington, lawmakers announced the outline of bipartisan legislation to bar imports of Russia’s oil into the U.S., clearing the way for a rapid crackdown on crude from that country.

The waterway is between the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, where Russia is conducting naval operations against Ukraine.

Stocks Slip as Commodity Costs Dim Outlook (4:55 a.m.)

Asian stocks and European equity futures fell Tuesday on concerns that commodity costs will fan inflation and choke economic growth.

Oil pushed past $121 a barrel, supported by fears of disarray in commodity flows stemming from the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia. The price of everything from natural gas to wheat has hit all-time highs for similar reasons.

Australia Imposes Sanctions on ‘Propagandists’ (2:09 a.m.)

Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement that the government was working with Facebook, Twitter and Google to stop the spread of content from Russian state media within Australia.

Wheat Soars to Record (1:58 a.m.)

Wheat jumped to an all-time high, exceeding levels during the global food crisis in 2008, as Russia’s intensifying war in Ukraine cuts off one of the world’s top breadbaskets and delivers an extreme supply shock.

Prices have skyrocketed more than 60% in the past two weeks as the war effectively shut off more than a quarter of the world’s supply of the food staple used in everything from bread to cookies and noodles.

UN Team Sent to Moscow in Humanitarian Effort (1:45 a.m.)

A top United Nations official told the organization’s Security Council on Monday that a team had been sent to Moscow to help coordinate relief efforts in Ukraine with Russia’s military.

Martin Griffiths, under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator said the UN team would “work on better humanitarian civil-military coordination that can allow us to scale up precisely to begin to establish a humanitarian notification system.” The trip to Moscow, he added, followed a telephone conversation late last week between UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.

U.K. Lawmakers Vote to Speed ‘Dirty Money’ Sanctions (11:59 p.m.)

Britain’s House of Commons backed a measure that will speed up sanctions against Russian tycoons, after Home Secretary Priti Patel accused Putin allies of hiding “dirty money” in the country.

The legislation, which now moves to the upper house of parliament and could become law within days, will set up a register identifying the ultimate foreign owners of U.K. real estate, preventing them from hiding behind shell companies.

Homes, schools and hospitals have all come under attack, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell told an emergency session of the UN Security Council called to discuss the war’s humanitarian impact. “So many children have been deeply traumatized,” she said.

Beyond the immediate risks from the war, Russell cited a growing risk of child trafficking as parents and children get separated while evacuating conflict areas, and said special measures should be taken to help nearly 100,000 Ukrainian children who live in institutions and boarding homes.

Russian Top Energy Official Threatens NS1 Pipeline (9:29 p.m.)

Russian deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak threatened to cut off Russian natural gas supplies to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in retaliation for Germany’s decision to block operation of the new Nord Stream 2.

In a televised statement, Novak, also the country’s top energy official, said Russia hasn’t made the decision yet but has the full right to take a “mirror” action and put an embargo on gas supplies that come through the NS1 pipeline, which he said is working now “at its full capacity.”

Last month, Berlin shelved the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that was designed to bring steady gas supplies from Russia. His warning comes as Europe is vowing to cut its reliance on Russian gas by almost 80% this year.

U.S. Lawmakers Coalesce Around Oil Ban (9:12 p.m.)

Key U.S. lawmakers have reached a deal to bar imports of Russian oil into the U.S., paving the way for a rapid crackdown on crude from the country.

The framework agreement comes amid mounting pressure to enact a ban tightening economic pressure on Russia. The House of Representatives could vote on the proposal as soon as Wednesday, but President Joe Biden hasn’t endorsed the effort.

The U.S. is sending refueling tankers and about 500 more military personnel to Europe to bolster NATO’s defenses amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a senior defense official said Monday.

The U.S. reinforcements include air support operations going to Poland and Romania and ordnance and maintenance personnel heading to Germany, the official told reporters. That brings to about 100,000 the number of U.S. forces in Europe.

The defense official also said Russia has committed almost 100% of its troops that were massed around Ukraine into the conflict. Russian attacks have increasingly hit civilian infrastructure, but the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was unclear whether such attacks were deliberate.

China’s Wang Tells EU That Sanctions Won’t Work (7:01 p.m.)

EU Weighs Grain Import Waiver Amid War Shock (4:37 p.m.)

The EU could consider temporarily lifting a ban on imports of genetically modified grains from the U.S. and South America to help farmers struggling with supply disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine, Spain’s Agriculture Minister Luis Planas said in an interview with Bloomberg.

Spain and France have also proposed a waiver on agricultural goods with traces of herbicide to increase stocks and seek alternative suppliers of mainly corn, which is key for the production of animal feed. If adopted, the measures could mark a shift from the bloc’s “Farm to Fork” strategy that included objectives to increase organic production and cut pesticide use.

Orban Signs Order Allowing NATO Troops in Hungary (3:47 p.m)

Prime Minister Viktor Orban signed a government decree authorizing stationing of NATO troops in Hungary. Orban’s government, which is trying to balance its relationship with Russia and its alliances with Europe and the U.S., hasn’t specifically asked for NATO troops to help defend its border with Ukraine, saying it has sufficient military resources.

EU May Vow to End Reliance on Russian Energy (3:21 p.m.)

EU leaders may authorize the deepest ever overhaul of the continent’s energy security strategy by pledging to phase out the bloc’s reliance on Russian fossil fuels, according to a draft statement seen by Bloomberg.

Meeting for an informal summit in Versailles starting Thursday, the leaders are considering a joint declaration that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine demands a “thorough reassessment of how we ensure the security of our energy supplies.” The document may still change before the meeting.

Scholz Rules Out Russian Energy Ban in Near Term (2:40 p.m.)

Chancellor Olaf Scholzput the brakes on discussions about imposing restrictions on Russian oil and gas imports, saying that supplies from Russia are of “essential importance” to the European economy. Heating, transport and electricity cannot be secured otherwise, the German leader said.

While the EU faces an urgent task of finding alternatives to Russian energy supplies, “this won’t happen overnight,” Scholz said. “It’s therefore a conscious decision on our part to continue the activities of business enterprises in the area of energy supply with Russia.”

Russia Destroys Ukraine Atomic Lab (2:25 p.m.)

Russian forces destroyed an atomic-physics lab in Ukraine’s second-largest city, the head of the world’s nuclear watchdog said. The inventory of radioactive material at the site was small and monitors detected no radiation release.

Peskov said military operations will stop immediately if Kyiv meets those conditions and gives up fighting. Ukraine, which has enshrined its ambition to join NATO in its constitution, has rejected Russia’s demands.

European governments are close to readying a new set of sanctions against Russia, including potential action on ports and ships, sanctioning more individuals as well as further restrictions on technologies used in military equipment, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Some of the measures could come as early as Tuesday, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.

IAEA Suggests Talks on Nuclear Safety (12:05 p.m.)

International nuclear monitors said they’re willing to meet with Ukraine and Russian officials to discuss the deteriorating safety situation. “It can be anywhere as long as it facilitates this necessary and urgent action,” International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Monday in Vienna.

The comments come after Russia rejected the IAEA’s initial proposal to convene a meeting at the defunct Chernobyl power plant. Russia is prepared to hold a virtual meeting or convene with Ukraine officials in a third country, Moscow’s envoy Mikhail Ulyanov said in a tweet. The IAEA reiterated warnings that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine risks triggering a nuclear safety incident.

Russia has threatened to close a major gas pipeline to Germany and warned of $300 oil prices if the West goes ahead with a ban on its energy exports. ""It is absolutely clear that a rejection of Russian oil would lead to catastrophic consequences for the global market,"" Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Monday in an address on state television. ""The surge in prices would be unpredictable. It would be $300 per barrel if not more.""

Novak also cited Germany's decision last month to halt the certification of the highly contentious Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, saying: ""We have every right to take a matching decision and impose an embargo on gas pumping through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline."" ""So far, we are not taking such a decision,"" Novak said. ""But European politicians with their statements and accusations against Russia push us towards that."" His comments come with Russia's onslaught of Ukraine well into its second week, with the already dire humanitarian crisis expected to worsen as the Kremlin continues its invasion. The U.N. has said 1.7 million refugees have left Ukraine since Russia's invasion of the country began on Feb. 24, describing it as ""the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II."" The U.S. has been considering whether to impose a ban on Russia's oil and gas exports as a way of punishing Moscow. Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. have appeared to back away from a coordinated Western embargo on Russian energy exports, however.

Energy analysts have warned that a ban on Russia's oil and gas would have seismic repercussions for energy markets and the world economy. Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer, behind the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, and the world's largest exporter of crude to global markets. It is also a major producer and exporter of natural gas. The European Union receives around 40% of its gas via Russian pipelines, several of which run through Ukraine.

Novak: 'We are ready for it'

""European politicians need to honestly warn their citizens and consumers what to expect,"" Novak said. ""If you want to reject energy supplies from Russia, go ahead. We are ready for it. We know where we could redirect the volumes to,"" he added, without providing further details. Oil prices soared to 14-year highs on Monday, as energy market participants focused on the prospect of full sanctions on Russia's energy exports. International benchmark Brent crude futures rose 2.1% to trade at $125.75 a barrel on Tuesday morning in London, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were 2% higher at $121.83.

European policymakers are under immense pressure to bring a swift end to their dependence on Russian fossil fuels, particularly as energy-importing countries continue to refill President Vladimir Putin's war chest with oil and gas revenue on a daily basis. Indeed, revenue from Russian oil and gas was seen to be responsible for roughly 43% of the Kremlin's federal budget between 2011 and 2020, highlighting how fossil fuels play a central role for the Russian government. Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has called on Western allies to impose a ""full embargo"" on Russian oil and gas, saying via Twitter that ""buying them now means paying for the murder of Ukrainian men, women and children.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told NBC on Sunday that President Joe Biden's administration was in ""very active discussions"" with European governments about banning imports of Russian crude and natural gas. Western sanctions imposed on Russia over the invasion have so far been carefully constructed to avoid directly hitting the country's energy exports, although there are already signs the measures are inadvertently prompting banks and traders to shun Russian crude.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday pushed back against calls to ban Russian oil and gas, saying such a move could put Europe's energy security at risk and imports from Russia were critically important to citizens' daily lives. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to align himself with Germany's Scholz in backing away from plans to impose an oil embargo on Russia. ""You can't simply close down use of oil and gas overnight, even from Russia. That's obviously not something that every country around the world can do,"" Johnson said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/08/russia-warns-of-300-oil-if-ban-goes-ahead-threatens-to-cut-off-european-gas.html

8,e4ae40df-8f47-4b29-aec1-38b75208d416,[],,"The German government is worried about the growing number of countries curbing food exports as the Ukraine crisis causes tight supplies and a sharp rise in world commodity prices, junior agriculture minister Silvia Bender said on Thursday. She was speaking ahead of a meeting of agriculture ministers of the G7 group of nations which Germany will host on Friday. Germany currently holds the G7 presidency.

""I am certainly concerned that some countries are planning to shut down their markets,"" Bender said. ""I believe that the crisis facing us can only be solved if we all show a high level of solidarity in the community of nations to prevent disruption to global food supply networks."" A number of countries worldwide have announced food export restrictions or are considering bans to protect their domestic supplies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow terms a ""special operation"".

The G7 agriculture ministers will discuss the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine for global food security. ""I think one goal for Friday's meeting...will be to strongly support world markets being kept open,"" Bender said.

Russia and Ukraine contribute nearly 30% of global wheat exports along with large volumes of animal feed grains and edible oils. But Ukraine's export shipments have been stopped and Russia's have been massively cut by the conflict. Wheat prices hit 14-year highs after the fighting started. Germany is also concerned about the serious extra financial burden to importers, especially developing countries, with very heavy extra costs faced by food aid agencies such as the World Food Programme, Bender said.
