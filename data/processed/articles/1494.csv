As a reminder -

Just so people know and understand. Information from war zones can become confusing as there will no doubt be info released from the players (on both sides) involved that might not necessarily be true.

As such take everything as a possibility and NOT as absolute truth.

The very first casualty in a war is the truth and all warfare is based on deception

As of April 1, forces of Russia and the people’s republics of the Donbass continue their offensive operations in the east of Ukraine.

According to the recent statement by the Russian Defense Ministry, units of the Lugansk People’s Republic blockaded the northern outskirts of Kremennaya and the eastern outskirts of Metelkino northwest of the Severodonetsk-Lysichansk agglomeration.

In the recent advance, LPR forces reportedly destroyed up to 40 members of 57th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, 1 artillery battery, 2 IFVs and 4 vehicles.

Fighting also continued in the area of the Severodonetsk-Lysichansk agglomeration itself. Nonetheless, it seems that in the current situation LPR troops supported by Russian units are mostly focused on blocking Lysichansk from the western direction rather than storming the city itself. The advance also continued in the direction of Slovyansk from the area of Izum where the Russian Armed Forces achieved an important tactical success.

The city of Popasnaya remains in the hands of Kyiv’s forces and also should be cleared before the further push towards Slovyansk through Bahmut from the southeastern direction.

The town of Nikolske in DPR after strikes by Kyiv’s forces:

In the advance towards the Ukrainian defense line Mariinka-Ugledar, DPR troops achieved no notable successes. These well fortified positions slow down the advance of Russian-led forces. In the current configuration of the frontline it is likely that DPR and Russia will work to block these areas before destroying the grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces there.

Intense clashes continue in Mariupol. The remaining grouping of Kyiv’s forces surrounded there show fierce resistance. Nonetheless, its fate predetermined, especially in the case of the increased attention of the Russian side to covert operations involving Ukrainian helicopters.

‘Fancy cars’ in Mariupol:

The frontline in the area of Kharkiv city in the region of Kharkiv remains stable and the Russian side undertakes little active offensive actions. This stabilization of the frontline allowed the Kyiv side to regroup its forces and carry out a successful strike with military helicopters on an oil depot in Russia’s Belgorod. Later on the same day, Russian air defense forces were once again activated in the area. Allegedly, they intercepted a Ukrainian missile there.

At the same time, the Russian Armed Forces continued strikes on military infrastructure of Ukraine. On April 1, the Russian side reported that the new round of missile strikes destroyed 6 Ukrainian military facilities, including five ammunition and missile-artillery weapons depots in Boguslavskoe, Krestishe, Reznikov, Velikaya Novoselka and a fuel depot.

The Defense Ministry added that air defence means of the Russian Aerospace Forces shot down 1 Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter near Lyubimovka and 8 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles near Lisichansk, Donetsk, Chernigov, Korosun and Novomikhailovskoe, including 1 Bayraktar TB-2 near Vakhovka.

Russian Operational-tactical and army aviation hit 52 military assets of Ukraine, including 3 command posts, 3 multiple launch rocket systems, Buk-M1 anti-aircraft complex, illumination and guidance radar of S-300 anti-aircraft missile system, as well as 10 areas of military equipment concentration and 16 AFU strong points.

According to the Russian side, since the start of the operation, Russian forces have destroyed 124 aircraft and 81 helicopters, 353 unmanned aerial vehicles, 1,839 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 202 multiple launch rocket systems, 773 field artillery and mortars, as well as 1,711 units of special military vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The changing configuration of the frontline near Kyiv and Chernihiv as well as reports about the regrouping of Russian forces there may indicate that the Russian military is adjusting its current approach and planning to redeploy forces to focus on particular targets. Earlier, reports appeared that the Russian side was not planning to storm Kyiv city itself in the near future. Therefore, this redeployment of forces may mark the upcoming intensification of offensive operations in the east.
