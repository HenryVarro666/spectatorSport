NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:



Foreign Minister Kuleba,

Dear Dmytro,

Welcome to NATO.

It is always a great pleasure to welcome you here.

And let me start by expressing how much we admire your courage, your leadership.

You personally, but also the Government of Ukraine, the people of Ukraine.

And, of course, the bravery and the courage of Ukrainian armed forces.

What you do every day, standing up against the Russian aggression, is something that inspires the whole world.

And as you know, NATO Allies have provided support for Ukraine for many years.

Trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops.

And now Allies are providing equipment, support to you to uphold your right for self defence.

A right which is enshrined in the UN Charter.

And it is an urgent need to further support Ukraine.

And at our meeting later on with the NATO Foreign Ministers, I am certain that we will address the need for more air defence systems, anti-tank weapons, lighter, but also heavier weapons, and many different types of support to Ukraine.

NATO also has a responsibility to, of course, protect and defend all Allies.

So we have since the invasion of Ukraine stepped up our military presence in eastern part of the Alliance.

And we are making sure that there is no room for misunderstanding, miscalculation in Moscow about our readiness to protect and defend all Allies.

You being here provides us with the very good opportunity to sit down with you.

To listen to your assessment, your analysis.

And together, discuss the way forward, how we can further support Ukraine.

So dear, Dmytro, please, welcome.

It is good to have you here.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba:

Good morning.

Thank you, Jens, for welcoming me.

I came to Brussels to participate in the NATO ministerial.

And to hold bilateral meetings with Allies.

My agenda is very simple.

It only has three items on it.

It’s weapons, weapons, and weapons.

We are confident that the best way to help Ukraine now is to provide it with all necessary to contain Putin, and to defeat Russian army in Ukraine, in the territory of Ukraine, so that the war does not spill over further.

In the recent month, in the recent weeks Ukrainian army and the entire Ukrainian nation has demonstrated that we know how to fight.

We know how to win.

But without sustainable and sufficient supplies of all weapons requested by Ukraine, these wins will be accompanied with enormous sacrifices.

The more weapons we get, and the sooner they arrive in Ukraine, the more human lives will be saved.

The more cities and villages will not be destructed.

And there will be no more Buchas.

This is my message to the Allies.

It is very simple.

And I call on all Allies to put aside their hesitations.

Their reluctance to provide Ukraine with everything it needs.

Because, as weird as it may sound, but today weapons serve the purpose of peace.

Thank you.

Question 1: Secretary General, are you ready or are Allies ready to send more offensive weapons to Ukraine? And one question to the Minister. Do you think that Germany is doing enough?

NATO Secretary General: Allies are sending many different types of weapons. And I think also we need to realize that Allies have supported Ukraine for many years. And these weapons, so the support we have provided is proving its importance on the battleground every day. We can see all the Russian armor that has been destroyed. We have seen the Russian planes being shut down. And of course, this is first and foremost because of the bravery, the commitment and the courage of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. But the equipment that has been supplied is of course also of vital importance. I have urged Allies to provide further support of many different types of systems. Both the light weapons but also heavier weapons. It is as Foreign Minister Kuleba states, Ukraine needs weapons to defend its own country. And this is actually defensive self-defence also, of course, with advanced weapon systems. So I expect this to be one important issue at the meeting today.

Minister Kuleba: When it comes to Ukraine, there should be no such difference as between defensive weapons and offensive weapons. Because every weapon used in the territory of Ukraine, by the Ukrainian army, against a foreign aggressor is defensive by definition. So this distinction between defensive and offensive doesn't make any sense when it comes to the situation in my country. And those countries who are saying we will provide Ukraine with defensive weapons but we are not in a position to provide them with offensive weapons, they are hypocritical. This is simply unfair, unjustified approach.

Germany, as you perfectly know has made a revolutionary step in changing its position from not agreeing to supply any weapons at all, to allowing certain supplies and providing Ukraine in particular with anti-tank weapons. However, it's clear that Germany can do more given its reserves, reserves and capacity and we are working with the German government on providing us with additional weapons. The issue that concerns me the most is the length of procedures and decision making in Berlin. Because while Berlin has time, Kyiv doesn't.

Question 2: Minister, what do you think about the most recent sanctions proposals?

Minister Kuleba: Well, I hope they will be applied in full. This is definitely a step forward. A week ago, the sanctions proposals were much weaker, to say the least. We were very unhappy about it. We were working with partners in G7 and in the European Union to ensure that sanction pressure is stepped up. We succeeded, but I cannot say that we succeeded 100%. We will continue to insist on full oil and gas embargo for Russia, on de-SWIFTing all Russian banks, on making sure that all ports are closed for Russian vessels and Russian goods with the minimal number of exemptions from it based on humanitarian grounds.

And frankly speaking, I hope we will never face a situation again, when to step up the sanctions pressure you need, we need atrocities like Bucha to be revealed and to impress and to shock other partners to the extent that they sit down and say okay, fine, we will introduce new sanctions. I don't believe that Ukrainians have to pay with their lives, health and sufferings for the political will of partners to impose sanctions.

Question 3: Minister, what kind of weapons exactly do you need? Is it planes, long ranging missiles? What exactly are you asking for?

Minister Kuleba: Planes, short to vessel missiles, personnel armored vehicles, heavy air defence systems.

Question 4: Foreign Minister, I would like to ask you, you say: weapons, weapons, weapons are your priorities today. For you on a personal note, how difficult would it be when some of the NATO Allies tell you that they can't give you some weapons because they don't want to plunge the West into a wider war with Russia? And just a word on the support Britain is giving your country.

And Secretary General, can you just remind us what has changed in the last few days in light of the horrors we've seen? And do you think partners in NATO, their minds will be changed today from what you'll hear from the minister?

Minister Kuleba: Yes, there are two ways of approaching the issue of weapons supplies. The first one is when you do not want to supply anything, you come up with the argument: we don't have to do it because it will pull us or NATO as a whole into the war. The second approach is completely different. This line of thinking is completely different. We will provide Ukraine with all necessary weapons so that we, neither we nor NATO as a whole, will have to fight in this war, because Ukrainians will do it for us. I think the deal that Ukraine is offering is fair. You give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives and the war is contained in Ukraine. This is it. The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of providing Ukraine with all necessary assistance and we deeply appreciate that help.

NATO Secretary General: I think fundamentally, what we have seen over the last days is the brutality of this war. And that has just highlighted the importance of support to Ukraine. And therefore I think it is important that we have Minister Kuleba here today to meet all NATO Allies and to discuss how we can further support Ukraine.

NATO Allies are providing many different types of weapons also heavier systems, advanced systems, and also systems that can shoot down planes and of course attack Russian armour. And it is exactly as Minister Kuleba said that, you know, Ukraine is fighting the defensive war. So this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons doesn't actually have any real meaning in defensive war as Ukraine is fighting. What we also have seen is, of course, that we need both the support with weapons but also to step up sanctions. And therefore, I also welcome the fact that NATO Allies are now in the process of stepping up further sanctions on Russia.

NATO provides support to Ukraine but NATO is not sending troops to be on the ground. And we also have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from escalating beyond Ukraine and become even more deadly, even more dangerous and destructive. So we are providing support but at the same time, working hard to prevent the escalation of the conflict.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_194508.htm
1,ce55a60f-8270-40ec-865e-b3cd7338d293,[],2022-03-16 00:00:00,"President Biden today announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine to $1 billion in just the past week, and a total of $2 billion since the start of the Biden Administration. The assistance will take the form of direct transfers of equipment from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military to help them defend their country against Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion.



The new $800 million assistance package includes:

800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;

2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems;

100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems;

100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns;

Over 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds;

25,000 sets of body armor; and

25,000 helmets.

In addition to the weapons listed above, previous United States assistance committed to Ukraine includes:

Over 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;

Approximately 2,600 Javelin anti-armor systems;

Five Mi-17 helicopters;

Three patrol boats;

Four counter-artillery and counter-unmanned aerial system tracking radars;

Four counter-mortar radar systems;

200 grenade launchers and ammunition;

200 shotguns and 200 machine guns;

Nearly 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition and over 1 million grenade, mortar, and artillery rounds;

70 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) and other vehicles;

Secure communications, electronic warfare detection systems, body armor, helmets, and other tactical gear;

Military medical equipment to support treatment and combat evacuation;

Explosive ordnance disposal and demining equipment; and

Satellite imagery and analysis capability.

In addition to the U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the Ukrainians have been using to great effect, the United States has also identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire additional, longer-range systems on which Ukraine’s forces are already trained, as well as additional munitions for those systems.

The United States continues to expedite the authorization and facilitation of additional assistance to Ukraine from our Allies. At least 30 countries have provided security assistance to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. In 2022, the Department of State authorized third-party transfers of defensive equipment from more than 14 countries, a number that continues to grow as Allies and Partners increase support to Ukraine.

The latest addition brings the overall US military assistance provided to Ukraine since Russia invaded its neighbouring country on February 24 to $2.6bn. It comes as Russian forces have retreated from northern Ukraine amid a shift in strategy to focus on the eastern Donbas region.

Biden on Wednesday said the latest package “will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine”.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the list of equipment came “directly out of multiple conversations with Ukrainians in the last few days”.

Here’s what’s in the latest package:

For the first time, the US will provide towed 155mm howitzer cannons and 40,000 artillery rounds to Ukraine.

Kirby said the weapons are “reflective of the kind of fighting that the Ukrainians are expecting to be faced with here in this more confined geographic area” of Donbas, noting Ukraine specifically asked for artillery “fire support”.

The US will give an additional 500 Javelin anti-tank missiles, shoulder-mounted weapons officials have said have proven particularly effective in stopping the Russian advance. It will also provide 300 more Switchblade drones, a single-use weapon that can fly directly at a target.

The package includes an additional 10 AN/TPQ-36 radars, which are designed to detect and track incoming artillery, rocket fire and mortar, as well as two more AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel air surveillance radars, which are used to detect incoming aircraft.

The US will triple the number of Mi-17 helicopters it has provided Ukraine to date, adding 11 Mi-17 helicopters to the five already provided earlier in the year.

The package also includes 100 armoured Humvees, body armour and helmets, 2,000 optics and laser rangefinders, and demolition equipment.

The list also includes “unmanned coastal defense vessels”, although the Pentagon did not elaborate on what that item pertains to.

What has the US previously given?

Last month, the Pentagon said it would send 800 Stinger anti-aircraft weapons alongside thousands of anti-tank weapons, including 2,000 Javelin systems.

It also said it would provide 100 tactical unmanned aerial systems, or drones, as well as an array of lighter weapons – 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 shotguns – and additional body armour, helmets and ammunition.

The US had previously provided Ukraine with more than 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems and about 2,600 Javelin weapons.

Besides the Mi-17 helicopters, it had also given three patrol boats, an array of smaller arms and several radar systems to track artillery, mortar and drone attacks.

EU readies new round of sanctions including on coal

BRUSSELS, April 7 (Reuters) - The United States will send new weapon systems to Ukraine, Washington's top diplomat said on Thursday after NATO foreign ministers agreed to accelerate arms deliveries in response to Russia's invasion.

Urged by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to end bureaucracy-driven delays, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States and 30 other countries were sending weapons to Ukraine and that that process would intensify.

""We're not going to let anything stand in the way of getting Ukrainians what they need, and what we believe, to be effective,"" Blinken said.

He spoke of ""new systems"" that have so far not been provided by NATO allies, but declined to go into details.

NATO diplomats said that meant, in part, helping Ukraine transition from its Soviet-era arsenal to more modern weapons.

Blinken said the United States had already agreed to send Kyiv anti-aircraft systems, shoulder-held anti-tank weapons and armoured vehicles.

Asking for planes, land-based anti-ship missiles, armoured vehicles and air defence systems, Kuleba made his plea to a special session at NATO headquarters.

Headdressed his counterparts from NATO's 30 members plus the European Union, Finland, Sweden, Japan, New Zealand and Australia, urging Germany in particular to speed up deliveries, saying procedures were taking too long in Berlin.

""I think the deal that Ukraine is offering is fair. You give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives, and the war is contained in Ukraine,"" Kuleba said.

After six weeks of a war that Moscow describes as a ""special military operation"", Ukraine says Russia continues to shell eastern cities following its forces'withdrawal from around Kyiv.

Kuleba also reiterated a demand that the EU stop buying Russian oil and gas, as the bloc promised a fifth round of sanctions against Moscow by Friday.

""We will continue to insist on a full oil and gas embargo,"" Kuleba said.

'PUTIN'S CALCULUS'

Outrage over killings of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha near Kyiv - where Russia denies any wrongdoing and says evidence was fabricated - appears to have galvanised Western support.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said a fifth package of sanctions, including a ban on coal, would be agreed on Thursday or Friday, while EU lawmakers voted in a non-binding resolution for ""an immediate full embargo"" on Russian energy imports.

But Blinken, whilesaying he had a strong sense that Europeans were committed to ending their dependency on Russian energy, also conceded that that could not be as quick as ""flipping a light switch.""

The bloc's high level of dependency on Russian oil and particularly gas makes a broader energy embargo - which would cut off a significant source of revenue for Moscow's war - unlikely for the time being.

Blinken said reports of rape and executions in Bucha would not impact peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia as much as whether Moscow thought peace was worth pursuing.

""I don't think in a sense, Bucha has anything to do with that. It has everything to do with what President (Vladimir) Putin's calculus is, what he decides,"" Blinken said.

BRUSSELS (AP) — Spurred into action by reports of atrocities in Ukraine, NATO countries agreed Thursday to ramp up the supply of weapons to Kyiv, including hi-tech arms, amid concerns that Russia is about to launch a large offensive in Ukrarine’s eastern Donbas region.

NATO, as an organization, refuses to send troops or weapons to Ukraine or impose a no-fly zone over it to keep the trans-Atlantic military group from being drawn into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia. Individual NATO countries, however, have provided anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, as well as equipment and medical supplies.

“There was a clear message from the meeting today that allies should do more, and are ready to do more, to provide more equipment, and they realize and recognize the urgency,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said after chairing a meeting of allied foreign ministers in Brussels.

Stoltenberg declined to say which countries were stepping up supplies or what kinds of equipment they might send, but he said: “Rest assured, allies are providing a wide range of different weapons systems, both Soviet-era systems but also modern equipment.”

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the “sickening images and accounts coming out of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine” have strengthened the West’s resolve to punish Russia and step up support for Ukraine.

Blinken said the United States is “looking across the board right now not only at what we provided, and what we continue to provide, but whether there are additional systems that could make a difference.”

One of the drawbacks of sending modern arms is that Ukrainian troops would have to learn how to to use them, but some NATO nations raised the possibility of providing training outside of the war-ravaged country.

Britain was also outspoken about its intentions.

“We’ve agreed to step up support for Ukraine and we’ve also recognized that the conflict has entered a new and different phase with a more concentrated Russian offensive,” British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.

“There was support for countries to supply new and heavier equipment to Ukraine so that they can respond to these new threats from Russia. We’ve agreed to help Ukrainian forces move from their Soviet-era equipment to NATO-standard equipment on a bilateral basis,” Truss said.

After talks with his NATO counterparts, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he was cautiously optimistic that some countries would boost weapons supplies to his nation. But he warned that those arms must get to Ukraine quickly, with Russia set to attack more widely in the east.

“Either you help us now — and I’m speaking about days, not weeks — or your help will come too late,” Kuleba said his message was to NATO countries. Asked what more his country was seeking, Kuleba listed planes, land-based missiles, armored vehicles and air defense systems.

He also criticized some Western countries for failing to impose sanctions quickly enough, or of acting too late, highlighting his point with the reports of war crimes in the northern town of Bucha.

“How many Buchas have to take place for you to impose sanctions? How many children, women, men, have to die,” Kuleba said, “for you to understand that you cannot allow sanctions fatigue, as we cannot allow fighting fatigue?”

Some NATO countries sending weapons have been making a distinction about what kind of support they can provide, saying Ukraine should only receive arms for defensive purposes and not offensive weapons like war planes or tanks.

But Stoltenberg rejected the rhetorical arguments. “Ukraine is fighting a defensive war, so this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons doesn’t actually have any real meaning,” he said.

Stoltenberg said he has “urged allies to provide further support of many different types of systems, both light weapons but also heavier weapons.”

Despite the allegations of Russian war crimes and warnings that more atrocities might emerge, it appears unlikely, at least for now, that the world’s biggest security alliance will agree as an organization to arm Ukraine and help end Europe’s biggest land war since World War II.

“Either you help us now – and I’m speaking about days, not weeks – or your help will come too late, and many people will die,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told a meeting of his counterparts in the alliance in Brussels on Thursday.

Kuleba said he expected Nato members to send Kyiv the weapons it needed, including air defence systems, artillery, armoured vehicles and jets, but insisted they must act fast while Moscow refocuses its offensive on the Donbas region.

“I have no doubts that Ukraine will have weapons necessary to fight,” he said. “The question is the timeline. The battle for Donbas will remind you of the second world war with large operations, thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.”

The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters the alliance had agreed to strengthen support to Ukraine, was providing “a wide range” of weapon systems, and would also provide cybersecurity assistance and equipment to protect against chemical and biological threats.

He said there was no sign the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, intended to pull back. “We have no indications he has changed his overall goal, and that is to control Ukraine and to achieve significant military victories on the battleground,” he said

“What we see is Russian regrouping and repositioning. We expect a big battle in Donbas. We are prepared for the long haul. This war may last for weeks, but also months, and possibly also for years. And therefore we need to prepare for a lot more.”

In a rare admission that Ukraine had already inflicted considerable damage on Russia’s invading forces, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov admitted in an interview with Sky News that Moscow had suffered “significant losses” since the start of the invasion, adding: “It’s a huge tragedy for us”. He did not specify a casualty toll.

With peace talks between Russia and Ukraine continuing by video, Turkey, which has hosted two meetings between the sides, said images of what appeared to be deliberate civilian killings in Bucha and towns in the Kyiv area had “overshadowed” negotiations and ruined an “emerging positive atmosphere”.

Pictures and video of dead civilians, some with their hands bound, in the streets of Bucha after it was recaptured from Russian invaders have sparked international revulsion and renewed calls from Ukraine for more weapons and tougher sanctions.

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday that Kyiv had presented Moscow with a draft peace deal containing “unacceptable” elements and deviated from previously agreed proposals, but Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, dismissed the comments as “purely propagandistic” and aimed at diverting attention from events in Bucha.

A day after a new round of western sanctions was announced, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said they did not go far enough and that Russia would see them as “permission to attack”. Some politicians were still “unable to decide how to limit the flow of … oil euros to Russia so as not to put their economies at risk”, he said.

The west must “bring Russia to justice”, Zelenskiy told the Greek parliament, and teach Moscow that “those who blackmail Europe with an economic and energy crisis always lose”. Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office, said sanctions “must be ruinous enough for us to end this terrible war”.

On Thursday evening Zelenskiy said that the situation in the town of Borodyanka was “significantly more dreadful” than in nearby Bucha.

“The work to clear the rubble in Borodyanka has begun … it’s significantly more dreadful there. Even more victims from the Russian occupiers,” he said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging service. The town is about 15 miles from Bucha.

The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc should approve its fifth round of economic sanctions, including a ban on Russian coal imports worth about €4bn (£3.3bn), by Friday and that measures against Russian oil would be discussed by foreign ministers on Monday.

“Sooner or later, I hope sooner, it will happen,” he said. Zelenskiy is due to hold talks with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in Kyiv on Friday, the Ukrainian government confirmed, adding that no advance details of the talks would be announced for security reasons.

But while it welcomed the fresh sanctions announced by the EU, Britain and the US – which targeted two daughters of Vladimir Putin as well as Russia’s biggest public and private banks – Ukraine insisted that Europe in particular must go further.

“We will continue to insist on a full oil and gas embargo for Russia,” Kuleba said. “I hope we will never face a situation again when to step up the sanctions pressure we need atrocities like Bucha to be revealed.”

He stressed the vital importance of weapon supplies as well as sanctions, saying the deal Ukraine was offering was fair: “you give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives, and the war is contained in Ukraine”. He added: “My agenda is very simple. It has only three items on it. It’s weapons, weapons and weapons.”

EU sources said Europe’s ban on Russian coal imports – the key measure in its latest sanctions – would not take effect until August, a month later than previously proposed after pressure from Germany, the bloc’s top importer of Russian coal. The UK is due to ban Russian coal by the end of the year.

Punitive measures on oil and gas, however, which are far more significant imports, have divided the EU27, with member states more dependent on imports from Russia afraid of the economic consequences. Russia accounts for about 40% of the EU’s natural gas consumption and a third of its oil imports.

Ukraine on Thursday accused Hungary, which has said it is prepared to pay in roubles for Russian gas, of adopting an “unfriendly” position. “If Hungary really wants to help end the war, here’s how to do it: stop destroying unity in the EU,” foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko said.

Budapest should “support new anti-Russian sanctions, provide military assistance to Ukraine, and not create additional sources of funding for Russia’s military machine”, he added. “It is never too late to get on the right side of history.”

Putin called Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has long sought a rapprochement with Moscow, to congratulate him after his party won a fourth consecutive term in general elections last week. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said a subsequent proposal by Budapest to host peace talks “looks cynical”.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/ukraine-calls-for-weapons-weapons-weapons-from-western-allies

Members of the NATO military alliance have been supplying Kyiv with weapons ever since Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February. The U.S., for instance, has supplied anti-aircraft Stingers, thousands of anti-tank weapons and millions of rounds of ammunition.

However, for Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba, this is not enough.

""My agenda is very simple. It only has three items on it. It's weapons, weapons, and weapons,"" Kuleba said as he arrived in Brussels, Belgium for a meeting with NATO members.

BRUSSELS — The top Ukrainian diplomat made a pointed appeal to NATO on Thursday to expedite arms supplies to Ukrainian forces, weaponry he said is urgently needed before Russia launches an expected offensive in the eastern part of the country.

ArrowRight Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called for swift action at a meeting of senior officials from across the Western alliance, where he put forward what he said was a threefold agenda: “weapons, weapons, weapons.”

“The more weapons we get, and the sooner they arrive in Ukraine, the more human lives will be saved,” Kuleba said before the meeting. “The more cities and villages will not be destructed. And there will be no more Buchas,” he said, referring to the Kyiv suburb where the withdrawal of Russian troops revealed horrific scenes of human suffering, including the bodies of civilians who appeared to have been tortured and summarily executed.

“I call on all allies to put aside their hesitations, their reluctance to provide Ukraine with everything it needs,” Kuleba continued. “Because, as weird as it may sound, but today weapons serve the purpose of peace.”

Secretary of State Antony Blinken the United States and its allies are considering sending more weapons but did not make a specific announcement. “We’re looking day in and day out at what we believe they most need, to include new systems that have not heretofore been provided,” he said at a news conference in Brussels. “We’re not going to let anything stand in the way of getting Ukrainians what they need and what we believe can be effective,” he said.

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said NATO allies had agreed to step up support by providing “new and heavier equipment” to Ukraine. “We have agreed to help Ukraine move from their Soviet-era equipment to NATO-standard equipment on a bilateral basis,” she said, without providing specifics on what might be shipped or when.

Kuleba said forces loyal to Kyiv, struggling to gain an upper hand against the larger Russian military, require aircraft, armored vehicles, missiles and additional air defense systems. NATO countries have provided an increasing array of arms since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in February, including antiaircraft missiles, tanks and kamikaze drones. But alliance members, nervous that Russia might launch a retaliatory attack against NATO territory, have stopped short of sending fighter jets or establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Kuleba told reporters after the meetings that he was confident additional kinds of weaponry would eventually be provided but said he was concerned they would not be sent fast enough. He said he had given NATO ministers a request with a specific timeline.

Meeting stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces, Russia has pulled troops back from positions around Kyiv and turned them toward southern and eastern Ukraine. Kuleba said the expected Russian offensive focused on the eastern Donbas region could resemble World War II with large military maneuvers involving thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and aircraft.

“This is why it is so urgent for allies not to, how to put it mildly, not to tell us that they’re still thinking that they have to do all the procedures, that there are remaining issues that have to be sorted out before they make decisions,” he said. “Either you help us now, and I’m speaking about days not weeks, or your help will come too late. And many people will die, many civilians will lose their homes, many villages will be destroyed exactly because this help came too late.”

This blunt appeal in Brussels echoed the approach other Ukrainian leaders, particularly President Volodymyr Zelensky, have taken as they seek to rally the world against the assault led by Russian President Vladimir Putin by using direct criticism of anything less than full support for Ukraine and identifying nations that fail to meet that mark.

Earlier in the day, Kuleba named Germany as an example of nations that have held back from giving as much military support as they might provide. “While Berlin has time, Kyiv doesn’t,” he said. “I think the deal that Ukraine is offering is fair. You give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives, and the war is contained in Ukraine,” he said. “This is it.

Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former commander of U.S. Army Europe, said the support of allies is critical as the war enters a “decisive new phase.” Ukrainian forces are running low on ammunition, he said. While allies are becoming more willing to send weapons, what has been sent so far is “not enough,” he said.

“The administration and NATO need to talk about winning, about helping Ukraine win, not just about avoiding losing, or preventing Russia from winning,” he said. Winning, according to Hodges, would mean a return to the lines before the war and rendering Russia unable to resume its offensive. “We need to see a sense of urgency,” he said, “something like the Berlin airlift.”

Divisions among Western nations about how far to go with military aid to Ukraine are also visible in the economic arena, as some countries call for more drastic action to deprive Russia of energy income, while others balk at steps that could increase the burden felt by European consumers.

The European Union this week proposed a ban on Russian coal imports, but the bloc has yet to halt the purchases of Russian oil and natural gas that continue to provide Moscow a valuable flow of cash. Ukraine has condemned that position and has called for, on top of a slew of global sanctions already in place, all Russian banks to be cut off from the global financial system.

The Biden administration on Wednesday announced new measures targeting Putin’s adult children and additional Russian banks. Blinken said Thursday that he sees a growing commitment from Europe to end its dependence on Russian energy.

“We’ve seen again and again Russia use energy as a weapon, as political leverage, and of course the proceeds it gets from the sale of its energy is now, yes, helping to fuel its aggression against Ukraine,” he said. “But it’s not like flipping a light switch. You have to do it methodically. ” he said. “You have to put in place the necessary alternatives.”

Images of mass graves and civilian corpses lying in the streets of Bucha, a city in the Kyiv region, have prompted international outrage. Even before those atrocities were revealed, the Biden administration announced last month a formal assessment that Russian forces were committing war crimes in Ukraine.

“The sickening images and accounts coming out of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine have only strengthened our collective resolve and unity,” Blinken said Thursday.

In a further sign of global anger at Russia, the NATO meeting was attended by ministers from Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, Georgia, Finland and Sweden. After talks on the sidelines of the NATO meeting, ministers from the Group of Seven bloc called for Russia’s suspension from the U.N. Human Rights Council. The U.N. General Assembly subsequently voted in favor of that suspension.

In remarks posted Wednesday on the State Department’s Telegram channel as part of an attempt to reach a Russian audience, Blinken said arms provided by Western nations have been instrumental in blocking Russia’s attempt to seize Kyiv.

The Biden administration has announced weapons transfers to Ukraine including, most recently, $100 million of Javelin antitank missiles. “What we’re focused on is making sure that we get to Ukraine the systems that they can use now and use effectively,” Blinken said.

“At the same time, we’re looking at other systems, some of them larger and more sophisticated, that may be useful and important going forward, but where, for example, Ukrainians need to be trained, because some of these systems, you can’t just turn them over and have them be used immediately,” Blinken said.

Speaking to reporters, Kuleba said nations that cited the need for lengthy training had slowed the supply of weapons unnecessarily, because if they had signed off on such systems at the beginning of the war, they would already be in Ukrainian hands.

Asked about a video circulating that appeared to show Ukrainian troops executing a Russian service member, Kuleba said Ukrainian forces respect the laws of war and that the incident would be investigated. He seemed to grow emotional as he described how Ukrainians are responding to abuses occurring during the war.

“You don’t understand how it feels to see pictures from Bucha, talking to people who escaped, knowing that the person you know was raped four days in a row,” he said. “You don’t understand how it feels that Russian soldiers rape children. This is not an excuse to those who violate the rules of war on either side of the front line. But there are some things which you simply can’t understand, I’m sorry.”
