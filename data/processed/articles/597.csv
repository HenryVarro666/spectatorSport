The route out of the eastern city of Sumy was one of five promised by the Russians to offer civilians a way to escape the Russian onslaught.

Even as video posted by the Ukrainian state communications agency showed people with bags boarding buses, it was not clear how long the effort would last. Previous attempts to lead civilians to safety amid the biggest ground war in Europe since World War II have crumbled with renewed attacks.

“The Ukrainian city of Sumy was given a green corridor, the first stage of evacuation began,” the Ukrainian state communications agency tweeted. Sumy is just 50 kilometers (30 miles) from the Russian border.

According to Ukraine’s rescue services, at least 21 people were killed by a Russian airstrike in Sumy late Monday.

With the invasion well into its second week, Russian troops have made significant advances in southern Ukraine but stalled in some other regions. Ukrainian soldiers and volunteers fortified the capital, Kyiv, with hundreds of checkpoints and barricades designed to thwart a takeover. A steady rain of shells and rockets fell on other population centers, including the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where the mayor reported heavy artillery fire.

“We can’t even gather up the bodies because the shelling from heavy weapons doesn’t stop day or night,” Mayor Anatol Fedoruk said. “Dogs are pulling apart the bodies on the city streets. It’s a nightmare.”

In one of the most desperate cities, the encircled southern port of Mariupol, an estimated 200,000 people — nearly half the population of 430,000 — were hoping to flee, and Red Cross officials waited to hear when a corridor would be established.

Russia’s coordination center for humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk both said a ceasefire was agreed on to start Tuesday morning to allow some civilians to evacuate, but the two sides differed on where they said the corridors would be.

Russia’s coordination center suggested there would be more than one corridor, but that most would lead to Russia, either directly or through Belarus. At the UN, however, the Russian ambassador suggested corridors from several cities could be opened and people could choose for themselves which direction they would take.

Vereshchuk, meanwhile, only said that the two sides had agreed to an evacuation of civilians from the eastern city of Sumy, toward the Ukrainian city of Poltava. Those to be evacuated include foreign students from India and China, she said.

She reiterated that proposals to evacuate civilians to Russia and its ally Belarus, which was a launch pad for the invasion, were unacceptable.

“We have information that the Russian side has planned to disrupt the corridors,” she said in a letter to the International Committee of the Red Cross.

“Manipulations are being prepared to force people to take another route, which is not coordinated and dangerous,” Vereschcuk said.

She said the corridor was also designed to channel the delivery of food and medicine

She called on Russia to “urgently coordinate” humanitarian corridors from the cities of Volnovakha and Mariupol, as well as from Kyiv, Kharkiv and their surrounding regions.

Demands for effective passageways have surged amid intensifying shelling by Russian forces. The steady bombardments, including in some of Ukraine’s most populated regions, have yielded a humanitarian crisis of diminishing food, water and medical supplies.

Through it all, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian forces were showing unprecedented courage.

“The problem is that for one soldier of Ukraine, we have 10 Russian soldiers, and for one Ukrainian tank, we have 50 Russian tanks,” Zelensky told ABC News in an interview that aired Monday night. But he noted that the gap in strength was closing and that even if Russian forces “come into all our cities,” they will be met with an insurgency.

A top US official said multiple countries were discussing whether to provide the warplanes that Zelensky has been pleading for.

The besieged city of Mariupol was short on water, food and power, and cellphone networks are down. Stores have been looted as residents search for essential goods. Police moved through the city, advising people to remain in shelters until they heard official messages broadcast over loudspeakers to evacuate.

Hospitals in Mariupol are facing severe shortages of antibiotics and painkillers, and doctors performed some emergency procedures without them.

The lack of phone service left anxious citizens approaching strangers to ask if they knew relatives living in other parts of the city and whether they were safe.

The battle for Mariupol is crucial because its capture could allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014.

Several hundred kilometers (miles) west of Mariupol, Russian forces continued their offensive in Mykolaiv, opening fire on the Black Sea shipbuilding center of a half-million people, according to Ukraine’s military. Rescuers said they were putting out fires caused by rocket attacks in residential areas.

Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said in a statement Tuesday that Ukrainian forces are continuing defense operations in the suburbs of the city.

The general staff said “demoralized” Russian forces are engaging in looting in places they have occupied, commandeering civilian buildings like farm hangars for military equipment, and setting up firing positions in populated areas.

Ukrainian defense forces were also involved in operations in the northern city of Chernihiv and the outskirts of Kyiv, the general staff said.

The general staff said that while the Russian offensive is continuing, it has “slowed significantly.”

Ukraine also said Russia was using psychological warfare to spread propaganda among the population.

None of the claims could be independently verified, though Britain’s defense secretary said Tuesday that there were reports Ukrainian special forces destroyed over 20 Russian helicopters on the ground overnight as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continued to face logistical problems and fierce resistance.

Russia’s advance toward Kyiv continues to face pressure from Ukrainian forces around the nearby towns of Hostomel, Bucha, Vorzel and Irpin, the UK Defense Ministry said in an intelligence update released late Monday. In addition, a lengthy Russian column remains stuck on the road north of Kyiv.

UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said Russian forces are becoming more and more desperate in the face of such military and supply holdups, leading to “indiscriminate shelling” of civilians.

“We’ve also recognized that probably the biggest single casualties, so far in the war, are Russian military soldiers who have been let down by appalling leaders, appalling leadership and appalling plans. And now you see them, literally, at large scales dying.”

In Kyiv, soldiers and volunteers have built hundreds of checkpoints to protect the city of nearly 4 million, often using sandbags, stacked tires and spiked cables. Some barricades looked significant, with heavy concrete slabs and sandbags piled more than two stories high, while others appeared more haphazard, with hundreds of books used to weigh down stacks of tires.

“Every house, every street, every checkpoint, we will fight to the death if necessary,” said Mayor Vitali Klitschko.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, with 1.4 million people, heavy shelling slammed into apartment buildings.

“I think it struck the fourth floor under us,” Dmitry Sedorenko said from his Kharkiv hospital bed. “Immediately, everything started burning and falling apart.” When the floor collapsed beneath him, he crawled out through the third story, past the bodies of some of his neighbors.

In the small town of Horenka, where shelling reduced one area to ashes and shards of glass, rescuers and residents picked through the ruins as chickens pecked around them.

“What are they doing?” rescue worker Vasyl Oksak asked of the Russian attackers. “There were two little kids and two elderly people living here. Come in and see what they have done.”

At The Hague, Ukraine pleaded with the International Court of Justice to order a halt to Russia’s invasion, saying Moscow is committing widespread war crimes.

Russia “is resorting to tactics reminiscent of medieval siege warfare, encircling cities, cutting off escape routes and pounding the civilian population with heavy ordnance,” said Jonathan Gimblett, a member of Ukraine’s legal team.

The fighting has sent energy prices surging worldwide and stocks plummeting, and threatens the food supply and livelihoods of people around the globe who rely on crops farmed in the fertile Black Sea region.

The UN human rights office reported 406 confirmed civilian deaths but said the real number is much higher. The invasion has also sent 1.7 million people fleeing Ukraine.

On Monday, Moscow again announced a series of demands to stop the invasion, including that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia and recognize the eastern regions controlled by Moscow-supported separatist fighters as independent. It also insisted that Ukraine change its constitution to guarantee it won’t join international bodies like NATO and the EU. Ukraine has already rejected those demands.

Zelensky has called for more punitive measures against Russia, including a global boycott of its oil exports, which are key to its economy.

“If (Russia) doesn’t want to abide by civilized rules, then they shouldn’t receive goods and services from civilization,” he said in a video address.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/evacuation-from-sumy-begins-as-ukraine-says-russian-offensive-slowed-significantly/

MUKACHEVO, Ukraine — The desperate effort to secure safe passage for civilians trapped in Ukrainian cities under attack by Russian forces remained deeply precarious on Tuesday: A single evacuation route opened, allowing thousands to escape safely, while Ukraine accused Russia of shelling another proposed corridor. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Ukraine’s foreign ministry said the Russian military violated a cease fire by shelling an evacuation route out of the besieged city of Mariupol. It was the fourth day in a row that Ukraine has accused Moscow of firing on routes used by civilians to flee the fighting.

As the situation in several cities grows more dire — with hundreds of thousands lacking power, heat and water and facing regular bombardment — Ukraine is seeking to avert a further humanitarian disaster. More than 2 million people, half of them children, have fled to neighboring countries since Feb. 24 when the conflict began.

U.S. intelligence officials warned Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin may escalate his campaign to subjugate Ukraine despite encountering military setbacks and an increasingly punishing slate of sanctions. President Biden announced that the United States would ban the import of Russian oil and natural gas in what he called “another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine.” Biden acknowledged that Americans will feel the impact in the form of higher gas prices, which are already at a record high.

Speaking via video to British lawmakers, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed to counter the Russian invasion, using words that echoed a famed speech by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill during World War II. “We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost,” Zelensky said. “We will fight in the forests, on the shores, in the streets.”

At least 474 civilians — including dozens of children — have been confirmed killed in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion, the United Nations said, adding that the true figure is likely to be far higher. Most of the deaths were caused by explosive weaponry such as heavy artillery and missiles, it said.

Russia had announced earlier Tuesday that it was opening corridors to evacuate civilians from several cities, including Mariupol and Kyiv. But the Kremlin said refugees from the Ukrainian capital would be flown to Russia after transiting through Belarus, a key Russian ally.

Such conditions are unacceptable to Ukraine, which has rejected the idea of evacuation corridors leading to Russia or Belarus. The Ukrainian government said Tuesday that the only agreed routes were for other regions within Ukraine.

One humanitarian corridor, from the city of Sumy in northeastern Ukraine, managed to open on Tuesday morning, said Dmytro Zhivitsky, the regional governor, in an update on the messaging app Telegram, despite a shooting incident near a checkpoint. He said a column of buses headed west and then south to Poltava, a city about 100 miles away, with priority given to children, disabled residents, pregnant women and the elderly.

Zhivitsky said that as of Tuesday afternoon, people were able to leave the city in their own cars. He emphasized they should depart by early evening, ahead of the closing of the “green corridor” at 9 p.m. local time. While the governor said the corridor stemmed from an agreement between Ukraine and Russia, he warned that there was still a “very high risk of provocation,” and he urged people to evaluate the risks of leaving for themselves.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 5,000 people, including 1,700 foreign students, were evacuated from Sumy, the Associated Press reported. Among them were nearly 700 Indian students who had been trapped in the city without power or water and were taking refuge in makeshift underground shelters. From Poltava, they will board trains for western Ukraine, the Indian government said.

Meanwhile, a planned evacuation from Mariupol could not start Tuesday morning because of the violence, according to Vereshchuk. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said a fleet of vehicles had been ready to deliver aid to the port city and carry civilians northwest toward another region of the country.

Zelensky accused Russia on Tuesday of using siege tactics in Mariupol, saying Russian forces had shut off communication, blocked the delivery of food and cut electricity in the city. Mariupol is being “deliberately exhausted [and] deliberately tortured,” Zelensky said.

The city “doesn’t have time to wait,” he said, adding that a child had died of dehydration there “perhaps for the first time since the Nazi occupation.” The Washington Post could not independently verify the claim.

Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of the Russian National Defense Control Center, blamed Ukraine for the failure of evacuations Tuesday. He accused Ukrainian authorities of confirming only the route out of Sumy while rejecting others proposed by Russia.

Russia is still pushing to encircle Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, a U.S. intelligence official testified at a congressional hearing Tuesday. If Russian forces cut off supplies to the capital, the situation in the city “will become somewhat desperate” in 10 days to two weeks, said Lt. Gen Scott Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

For days, a miles-long convoy of Russian vehicles has been stalled beginning at the Hostomel airport, about 15 miles northwest of Kyiv. But Russian forces are also positioned about 37 miles to Kyiv’s east, after advancing southwest from the city of Sumy, a senior U.S. defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon.

Russia has launched nearly 670 missiles into Ukraine since the invasion began, the official said, a figure that has increased by several dozen a day.

In a move that blindsided U.S. officials, the government of Poland announced Tuesday that it was ready to hand over an unspecified number of MiG-29 fighter jets to the United States so that the warplanes could be transferred to Ukraine for use against invading Russian forces.

U.S. officials said Poland did not warn them before the announcement; the Pentagon subsequently said Poland’s offer appeared to be untenable.

At Tuesday’s hearing of the House Intelligence Committee, U.S. intelligence officials said Putin had failed to anticipate the strength and unity of the Western response to his invasion of Ukraine, and that his military’s performance has been less effective than expected.

Russia’s military faced determined resistance from its much smaller Ukrainian counterpart, the officials said. Berrier estimated that as many as 4,000 Russian troops may have died in the invasion, although he said he had low confidence in the estimate.

Avril Haines, the nation’s top intelligence official, testified that Putin “may escalate, essentially doubling down” to prevent Ukraine from further aligning itself with the United States and NATO. Putin “perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose,” Haines said.

Any escalation would be devastating for Ukraine’s more than 40 million people, who are facing both violence and critical shortages of food, heat, fuel and water. The United Nations on Tuesday said 2 million people have fled the country, despite the lack of protected evacuation corridors, making it the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. Half of those fleeing are children, UNICEF said Monday.

Ukraine’s State Customs Service said citizens seeking safe haven in other European countries should head for Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Moldova, where checkpoints are empty or free of large crowds. Land crossings into Poland, which has taken in more than 1 million people, are among the most congested, the agency said.

For Russia, the economic costs of the invasion continue to mount. Britain announced Tuesday that it would phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, while the European Commission presented a plan to cut Russian gas imports by two-thirds in 2022, marking a dramatic shift for countries that remain heavily reliant on relatively cheap and abundant Russian energy.

In less than two weeks, Russia has become the most-sanctioned nation in the world, surpassing countries such as Iran, North Korea and Syria, according to data from Castellum.ai, a global database that tracks sanctions. Its data shows that Moscow now faces 5,532 sanctions, well ahead of Iran, which is second on the list with 3,616.

Starbucks and McDonald’s became the latest multinationals to pause operations in Russia in the face of pressure from customers and large investors.

McDonald’s said it would temporarily close 850 restaurants in the country but continue paying its 62,000 employees there. Chief executive Chris Kempczinski wrote in a letter to staff that it was “impossible to predict” when the outlets would reopen, saying the company “cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.”

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that Ukraine would not accept Moscow's offer to establish safe corridors for civilians to head toward Russia. It will only agree to safe exits leading westward.

Vereshchuk said that the evacuation from the southern port of Mariupol failed Tuesday because the Russian troops fired on a Ukrainian convoy carrying humanitarian cargo to Mariupol that was to carry civilians from the city on its way back.

She said the city was in a ""catastrophic situation"" cut from water, power and communications, adding that a child in Mariupol has died of dehydration.

Hours after a Russian bombardment that left at least 21 civilians dead, Ukraine announced the opening of a humanitarian corridor to evacuate the population of Sumy, in the northeast of the country, reported the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories Iryna Vereshchuk.

“A ceasefire was agreed along the route starting at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT),” the deputy prime minister said in a video message, adding that the corridor will be open until 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT). and the journey will be made between Sumy, Golubivka, Lojvitsa, Lubny and Poltava.

“No other route has been agreed upon,” stressed Vereshchuk, who maintained that the opening of the corridor to Sumy has been notified by the Russian Ministry of Defense to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and that there is “documentary evidence” about this decision.

Ukraine subsequently informed the Red Cross and Russia that it accepted the opening of the humanitarian corridor for the city, he added.

He said the first column of humanitarian convoys was to start leaving Sumy at 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT) and would be followed by civilians who choose to take their own car to leave the city.

The Ukrainian authorities intend to evacuate, together with the citizens of Sumy, foreign students to the town of Poltava, in particular young people from India and China, according to the UNIAN agency.

The deputy prime minister also reported that Ukraine presented Russia and the ICRC with routes for humanitarian corridors in the cities of Kiev, Chernigov, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Volnovakha.

The adviser to the Office of the Ukrainian President, Mykhailo Podolyak, pointed out in his Telegram account that this is a new attempt to establish humanitarian corridors after three evacuations frustrated by non-compliance with the ceasefire, for which both parties blame each other.

“Let’s try it again. We agreed on a humanitarian corridor for the city of Sumy,” said the adviser, while reporting that humanitarian aid will also enter the city in the opposite direction.

“We believe that ‘the authors of the corridors to evacuate Ukrainians to a country (Russia) where no one wants to go’ will not close the door and no one will get hurt,” he said.

Podolyak was thus referring to the announcement on Monday and today by Moscow to open routes from Kiev, Chernigov, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol with routes that mostly ended in Russian territory, via Belarus.

Vereshchuk pointed out that the proposal that Ukraine has transmitted to Russia and the ICRC establishes the following routes: Volnovakha-Zaporiyia, Mariupol-Zaporiyia, Kiev and the Kiev region to the west of Ukraine, and Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region also to the west.

“We urge Russia to immediately agree on these routes, notify the ICRC and ensure a permanent ceasefire on these routes,” he stressed.

“Sumy was given a humanitarian corridor, the first stage of evacuation was started,” confirmed Kirill Timoshenko, deputy head of the Office of the Ukrainian President. on his Telegram account, in which he posted a video of the first buses and private vehicles leaving the city of almost 270,000 inhabitants.

The head of the regional state administration of Sumy, Dmitro Zhyvytskyy, said on the same social network that “the first column left the city at 09:00” local time (07:00 GMT), escorted by a Red Cross vehicle, according to reports. you can see in a short video.

He added that the second column of vehicles will leave around 1:00 p.m. local time (11:00 GMT).

In a previous message, Zhyvytskyy assured that he is working with the City Council and two deputies to organize the exit from the city.

“We join all forces and organize transportation as much as possible,” he wrote, while asking citizens to use their own vehicle if they can to help relatives leave the city.

Sumy was last night the target of a Russian attack on residential buildings, in which nine people died, including two children, according to the Ukrainian State Emergency Service, a figure that Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko raised to 21.

“Last night, Russian fascist pilots committed another crime against humanity in Sumy. 500-kilogram bombs were dropped on residential buildings (…) ”, he wrote on Telegram, where he said that the cleaning of the rubble continues and that there may be more victims.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow's invasion on February 24.

The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday.

One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city's regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy.

""At the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,"" Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. ""After 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy.""

The frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians ""hostage"" in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration.

Ukrainian authorities said that a long-awaited convoy of humanitarian aid to the city appeared to have come under fire on Tuesday. Russian troops are not allowing ""children, women and the elderly"" out of the city, and have launched an attack ""precisely in the direction of the humanitarian corridor,"" Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation said.

CNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response.

A senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been ""isolated"" by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it ""in any significant way.""

CNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days.

Meanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught.

""The main issue today remains humanitarian aid,"" Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video.

Residents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are ""forced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,"" he said, adding that Moscow is preventing ""humanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation.""

On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces ""violated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,"" following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army's advance in northern Ukraine.

That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing ""several civilians"" trying to evacuate the town of Irpin.

Zelensky calls for help as Ukrainians flee west

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the ""sidelines"" of the Russian invasion.

Addressing the UK's House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that ""we will fight to the end,"" echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's famous wartime speech.

""We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,"" he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to ""strengthen the sanctions"" against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia ""as a terrorist state"" and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a ""responsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine"" during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits.

""That would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,"" said Stoltenberg. ""The situation could spiral out of control,"" he said.

On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week.

In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city.

""In order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,"" Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. ""If the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.""

The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling.

The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country.

In total Russia has launched ""nearly 670"" missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday.

Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, ""the other half largely from inside Ukraine,"" the official said. ""A little bit more than 70"" missiles have been fired from Belarus, and ""only a half dozen or so"" are coming from the Black Sea, the official added.

A humanitarian crisis keeps growing

Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia's invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began.

The milestone is a ""terrifying"" number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries ""where they have connections, family,"" he added.

""What worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,"" said Grandi.

At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

Ukraine said a separate convoy of 30 buses was also headed to Mariupol to evacuate residents from that southern port, which has been encircled without food, water, power or heat and subjected to relentless bombardment for a week.

The United Nations said the number of refugees who have fled Ukraine had surged past 2 million, describing the flight as one of the fastest exoduses in modern times. The evacuations from Sumy to the city of Poltava further west began hours after a Russian air strike in Sumy, which local authorities said had killed 21 people. Reuters could not verify that report.

""We have already started the evacuation of civilians from Sumy to Poltava, including foreign students,"" Ukraine's foreign ministry said in a tweet. ""We call on Russia to uphold its ceasefire commitment, to refrain from activities that endanger the lives of people and to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid.""

Dmytro Zhyvytsky, the governor of the Sumy region, said in a video statement that a second column of civilians would leave Sumy at around 1100 GMT. A short video clip released by presidential advisor Kyrylo Tymoshenko showed a red bus with some civilians on board.

Residents were also leaving the town of Irpin, a frontline Kyiv suburb where Reuters journalists had filmed families fleeing for their lives under fierce bombardment on Sunday. Residents ran with their young children in strollers or cradling babies in arms, while others carried pets and plastic bags of belongings.

""The city is almost ruined, and the district where I'm living, it's like there are no houses which were not bombed,"" said one young mother, holding a baby beneath a blanket, while her daughter stood by her side. ""Yesterday was the hardest bombing, and the lights and sound is so scary, and the whole building is shaking.""

Moscow describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to disarm its neighbour and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and its Western allies call this a baseless pretext for an invasion to conquer a country of 44 million people.

Western sanctions have cut off Russia from international trade and financial markets to a degree never before imposed on such a big economy.

Russia is the world's leading exporter of oil and gas, and both Russia and Ukraine are major suppliers of grain and metals, creating concern the conflict could severely disrupt supplies and derail the global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.

On Tuesday, London trading in nickel was suspended after its prices doubled to $100,000 a tonne as a result of supply concerns.

Establishing humanitarian corridors for evacuations and aid has been the main focus of three rounds of talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Belarus, the last of which was held on Monday.

Russia's Interfax news agency said Moscow was opening corridors on Tuesday to allow people to leave five Ukrainian cities: Sumy, Maripol, Cherhihiv, Kharkiv and the capital Kyiv.

Ukraine has rejected Russian proposals for Kharkiv and Kyiv which would see evacuees sent to Russia itself or its ally Belarus. Earlier attempts to evacuate residents from Mariupol failed on Saturday and Sunday, with each side accusing the other of continuing to fire.

Jens Laerke, spokesperson of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said the United Nations was discussing humanitarian access with both sides, with a delegation in Moscow since Monday. To ensure safe passage, the sides would have to coordinate routes and timings of convoys.

DISASTER

Ukraine said the pace of Russia's advances had slowed on Tuesday. Its defence ministry said Russian Major General Vitaly Gerasimov, first deputy commander of Russia's 41st army, had been killed on Monday, the second Russian major general killed since the invasion began. Russia's defence ministry could not be immediately reached for comment and Reuters could not verify the report.

Western countries say Russia's initial battle plan for a rapid strike to topple the Kyiv government failed in the early days of the war, and Moscow has adjusted its tactics for longer sieges of cities.

The main assault force heading towards Kyiv has been stuck on a road north of the capital, an armoured column stretching for miles. To the south, Russia has made more progress along the Black and Azov Sea coasts.

Fears of an energy war between Russia and the West have grown this week, after Washington pushed its allies to ban Russian oil imports, so far excluded from sanctions.

U.S. President Joe Biden held a video conference call with the leaders of France, Germany and Britain on Monday. The United States is not a major buyer of Russian energy, but Russia supplies 40% of Europe's gas, and European allies have indicated so far that they were unable to halt Russian energy supplies.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak warned on Monday Russia could halt gas deliveries to Germany in retaliation for Berlin suspending a new pipeline. Oil prices could more than double to $300 a barrel if the United States and its allies banned Russian crude imports, he said.

A senior U.S. defence official said Putin had now deployed nearly 100% of the more than 150,000 troops that he had pre-staged outside Ukraine before the invasion.

Within Russia itself, the war has led to a severe new crackdown on dissent, with the last remaining independent media largely shut down last week and foreign broadcasters banned. Many foreign news organisations have suspended reporting from inside Russia after a new law was enacted imposing long jail terms for reporting deemed to discredit the military.

The top U.N. human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, said 12,700 people in Russia had already been detained at anti-war demonstrations.

""I remain concerned about the use of repressive legislation that impedes the exercise of civil and political rights and criminalising non-violent behaviour,"" Bachelet told the Human RIghts Council in Geneva via a video message.
