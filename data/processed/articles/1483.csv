According to the EU Commission, this agreement will allow the increased deployment of Frontex teams to support the Moldovan authorities in border management, including control, registration, and identity control of people crossing the border and border surveillance tasks, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.

The agreement was signed on behalf of the EU by Ylva Johansson, Commissioner for Home Affairs, and Philippe Léglise-Costa representing the French Presidency of the Council and, on behalf of the Republic of Moldova by Daniela Morari, Ambassador of Moldova to the European Union.

In a press release issued on March 17 by the EU Commission, Commissioner Johansson said that since the beginning of the war, Moldova has hosted many refugees from Ukraine, and the Moldovan actions in receiving these people have been impressive.

“The EU stands by Moldova – through humanitarian support via the Civil Protection Mechanism, pledges to transfer people to the EU Member States and now today through this agreement signed today, the EU will provide further assistance to support border management with the actual deployment of Frontex border guards in the territory of Moldova, to work hand in hand with Moldovan border guards in the performance of their work,” she pointed out in this regard.

The draft decision must receive the final approval of the European Parliament but based on a provisional application of the Council decision from March 17, additional Frontex staff may be appointed.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, more than 400,000 Ukrainians have crossed the territory of the Republic of Moldova.

According to United Nations recent data, more than three million people have left their home country, seeking shelter in neighbouring countries.

On March 3, Frontex decided to send additional support to Romania in border management due to the large influx of people coming from Ukraine.

Frontex has sent about 150 officers to the Romanian border with 45 patrol cars and other equipment. In addition, the status agreement will also positively impact the management of Romania’s borders and the overall management of the EU’s external borders.

Moreover, Germany decided on March 14 to relocate 2,500 Ukrainian refugees in Moldova to its territory.",https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/eu-signs-agreement-with-moldova-on-cooperation-with-frontex-in-border-management/

Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said: “Moldovan actions in receiving and hosting people fleeing war in Ukraine have been impressive. Since the beginning of the war, Moldova has received the highest number of refugees per capita in the region.

Of the over 3 million people who have so far fled from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, more than 300,000 persons so far have sought safety in Moldova. Moldovan border guards are facing challenges both in view of the high number of arrivals and sharing a border with an active war zone.

To support the Moldovan authorities to address these challenges, this agreement will allow for increased deployment of Frontex teams. Their tasks will include border management support. This could encompass: screening, registration and identity checks of people crossing the border and border surveillance tasks, working hand in hand with the Moldovan authorities, as well as help in the collection and exchange of information. This could help support the transfer of persons to EU Member States in the context of the Solidarity Platform.

Next steps

The draft decision on the conclusion of the agreement will be sent to the European Parliament, which needs to give its consent for the agreement to be concluded. However, based on a provisional application of the Council decision, additional Frontex staff can be deployed from today.

Background

Today's status agreement is the first based on the reinforced mandate of the European Border and Coastguard, and the fourth such agreement to be concluded with a partner country, after similar agreements were signed with Serbia in November 2019, with Albania in October 2018 and Montenegro in October 2019. Similar status agreements with North Macedonia (July 2018) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (January 2019) are pending finalisation.

The EU has been supporting Moldova to manage the large number of people fleeing the war in Ukraine. Moldova activated the EU Civil Protection on 25 February. 13 EU countries have made offers, Austria, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Finland, Romania, Croatia, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Italy. As of 15 March, 2.6 million of items have been offered and 2.4 million items are in their way or have been already delivered, that includes mainly shelter capacities but also medicines and hygiene items. In the context of the new Solidarity Platform coordinated by the Commission, 6 Member States made pledged to welcome 11,500 people transiting Moldova. The EU Border Assistance Mission has been relocated to Chisinau and is now providing direct support at the border crossings.

Czech Republic says it no longer can receive refugees

On the other hand, the Czech Republic said it no longer can receive refugees from Ukraine due to the lack of resources to cope with large flows that entered the country so far.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, 270,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in the Czech Republic.

In 2020, there were 82.4 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, forced to leave their homes due to conflict, violence, human rights violations, persecution, and natural hazards. Of those, 46 million are internally displaced people and 26.4 million refugees. An estimated 35 million (42%) are children below the age of 18. Most refugees (86%) are hosted in developing countries.

Around the world, the vast majority of migrants travel, live and work in a regular and legal manner. Migration can bring considerable benefits to all sides. In countries of destination, migrants can make up for labour shortages, invest in new businesses, help create jobs and contribute to a richer and more diverse culture. And migrants, notably those working in the health sector, have been giving an important contribution in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic in their host countries. Migration also contributes to development in countries of origin. In this context, migrants send home remittances, which provide a stable source of financing that can help reduce poverty, and bring home new skills.

Migration also presents a set of specific challenges, in particular when it takes place in an irregular manner. Migrants risk their life on dangerous journeys and are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. At their destination, migrants often face difficulties in accessing health care, housing, education or employment. Organised crime networks benefit from facilitating irregular migration.

Migration is a key policy area for the EU. Over the past years, the EU has developed a comprehensive and balanced policy framework on migration. Our ultimate aim is to ensure that migration takes place in a safe and regular manner, avoiding loss of life, protecting the human rights of migrants and providing international protection to those who need it. Constructive and sustainable migration policies are in the interest of partner countries, the EU, and refugees and migrants themselves.",https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/migration-forced-displacement_en
