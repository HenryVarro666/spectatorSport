The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

The latest: As Ukrainian and Russian officials prepared for peace talks Monday, the U.K. Defense Ministry issued a statement saying British intelligence supports Ukrainian forces' claims that they've ""slowed down"" Russia's offensive, adding: ""Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continue to frustrate the Russian advance.""

The British statement concurs with comments by a Pentagon official on Sunday that the bulk of Russia's forces had stalled about 30 kilometers (19 miles), from Kyiv's city center.

Meanwhile, Russia's currency collapsed in overnight trading, with the ruble plummeting against the dollar, as the West ramps up sanctions over the invasion.

The Russian central bank raised interest rates from 9.5% to 20% and announced a raft of measures on Monday.

By the numbers: A senior Pentagon official said Sunday that Russia had committed two-thirds of its massed forces to fight in Ukraine and fired over 320 missiles, but still does not hold a major population center.

The invasion has caused at least 352 civilian casualties, including 14 children with another 1,684 people — including 116 children — injured, Ukraine's Ministry of Interior said Sunday.

State of play: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced Sunday following a conversation with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to hold peace talks with ""no preconditions"" on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River.

Putin ordered Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert Sunday. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said this was an attempt ""to put additional pressure on the Ukrainian delegation"" in peace talks.

Ukraine's Defense Ministry said all of Kharkiv — Ukraine's second-largest city, which lies on its eastern border with Russia and has endured some of the heaviest fighting of the war — was back under Ukrainian control Sunday.

The European Union announced sweeping sanctions on Russian aircraft and state media and said that, for the first time, the bloc will buy and deliver weapons to Ukraine — including transferring Soviet-era fighter jets.

What to watch: The United Nations will convene a rare emergency session of the 193-member General Assembly on Monday to vote on a resolution calling for peace in Ukraine.

Forces from Chechnya have entered the fight, while Belarusian forces have reportedly been readied to deploy in support of Russia.

What they're saying: Announcing the peace talks, Zelensky said: ""Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarusian territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation's travel, talks and return.""

""Our president, from the beginning, even before the war started, was focused on the diplomatic solution,"" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova said after the announcement, per CNN.

""But he always said, 'we’re ready for peace talks, we’re not ready to surrender,"" added Markarova, who compared Putin's tactics to those of Adolf Hitler.

Between the lines: It's unclear what exactly can be achieved from negotiations between envoys sent by Putin and Zelensky, given that Putin's unprovoked invasion appears to be aimed largely at removing Zelensky from power.

Putin has called on the Ukrainian military to topple their president and absurdly suggested that Zelensky's administration comprises Nazis (Zelensky is Jewish and lost family members in the Holocaust).

Zoom in: Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told AP Kyiv residents had water and electricity, ""but the infrastructure is destroyed to deliver the food and medication,"" which he said could cause a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""

What else is happening: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the all ""Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft,"" including the private jets of oligarchs, would be banned from European airspace.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared that Russia's invasion ""marks a turning point in the history of our continent,"" and promised major new contributions to Ukraine and to Germany's own defenses.

The Kremlin and state media continue to tell Russians that no ""war"" or ""invasion"" is taking place, but instead states there's a limited defensive operation in eastern Ukraine.

What to watch: Having already threatened independent publications that report on Russian casualties or aggression with censorship, the Kremlin announced Sunday that ""the provision of any assistance to a foreign state"" during the ""military operation"" would be considered treason — punishable by up to 20 years in prison.

Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

As the day began, Russia’s currency lost as much as a quarter of its value within hours. Scrambling to stem the decline, the Russian Central Bank more than doubled its key interest rate, banned foreigners from selling Russian securities and ordered exporters to convert into rubles most of their foreign-currency revenues. It closed the Moscow stock exchange for the day because of the “developing situation.”

“The economic reality has, of course, changed,” the Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters, announcing that Mr. Putin had called an emergency meeting with his top finance officials.

Even as Russian and Ukrainian delegations met for talks at the Belarus border, Moscow’s military offensive showed no sign of letting up, and the hectic moves offered the first signs that the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West over the weekend were shaking the foundations of Russia’s economy. The decisions by the United States, Britain and the European Union restricting the Russian Central Bank’s access to much of its $643 billion in foreign currency reserves have undone much of the Kremlin’s careful efforts to soften the impact of potential sanctions.

And with dozens of countries closing their airspace to Russian planes, major foreign investors pulling out and the West placing debilitating restrictions on Russia’s biggest banks, it was becoming clear that Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was ushering in a period of international isolation for Russia unseen since the Cold War.

“So, has Russia become Venezuela or is it still Iran?” the morning-show host on the liberal-leaning Echo of Moscow radio station asked an economist on Monday.

“We’ll go through the Iran phase,” Yevgeny S. Gontmakher of Moscow’s Higher School of Economics responded, referring to sanctions placed on Iran because of its plans for uranium enrichment, “but what happens after that is hard to say.”

Elvira Nabiullina, the widely respected governor of the Russian Central Bank, was expected to speak to the public at 4 p.m. Moscow time.

On Sunday, Mr. Putin called the West’s sanctions “illegitimate” in a televised meeting with his defense minister and top military commander. Mr. Putin then told them to place Russia’s nuclear arsenal on high alert; some analysts fear that Russia’s economic instability could lead Mr. Putin to escalate his conflict with the West using new military threats or other means, such as cyberattacks.

But there was also extreme uncertainty inside Russia as the value of people’s savings evaporated and the interconnections with the Western world that Russians had come to take for granted in the last three decades rapidly broke away. It was not immediately clear whether most Russians would blame Mr. Putin for the crisis — or whether they would take cues from Kremlin propaganda and blame the West.

“Times change, much has happened, but one thing has not changed,” a reporter on the state-run news channel Rossiya 24 said on Sunday. “When a united Europe tried to destroy Russia, this always ended up bringing about the opposite result.”

(Ivana Kottasova/CNN)

Last Sunday, Kyiv was a buzzing European city with hip cafes, artwork at every corner and fresh sushi available on demand at midnight. Now, it’s a war zone.

Sirens blasting through the city, the unmistakable loud bangs of explosions and strikes. The transformation inflicted on the city by the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been surreal.

Just a week ago, Dniprovsʹkyy Park was full of runners and cyclists taking advantage of the sunny weather to get their Sunday workout done.

The traffic-free park sits on an island across the river from the old town, its banks lined by sandy city beaches where kids are normally running around, watching the ducks swim by.

In the historical Mariinskyi Park families were strolling around, with kids enjoying the park’s playground that features large boat-shaped monkey bars.

Now, the same city is reeling from a steady stream of news of yet another terrifying incident. A six-year-old boy killed in heavy gunfire. A high-rise apartment building being hit. The dam of Kyiv reservoir destroyed. The streets are deserted, the sense of dread hanging in the air.

Many have fled the city, encouraged by the authorities to go while there still was a chance. The state railway company has been dispatching extra trains heading to the west for days now, Kyiv’s main train station full of families hoping to get onto the next one.

The same people who were happily shopping in fashion stores lining Kyiv’s boulevards, dining at trendy restaurants are now hunkered down in basements, underground parking lots and subway stations.

Instead of hanging out with friends, enjoying the sunshine, they are now sleeping on the floors, trying to calm their children that don’t understand why they can’t go to kindergarten.

Despite the shock and suffering brought in recent days, Kyiv’s residents are showing incredible resolve and defiance.

Within hours after the invasion started, more than 18,000 have responded a call to defend the city, collecting their firearms from authorities, according to Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.

In the hotel where many western journalists are staying in the city center, the staff, who are now staying there instead of being at home with their families, are alternating between distributing blankets and water bottles in the bomb shelter and serving four different types of egg dishes at the buffet breakfast.

“The politicians agreed that the Ukrainian delegation would meet the Russian one without preconditions at the Ukraine-Belarus border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said in a statement.

It did not list a specific location or time for the talks.

In a video address later Sunday, he expressed skepticism over the talks.

“I will be honest, as always: I do not really believe in the outcome of this meeting, but let them try,” Zelensky said in a video address later. “No citizen of Ukraine should have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war, when there was even a small chance.”

He described his talk with Lukashenko as “long” and “substantive.”

The announcement on Sunday came hours after Russia announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks. Ukrainian officials initially rejected the move, saying any talks should take place elsewhere than Belarus, where Russia has placed a large contingent of troops.

But Kyiv said Lukashenko assured Zelensky that “all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarus territory will remain on the ground during the travel, negotiations and return of the Ukrainian delegation.”

However, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba claimed that missiles from Belarus were continuing to hit Ukrainian cities, amid reports one that hit an airport in Zhitomyr had been fired from the northern neighbor.

He said Kyiv would not buckle at the talks with Russia over its invasion, accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of seeking to increase “pressure” by ordering his nuclear forces on high alert.

“We will not surrender, we will not capitulate, we will not give up a single inch of our territory,” Kuleba said at a press conference broadcast online.

News of the meeting came shortly after Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces put on high alert in response to what he called “aggressive statements” by leading NATO powers.

Putin accused Western countries of taking “unfriendly” steps against his country.

The fourth day of fighting Sunday saw street battles break out in Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, and Russian troops squeezing strategic ports in the country’s south, advances that appeared to mark a new phase of Russia’s invasion following a wave of attacks on airfields and fuel facilities elsewhere in the country.

The capital, Kyiv, was eerily quiet after huge explosions lit up the morning sky and authorities reported blasts at one of the airports. Only an occasional car appeared on a deserted main boulevard as a strict 39-hour curfew kept people off the streets. Terrified residents instead hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault.

“The past night was tough — more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure,” Zelensky said earlier. “There is not a single facility in the country that the occupiers wouldn’t consider as admissible targets.”

Ukraine has reported 198 civilian deaths, including three children, since the invasion began. The UN has put the civilian toll at 64.

Zelensky initially rejected Belarus as a location for talks because it served as a staging ground for the invasion. He said Kyiv had proposed “Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku” as options to Russia.

He had also apparently floated Israel as a mediator in a call with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Friday.

Bennett spoke with Putin on Sunday about the possibility of Israel brokering peace talks. He told the Russian leader Israel was ready to assist in any way possible in bringing the sides together, in light of its unique relationship with both countries, according to an Israeli official.

Putin told Bennett that he is ready to negotiate, according to the official.

However, the Kremlin said Putin had told Bennett that Russia had already sent a delegation to Gomel in southern Belarus to conduct peace talks with Ukrainian officials.

In a statement, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had agreed to meet with the Russians on the border of Belarus ""without preconditions"" after speaking with that country's president, Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko, a Putin ally, “has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, talks and return,” Zelenskyy's office said.

The European Union announces it is closing its airspace to all Russian aircraft, while UPS and FedEx say they are suspending service to the country.

Putin puts his military's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert after what he calls ""aggressive statements"" from the West.

Ukraine agrees to negotiations with Russia on the border with neighboring Belarus.

Kyiv remains in Ukrainian hands after fierce fighting; Ukraine says it took back control of Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city.

of Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city. Russian forces block southern Ukrainian cities with the apparent aim of seizing the coastline.

At least 368,000 Ukrainians are fleeing westward, becoming refugees near the border and in neighboring countries.

Zelenskyy had said his government would not attend negotiations in Belarus, a close ally of Moscow’s, where thousands of Russian troops massed in the lead-up to the invasion last week. He later said he doubted the meeting, which was to take place near the Pripyat River, would produce results but that he went ahead with it “so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was a small chance.” Zelenskyy added that he would remain in Kyiv while the talks proceeded.

Russia, like NATO and the U.S., has thousands of nuclear warheads in its arsenal. By putting nuclear deterrence forces on high alert for what he called the ""aggressive statements"" of NATO countries, Putin raised the global stakes of the conflict to a far deadlier level.

A senior Defense Department official suggested the nuclear readiness of NATO and Russia was not to be taken lightly, even amid a historic invasion. Putin's escalation, which the Pentagon had no reason to doubt, ""could make things much, much, more dangerous,"" the official said Sunday during an evening briefing held on background.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an earlier interview on MSNBC that Putin's move was ""exactly the kind of manufactured threats"" that he has been using since the invasion started ""to justify further aggressive action.""

Speaking on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Putin ""is continuing to escalate this war in a manner that is totally unacceptable."" The U.N. Security Council voted Sunday afternoon to convene a rare emergency special session of the General Assembly on Monday to address the Russian invasion.

E.U., U.S. sanctions

As the fighting continued into its fourth day, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced that the European Union would close its airspace to all Russian planes — a move that some European countries had taken individually. Von der Leyen also said the E.U. was banning Russian state media and sanctioning Belarus for its involvement in the invasion.

European leaders are also in step with the U.S. in efforts to target the assets of Russian oligarchs and sanctioned companies, a senior White House official said, adding that the Biden administration is launching a trans-Atlantic task force to identify any ""ill-gotten gains"" from elites close to Putin and the Russian government. That is in addition to severe sanctions placed on Putin's personal assets and Russian banks over the last several days.

Switzerland's president, Ignazio Cassis, also said Sunday that it was ""very probable"" his country would join the efforts to sanction Russia and freeze its assets.

With more and more flights out of Russia being canceled and swaths of airspace being shut down, the U.S. Embassy there urged all Americans in the country to depart “immediately.” Separately, FedEx and UPS said they were suspending shipments to Russia, as well as Ukraine, and the British oil giant BP said it was abandoning its 20 percent stake in the Russian state-controlled oil company Rosneft.

The U.S. and the E.U.'s actions came after Washington and allies escalated sanctions on Russia over the weekend, including blocking certain Russian banks from accessing SWIFT, a service that facilitates global transactions among thousands of financial institutions. Japan also said Sunday that it would join that move.

Von der Leyen also said the E.U. would deliver military equipment to Ukraine in what she called ""a watershed moment"" — the first time the E.U. has financed the purchase and delivery of weapons for a country under attack. The move followed a decision by Germany and other countries to provide Ukraine with weapons and supplies. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, meanwhile, put out a new call Sunday for more weapons, including “more air-to-air and ground-to-air missiles to counter invaders. We need more drones, more vehicles, aircraft artillery, guns, machine guns, ammunition.”

Fierce fighting

Earlier in the day, Ukraine said it had taken back control of its second-largest city, Kharkiv, after fighting pitched street battles with the Russian forces, and Kyiv residents awoke to find that the capital was still in Ukrainian hands.

“Anyone who wants to join the defense of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians,” Zelenskyy’s office said in a statement. “There is no greater contribution which you can make for the sake of peace.”

Kuleba, the foreign minister, echoed the call, inviting foreigners to contact Ukraine’s foreign diplomatic missions in their respective countries.

Russian vehicles broke into Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million people 25 miles south of the border with Russia, and engaged in intense street fighting with the Ukrainian forces. The head of the Kharkiv regional administration, Oleh Sinegubov, said later that Ukrainians had regained control of the city. “Control over Kharkiv is completely ours!"" Sinegubov said in a message on the Telegram messaging app.

NBC News teams in the country witnessed Ukrainians rallying to repel the invaders, with chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel seeing people in the towns and villages he has passed filling sandbags, manning checkpoints and standing armed at crossroads.

The senior U.S. defense official said Sunday that the U.S. continues to see Russian momentum slowed by the stiff Ukrainian resistance and logistical challenges, including fuel shortages. While the Russian military has sent about two-thirds of the forces that were amassed around Ukraine into the country, it has not been able to take control of any cities, the official said.

The resistance, the official said, is ""heroic, it's inspiring,"" but Russia still has an operational advantage, with ""an awful lot of combat power"" arrayed in and outside Ukraine.

Russian reconnaissance troops have tried to enter Kyiv's center by wearing uniforms that make them appear to be Ukrainian troops, the official said. But the country's forces and even some locals have been successful in ferreting them out.

Speaking in a video message posted on his Instagram account Sunday, Zelenskyy said the night around the country was “brutal.” Russian forces were targeting residential buildings, kindergartens and even ambulances, he said. Russia has denied it has been targeting civilians.

Kyiv remained under strict curfew until 8 a.m. local time Monday, complicating the task of assessing the intensity of the fighting, as residents were told to avoid venturing out onto the streets and to seek shelter.

Mayor Vitali Klitschko said there were clashes with Russian “sabotage groups” overnight but that they had been ""destroyed"" and that there were no Russian troops in the capital. He later said Kyiv, a city of nearly 3 million people, was ""encircled"" by Russian forces, The Associated Press reported; the news service said it was unable to immediately verify Klitschko's report or how wide the area of encirclement might be because of the curfew.

Russian munitions struck a radioactive waste site in the city overnight, but there were no immediate signs of damage or radioactive release, the International Atomic Energy Agency said.

Russian forces on Sunday blocked the southern Ukrainian cities of Kherson, a port and gateway into the Black Sea, and the port of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov, the Russian state-run Interfax news agency quoted Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov as saying. The pressure on strategic cities in the south of Ukraine, including ports, appeared aimed at seizing control of Ukraine’s coastline.

While the Russian offensive appeared to have been stymied by stiffer-than-expected resistance from highly motivated Ukrainian armed forces, thousands of Ukrainians have fled to the country’s Western borders to escape the fighting.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Sunday the number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the country has reached 368,000 and continues to rise.

The Ukrainian government's human rights ombudsman, Lyudmyla Denysova, said Sunday that more than 210 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and that more than 1,100 have been wounded, while the health ministry reported larger numbers, saying nearly 1,700 people had been injured and more than 350 had been killed, including 14 children, according to a message on Telegram from Parliament. Moscow has not released casualty numbers for Russian forces.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-president-kyiv-kharkiv-foreign-fighters-join-russia-putin-rcna17844
