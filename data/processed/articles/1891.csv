President points to treason

In a rare criticism of Ukrainian security bodies, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has revealed that two generals would be stripped of their rank.

«Today, another decision was made on anti-heroes – now, I don’t have time to deal with all traitors, but gradually all of them will be punished. That is why Andriy Olehovych Naumov, former head of the main department of internal security at the Security Service of Ukraine, and Serhiy Oleksandrovych Kryvoruchko, former head of the SBU directorate in the Kherson region, are no longer generals,» Zelensky said.

Zelenskyy also noted that «these high-ranking servicemen, who could not decide on where their homeland is, who violate the military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people regarding the protection of our state, its freedom, independence, will certainly be deprived of their high military rank.»

Today, April 2, Russia's military attack on Ukraine has been going on for thirty-eight days. We're reporting on all the current news. The article will be constantly updated.

What about today?

Key points

The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue their armed aggression against Ukraine.

They are withdrawing troops in certain areas, probably in order to strengthen the grouping of the occupying forces for further offensive operations in the Sloboda, Donetsk, and Luhansk areas.

However, these areas have been hotspots every day. A group of troops of the Armed Forces of Ukraine repulsed 9 enemy attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk directions in the past 24 hours. Our soldiers destroyed 8 tanks, 44 armored fighting vehicles, 16 units of vehicles, and 10 artillery systems.

Over the past week, the irreparable loss of personnel in the units of the so-called 2nd Army Corps amounted to about 800 people.

Our soldiers are fighting heroically for every meter of our land, the enemy's strength and motivation are exhausted, but Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksii Danilov urged Ukrainians not to fall into euphoria from the fact that Russian troops are retreating in certain directions (""our fighters' lives and Ukrainian Armed Forces' work is behind every withdrawal""). He says that the Russian army is being reformatted to launch new strikes. Danilov believes that Putin will try to win anywhere by May 9 to ""hold a victory parade."" The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council warned that there are still many fights ahead and that ""I don't advise anyone to relax.""

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola, who arrived in Kyiv. ""I came to Ukraine not only to confirm our solidarity. I would also like to make sure that you have everything you need to win this war. Because if you win, the whole world will win,"" said Roberta Metsola.

Russia is a country without shame, morality, and humanity. Since the beginning of the war, the occupiers have fired on 274 hospitals and shut down 70 ambulances. 154 residential buildings, 20 private estates, 27 kindergartens, and 44 schools were damaged.

Zelenskyy completely excludes renouncing the territory for the sake of a peace agreement, he said in an interview with Fox News.

Ukraine's talks with Russia

Davyd Arakhamia, the head of the Ukrainian delegation to the talks, announced some important news from the talks on the telethon:

Russia has verbally accepted a project proposed by Ukraine in Istanbul , with the exception of Crimea (Kyiv is proposing to open 15-year talks on it, and Moscow is demanding recognition of its Russian status).

, with the exception of Crimea (Kyiv is proposing to open 15-year talks on it, and Moscow is demanding recognition of its Russian status). Kyiv is waiting for Russia to confirm its statements at the talks in writing.

Negotiations are underway with China through diplomatic channels to make it a guarantor of Ukraine. But, according to Arakhamia, the issue with China has been worked out less than with other countries.

We will not sign any document where Russia will have the right to veto the decision with its vote, added Arakhamia.

He also said that ""we want to make our own NATO.""

Trophies of the Armed Forces

Resistance forces in Shestovytsia, Chernihiv region, replenished armored personnel carriers for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine has successfully used Starstreak, a missile that strikes targets with three kinetic darts. Thus, a Russian helicopter was shot down in the Luhansk region.

During the fighting in the Kyiv direction, one of the units of the National Guard of Ukraine acquired trophy Russian equipment SAU 2C -3 and MT-LB. Ukrainian defenders have already towed them to the rear. After minor repairs, the equipment will strengthen the unit fighting in this direction.

And in this photo, soldiers of the Special Operations Forces Resistance Movement are inspecting a Russian helicopter shot down by soldiers of the Defense Forces of Ukraine.

Humanitarian corridors

Today, Saturday, April 2, 2022, 7 evacuation routes have been agreed upon:

Donetsk region: Private transport: Mariupol – Manhush – Berdiansk – Tokmak – Vasylivka – Kamianske – Zaporizhzhia

Zaporizhzhia region: Berdiansk – Tokmak – Vasylivka – Kamianske – Zaporizhzhia

Atomic and chemical threats

Russia will not attack nuclear facilities in Ukraine. The head of the IAEA Rafael Grossi is sure of it. The International Atomic Energy Agency will start assisting Ukraine in maintaining the safety of nuclear facilities. Regarding reports of exposure of the Russian military to the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, Grossi said the agency had contacted its Russian counterparts for more information.

Most likely, in the near future, Russia may decide to conduct a chemical attack on Ukraine. Therefore, Ukraine should be prepared for such a scenario. This is the opinion of Oleksii Danilov, Head of the Council of Experts on Energy Security. ""You know that, despite the ban on all international institutions on the use of chemical weapons, they used it in Syria at one time. We have a clear awareness that they can do it in our country. We must be ready for that,"" he said.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

The United States will provide Ukraine with equipment to protect against possible chemical attacks, the White House said. ""In an effort to help our Ukrainian partners, the US government is providing the Ukrainian government with rescue tools and materials that could be deployed in the event of Russia's use of chemical or biological weapons,"" said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki.

News from partners

American actor Sean Penn appealed to billionaires around the world to help Ukraine. Penn is asking billionaires to spend $300 million and buy two squadrons of F-15 or F-16 fighters for Ukraine, which would have a qualitative advantage over Russian Su and MiG fighters. He also called for $200 million worth of missile defense systems for Ukraine, for a total of half a billion dollars.

US President Biden said more than 30 countries had decided to release oil from their reserves to lower prices. He added that various states have united to prevent Russia from ""turning energy resources into weapons"" against the United States, Europe, and other countries.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria has declared the first secretary of the Russian embassy in Sofia persona non grata. He is suspected of espionage. A Russian diplomat has 72 hours to leave Bulgaria.

Following Bulgaria, the German government is considering expelling ""a significant number"" of Russian diplomats suspected of espionage.

The Pope has already abandoned Moscow's terminology, calling a ""special military operation"" a war. Today, he condemned ""unjustified aggression"" by Russia and ""atrocities"" in the war. ""Again, a dictator, unfortunately, entangled in anachronistic statements about nationalist interests, provokes and inflames conflicts, while ordinary people feel the need to build a future that will either be common or non-existent,"" Francis told Maltese officials.

What's in Russia?

In Ukraine, the Russian military will be paid for voluntarily transferring usable military equipment to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Verkhovna Rada voted in favor of the document. The Russian military is guaranteed the right to keep secret the fact of transferring equipment, obtaining new documents with new installation data and security of their stay in Ukraine, as well as creating conditions for travel to a safe third country. Very good offer!

On April 1 this year, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation decided to hold a military meeting with reservists from April 4 to May 23, 2022. The redeployment of Russian troops and units of the so-called Transnistrian-Moldavian Republic in order to prepare for a demonstration of readiness for the offensive and, possibly, hostilities against Ukraine was also noted.

There are many forbidden words and expressions in Putin's Russia. They even arrest people for the inscription on the sausage package:

""In unrecognized Transnistria, rumors are spreading about the coercion of army personnel to take part in the war against Ukraine,"" the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said.

Panic is also spreading among Russian servicemen because of radiation exposure of personnel based in the Chornobyl zone. The population of Bragin, Belarus, is advised to avoid contact with the Russian occupiers who have left the contaminated area.

What about Belarus?

About 25 missiles were launched from Belarus to Ukraine last night alone. This was reported by the media and Belarusian telegram channels.

Russian lies

On March 15, Solovyov stated in his telegram channel to all of Russia that the legendary Canadian sniper Vali, who was fighting on the side of Ukraine, had allegedly been killed by Russian special forces. As a real sniper, Vali showed endurance, and two weeks later showed a photo greeting to Solovyov and all those who rejoiced at his ""death."" He posted a photo with a Russian C-ration of racists.

In Russia, a video is being distributed where an Azovstal employee allegedly wants to join the occupiers' armed forces. This was reported in the Mariupol City Council: ""They took an actor, invented his name and position and called him an Azov resident. It is said that an employee of the plant allegedly wants to join the ranks of murderers."" Azovstal HR has raised the base of all employees of all Metinvest Group companies over the years. As it turned out, a person with this name and surname had never worked at the company.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

Ritter Sport has started to have problems selling products in Europe. Earlier, the company refused to leave Russia and even stated that it would develop its business there. Buyers did not like it very much, but the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany Andrii Melnyk added a special reputation, inventing a new slogan for Ritter Sport: ""Quadratisch, praktisch, Blut"" (Square, practical, bloody). The slogan has literally spread on the Internet and is already threatening to collapse sales across Europe. Now it's not about sanctions, it's about principles.

Oil giant Shell will not be able to pay for gas delivery under the new Kremlin scheme, as the UK has put Gazprombank under sanctions.

But Moldova has decided to ""maintain neutrality"" and will not join the sanctions imposed on Russia, President Maia Sandu told Radio Europa Liberă. This is a decision of a small country, which allegedly does not affect anything and does not want to irritate a large country. Unfortunately, this does not work with Russia. It always wants blood.

Russian gas is no longer supplied to the Baltic States, said Uldis Bariss, chairman of the board of the natural gas system operator Conexus Baltic Grid.

The supply of champagne from France to Russia was stopped after the start of the Russian military operation in Ukraine. The prospects are unknown, said the director-general of the Union of French Champagne Houses (UMC) David Chatillon. But we believe there are no secrets here. Hawthorn tincture instead of champagne is the prospect in Russia.

The largest scientific publishers have decided to close access to their database of articles in Russia. At the same time, publishing houses will continue to publish articles by Russian and Belarusian scientists. The relevant statement was published on March 31.

Life considering hostilities

Ukraine has created a service for sending e-mails after the war. Messages are stored in a secure database, and after the war, the developers will automatically send them to recipients. ""Write something important today to those you think about, and after the war, they will receive your letter. You can even write to yourself as a memory of those times,"" the authors of the idea comment.

260,000 temporarily displaced people have registered with the social security authorities, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said at a Cabinet meeting today. If we take into account that, according to the UN, at least 10.5 million people in Ukraine have currently moved out of their homes, only 2.5% have registered.

Kyiv and region

Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klychko has said that the bombing of the Ukrainian capital's satellite cities continues, despite Russia's promises to withdraw troops from the region. On Sky News, Klychko said that the fighting continues in Brovary, east of Kyiv. ""Those who want to return to Kyiv, it is better to wait a few weeks to see how the situation will develop,"" summed up the mayor.

""I think everything will turn out in our favor. They don’t have a reserve to continue this phase actively. It will take at least 2-3 months to gather these reserves. Sanctions will finish off the economy. That is, now it should be decided within 2-3 weeks. I often said 2-3 weeks, but this is from the beginning of the second phase. Now it begins. I think they should actively leave in three days, and after that 2 weeks will decide everything,"" Arestovich said during a visit to Irpen, liberated from the invaders.

He also added that, in his opinion, the Russian troops will no longer return to the north of the Kyiv region:

""They will definitely not return here. Because in order to return here, you need to at least create the same grouping, which they are not capable of. They do not have a mobilization potential.""

21:57 The head of the Ukrainian negotiating group David Arakhamia commented on the course of the negotiations:

— conceptually, there is nothing new in the negotiation process at the moment;

— the Russian Federation gave an official response to the Ukrainian position, voiced in Istanbul. This answer is as follows: the position is accepted, with the exception of the issue of Crimea;

— Foreign Minister Dmiytro Kuleba said that he was waiting for confirmation (of the Russian reaction to our position on Crimea) in writing, so far there has been no oral confirmation. At the same time, according to Arakhamia, yesterday, verbally during a video conference, ""we heard that the Russian side is not against such a position and we are moving forward more from a legal point of view"";

— According to Arakhamia, the Russian side confirmed the thesis of the Ukrainian delegation that the draft documents have been developed enough to conduct direct consultations between the two leaders of the countries, that is, with the presidents of Ukraine and the Russian Federation;

— now the task is to quickly work out some final stage not of the document itself, but of those issues that have already been touched upon and to prepare a possible meeting of the presidents;

— Turkish President Erdogan called both Zelensky and Putin yesterday and confirmed for his part that they were ready to organize a meeting in the near future. Therefore, with a high degree of probability, the meeting will be held in Istanbul;

— There are active consultations with potential security guarantees. Officially, the three NATO countries agreed to provide (guarantees) exactly in the format in which Ukraine offers (Turkey, Germany, Italy). It is also important to obtain guarantees from the UK and the US;

— it is important that nuclear states enter the pool of guarantors. Ukraine is negotiating with China through diplomatic channels. The state of negotiations with China is the least ready when compared with countries that actively help, but Arakhamia expects that China will still enter the pool of guarantors.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.
