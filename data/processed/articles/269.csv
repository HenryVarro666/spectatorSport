The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

According to the ministry, some of them, serving in supply units had been imprisoned by the Ukrainian army, since they entered the country on February 24.

The defence ministry said, ""Unfortunately, we have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine. Practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to Russia"", as per Reuters.

Meanwhile, RIA, the Russian state-run news agency, cited Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, saying that Putin ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish officers who disobeyed his orders of excluding conscripts from the troops sent to Ukraine.

During a televised address on International Women's Day, March 8, Putin clearly said ""Conscripted soldiers are not participating and will not participate in the fighting. There will not be an additional conscription of reservists either"", and added, ""The fixed objectives are only carried out by professional servicemen. I am sure they are guaranteeing security and peace for the Russian people in an effective manner"".

The Russian defence ministry and President Putin seem to have two different versions about the involvement of conscripts in Russian operations in Ukraine. Notably, Russia has passed a law that gives up to 15 years in jail for spreading false news about the Russian military.

However, some associations of soldiers' mothers in Russia have raised their concerns since conscripts have gone incommunicado around the time Putin sent his troops into Ukraine. As per Reuters, there are suggestions that these individuals might have been sent to fight though they lacked adequate training. Up until now, this was denied by both Kremlin and the military authorities.",https://opoyi.com/english/conscripts-sent-to-ukraine-russian-defence-ministry-exposes-putins-lies

Russian President Vladimir Putin likely never thought he would have to admit that conscripts had been used in Ukraine — and, yet, the Russian government had to do just that.

Conscription is a sensitive topic in Russia, and their use by the Kremlin indicates the degree to which the country’s leaders believed they could keep the cost of the war hidden from the domestic populace. But now that their deployment is public, what does Russia’s continued use of conscripts say about the war and the future course the conflict may take?

The short answer is that the war is not going as well as planned — and using conscripts could create more problems for Russian security leadership.

Russian military personnel consist of four primary groups: officers, (a very small pool of) non-commissioned officers, contracted personnel and conscripts. Historically, conscription has been used in Russia to ensure that a large portion of the population has military training in case of mobilization for a major war, and to cut costs associated with maintaining a military large enough to defend the country. They are also generally prohibited from being deployed abroad. Today, Russia requires all male citizens aged 18 to 27 to register for conscription, normally for the term of a year, and then move into a mandatory reserve status.

Currently, most estimates hold that approximately 25 percent of the Russian military is made up of conscripts, with the number varying within each military service and between unit types. And though Russia has attempted to move toward a professional army — primarily to increase the level of training and expertise in the force — the country must balance professionalization with its need to maintain a large military.

Yet public support for conscription is limited in Russia, and the deployment of conscripts is controversial. Conscripts are generally less capable than their contracted counterparts, as their service period limits their training. And although a longer conscription period would lead to a more capable conscript force, such a decision would prove unpopular with the Russian public. Thus, when used, conscripted service members are generally seen in roles requiring less technical expertise, like logistics, which has already proved a key sticking point in Russia’s advance across Ukraine.

Additionally, due to widespread, brutal hazing — called dedovshchina — seen since the Soviet period, conscripts also have lower morale and unit cohesion. The Russian military has had varied success in reducing its effects, but hazing remains a major problem, leading to widespread (and often successful) attempts to try to gain exemptions from service, most frequently for medical or educational reasons.

Furthermore, the use of conscripts in active combat will impact wide swaths of Russian families and is likely to draw a negative reaction from the broader public as casualties grow. During the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s, Soviet leadership was so concerned about public outcry over casualties and about denying the reality of war that it sent home soldiers killed in action in sealed zinc coffins. The comparison is unlikely to be far from anyone’s mind.

Clearly, domestic pressure is already strong enough that the Russian government felt it had to admit that conscripts were in Ukraine. As recently as last Tuesday, Putin promised that no Russian conscripts were being used in the war against Ukraine. But just one day later, the Ministry of Defense publicly confirmed that there were Russian conscripts in Ukraine and that some had been taken prisoner. The Russian government then vowed to return all of them home and prevent their further deployment. And earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed directly to conscripts to surrender in a speech about halting the conflict.

Prior to the official announcement, reports of their presence had been circulating in Russia, and while information out of Ukraine is hard to decipher, text messages to mothers and recordings of soldiers crying on the front lines have surfaced. Videos of Russian prisoners of war suggest that at least some did not know they were going to fight in Ukraine, and there are reports of low morale among Russian soldiers more broadly. Within Russia, the advocacy group Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers of Russia has also raised concerns that conscripts were being forced to sign contracts at the border — a practice reportedly used by Russia in Ukraine in 2014.

If purposeful, the Russian military’s use of conscripts despite all these drawbacks is an indication of how easy they thought the campaign would be. Conscripts are not often found in elite units, and early assessments of Russian operational plans suggest that elite units were expected to secure areas quickly and without much resistance. However, with the Ukrainian military’s unexpected performance, Russia has had to push more units into combat, and it is unlikely it would have used conscripts if they did not think them necessary — thus, their involvement could also be a sign that attempts to fill military personnel needs with contract soldiers have failed.

If, as the Russian government has suggested, their employment in Ukraine was accidental, this reflects poorly on Russian command leadership, as well as severe personnel control issues within the Russian officer corps.

The situation also suggests the degree to which Russian officials must have assumed they could control domestic discourse. While the Kremlin does control most media messaging — and has increasingly tightened its grip on the information space — bad news from the front is hard to hide. And when mothers are unable to reach their sons, or when they start coming back with injuries or in coffins, the realities of war may fuel anger among the Russian population, just as it did during the Soviet-Afghan War.

The Russian government is thus constrained. With the war more difficult than anticipated, it needs more personnel in combat and support roles. However, if it continues to use conscripts, especially in any large numbers, this could be seen as a sign of increasing military desperation. Pushing more conscripts into Ukraine, or using them after promising to bring them home, doesn’t just mean the Russian military is sending less capable forces to the front; it also risks raising the human cost of war back home, potentially leading to further public outcry, as the Russian population may realize that they were lied to.

Whatever the reason for their deployment, the use of Russian conscripts in the war in Ukraine reflects poorly on the capability and readiness of the Russian military for this conflict. And though we still do not know the extent to which conscripts are represented in the Russian forces in Ukraine, or in which units they are fighting, how the Russian military handles them going forward will be a clear indicator of its commitment to the war and of how well they think it is going.",https://www.politico.eu/article/what-the-use-of-russia-conscripts-tells-us-about-the-war-in-ukraine/
4,30863b02-90ce-4fd3-976d-991a397bd4c3,[],,"BACKGROUND ON CONSCRIPTION IN RUSSIA The Russian Federation has had a conscription army since 1918.3 In recent years, approximately 400,000 young men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-seven are drafted each year to serve in the regular army, the Ministry of Internal Affairs forces, border troops, and other branches of Russia's vast armed forces.4 During the Soviet period conscription was a fact of life that was not open to public discussion. But after perestroika, Russians were able to voice their objections to conscription, and it became increasingly unpopular with the Russian public. Combined with reports about the disastrous state of the Russian military, these objections spurred many debates about transition to a professional army. The immense public antipathy toward conscription is closely linked to numerous exposés about endemic abuses in the armed forces. Among the first was Yuri Poliakov's 1987 novel, One Hundred Days Until the Order, which gave the Soviet public the first opportunity to read a frank account of violent hazing of conscripts during their first year of service.5 In subsequent years, especially after the break-up of the Soviet Union, the media continued to expose the appalling conditions in the armed forces, including severe malnutrition and poor medical care that sometimes led to death and permanent injury of conscripts. Journalists also provided vivid descriptions of conscripts' desperation that too often led to suicide, frequent attempts to desert, and a pattern of deserters going on shooting sprees or committing suicide in order to avoid having to return to their military unit.6 As young men of conscription age and their parents became increasingly wary about the perils of military service, many of them started looking for ways, both legal and illegal, to avoid it.7 A network of soldiers' mothers' organizations emerged throughout the Russian Federation dedicated to helping young men and their parents find legal ways of avoiding conscription. For more than ten years, these groups-one of Russia's most widespread and effective grassroots movements-have helped thousands of young men avoid being drafted arbitrarily when they had legitimate grounds not to serve. They have also helped defend the rights of numerous conscripts who fled their units due to ill-treatment, malnutrition, and other abuse. Popular discontent with the treatment of conscripts reached new heights in the mid-1990s, when Russia's military leadership sent poorly prepared conscripts to fight in the war in Chechnya. Thousands of conscripts died.8 By 1996, conscription was so unpopular that, as part of a desperate effort to boost his ratings during the election campaign, then-President Boris Yeltsin promised to abolish it after he was reelected. Yeltsin abandoned his promise. Today, with Russia's second Chechen war entering its fourth year, young men of conscription age continue to fear being sent to Chechnya to fight, although public protests against the war have not reached 1996 levels. In November 2001, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov announced plans for a long-term and sweeping overhaul of the armed forces. The plan envisages significantly downsized armed forces made up only of well-paid professionals and equipped with updated military hardware by 2010. It calls for the gradual abolishment of conscription, starting in 2004.9 In March 2002, Ivanov announced that the Ministry of Defense would start by transforming one paratrooper division in mid-2002, an experiment he said would allow officials to plan for the subsequent transition of the rest of the armed forces.10 Although many Ministry of Defense officials seemed skeptical about the transition to a professional army, few challenged the view that reforms were necessary. The Conscription Process

Russian law gives detailed guidelines for the various stages of the conscription process. These guidelines, found in the 1998 law on military service and a 1999 implementing regulation, are applicable without exception to all young men of conscription age.11 In the year he turns seventeen, a male citizen is entered into the military registry (in Russian: voinskii uchet). At this time, a preliminary determination is made as to whether he is fit for military service or has grounds for a non-medical exemption.12 When he turns eighteen, a Russian male receives a summons to appear at his local draft board for conscription proceedings. According to the regulation on conscription, he must be directly handed the summons and must sign it.13 If a young man is handed a draft summons and signs but subsequently does not appear for conscription proceedings, he is considered to be a draft dodger and is prosecuted under the criminal code.14 If officials are unable to physically hand a young man a summons, the military recruitment office may request the local police precinct in writing to help ""ensure"" his presence at conscription proceedings.15 Human Rights Watch did not find any cases in which a man delivered with a summons refused to sign, and it is unclear what consequences ensue in such cases. Conscription proceedings ordinarily consist of a medical exam by physicians to determine a candidate's fitness for military service,16 and a determination by the draft board (in Russian, prizyvnaia komissia) as to whether he should be exempted from military service, given a deferral, placed in reserve, drafted, or sent to perform alternative service.17 It also assigns the candidate to a specific branch of service.18 Once the draft board has reached a decision to conscript, it informs the draftee, who is entitled to a copy of the conscription order upon request.19 The draft board then allows him to go home to await a service summons to appear at the collection point (in Russian, sbornyi punkt) from which he is to depart to his military base.20 This waiting period typically lasts from one day to about three months. During this time, the young man may appeal the draft board's decision.21 At the collection point, the municipal or province draft board reviews the decisions of the local commission, and a panel of medical doctors once again examines his fitness. After these procedures, representatives of military units meet the new conscripts and arrange for their departure.22 Draft Quota Problems

Due in part to conscription's unpopularity and in part to the deteriorating health of Russia's youth, recruitment authorities in many cities throughout Russia cannot meet draft quotas, and many of those drafted have been described as in poor health.23 Many young men of conscription age do not want to serve in the armed forces. They are worried about endemic hazing, being sent to Chechnya, or simply see spending two years in the army as a waste of their time and career opportunities. Some are conscientious objectors who have no options for real alternative civilian service.24 Many temporarily or permanently avoid military service by enrolling in educational programs, or finding government jobs that allow them to defer service, or by having a doctor document legitimate health problems that disqualify them for service.25 Other young men use illegitimate means to avoid being conscripted by, for example, paying bribes to members of draft boards, doctors, or other officials. Others simply avoid recruitment officials. They refuse to open the door when officials come to their homes to hand them draft summonses, do not live where they are registered, and ignore the summonses that are dropped into their mailboxes.26 According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces, every year 30,000 young men ignore draft summonses and fail to appear for conscription proceedings.27 This figure appears to include both young men to whom officials served summonses but who failed to appear for conscription proceedings, and young men who ignored summonses that had not been properly served and are thus invalid under the law. In July 2002, the Russian media reported that in Nizhnii Novgorod the number of people the military recruitment office considered such draft evaders outnumbered those actually drafted during that conscription period.28 Military officials have found it particularly difficult to conscript young men in Moscow, likely a consequence of better access to information, greater career opportunities, and the higher level of wealth Moscow's youth enjoy compared to their peers elsewhere in Russia. The conscription quota set for Moscow is low compared to other regions, but recruitment officials still have difficulty meeting it. In the fall of 2001, only about 3 percent of all conscripts were drafted from Moscow, whereas young men of draft age in Russia's largest city make up almost 6 percent of the total number of young men of draft age in Russia.29 Official statistics for the 2001 fall conscription period show that between 50 and 60 percent of all young men processed by Moscow draft boards had an education-related right to deferral, 30 percent were declared unfit for military service, and 2 percent received a deferral based on their family situation.30 It is unclear what percentage of Muscovites of conscription age simply ignored draft summonses, served properly or not, in the fall of 2001, but according to official statistics about 10,000 Muscovites failed to appear at military recruitment offices for conscription proceedings.31 According to the Soldiers' Mothers of St. Petersburg, a similar situation exists in St. Petersburg.32 The deteriorating health of Russia's youths has compounded the conscription crisis. Poor health has disqualified about 50 percent of Russia's young men for military service each year in recent years. A Ministry of Defense official told a press conference in April 2002 that in 2001, doctors on draft boards found no less than 54 percent of the young men tested unfit for military service.33 Another official said that for the 400,000 young men drafted some 600,000 young men are declared unfit each year.34 Because Russia's youth is wracked with poor health, and because many of Russia's most healthy and educated young men successfully manage to avoid military service, recruitment officials are often left to select conscripts from a group of young men with low education levels and sometimes serious health problems. An unidentified Russian lawmaker told The Moscow Times that, in a speech to the State Duma, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said the young men drafted in the fall of 2001 were a ""pathetic lot, afflicted with drug addiction, psychological problems and malnutrition.""35 Ministry of Defense statistics indicate that every second conscript had an alcohol problem prior to entering service, and that every fourth had been a drug user.36 In October 2001, Moscow's acting military commissioner Viktor Beznosikov also complained at a press conference about the decreasing level of education among new conscripts and the increasing number of new conscripts with a criminal record.37 A July 2002 edition of the web publication Grani.ru described the average conscript as a ""young man who has not completed high school"" who, prior to being drafted, ""did not study or work and indulged in vodka and narcotics."" It concluded that the ""absolute majority of conscripts come from poor and socially disadvantaged families that do not have the means to enroll the young man in paid education or buy them a false certificate for deferral.""38 In response to the conscription crisis, officials have recently slashed conscription quotas; whereas traditionally about 200,000 people were conscripted during each of the two conscription periods, in the spring of 2002 the quota was set for just over 160,000.39 The Ministry of Defense is also developing legislation that would cut the list of deferral grounds and enable recruitment officials to draft tens of thousands of additional young men who currently work for government agencies.40 It remains unclear if and when this legislation will enter into force. Finally, in a number of large cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, recruitment officials have reverted to detaining perceived draft dodgers for conscription.41 3 Conscript and contract soldiers make up rank-and-file soldiers and sergeants in the Russian armed forces; in peacetime, conscript soldiers far outnumber contract soldiers. Higher ranks are made up of professional soldiers. 4 Article 2 of the Law on the Conscription Obligation and Military Service of March 28, 1998 contains a full list of all branches where conscripts may serve: Military service is a special kind of federal state service, which citizens perform in the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, as well as in the border troops of the Russian Federation, the interior troops of the Ministry of Interior of the Russian Federation, the railway troops of the Russian Federation, troops of the federal agency for government communication and information under the president of the Russian Federation, civil defense troops (hereinafter-other troops), engineering-technical and road construction military formations of federal executive organs (hereinafter-military formations), the foreign intelligence service of the Russian Federation, the organs of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, the organs of the Federal Border Service of the Russian Federation, the federal organs for government communication and information, the federal organs of state security (in Russian: gosudarstvennoi okhrany), the federal organ for ensuring mobilization preparedness of the organs of state power of the Russian Federation (hereinafter-the organs) and in special formations created for time of war. 5 Yurii Poliakov, Sto Dnei do Prikaza, (Moscow: Molodaia Gvardia), 2001. 6 Vladimir Mukhin, ""Minoborony: po Rossii guliaet dva batal'ona desertirov,"" (Defense Ministry: Two Batallions of Deserters are Wandering around Russia), Strana.ru, July 11, 2002. See: http://www.strana.ru/stories/01/08/23/1053/152459.html (Accessed September 3, 2002). 7 Throughout Russia it is overwhelmingly the mothers of recruitment-age males who actively seek to prevent their conscription. 8 Official figures for the number of soldiers (including conscripts, contract soldiers, and officers) who died during the first Chechnya war vary from almost 4,000 to 5,500 (official figures cited in the newspaper Kommersant respectively on August 4, 2000 and September 21, 2000). Unofficial estimates are higher: journalist and Chechnya expert Viacheslav Ismailov estimated about 8,000 military servicemen had died (Novaia gazeta, [The New Gazette], April 10, 2000) and Kommersant cited the Union of Committees of Soldiers' Mothers as saying the figure was around 14,000. At least half, and possibly many more, of the deceased military servicemen were conscript soldiers. 9 Megan Twohey and Kevin O'Flynn, ""Putin Moves to Make Good on Yeltsin Pledge,"" The Moscow Times, November 23, 2001. 10 Jon Boyle, ""Elite Russian Paratroopers to Try Out Army Reform,"" Reuters news agency, March 5, 2002. 11 Law on the Conscription Obligation and Military Service of March 28, 1998 (hereinafter-the law on military service).

This report does not cover such cases. 15 Article 31(2) of the law on military service and article 10 of the regulation on conscription. Officials authorized to deliver a draft summons include officials of the military recruitment office, supervisors at work or at educational institutions, and officials of the local authorities and other organizations responsible for work related to compulsory military service (see: article 7 of the regulation on conscription and article 31(2) of the law on military service). 16 Russian law contains a long list of medical grounds that exempt an individual from performing military service temporarily or permanently. The law on military service establishes five categories of fitness of conscript candidates: A - fully fit for military service; B - fit for military service with minor restrictions; C - partially fit for military service; D - temporarily unfit for military service; and E - unfit for military service. Conscript candidates who are classified in category A and B are considered fit for military service, although category B excludes service in certain types of units. People classified in category C do not have to serve in peacetime but may be drafted in time of war. The fitness of conscript candidates in category D is re-examined within a year (Article 24 (1a) of the law on military service). Those placed in category E cannot be drafted even in time of war. An appendix to the Regulation on the Military Medical Examination (confirmed by Decision No. 390 of the government of the Russian Federation of April 20, 1995) contains a list of medical conditions and the relevant categories. The appendix can be found at: http://www.hro.org/docs/rlex/milexp/index.htm (accessed on August 23, 2002). 17 Articles 23 and 24 of the law on military service provide for a complex set of non-medical exemption and deferral grounds. For example, a candidate may claim exemption if he has performed military service in a different state, or if his father or brother died while performing military service or as a result of injuries sustained during military service. A candidate has a right to deferral for certain types of studies, if he has a child under three, is a single father, if he is the only person obliged by law to care for an immediate relative in need of constant care, if he works as a medical doctor in an agricultural environment, or under other circumstances. See: http://www.hro.org/docs/rlex/newzvovs/razdel4.htm#24 (accessed on August 23, 2002). 18 Article 14 of the regulation on conscription. 19 Article 28(6) of the law on military service. 20 Article 16 of the regulation on conscription. The draft board may also deliver the summons to appear at the collection point while the recruit is still at the recruitment office. 21 The law on military service does not specify a fixed statutory period for appeal of a draft board decision. However, the 1993 Law on Court Appeals against Decisions and Actions that Violate the Rights and Freedoms of Citizens establishes that court appeals against decisions by state and other agencies must be launched within three months of the moment the plaintiff became aware of the violation of his right (Article 5) 22 Article 28 of the regulation on conscription. 23 Valentina Melnikova of the Union of Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia told Human Rights Watch that military officials set inflated draft quotas. She explained that quotas are based on information from local military registries, which do not accurately reflect the health conditions of many of the young men, as medical examinations conducted when they are entered into the registry are often cursory. 24 After years of delays in parliament, in July 2002, Russia adopted a law regulating conscientious objection. The law will enter into force only on January 1, 2004. It sets out a 3.5-year period of alternative service, and a three-year period for those willing to perform alternative service on military bases. 25 Certain types of jobs at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the tax police, the customs services, and other government agencies entitle their holders to defer military service. See article 24(1g-h) of the law on military service. Medical commissions attached to draft boards frequently perform only a superficial medical examination. Soldiers' mothers' groups therefore recommend that men be examined by specialists and present their reports to the doctors at the military recruitment office to force them to pay serious attention to health problems. 26 The law on military service requires recruitment or other officials to hand summonses directly to the young men, who must sign the summons in acknowledgement. A summons that is simply left in a mailbox does not have legal force.

Former NATO chief Wesley Clarke 'surprised' by Russian 'ineffectiveness' in Ukraine

Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Wesley Clarke told DW that he was ""surprised by the ineffectiveness of the Russian military"" in Ukraine.

""The Russians have proven themselves a relatively inept force,"" he said.

Clarke said ""any negotiations will be determined by the outcome on the ground, [which] is determined by the resistance of the Ukrainians"" and that NATO should increase its support to Ukraine by giving it ""javelins, stingers and as much anti-air and air support as is feasible to do.""

Watch video 07:14 War in Ukraine: Former NATO commander Wesley Clark talks to DW

Clarke added that although it wasn't possible to establish a ""legalistic"" no-fly zone in Ukraine, ""air support can be provided by nations who are willing to go in.""

When asked if NATO air support could lead to further escalation and the outbreak of a third world war, Clarke said ""if we fall back and are intimidated by Mr. Putin's threat of nuclear weapons, if there's nothing we can do to help Ukraine, then we'll be dealing with the next crisis on NATO's territory itself.""

""Escalation by Mr. Putin is not solely under the control of NATO,"" Clarke said, adding that Putin may decide to escalate regardless of NATO's actions.

Clarke said that, although Russian forces were currently ""checked"" on the ground by Ukraine, this could change quickly as Russia ramps up bombing and shelling of population centers.

Putin is ""trying to steal Ukraine as quietly and quickly as he can,"" Clarke said. ""But he will use massive firepower if necessary.""

IMF approves $1.4 million in support for Ukraine

The International Monetary Fund has greenlit $1.4 million (€1.26 million) in emergency support for Ukraine.

The aim of the emergency financing is to help Ukraine deal with its ""massive humanitarian and economic crisis.""

The financial package provides Kyiv with ""critical financial support"" to boost the ""large-scale mobilization"" of funding needed to ""mitigate the economic impacts of the war.""

""We are immensely grateful to the IMF for its prompt response to our request. We look forward to completing all required procedures as soon as possible,"" Ukrainian Central Bank Governor Kyrylo Shevchenko said. ""It is vital for Ukraine now that it has been going through such a horrible time.""

US warns of chemical weapons threat against Ukraine

The White House has called Russia's ""false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development"" in Ukraine ""preposterous.""

White House spokesperson Jen Psaki wrote on Twitter: ""Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them.""

Russia has made several claims in recent days about weapons being developed in Ukraine and said on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces were planning on carrying out a ""false flag"" chemical attack against their own people and to blame it on Russia.

The US has now warned that this claim could be the pretext to a chemical attack that Russia would call a false flag attack by Ukraine.

Psaki said Russia ""has a long and well-documented track record of using chemical weapons"" and ""of accusing the West of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.""

MSC Chairman Christoph Heusgen: 'Putin is in a big dilemma right now'

On the eve of negotiations between the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine in Turkey, Munich Security Conference Chairman Christoph Heusgen told DW in an interview that he agreed with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's rebuff of Polish plans to provide fighter jets to Ukraine.

""It is very important that Germany supports Ukraine and we do a lot, a lot of solidarity: What our citizens do in solidarity, it's enormous, what we do in providing anti-tank missiles, Stinger missiles, this is very important,"" Heusgen said. ""But to provide fighter planes would actually create a danger of a direct confrontation with Russia. And this is something that the chancellor is right [to rule] out.""

Heusgen underscored the importance of dialogue, saying that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has offered something that is very substantial,"" as Kyiv offered Russia a ""face-saving way out"" of ""the miserable military situation they are in.""

Watch video 02:14 MSC chairman Heusgen: 'Putin is in a big dilemma right now'

""Well, I think he he wants what he said. I think that he wants to rebuild the Soviet Union under kind of the Russian flag, and he was totally mistaken,"" Heusgen said about what Putin wants from the invasion. ""He probably believed in what he said that Ukraine is not a real state, that Ukraine is part of Russia, that you have fascists and people, drug addicts there as their rulers. And he has to find out that it's the absolute opposite: They're patriotic, they do have their national identity, they are fighting — and Putin is in a big dilemma right now.""

Mariupol on 'the verge of death'

Petro Andryushchenko, advisor to the mayor of Mariupol, spoke to DW about the humanitarian crisis in the city.

""The children's hospital in Mariupol was just attacked by Russian planes, it's been completely destroyed. There's a maternity clinic there, and children,"" Andryushchenko said. ""The number of victims isn't clear yet, rescue workers are still removing the rubble.""

He told DW that Russian forces had violated a ceasefire agreement in the city and had blocked the evacuation of civilians.

""There is still no humanitarian corridor for the evacuation of people from the city. The city is on the verge of death,"" he said.

According to the figures they have available, the authorities believe at least 1,207 people have been killed, but said the death toll may even be as high as 15,000 already.

Russian F1 pilot Mazepin starts foundation to aid excluded athletes

Russian Nikita Mazepin, who was fired by his team Haas F1 Saturday, says he will create a new foundation to assist athletes excluded from competition as punishment for Russia's attack of Ukraine.

Haas also dropped sponsor Uralkali, a company owned by Mazepin's father Dmitry, a close associate of Vladimir Putin. On Wednesday, father and son were added to the EU's sanctions list.

Uralki, which is mulling legal action against Haas over the termination of its sponsoring contract, says it will now use its funds to sponsor the foundation ""We Compete as One,"" which seems to intentionally echo F1's ""We Race as One"" inclusion motto. Mazepin says, ""The foundation will allocate resources, both financial and non-financial, to those athletes who have spent their lives preparing for Olympics or Paralympics, or other top events, only to find that they were forbidden from competing and collectively punished just because of the passports they hold.""

On Wednesday, drivers gathered for the start of the season in Bahrain posed for a group photo later posted on Twitter with the words ""No War.""

Formula 1, which has few qualms more generally about working with authoritarian countries, terminated its contract for the Russian GP on February 25 in the face of driver boycotts.

'Compromise' on the table ahead of Thursday's high-level talks

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrived in the Turkish city of Antalya on Wednesday evening, ahead of the first high-level talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba since Russia launched its invasion two weeks ago.

Although delegations from both sides have met three times already to discuss humanitarian ceasefires, Thursday's talks will mark the first time the two countries' top diplomats will meet face-to-face amid open conflict.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told German newspaper Bild that: ""In any negotiation, my goal is to end the war with Russia. And I am also ready to take certain steps.""

""Compromises can be made, but they must not be the betrayal of my country,"" Zelenskyy said.

The talks were announced on Monday by Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and will take place ahead of a diplomatic forum in the coastal city.

German opposition calls for halt to Russian gas via Nord Stream 1

Germany's conservative Christian Union parties CDU/CSU on Wednesday called on the federal government to go on the offensive against Russian aggression by stopping gas imports from the country via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.

Opposition leader Friedrich Merz said the move would, ""take sanctions to a new level"" in the face of ""mass war crimes"" committed by Russia, saying the opposition is of the opinion that Germany ""must accept"" limits to gas imports ""in light of the situation"" in Ukraine.

""We don't want to wait until others suggest it then Germany again plays catch-up,"" Merz said. ""Or wait until Putin turns off the gas.""

He and deputy leader Alexander Dobrindt called on the government to lower fuel taxes from 19% down to 7% to soften the blow to consumers. They suggested implementing the measures for three months.

Merz and Dobrindt also criticized the ""ideologically driven"" steps taken by the government to shut down nuclear power plants, saying it made no sense to shut them down now.

On February 22, two days before Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz canceled approval of the controversial new $11 billion (€9.93 billion) Russian-German Nord Stream 2 pipeline before gas began to flow through it.

Kremlin admits use of conscripts in invasion

Russia's Defense Ministry has acknowledged that Russian conscripts were sent into Ukraine despite prior repeated denials by President Vladimir Putin.

""Unfortunately, we have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine. Practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to Russia,"" the Defense Ministry said in a statement.

The alarm was first raised by mothers of soldiers doing mandatory military service who said they had lost contact with their sons shortly after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

Putin repeatedly claimed that only professional soldiers had been used. On Wednesday the Kremlin admitted that conscripts had indeed been sent in, and that some had been taken captive.

The ministry also said it was launching an investigation to punish those who allegedly disobeyed orders not to use conscripts.

German Catholic Bishops' Conference calls for defense of Europe

German Catholic bishops alarmed at the war raging in Ukraine called for the defense of the European project allowing people to live in free democracies. Speaking at the annual spring plenary of the German Bishops' Conference on Wednesday, Bishop Bertram Meier of Augsburg said: ""We value human rights and civic freedoms, we stand for the common security of states and the exchange between them on the basis of binding and fair rules. All of this is under attack with the invasion of Ukraine.""

Meier said increased European support for Ukraine amid the threat of escalating military action was, ""compatible in principle with the basic Christian teaching of peace.""

Meier, who is responsible for foreign policy for the Conference, also defended Pope Francis, who has been criticized for his reluctance to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin for launching the attack on neighboring Ukraine. He said the pontiff, whose ultimate aim was for the fighting to stop, had been clear in his condemnation of violence but did not want to choose sides.

Bishop Bohdan Dzyurakh, the highest-ranking representative of Ukrainian Catholics in Germany condemned the war as an ""act of state terrorism.""

Former US general tells DW time is on Ukraine's side

Ben Hodges, retired US Army officer and the former commander of US forces in Europe, told DW that he believed Ukraine would be able to win against Russia.

""Russia is not going to get into Kyiv,"" Hodges said, grounding his claim in Moscow's decision to ""transition to attrition warfare.""

""To do that, you have to have time, you have to have unlimited ammunition and you have to have unlimited manpower. And Russia has none of those three,"" he said.

The former officer said that Russia was already showing signs of shortages, but these would get worse as sanctions begin to really take their toll ""in the next few weeks.""

He also rejected the idea that Russia had military superiority, claiming that Ukraine has more manpower and a population that has demonstrated a willingness to resist.

He added that despite Russia's advantage in sea power and airpower, ""the logistics is improving for the Ukrainians and it's only getting more difficult for the Russians.""

The retired officer also spoke about the plan to send Polish jets to Ukraine and how he thinks the war can be ended, you can watch the full interview here.

War threatens food supply in Russia, Ukraine and far beyond

Russia and Ukraine, two of the world's largest wheat exporters, announced export shifts amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Wheat exports from both countries are critical to the global food supply and the moves will likely have a far-reaching effect.

Ukraine has banned all wheat exports in an effort to avert catastrophe and feed local populations, while Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said his country must direct wheat supplies to domestic bread production in the face of mounting international sanctions.

Observers say the situation could be devastating to North African and Middle Eastern countries that are highly dependent on both suppliers and who are already struggling to afford high prices as supply shortages threaten to drive up purchasing costs further still into the unforeseeable future. Currently prices are 55% higher than they were one week before the Russian invasion.

Ukrainian officials: Attack hits children's hospital

Ukraine has accused Russia of bombing a children's hospital and maternity ward in the beleaguered port city of Mariupol.

Russia had said it would maintain a cease-fire to enable civilians to flee Mariupol and other besieged cities on Wednesday. But the city council said the hospital had been hit more than once.

Watch video 01:57 Ukraine accuses Russia of bombing children's hospital

""The Russian occupying forces have dropped several bombs on the children's hospital. The destruction is colossal,"" it said, adding that it did not yet know casualty numbers.

The report could not immediately be verified, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted: ""Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity.""

Russia wants to nationalize assets of firms that leave

A Russian government commission has taken the first step towards nationalizing the property of foreign firms that leave the country.

Russia's ruling party, United Russia, said in a statement that the commission on lawmaking activity had approved a bill allowing for firms more than 25% owned by foreigners from ""unfriendly states"" to be put into external administration. The party said this would be done to prevent bankruptcy and save jobs.

Scholz: Ukraine solution 'certainly doesn't involve' sending Polish jets

In a joint press conference with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau in Berlin, Germany's Olaf Scholz rejected Poland's suggestion to send fighter jets to Ukraine.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said: ""A military solution to the conflict doesn't make any sense, what we need right now is a diplomatic solution.""

Responding to a question about possible delivery of Polish fighter jets to Ukraine via the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the chancellor emphasized next steps needed to be thought through carefully.

""And that certainly doesn't involve any military planes,"" Scholz said, also alluding to the defensive military equipment Germany had already dispatched to Ukraine.

Watch video 00:24 Scholz: Germany won't send fighter jets to Ukraine

Poland first said on Tuesday that it was willing to make its fighter jets available, for the US to then deliver to Ukraine's military. Urkainian pilots are trained to fly Soviet-made Mig fighters.

The US has since dismissed the request, with a Pentagon spokesperson saying the plan would raise ""serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance.""

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for NATO to reconsider in a video message on Telegram on Wednesday: ""We ask you again to decide as soon as possible. Send us planes,"" he said.

Ukraine accuses Russia of holding 400,000 'hostage' in Mariupol

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Wednesday condemned what he called Russia's ""barbaric war on civilians and babies"" in an English-language post on Twitter. Kuleba said Moscow was ""holding hostage over 400,000 people in Mariupol"" and decried the shortage of food and medicine ""for almost 3,000 newborn babies"" in the city.

Russia and Ukraine agreed earlier to a new 12-hour ceasefire to allow civilians to flee cities including the southern port of Mariupol, which has been without water and electricity for the past nine days as Russian forces continue to besiege the city.

Progress in establishing safe humanitarian corridors remains limited as hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped in cities across Ukraine.

Ukraine to pull troops, equipment from UN missions

A UN official said Ukraine would withdraw its troops and equipment from all UN peacekeeping operations.

Its biggest contribution is to MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where a 250-member aviation unit operates nine helicopters on behalf of the UN.

""At the moment, we are evaluating what impact this retreat could have on our mission and how we can minimize it,"" a Monusco official told the Reuters news agency.

Ukrainian media reported that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree on Tuesday recalling all peacekeeping forces to assist in the war effort at home.

Ukraine contributes about 300 troops, police officers, and staff to six UN missions, but its decision to repatriate aircraft would significantly impact peacekeeping operations.

Two lions rescued from Kyiv arrive in Belgium

Two young lions rescued in Ukraine arrived at a wildlife rehabilitation center in Belgium.

The two were due to be transferred to Belgium in May after the Ukrainian authorities seized them from private owners who had mistreated them.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine meant the transfer had to happen sooner.

The journey was almost cut short, Frederik Thoelen, a biologist who has worked at the Belgium Natuurhulpcentrum shelter, said.

""The Russian army, they pointed their guns at the [Ukranian] carers. They threatened to kill the animals. The carers said, 'No those are our animals. If you touch the animals, you first have to touch us,'"" Thoelen told the Reuters news agency.

The lions, called Tsar and Jamil, were driven to Poland and then to Belgium.

The shelter will hold them in quarantine for three months and nurse them back to health before starting to look for permanent homes.

US has declared economic war, Russia says

Russia said the US is waging an economic war against it.

""The United States definitely has declared economic war against Russia and is waging this war,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

It comes after US President Joe Biden announced the US would no longer import Russian oil.

""We will not be part of subsidizing Putin's war,"" Biden said, describing energy imports as ""the main artery of Russia's economy.""

Peskov said Russia would remain a reliable energy supplier and pointed out that energy flows continued.

""But you see the bacchanalia, the hostile bacchanalia, which the West has sown — and that, of course, makes the situation very difficult and forces us to think seriously,"" Peskov said.

Chernobyl without power

Ukraine's state-run nuclear company said Russian Forces had cut a power line supplying electricity to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

Chernobyl no longer generates electricity, but it needs the power to help cool spent nuclear fuel.

Energoatom said it was impossible to fix the power line because of ongoing fighting in the area.

Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said authorities did not know the radiation levels at the site since the Russians took control of it.

On Tuesday, the UN's nuclear watchdog said Chernobyl was no longer transmitting data.

""The Director-General ... indicated that remote data transmission from safeguards monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP had been lost,"" the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement.

The defunct plant sits inside an exclusion zone that houses decommissioned reactors and radioactive waste facilities.

Russia says not trying to 'overthrow' Ukraine government

Russia claims it does not want to overthrow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government.

The Russian military had not ordered to ""overthrow the current government,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, said during a press briefing on Wednesday.

Her denial comes after Moscow's often repeated aims to disarm its neighbor and target leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis.""

Zakharova also said ""some progress has been made"" in the Russia-Ukraine talks.

On Monday, Zelenskyy said negotiations to resolve the conflict had made little progress.

He also said he was ""not hiding"" and ""not afraid of anyone"" as he revealed his location in Kyiv.

New Zealand passed a bill to impose economic sanctions on Russia.

It is a first for the country, which normally only acts following a resolution of the United Nations.

Amnesty International says Chernihiv attack likely a war crime

A Russian airstrike that killed at least 47 civilians in the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv may constitute a war crime, Amnesty International said.

""This was a merciless, indiscriminate attack on people as they went about their daily business in their homes, streets and shops,"" said Joanne Mariner, Amnesty International's Crisis Response Director.

Russia escalated its air campaign against Ukraine last week, and Thursday's attacks on Chernihiv destroyed high-rise apartments buildings and damaged a clinic and hospital.

Amnesty International's Crisis Response team has concluded the attack was most likely a Russian airstrike using at least eight unguided aerial bombs, known as dumb bombs.

Amnesty was not able to identify a military target at the scene of the strike.

""This shocking attack is one of the deadliest that the people of Ukraine have endured yet. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court should investigate this airstrike as a war crime. Those responsible for such crimes must be brought to justice, and victims and their families must receive full reparation."" Mariner said.

Corridors open in Ukraine after failed attempt

The Russian military said it would hold fire and open humanitarian corridors in several Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv.

Separately, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, said people would be allowed to evacuate Kyiv, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy and warned Russian forces against shooting in those areas.

""I appeal to the Russian Federation: You have undertaken official public commitments to cease fire from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. We have had negative experiences when the commitments that were undertaken did not work,"" Vereshchuk said.

On Tuesday, at least 5,000 civilians managed to flee from Suny, but Russia and Ukraine accused each other of failing to implement a ceasefire in other cities.

The UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, said thatup to 2.2 million refugees had fled Ukraine since February's Russian invasion.

Europe won't need Russian gas to get through winter

Europe has enough liquefied natural gas to last it throughout winter, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

She told Germany's ARD television the EU wouldn't need to import any gas from Russia.

Von der Leyen said sanctions against Russia were designed to cause a maximum impact on Moscow while causing the least damage possible to Western economies.

On Tuesday, the Commission proposed a plan to free the EU entirely of its Russian gas dependence before the end of the decade.

It will switch to alternative supplies and expand clean energy more quickly.

The US and UK have also announced plans to stop the import of Russian oil.

US Congress agrees on Ukraine aid package

US lawmakers put up a rare united front on Wednesday, agreeing on a bipartisan deal providing $13.6 billion (€12.4 billion) to help Ukraine and European allies.

Democratic and Republican backing for the Ukraine aid package was so staunch it is substantially more than the $10 billion the White House requested.

The aid package is part of a $1.5 trillion funding bill to prevent a US government shutdown.

Party leaders hoped to push the measure through the House on Wednesday and the Senate by the end of the week.

""War in Europe has focused the energies of Congress to getting something done and getting it done fast,'' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.

UK strengthens aviation sanctions against Russia

The British government unveiled new aviation sanctions giving it the power to detain any Russian aircraft that enters UK airspace.

Most European nations, including the UK, closed airspace to Russian aircraft last week, but London has now made it a ""criminal offense"" for Russian planes to fly or land in the country.

""The ban includes any aircraft owned, operated or chartered by anyone connected with Russia or designated individuals or entities, and will include the power to detain any aircraft owned by persons connected with Russia,"" the Foreign Office said in a statement.

The country also barred exports of aviation or space-related goods to Russia.

World Bank official: Russia-Ukraine crisis could limit growth and create food insecurity

A World Bank official said that persistently high oil prices resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine could cut a full percentage point off of growth in a number of large oil-importing developing economies.

Countries that could be affected include China, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey, World Bank official Indermit Gill said.

Additionally, a number of economies in Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa are ""heavily reliant on Russia and Ukraine for food,"" Gill said.

""For lower-income countries, disruption to supplies as well as higher prices could cause increased hunger and food insecurity,"" he added. ""The war has aggravated those uncertainties in ways that will reverberate across the world, harming the most vulnerable people in the most fragile places.""

Thousands of Ukrainian citizens, foreign students evacuate Sumy

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that thousands of civilians had left the northeastern Sumy region, according to the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN.

The corridor out of Sumy will continue to function on Wednesday, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy confirmed.

Among the evacuees were 5,000 Ukrainians and 1,700 international students, Vereshchuk said, adding that the evacuation was successful due to the mediation of the Red Cross.

The city of Sumy lies some 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) southwest of Ukraine's border with Russia.

According to Vereshchuk, Sumy has been under ""total siege"" for three days.

Civilians left the city in busses and cars to Poltava during a ceasefire on Tuesday, the only one that held. From Poltava many are expected to go on to the western city of Lviv and to neighboring EU countries.

Sumy is the first city where a humanitarian corridor has been successfully established. In four other cities selected for evacuation, no Nomparable escape route has as of yet been made available.

Some 200,000 people are still waiting to get out of the southeastern port city of Mariupol, according to the Red Cross.

On Wednesday, the Russian military said routes would be open in Kyiv, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy for civilians trying to escape besieged cities. However, Ukraine has repeatedly warned Moscow is not genuinely looking to allow civilians to flee.

Zhyvytskyy said Sumy was bombarded overnight.

Zelenskyy thanks US, UK for ban on Russian oil imports

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the leaders of the US and UK for banning Russian oil imports in his daily video address.

""This is a powerful signal to the whole world,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to US President Joe Biden's decision to ban oil imports from Russia.

""Either Russia will respect international law and not wage wars, or it will have no money,"" he added.

""Every cent paid to Russia turns into bullets and projectiles that fly into other sovereign states,"" Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy called for the war to end through negotiation with Russia saying, ""the war must be stopped. We need to sit down at the negotiating table, but for honest, substantive talks.""

Pentagon rejects Polish offer to send fighter jets to Ukraine through Germany

The Pentagon has rejected Poland's offer to send its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via a US airbase in Germany.

Poland's offer would have had Soviet-era MiG-29 fighters sent to the US base in Ramstein, Germany, with the aircraft eventually being given to Ukraine. Poland's air force would have then received F-16 fighters as replacements.

""We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.

Kirby said flying from a US base ""into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance.""

Russia's army said on Wednesday that young draftees were sent to fight in its war against Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin previously denied that conscripts were involved in the attack.

Some of the conscripts have been captured, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.

Russia's military admitted on Wednesday that young draftees were sent to fight in its war against Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin denied that conscripts were involved in the attack.

""Unfortunately, some facts have come to light about the presence of conscript servicemen among the Russian armed forces conducting the special military operation on Ukrainian territory,"" said Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov.

""Practically all of the conscripts have been returned to the territory of the Russian Federation,"" Konashenkov added.

Konashenkov said, however, that some of the conscripts have been captured.

""In addition, one of the divisions operating toll security has been attacked by a diversionist group of the national battalion,"" he said, adding, ""A number of military personnel, some of which conscripts, were captured in this attack.""

Konashenkov continued, ""Effective immediately, exhaustive measures have been taken to prevent conscripts from entering any and all combat zones, and to free captured personnel.""

Earlier this week, Putin said that only ""professional"" Russian soldiers were sent in to invade Ukraine and that he would not send conscripts to fight, according to The Moscow Times.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday Putin ordered conscripts to be excluded from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to Russian state media.

Before Russia launched its February 24 attack on Ukraine, Putin had instructed all military commanders ""to categorically exclude the involvement of conscripts for any tasks on the territory of Ukraine,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, the state-owned TASS news agency reported.

""In connection with the facts of the presence of a number of conscripts in the units of the armed forces who are participating in a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, at the direction of the President of Russia, materials have been sent to the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office to verify and legally assess the actions and punish officials responsible for failure to comply with this order,"" Peskov said, according to TASS.

President Biden strongly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine during his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday. Here are some excerpts from his prepared remarks, as released by the White House.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

He met the Ukrainian people.

From President Zelensky to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

In this struggle as President Zelensky said in his speech to the European Parliament, “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian ambassador to the United States is here tonight.

Let each of us here tonight in this chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.

Please rise if you are able and show that, yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.

Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.

They keep moving.

And the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.

That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War II.

The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.

It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.

Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.

He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.

He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did.

We prepared extensively and carefully.

We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.

I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.

We countered Russia’s lies with truth.

And now that he has acted, the free world is holding him accountable.

Along with 27 members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.

We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.

Together with our allies — we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.

We are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian ruble, making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.

We are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.

Tonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime, “No more.”

The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.

We are joining with our European allies to find and seize their yachts their luxury apartments their private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.

And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. He has no idea what’s coming.

The Ruble has lost 30 percent of its value.

The Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value, and trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is to blame.

Together with our allies, we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance.

We are giving more than $1 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine, and will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.

But let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.

Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies — in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.

For that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

As I have made crystal clear: The United States and our allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power. Every single inch.

And we remain cleareyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks and months will be hard on them.

Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.

And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backward.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I always promised I would be. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.

And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.

But I want you to know that we are going to be OK.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

While it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake, now everyone sees it clearly.

We see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.

In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.

This is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.

To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you.

Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.

He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/01/world/ukraine-russia-war

""We are speaking about closing the sky. You can't decide to close or not to close, you can't decide,"" Zelenskky said in an interview with Sky News.

""Don't wait [for] me asking you several times, a million times, to close the sky. No. You have to phone us ... our people who lost their children and say: 'Sorry we didn't do it yesterday, one week ago. We didn't push Putin, we didn't speak with him a lot, we didn't find the dialogue with him. We did nothing.'""

""And it's true. Yesterday, the world did nothing. I'm sorry but it is true,"" Zelenskky said, calling on policymakers to act faster to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

""Close the sky and stop the bombing,"" he said.

When asked about Western concerns of a no-fly zone bringing about a direct confrontation with Russia, making the situation even worse, Zelenskky replied: ""So, it would be worse for whom? For our families? No, for whom? For them? No, who knows? Nobody knows. But we know that exactly that now is very bad. And in future, it will be too late.""

The report went on: “It likely indicates that the Russian military is struggling to amass sufficient combat power on this axis from the available conventional military units.

“Observed and reported casualties among Russian mechanised and airborne forces in the vicinity of north-western Kyiv Oblast have been very high, and various reports suggest that the morale and combat effectiveness of the remaining conventional forces there are low.”

Russian forces have captured towns to the north-west of Kyiv, including Irpin, Bucha and the military airfield at Hostomel. However, an armoured convoy 40 miles long stalled en route to Kyiv, vulnerable to attack from Ukraine forces.

The CIA said on Wednesday that it believed between 2,000 and 4,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in fighting across the country. Ukraine military and independent observers studying photographs and videos have also logged the destruction of Russian equipment, including hundreds of tanks and armoured vehicles as well as aircraft.

Military strategists believe Russia will launch an attempt to encircle Kyiv from the east and the west within the next 72 hours. They expect Chechen fighters to be involved.

One Chechen warlord, Magomed Tushayev, was reportedly killed at the start of the invasion in the fight for Hostomel, one of the key battlegrounds which has changed hands a number of times.

Philip Ingram, a former colonel in British military intelligence, said Putin had “failed to achieve any of the objectives I would have anticipated him to achieve by now”. He said the “traditional method for Russia is to become much more violent” as a consequence.

Mr Ingram added: “Bringing in Chechens and the promoting of it may be as much about information operation as military capability. They are supposed to be these big scary murderers and scaring the local population into surrendering is what Putin is now hoping for.”

Meanwhile in Moscow, police have been accused of stopping commuters and demanding to check their phones, as they suppress any sign of dissent - prompting tens of thousands of people to flee the country.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/03/09/russia-ukraine-war-conscripts-army-troops-fight/
