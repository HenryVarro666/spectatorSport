MARIUPOL, Ukraine (AP) — In the port city of Mariupol, where Ukrainians are trying to fend off a Russian advance, an ambulance raced into a city hospital Sunday, carrying a 6-year-old girl mortally injured in Russian shelling.

She was pale. Her brown hair was pulled back with a rubber band. Her bloody pyjama pants were decorated with cartoon unicorns. She was brought in with her wounded father, his head bloodied and bandaged.

A medical team pumped her chest, fighting desperately to revive her. Her mother stood outside the ambulance, weeping.

“Take her out! Take her out! We can make it!” a hospital worker shouted, pushing a gurney to the ambulance.

The girl was raced inside and doctors and nurses huddled around her. One gave her an injection. Another tried to revive her with a defibrillator. A nurse wept. A doctor in blue medical scrubs, pumping oxygen into her, looked straight at the camera of an Associated Press videojournalist who had been allowed inside.

Reports of violent attacks in Ukraine have left the world shocked after Russian troops moved into the country.

While there has been much made of Russian air strikes, one of the methods in which troops have been attempting to take over the country is shelling attacks.

The method is deadly and can bring devastation to those affected, with citizens among those badly hit.

But what exactly does it mean, and how many attacks have taken place so far?

What is a shelling attack?

In simple terms, a shelling attack is when an enemy is constantly fires at with bombs

It is a common method of attack in war and conflicts throughout the ages.

Due to the high volume of ammunition in a short amount of time, cars, homes, buildings and people can be hit and either injured or killed.

The word “shelling” comes from the shells which are used up by the fired ammunition, with the used shells found at the scene of the attack.

What types of shells are there?

Shells are normally shaped in a point to allow them to be fired from distance and move aerodynamically.

There are many different types of shells which can be used in an attack.

This includes Armour-piercing sells, high explosive shells, shrapnel shells and chemical shells.

Several different types of attacks have taken place in Ukraine since Russian began to attack civilian city targets.

Where in Ukraine has been hit by shelling attacks?

The shelling attacks have been used by Russian troops since they moved into the country on 24 February.

One of the main areas which has been shelled in the past week is the city Kharkiv.

Kharkiv is located in the south-east of Ukraine and has been at the centre of Russian aggression.

Multiple attacks have results in the death of citizens.

Mayor Ihor Terekhov said that as of 1 March at 9am, nine people had died and 37 were injured as a result of shelling.

Prior to the full invasion, a nursery in the Donbas region was shelled, with Russian forces initially stating that Ukrainian forces were to blame for the incident.

However, the West believed that the shelling was a false flag operation conducted by Russia to set a pretext for a full invasion.

A TV tower in Kyiv was also believed to be shelled after an attack on Ukrainian television stations.

As a result of this attack, five people were killed.

Normally, one can find fragments or shell casings near a bombed location.

Shells are used as ammunition, and the amount of firepower depends on the size of the shell and the barrel (handheld mortar shells, a howitzer and artillery tanks).

During shelling, citizens on the receiving side’s movement is hampered.

Explained What Is The Meaning Of Shelling In War

Shelling is used to provoke the enemy, and anything can happen during shelling, including infiltration. During shelling, the person who started first will be completely aware of firing points, and it will only take a short time to retaliate and check on other things such as infiltration.

It is a regular phenomenon in war, particularly in invasions such as Russia’s and Ukraine’s. Shells are large projectiles that are fired by artillery or armoured vehicles such as tanks.

A shell is typically a cylinder with a tapered tipped nose cone for maximum aerodynamics as it must fly through the air.

What Is Shelling And What Are The Types Of Shells Used In War?

There are many different types of shells, ranging from nuclear to non-lethal.

As improvements are made and specific shells are designed, each shell type can have many sub-types within the same category.

The following shells have been used in warfare:

Armour-piercing shells

Armour-piercing shells, which are lighter shells with a pointed tip, have been around since the 1850s.

The projectile is designed to pierce both body and vehicle armour.

High explosive shells

High explosive shells, also known as HE shells, are filled with explosives such as TNT. These are made of steel and contain a bursting charge as well as a fuse that detonates the charge.

The shell fragments inflict more damage than the blast.

Shrapnel shells

Shrapnel shells are loaded with bullets to achieve greater ranges than a gun.

They use a timed fuse to detonate before they hit the ground.

It was lethal against soldiers on the ground but useless against buildings, so it was phased out during World War I in favour of the high-explosive shell.

Chemical shells

Chemical shells contain a chemical agent, which can be in the form of a gas or liquid. Non-lethal shells can emit smoke or light.

Some militaries also have self-steering guided shells, but they are much more expensive and thus less common.

What does shelling mean in war?

Shelling is another way to describe heavy bombing of an area.

Normally you can find fragments or shell casing around the location which has been bombed.

It is a common occurrence in war, especially in invasions like Russia and Ukraine.

The shells are large projectiles fired by artillery or armoured vehicles such as tanks.

Usually a shell is a cylinder with a tapered tipped nose cone, this is for optimum aerodynamics as it must fly through the air.

KYIV, Ukraine — The United States and key Western allies on Saturday announced severe new sanctions on Russian banks as the Ukrainian capital came under bombardment with some of the fiercest shelling since the start of the Russian invasion. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The Biden administration, Canada and European allies will impose major restrictions on Russia’s central bank, freezing its ability to use its $640 billion in foreign reserves. They also announced that they would remove certain Russian financial institutions from the SWIFT messaging network that connects banks worldwide, a move that to date has been taken against only Iran and North Korea.

The latest steps to economically choke Moscow and its ruling class come as Kyiv is under attack from Russian forces encroaching on Ukraine’s largest city. A massive fireball was visible to the southwest of Kyiv following a pounding explosion that rocked the city in the early-morning hours local time on Sunday. At least one high-rise apartment building had been struck directly Saturday, fueling skepticism of Russia’s claim that it was targeting only military facilities.

Meanwhile, civilians have been fleeing westward in droves to escape the worsening fighting. The United Nations said more than 150,000 Ukrainians have fled the country already, while U.S. officials noted that the lines of those trying to cross into Poland and other nations were extremely long.

As the humanitarian crisis worsened, volunteers in Poland and other countries neighboring Ukraine to its west scrambled to organize food, shelter, transportation and other resources to meet the needs of the incoming waves of refugees.

Leaders across Europe stepped up on Saturday by promising more concrete action to help Ukraine, even though the United States and its NATO allies have pledged not to send any troops into Ukraine. The United States announced that it would send Ukraine an additional $350 million worth of small arms, protective gear and anti-armor missiles — including antitank Javelins — to help defend the country from the slowed but steadily encroaching Russian onslaught. Germany announced plans to send 1,000 antitank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles to Ukraine to help it beat back Russian forces.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the contributions as he tried to buoy his country’s spirits, posting several video messages on the messaging app Telegram throughout Saturday.

He vowed to fight “for as long as it takes to liberate the country.” Although Western officials have noted that Ukraine’s resistance to the invasion was stronger than Russian President Vladimir Putin had anticipated, Russian troops continued to press into the country and threaten its biggest population centers.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a video on Feb. 26 insisting he had not called on his country's soldiers to surrender. (Video: The Washington Post)

Before the worst strikes began, Russian reconnaissance forces had entered Kyiv, a senior U.S. defense official said, though this person would not say whether those were Russian special operations troops, known as Spetsnaz. There had also been reports of street fights in the capital.

Though the bulk of Russian troops remained about 20 kilometers outside the capital to the north on Saturday, the city was increasingly bombarded with shelling from Russian positions outside the city, fueling skepticism that Russia is targeting military facilities.

For days, Russian troops have been moving steadily into Ukraine from the north, east and south, launching air, land and amphibious assaults. The Pentagon believes that over 50 percent of the troops Russia dispatched to the theater around Ukraine are now operating inside the country, according to the senior defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding situation on the ground.

“The Russians are increasingly frustrated by their lack of momentum, particularly in the north part of Ukraine,” the senior defense official said, noting that a “viable” and “very determined Ukrainian resistance” had “slowed them down.”

Still, Russian missiles struck a cargo ship and an oil tanker that a Ukrainian shipping company claimed was bringing fuel supplies to Ukrainian forces, in what the company said was a targeted attack. Russian forces also destroyed a dam in a water reservoir near Kyiv, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States said Saturday, creating a flood risk in the already-beleaguered capital.

As the intensity of attacks increased, casualties on both sides have been rising, but accurately counting the dead has proved difficult to verify. On Saturday, Ukrainian leaders claimed that fewer than 200 civilians had died, but that forces had killed or injured around 3,500 Russian troops — numbers that a senior U.S. defense official said the Pentagon could not and probably would not ever be able to verify. The United Nations reported late Saturday that there had been at least 240 casualties, including at least 64 dead.

The Ukrainian government also announced a hotline for Russian mothers to call to see if their sons were among those killed in the fighting — apparently a move to win hearts and minds in Russia, where nearly all of the media is state-controlled and the government has been downplaying the severity of the fighting in Ukraine. There were reports Saturday of Twitter and Facebook being blocked.

Ukraine has banned men ages 18 to 60 from leaving the country in case they need to be called upon to join the national defense. Cities have been enlisting civilian volunteers to join territorial defense forces across the country. Even people in Lviv, a city in western Ukraine that has been treated as a haven, were preparing for the war to arrive on their doorstep.

In Kyiv, citizens lined up at a police station for weapons they could use in defense of the capital. Others made molotov cocktails to use against Russian forces if they reached the city.

The city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, also imposed a 5 p.m. curfew on Saturday, warning that anyone found on the streets after that would be treated as “members of the enemy’s sabotage and reconnaissance groups.”

Ukrainian authorities have encouraged civilians to rip down street signs in an effort to confuse Russian troops, and called for technology experts to volunteer for the “IT army” to “fight on the cyber front.” Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, has also seen heavy fighting and has long championed itself as a tech hub.

As Ukraine’s cities came under bombardment and citizens prepared for potential hand-to-hand combat with Russian troops in the streets, NATO countries made additional gestures of solidarity. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Poland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic all shuttered their airspace to Russian aircraft, encouraging the rest of Europe to do the same. Meanwhile, Sweden and Finland denied a top Russian official flying to Moscow permission to have his plane cross their airspace, as a rebuke over the war being promulgated in Ukraine.

“War has returned to Europe,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in a video address Saturday, predicting that “this crisis will last. This war will last,” and that the Ukraine war will “have lasting consequences.”

It is not clear how Russia will respond to the West’s latest financially punitive measures. Earlier on Saturday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had shrugged at the sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other nations, calling them “quite serious” but “predictable.”

Going after Russia’s central bank, and barring its financial institutions from SWIFT — a move administration officials intimated would not include any waivers for energy transactions — may surprise the Kremlin.

Targeting the central bank could have a particularly devastating effect on Russia’s economy: If Moscow is barred from using its foreign reserves to stabilize its currency, it could cause a dramatic slide in the value of the Russian ruble.

The administration is coupling those actions with additional sanctions on oligarchs as well, that will “go after their yachts, their luxury apartments, their money and their ability to send their kids to fancy colleges in the West,” a senior administration official said. “Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah.”

The strategy is not without risks — and experts note they could be viewed in Moscow as an escalation. It is possible that the Kremlin could react by escalating hostilities against Ukraine. Or it is possible that the Kremlin could attempt to take measures aimed directly at the West.

“There is no particular need in maintaining diplomatic relations,” former president Dmitry Medvedev, who serves as the deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, wrote Saturday on his official page on the Russia social media site VKontakte.

“Padlock the embassies,” he continued. “We may look at each other in binoculars and gunsights.”

Even before the sanctions were announced, the potential for a diplomatic off-ramp to bring an end to the fighting on the ground in Ukraine appeared grim. The Kremlin announced Saturday that Putin reversed a decision made on Friday to schedule a strategic pause in attacks, to lure Kyiv to negotiations about a “neutral status” for Ukraine — a posture that would require its government to abandon NATO aspirations.

But Ukrainian officials bristled at what they viewed as an effort to strong-arm them, criticizing Russia for not being willing to have “full-fledged negotiations.” By Saturday, the Russian Defense Ministry said it had received the green light to “advance in all sectors,” resuming its assault “along key axes.”

The Pentagon has tracked the Russian invasion along three main pathways: from Belarus in the northwest, the Belgorod region of Russia in the northeast, and by land and sea in the south, via the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea and Russia’s positions in Crimea.

8,91126f2c-ddde-458e-90f7-0554dd2f0ab0,['Jamie Dettmer'],,"Fears are mounting that Russian forces will turn more to targeting critical civilian infrastructure and mount indiscriminate shelling as the defenders of Kyiv maintain their resistance and hold ground despite redoubled Kremlin efforts to subjugate Ukraine’s capital.

Some critical civilian infrastructure has already been hit and the Ukrainian military said it intercepted a missile heading for a nearby dam, which if breached could have caused major flooding of low-lying districts near the Dnieper River.

Russian forces also targeted a radioactive waste disposal site in Kyiv, Ukrainian authorities say.

“I think today we've seen a shift in Russian targeting towards critical civilian infrastructure, greater use of MLRS [multiple rocket launchers], and artillery in suburban areas,” tweeted Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at CNA, an American defense research organization.

“Unfortunately, my concern that this was going to get a lot more ugly and affect civilians is starting to materialize,” he added.

In the dam incident, the Ukrainian military said it managed to shoot down a Russian missile heading toward the Kyiv Reservoir dam Saturday.

“If the dam is destroyed, the flood will lead to catastrophic casualties and damage, including flooding of residential areas in Kyiv and the suburbs,” the Infrastructure Ministry said on Telegram.

Water experts say if the dam north of the city is breached, it could trigger a cascade effect, causing other key dams to fail. There are even concerns that a nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhya, about 550 kilometers southeast of Kyiv, could be affected.

Russian forces Saturday targeted an oil depot southwest of the city at Vasylkiv as Ukrainian forces repulsed a Russian assault on the capital.

Local authorities say Ukrainian forces are battling saboteurs and Russian special operations forces units who have infiltrated the capital. The Ukrainian government has reported 198 civilian deaths, including children, since the Russia's invasion, but they caution the numbers could be higher. Ukrainian authorities say at least 1,200 civilians have been injured.

Six people, including a 7-year-old girl, were killed in Russian shelling in Okhtyrka, in Sumy Oblast in northeastern Ukraine, Governor Dmitry Zhivitsky said Sunday. And in the south of the country the Russian military launched drones strikes in Odessa, according to Serhiy Bratchuk, head of the regional administration.

The Ukrainian military says it has inflicted heavy losses on Russia, saying its forces have managed to destroy 16 warplanes, 18 helicopters, 102 tanks, 504 armored vehicles and a Buk-1 missile system. They estimate they have killed 3,000 Russian soldiers and captured 200. VOA is unable to vouch for the accuracy of the claims.

Sunday morning the Ukrainians blew up a bridge on the northwest of Kyiv to try to hinder Russian forces.

Ukraine presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told reporters that while a Russian delegation had arrived in Gomel in Belarus for peace talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected a Russian offer of talks in Belarus on Sunday. Podolyak said Zelenskyy is open to negotiations elsewhere — the Ukrainians have suggested Warsaw, which is being refused by the Russians.

Zelenskyy described the fighting overnight in Kyiv and across the country as “brutal” in a statement Sunday. He said Russian occupying forces are “attacking civilian areas” where there is no military infrastructure. He said Russia is now “attacking everything,” including ambulances.

As worries mounted in Kyiv of a shift in Russian targeting from mainly military infrastructure, locals Sunday reported fierce street fighting in Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, where overnight shelling of residential districts preceded the entry of Russian ground forces.

Despite the Russian breach of Kharkiv, local Ukrainian commanders say they will continue to resist.

“There has been a breakthrough in light equipment including in the central part of the city,” Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the Kharkiv regional administration, announced, urging local residents to stay in shelters. He said Russian troops were still being blocked amid heavy fighting.

As in Kharkiv and Kyiv, so too elsewhere in the country defiance remains high — with resistance symbolized for many by a video posted on social media showing a Ukrainian civilian in Bakhmach in northern Ukraine attempting to stop a Russian tank by pushing against it.

In the video, the man first climbs on to the tank before jumping down and attempting to push it back, after that he kneels in front in a desperate bid to stop its advance. VOA cannot confirm the authenticity of the video, nonetheless it is one of many posted that Ukrainians point to as inspirational.

Ukrainian forces have notched up some significant successes. Zelenskyy aides confirmed that a convoy of Chechen special operations forces was intercepted near Hostomel and wiped out. Ukrainian forces have downed a cruise missile fired by a Russian Tu-22 strategic bomber from the territory of Belarus, Valery Zaluzhny, chief commander of the armed forces, said Sunday.

For civilians in cities and towns under siege — and even in towns unaffected directly by the fighting — getting basic goods and staples is becoming increasingly difficult. Many stores have closed, and supplies are difficult for owners to maintain. Village stores seem better supplied, being able to stock up with local produce, as witnessed by this VOA correspondent.

Seventy-two hours since the Russian invasion, Western experts estimate 80% of the country is still in Ukrainian hands, with around half of the forces Russian leader Vladimir Putin deployed along Ukraine’s borders now in action.

Franz-Stefan Gady, an analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think tank in London, says the Russians are having to throw in more second-echelon units because “Ukrainian forces by and large are fighting orderly delaying actions; morale remains very high; air-defenses still operational; air force remains active.”

He says Ukraine’s mechanized forces are managing to mount counterattacks and that a race is on for Ukrainian forces to beat an orderly retreat from the East, where the bulk of Ukrainian forces have been deployed, to cross the Dnieper River and establish fresh defensive positions where possible. The Russian tactic seems to be to avoid losing contact with major Ukrainian units and to encircle major cities, as they are trying to do with Kyiv, and probe for weaknesses.

He, too, worries about the likelihood of mounting civilian casualties.

“Expect very heavy fighting and a noticeable increase in Russian ground-based mass fires to break Ukrainian resistance. This will be absolutely devastating for the civilian population, if caught in crossfires,” he tweeted.

The U.N. Refugee Agency said Sunday that more than 200,000 Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries. Tens of thousands more are waiting on Poland’s borders to enter, with many more trying to make it across the country, as witnessed by this VOA correspondent during a journey from Kyiv to Lviv that took two days.

As blasts and explosions echoed around Kyiv, Zelenskyy, wearing olive green military-style clothing, assured residents of the capital that he remains with them.

“I am here. We will not lay down any weapons. We will defend our state, because our weapons are our truth,” he said. “Our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children and we will protect all of this,” he added.

The country’s 44-year-old leader also said the country’s steadfast resistance has “derailed” a Russian plan to establish a puppet state in Ukraine.",https://www.voanews.com/a/fears-mount-of-indiscriminate-russian-shelling-as-ukraine-battles-on/6461578.html
