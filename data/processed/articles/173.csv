1,dc8aadf3-2015-4455-b7c8-fd5f80498db5,['Current Time'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces battled for control of a vital energy-producing city in Ukraine’s south on Thursday and also gained ground in their bid to cut off the country from the sea, as Ukrainian leaders called on citizens to wage guerrilla war against the invaders.

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

The fighting at Enerhodar, a city on the Dnieper River that accounts for about one-quarter of the country’s power generation, came as the two sides met for another round of talks aimed at stopping the bloodshed that has set off an exodus of over 1 million refugees.

The mayor of Enerhodar, the site of the biggest nuclear plant in Europe, said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts. Dmytro Orlov urged residents not to leave their homes.

Moscow’s advance on Ukraine’s capital in the north has apparently stalled, with a huge armored column outside Kyiv at a standstill. And stiffer than expected resistance from the outmanned, outgunned Ukrainians has staved off the swift victory that Russia may have expected.

A top Russian officer, Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, commander of an airborne division, was killed in the fighting earlier this week, an officers organization in Russia reported.

But the Russians have brought their superior firepower to bear in the past few days, launching missile and artillery attacks on civilian areas and making significant gains in the south as part of an effort to sever the country’s connection to the Black and Azov seas.

Cutting Ukraine’s access to the coastline would deal a crippling blow to the country’s economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor stretching from its border, across Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, and all the way west to Romania.

The Russians announced the capture of Kherson, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed that forces have taken over local government headquarters in the vital Black Sea port of 280,000, making it the first major city to fall since the invasion began a week ago.

Heavy fighting continued on the outskirts of another strategic port, Mariupol, on the Azov Sea, plunging it into darkness, isolation and fear. Electricity and phone service were largely down, and homes and shops faced food and water shortages.

Without phone connections, medics did not know where to take the wounded.

A second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations began in neighboring Belarus. But the two sides appeared to have little common ground going into the meeting, and Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Ukraine that it must quickly accept the Kremlin’s demand for its “demilitarization” and declare itself neutral, formally renouncing its bid to join NATO.

Putin has long contended that Ukraine’s turn toward the West is a threat to Moscow, an argument he used to justify the invasion.

Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron that he was determined to press on with his attack “until the end,” according to Macron’s office.

Despite a profusion of evidence of civilian casualties and destruction of civilian infrastructure by the Russian military, some of it documented by The Associated Press, Putin called accusations that his military had attacked residential areas part of “an anti-Russian disinformation campaign” and insisted that Moscow uses “only precision weapons to exclusively destroy military infrastructure.”

Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamiya said Kyiv’s main demand in the talks would be the establishment of humanitarian corridors so civilians could reach safety. Ukraine also sought a cease-fire.

Ukrainians still in the country faced another grim day. In Kyiv, snow gave way to a cold, gray drizzle, as long lines formed outside the few pharmacies and bakeries that remain open.

New shelling was reported in the northern city of Chernihiv, where emergency officials said at least 22 civilians had been killed in a Russian bombardment of a residential area.

Families with children fled via muddy and snowy roads in the eastern region of Donetsk, while military strikes on the village of Yakovlivka near the eastern city of Kharkiv destroyed 30 homes, leaving three dead and seven wounded, and rescuers pulled 10 people from the ruins, according to emergency authorities.

Ukrainian authorities called on the people to defend their homeland against Putin’s forces by cutting down trees, erecting barricades in the cities and attacking enemy columns from the rear.

“Total resistance. ... This is our Ukrainian trump card and this is what we can do best in the world,” Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovich said in a video message, recalling guerrilla actions in Nazi-occupied Ukraine during World War II.

In just seven days of fighting, more than 2% of Ukraine’s population has been forced out of the country, according to the tally the U.N. refugee agency released to The Associated Press.

The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, with about 1.4 million people. Residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the railroad station and squeezed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed.

At least 227 civilians have been killed and 525 wounded, according to the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, though it acknowledged that is a vast undercount, and Ukraine earlier said more than 2,000 civilians have died. That figure could not be independently verified.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. defense official said the immense Russian column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles appeared to be stalled roughly 16 miles from Kyiv and had made no real progress in the last few days.

The convoy, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, has been plagued with fuel and food shortages, the official said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian land forces have stalled and Moscow is now unleashing air attacks, but that they are being parried by Ukrainian defense systems, including in Kherson.

“Kyiv withstood the night and another missile and bomb attack. Our air defenses worked,” he said. “Kherson, Izyum — all the other cities that the occupiers hit from the air did not give up anything.”

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions heard overnight in the capital were Russian missiles being shot down.

In Kherson, the Russians took over the regional administration headquarters, said Hennady Lahuta, governor of the region. But he added that he and other officials continued to perform their duties.

From Kherson, Russian troops appeared to roll toward Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding center to the west. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said big convoys of Russian troops were advancing on the city.

A group of Russian amphibious landing vessels also headed toward the port of Odesa, farther west, the Ukrainian military said.

Russia reported its military casualties Wednesday for the first time in the war, saying nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and almost 1,600 wounded. Ukraine insisted Russia’s losses are many times higher but did not disclose its own military casualties.

In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Zelenskyy praised his country’s resistance.

“We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,” he said. “They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.”

He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who “go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat.”

“These are not warriors of a superpower,” he said. “These are confused children who have been used.”

3,800 troops at Fort Stewart ordered to deploy SAVANNAH, Ga. — About 3,800 troops based at Fort Stewart in southeast Georgia have been ordered to deploy quickly and bolster U.S. forces in Europe after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “It’s been very hectic and stressful, but overall it’s worked out,” Army Staff Sgt. Ricora Jackson said Wednesday as she waited with dozens of fellow soldiers to board a chartered flight at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah. The soldiers are from the 1st Armored Brigade of the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division. In all, the Pentagon has ordered about 12,000 service members from various U.S. bases to Europe, with a couple of thousand more already stationed abroad shifting to other European countries. The soldiers’ mission overseas is to train alongside military units of NATO allies in a display of force aimed at deterring further aggression by Russia. Maj. Gen. Charles Costanza, the 3rd Infantry’s commander, said soldiers and their families were told to expect the deployment to last six months, though it could be extended or shortened depending on developments in Ukraine. “There is no intent to have any U.S. service member fight in Ukraine,” Costanza said. “And they know that.” Share this -







State Department: Russia restricting media, 'throttling' Twitter, Facebook Russia's government has restricted news organizations and throttled internet services to mislead its people about its attack on Ukraine, the State Department said Wednesday. The government restricted access to Radio Ekho Moskvy and Dozhd TV, the U.S. said. It is also ""throttling"" Twitter, Facebook and Instagram platforms, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement. ""Russia is engaged in an unprovoked war on Ukraine. At home, the Kremlin is engaged in a full assault on media freedom and the truth, and Moscow’s efforts to mislead and suppress the truth of the brutal invasion are intensifying,"" Price said.

Invasion forces Germany into diplomatic U-turn Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has accomplished what four years of hectoring by former President Donald Trump failed to do — persuade Germany to double its defense budget and boost its military contribution to NATO. And Germany is not the only country that has made a diplomatic U-turn since Putin launched the biggest land war in Europe since World War II, top diplomats say. “I was talking to my wife and saying that Biden did a good job in uniting the West,” said Ian Kelly, the former U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as the nation of Georgia. “She said, ‘No, Putin did a good job of uniting the West.’” Read the full story here.

Spotify closes office in Russia Spotify said Wednesday it has closed its office in Russia indefinitely in response to what the audio streaming platform described as Moscow's ""unprovoked attack on Ukraine."" Since July, Russian legislation signed by President Vladimir Putin has obliged foreign social media companies with more than 500,000 daily users to open local offices or be subject to restrictions as severe as outright bans. Ahead of the March deadline, only a few companies, including Spotify, had complied. ""Our first priority over the past week has been the safety of our employees and to ensure that Spotify continues to serve as an important source of global and regional news at a time when access to information is more important than ever,"" Spotify said in a statement. Spotify said it has reviewed thousands of pieces of content since the start of the war and restricted the discoverability of shows owned and operated by Russian state-affiliated media. It also removed all content from state media RT and Sputnik this week in the European Union, the U.S. and other markets around the world, except for Russia, following similar steps by Twitter and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook. Spotify said it would match employee donations 2-to-1 to support local humanitarian efforts. Share this -







What to know about Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska With a massive Russian military convoy moving closer and closer to Ukraine’s capital city, Kyiv, all eyes are on President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his family. Zelenskyy, 44, has inspired many over the past week with his calls for strength and unity. And his wife, Olena Zelenska, 44, has been speaking out with equal passion. Zelenska’s exact location is unknown. She is believed to have remained in Ukraine along with her husband and their children, Sasha and Cyril — a risky decision, considering that Zelenskyy has said he is Russia’s “target No. 1” and that his family is “target No. 2.” Zelenska is drawing widespread praise for her presumed decision to remain in Ukraine and for sharing the realities of the crisis on social media.

At least 227 civilians killed in Ukraine, real toll 'much higher,' U.N. says At least 227 civilians have been killed in Ukraine and 525 have been injured, the United Nations' human rights office said — but the real toll is ""much higher,"" it said. The dead include 15 children, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said Wednesday night. The casualties as of midnight Tuesday include only those recorded by the U.N. office. ""OHCHR believes that real figures are considerably higher,"" it said. Intense fighting in Ukraine has delayed reports, and many other reports are pending corroboration. Most of the casualties were from explosive weapons affecting wide areas, like artillery, rockets and airstrikes, it said. Ukraine’s state emergency services said Wednesday that since the war began, around 2,000 civilians have died. The agency later walked back that number, calling it “approximate,” as it is unknown how many people are under fire or debris. NBC News has not confirmed the numbers of any deaths. From 24 Feb—1 March, we recorded 752 civilian casualties in context of the Russia’s military action against #Ukraine: 227 killed, incl 15 children; 525 injured, incl 28 children, mostly caused by shelling & airstrikes.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy: 'We will expel them' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that the situation in parts of his country was ""very difficult"" but that ""we are resisting the terror."" Zelenskyy made the comments in a video address early Thursday as Russian forces intensified attacks on key Ukrainian cities. ""Even if they entered somewhere, it is only temporary. We will expel them, with disgrace,"" Zelenskyy said. The southern city of Kherson, a major port on the Dnieper River and the Black Sea, has been the subject of fierce fighting, and its status was unclear. Its mayor said Wednesday that the city was encircled and pleaded for an open corridor to move in supplies, such as food and medicine. Zelenskyy said Thursday that ""in just a week we broke the enemy's plans, plans that have been building for years."" He vowed that Ukrainians would fight, and he said that ""every occupier needs to know they won't get anything here, won't conquer anyone."" Zelenskyy said almost 9,000 Russians have been killed. NBC News has not verified those numbers. The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that 498 of its service members have been killed and that 1,597 have been wounded. Share this -







Oil soars as markets, consumers brace for more volatility After a steady ascent over the past week, the price of oil skyrocketed Wednesday. Market observers said the spike will continue to fuel volatility in the days and weeks ahead as traders try to sort through the implications for inflation and central bank policy — and whether, or when, ordinary Americans and businesses will hit their limit. The broader question for investors is not just how much higher oil might go, but how much it could affect inflation. “Higher oil prices mean higher energy costs, and that’s really a key inflationary pressure,” said Will Rhind, the founder and CEO of GraniteShares. “Like any inflationary factor, there comes a point where it creates demand destruction.” Read the full story here.

International Criminal Court to investigate Russia's invasion of Ukraine The International Criminal Court said Wednesday that it has opened an investigation into Russia's invasion of Ukraine based on the referral of 39 member countries. The countries include Poland, Switzerland, Lithuania, Spain, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Canada, Colombia, Australia and New Zealand, among many others. The U.S. was not one of the countries because it is one of only seven countries that voted against the Rome Statute, the court's founding treaty. ""These referrals enable my Office to proceed with opening an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 onwards, thereby encompassing within its scope any past and present allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed on any part of the territory of Ukraine by any person,"" Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement. The U.K. foreign office said it was leading the effort to gather referrals and push the court to investigate.

SWIFT to disconnect seven Russian banks on March 12 SWIFT, a service that facilitates global transactions among thousands of financial institutions, said it will cut off seven Russian banks as of March 12 in accordance with European Union guidance. ""Diplomatic decisions taken by the European Union, in consultation with the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, bring SWIFT into efforts to end this crisis by requiring us to disconnect select Russian banks from our financial messaging services,"" SWIFT said in a statement Wednesday. ""As previously stated, we will fully comply with applicable sanctions laws."" Cutting off Russian access to SWIFT is one of the toughest financial steps, and it could damage Russia's economy in the long term. The impacts were being felt even in the short term: Because SWIFT handles international bank payments, some Moscow hotels requested that customers settle their bills early in case their credit card systems no longer worked. The U.S. and its allies moved last week to limit Russia's access to SWIFT, and many in the international community had been pushing for SWIFT to cut ties. As recently as Thursday, however, President Joe Biden had stopped short of pushing for the harsh financial penalty. ""Our deepest thoughts are with those suffering the tragic human consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,"" SWIFT said in the statement. Share this -

U.S. postpones ballistic missile test in bid to lessen Russia nuclear tensions The U.S. military has postponed a long-planned intercontinental ballistic missile test scheduled for this weekend after Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was putting his country's nuclear forces on alert, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday. ""In an effort to demonstrate that we have no intention in engaging in any actions that could be misunderstood or misconstrued, the secretary of defense has directed that our Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile test launch scheduled for this week to be postponed,"" Kirby told reporters at his daily briefing. ""We did not take this decision lightly, but instead to demonstrate that we are a responsible nuclear power."" While the U.S. and their allies have said they have not seen any actual change in Russia's nuclear readiness posture, Kirby said, ""such provocative rhetoric and possible changes to nuclear posture involving the most consequential weapons in our respective arsenals is unacceptable. The United States has not taken any similar steps."" But, he added, ""we recognize at this moment of tension how critical it is that the United States and Russia bear in mind the risks of miscalculation and take steps to reduce those risks."" He said postponing the test would not affect U.S. military readiness. ""It's not going to change our strategic deterrent posture one bit. It's a wise and prudent decision by the secretary to send a strong, clear, unambiguous message to Mr. Putin how seriously we take our nuclear responsibilities at a potentially tense time.""

Sen. Joe Manchin says he'll introduce legislation to prevent U.S. imports of Russian oil Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said Wednesday he's planning to introduce legislation with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, that would prohibit the U.S. and domestic companies from importing Russian crude oil and petroleum. The bill ""declares a national emergency with respect to Russian aggression against Ukraine and the threat to our national security, foreign policy, and economy and directs the President to the authority he has had since 1917 to prohibit imports of crude oil, petroleum, petroleum products and LNG from Russia,"" the senators wrote in a one-page draft document, obtained by NBC News. The ban would be in place ""during the national emergency and either the President or Congress would be able to terminate the emergency and the import ban,"" they wrote, adding that continuing to import Russian products ""puts our national security at risk and supports Putin's ability to stay in power."" The effort comes after a group of Republicans proposed similar legislation seeking to ban imports of Russian oil earlier this week. While the sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine so far does not include oil and gas exports, White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said, ""We haven't ruled out that.""

U.S. has sent hundreds of Stinger missiles to Ukraine this week The U.S. has delivered hundreds of Stinger missiles to Ukraine this week, including more than 200 on Monday, two congressional officials briefed on the deliveries said. The shipments are part of the $350 million lethal and nonlethal aid package the White House announced late Friday. The package also includes Javelin anti-tank missiles and ammunition, both of which the Ukrainian government has said it needs to fight off the advancing Russian military. Stinger missiles can shoot down aircraft. During the Cold War, the U.S. government secretly supplied Afghan resistance fighters with Stingers to shoot down Russian helicopters over Afghanistan. The Defense Department and the National Security Council declined to comment. Germany announced over the weekend that it was sending 500 Stinger missiles to Ukraine, as well.

Russian woman burns passport at Scottish protest: 'I'm ashamed to be Russian' A Russian woman who set fire to her passport at a Tuesday vigil in Edinburgh, Scotland, protesting Russia's invasion of Ukraine has said she is ""ashamed to be Russian."" In a phone interview Wednesday, Anna Jakubova said she was horrified by Russia's deadly war. ""I feel ashamed of being associated with this country,"" she said. ""I feel horrible for Ukrainians. I feel so sad."" Jakubova can be seen in a video posted to Facebook lighting her passport on fire, saying: ""I hope the Russian government burns just as well."" In photos shared with NBC News after the demonstration, the front cover of the passport can be seen almost completely burned off, along with some of its key pages. Jakubova, 26, who left Russia around a decade ago because she disagreed with Moscow's treatment of marginalized groups, said giving up her passport was ""nothing in comparison"" to what Ukrainians have lost. Jakubova said that she is still an Estonian citizen but that her decision to burn her Russian passport and speak out against Moscow's invasion most likely means she may never see some loved ones still living in Russia again. ""Despite the Russian government, in some ways, Moscow will always be my home,"" she said. However, she said: ""This is a sacrifice that I think is worth it to make, because Ukrainians are sacrificing so much more than that."" She said she hoped her action would also draw attention to protesters' calls for support for Ukraine, including demands for a no-fly zone over the country. ‘I no longer want to be a citizen’: Russian woman burns passport in support of Ukraine March 2, 2022 00:30 Share this -







Russian ambassador to U.N. appears to invoke Trump's stolen election lie Russia's ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya invoked former President Donald Trump's stolen election lie on Wednesday in remarks opposing a resolution denouncing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a speech advancing Russia's false narrative about the invasion, Nebenzya said the ousting of a Russian-backed president in Ukraine in 2014 by protestors and the country's own parliament was a “coup” conducted with “the connivance of Germany, France, and Poland, and with the support of the United States, where the legitimately elected president of the country was overthrown,” according to a live English translation of his Russian remarks. This is false. Numerous investigations, audits, and inquiries in states across the country have concluded the 2020 presidential election was safe, secure, and its results accurate, despite false claims advanced by Trump, who lost the White House to President Joe Biden. Trump's numerous attempts to challenge the results of the election in court also failed. Share this -







Blinken to travel to Europe Thursday, will visit countries on NATO's eastern flank Secretary of State Antony Blinken will leave Thursday for a trip to Europe, which will include stops in a number of countries on NATO's eastern flank, the State Department said. Blinken will first arrive in Brussels where he's expected to participate in the NATO and G7 meetings of foreign ministers. On Saturday, Blinken will travel to Poland where State Department press secretary Ned Price said America's top diplomat will meet with Polish leaders, ""including Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, to discuss further security assistance in the face of Russia’s continued aggression and unprovoked attack on Ukraine.""

The lives of Ukraine's Black immigrants come into focus as reports of racism at Polish border emerge After having studied in India, Heidi Nguema visited Ukraine a few years ago with no plans to make it his home. But as an African from the country of Gabon, in the central part of the continent, he said, he “fell in love” with Ukraine and “decided to stay.” Part of the reason for his affection for the European country that neighbors Russia is that he never had problems with racism in Ukraine, “even if I know some who did. It can’t compare with the U.S., for sure,” said Nguema, who lives in Uman, a city in central Ukraine. So it jolted him when he heard from others that many Black people of Ukraine, most of them African, had been prevented from entering Poland and other safe countries to elude the Russian attacks that started last week. Nguema, the owner of a digital agency who also teaches English and French in Ukraine, said life had been solid before the invasion. “I have great colleagues, my brother who helped me a lot, his family and awesome friends,” he said. But the war is taking a toll. Read the full story here. Share this -

Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich to sell Chelsea Football Club Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich will sell Chelsea Football Club following mounting pressure over his ownership of the prominent team amid the invasion of Ukraine, he announced Wednesday. “I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the Club as I believe this is in the best interest of the Club, the fans, the employees, as well as the Club’s sponsors and partners,” he said in a statement. He said the sale of the club will not be fast-tracked, and he won’t ask for any loans to be repaid. ”This has never been about business nor money for me, but about pure passion for the game and Club,” the billionaire, who has owned the team since 2003, said.

Almost 500 troops killed in Ukraine, Russia says in first casualty report since invasion Almost 500 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine, Russia's defense ministry said Wednesday in its first report of military casualties since the country invaded its neighbor last week. ""Unfortunately, there are losses among our comrades participating in the special military operation,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement, adding that 498 servicemen had died and 1,597 had been wounded. Two Western officials told NBC News that about 5,800 Russians have been killed, a number in line with Ukraine’s estimates. However, one U.S. official is cautioning that the estimates have been all over the map, ranging from as low as 500 to more than 5,000, and are extremely difficult to pin down. Ukraine’s state emergency services said Wednesday that since the war began, around 2,000 civilians have died. The agency later walked back that number calling it ""approximate"" as it is unknown how many people are under fire or debris. NBC News has not been able to independently verify any of these numbers. Konashenkov said that Russia continued to strike at the military infrastructure of Ukraine and had hit command posts, communication centers and other targets. ""Russian soldiers and officers show courage, bravery and heroism,"" he said. Share this -







Africans report racism and hostility trying to flee Ukraine Alexander Somto Orah, 25, was among thousands of people crowding a Kyiv train station Friday, hoping to flee Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. He said he and his friends hoped to get to safety at the Polish border quickly but that officials wouldn’t allow the group of Africans to board trains out of the region. “I was like, ‘You are picking only white people!’” Orah said. He said he and his friends briefly made it onto a second train headed to Poland but were quickly kicked off, with officials telling them “Ukrainians only.” Orah is one of several African citizens living in Ukraine who have reported racist discrimination and abuse at the border.

China will not join sanctions on Russia, banking regulator says China will not join in sanctions on Russia that have been led by the West, the country's banking regulator said Wednesday, adding that he believed the impact of the measures on China would be limited. China, which has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has repeatedly criticized what it calls illegal and unilateral sanctions.

What are vacuum bombs? Concerns grow about Russia's thermobaric weapons Accusations that Russia may be using thermobaric weapons in Ukraine have raised fears about the potential devastation that could result from attacks with the so-called vacuum bombs. Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, said Monday that the Russian military had used a vacuum bomb, which sucks oxygen from the air to trigger a huge explosion. Markarova did not provide additional details and NBC News has not independently verified that the weapon has been used in Ukraine, but Russian thermobaric rocket launchers have been photographed entering the country by a CNN team. The accusation adds to mounting concerns voiced by several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, that Russia is conducting indiscriminate attacks in densely populated civilian areas that could constitute war crimes. The potential use of vacuum bombs is of particular concern because these thermobaric munitions are designed to cause immense destruction. “It’s just a horrible, devastating weapon,” said David Johnson, a retired U.S. Army colonel and a principal researcher at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit policy research organization headquartered in California.

He strictly urged residents to not leave the house and provoke shooting. “Today I will work to find a way to collect the dead, how to restore light, gas, water and heat where it is damaged,” he said. “We are all waiting for a miracle now.

""As a member of the global partners of democracy, Taiwan is not absent, and we fully support Ukraine,"" Tsai said. Taiwan has firmly joined international efforts to support Ukraine since the Russian invasion last week, imposing sanctions on Russia and sending 27 tons of medical supplies to Ukraine on Tuesday. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also set up a dedicated bank account to receive public donations. Share this -







Ukraine's Zelenskyy tells Russia ""just stop the bombing"" before more ceasefire talks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before meaningful talks on a ceasefire could start, as a first round of negotiations this week had yielded scant progress. Speaking in an interview in a heavily guarded government compound, Zelenskyy urged NATO members to impose a no fly zone to stop the Russian air force, saying this would be a preventative measure and not meant to drag the alliance into war with Russia. Zelenskyy, who has refused offers to leave the Ukrainian capital as Russian forces advanced, also said Ukraine would demand legally binding security guarantees if NATO shut the door on Ukraine's membership prospects. Setting out his conditions for further talks with Russia, Zelenskyy told Reuters and CNN in a joint interview: ""It's necessary to at least stop bombing people, just stop the bombing and then sit down at the negotiating table.""

KYIV/KHARKIV, Ukraine, March 3 (Reuters) - Russian troops are in the Ukrainian city of Kherson and forced their way into the council building, the mayor said after a day of conflicting claims over whether Moscow had make the first major gain of a city in its invasion that began eight days ago.

Moscow's attack on its neighbour has yet to overthrow the government in Kyiv but thousands are thought to have died or been injured and it could cause another deep hit to the global economy still emerging from the coronavirus pandemic.

The biggest attack on a European state since 1945 has caused over 870,000 people to flee, led to a barrage of sanctions against Russia, and stoked fears of wider conflict in the West unthought-of for decades.

The Black Sea port of Kherson, a southern provincial capital of around 250,000 people, is strategically placed where the Dnipro River flows into the Black Sea and would be the first significant city to fall into Moscow's hands.

Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday morning it had captured Kherson but several hours later an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy responded that the Ukrainian side was continuing to defend the location.

Late on Wednesday, Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said Russian troops were in the streets.

""There were armed visitors in the city executive committee today,"" he said in a statement. ""My team and I are peaceful people - we had no weapons and there was no aggression from our side.""

""I didn't make any promises to them... I just asked them not to shoot people,"" he wrote.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. It denies targeting civilians.

Refugee total exceeds 1 million - UNHCR

BORODYANKA, Ukraine, March 3 (Reuters) - Ukraine said it would call for humanitarian corridors for its besieged citizens at peace talks with Russia on Thursday, as war entered its second week with Ukrainian cities surrounded and under bombardment.

Hundreds of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed since President Vladimir Putin sent his troops over the border on Feb. 24. Russia itself has been plunged into isolation never before experienced by an economy of such size. read more

The United Nations said more than 1 million refugees had fled in just seven days, one of the fastest exoduses in memory.

Ukrainian negotiator Davyd Arakhamia posted a picture on Facebook of himself preparing to board a helicopter for talks, which he said would start around 1400 GMT. He did not say where.

""The minimum programme: humanitarian corridors,"" he said. Neither side has suggested it was expecting breakthroughs after a first round of talks held in Belarus on Monday led to no progress.

Despite an initial battle plan that Western countries said was aimed at swiftly toppling the Kyiv government it describes as dangerous nationalists who threaten its security, Russia has captured only one Ukrainian city so far - the southern Dnipro River port of Kherson, which its tanks entered on Wednesday.

With its main assault force halted for days on a highway north of Kyiv, Russia has shifted tactics, escalating its bombardment of major cities. Swathes of central Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people, have been blasted into rubble.

Mariupol, the main port of eastern Ukraine, has been surrounded under heavy bombardment, with no water or power. Officials say they cannot evacuate the wounded. The city council compared the situation to the World War Two siege of Leningrad. read more

'NOTHING TO LOSE'

Britain's defence ministry said the main body of the huge Russian column advancing on Kyiv was still 30 km (19 miles) from the city centre, held up by Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. read more

""The column has made little discernible progress in over three days,"" it said in an intelligence update.

In Borodyanka, a small town 60 km (40 miles) northwest of Kyiv where locals had repelled a Russian assault, burnt out hulks of destroyed Russian armour were scattered on a highway, surrounded by buildings blasted into ruins. Flames from one burning apartment building lit up the pre-dawn sky.

""They started shooting from their APC towards the park in front of the post office,"" a man recounted in the apartment where he was sheltering with his family, referring to a Russian armoured personnel carrier.

""Then those bastards started the tank and started shooting into the supermarket which was already burned. It caught fire again.

""An old man ran outside like crazy, with big round eyes, and said 'give me a Molotov cocktail! I just set their APC on fire!...Give me some petrol, we'll make a Molotov cocktail and burn the tank!'.""

At least nine people were killed and four wounded in a Russian air strike that hit two schools and private houses in the eastern Chernihiv region on Thursday, governor Viacheslav Chaus said in an online post.

Footage from a car dashboard camera, verified by Reuters, showed buildings in a residential area in Chernihiv hit by apparent missiles. The street was engulfed in a fireball and a huge cloud of black smoke rose into the sky.

Two cargo ships came under apparent attack at Ukrainian ports. Four crew members were missing after Estonian-owned ship exploded and sank off Odessa, and at least one crew member was killed in a blast on a Bangladeshi ship at Olvia. Ukraine is one of the world's biggest grain and food oil exporters from its Black Sea ports.

'YOU ARE LYING TO YOURSELF'

Amid Moscow's increasing diplomatic isolation, only Belarus, Eritrea, Syria and North Korea voted with Russia against an emergency resolution at the United Nations General Assembly condemning Moscow's ""aggression"".

Putin spoke by telephone to French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday, telling him Russia would achieve its goals, including the demilitarisation and neutrality of Ukraine, the Kremlin said. Macron told Putin ""you are lying to yourself"", about the government in Kyiv, and said the war would cost Russia dearly, a French official said. read more

In Russia itself, where nearly all major opposition figures have been jailed or exiled in a crackdown over the past year, the authorities have banned reporting that describes the ""special military operation"" as an ""invasion"" or ""war"".

Ekho Moskvy radio, the best-known independent broadcaster of the post-Soviet era and one of Russia's few remaining liberal voices, shut itself down on Thursday after authorities ordered it off the air.

Riot police snatched peaceful protesters off the streets in St Petersburg late on Wednesday, including a 77-year-old woman filmed being muscled away by men in black helmets. Activists distributed footage of a small girl weeping behind bars, having been arrested for holding up a sign that said ""No war"".

STALLED ADVANCE

Military analysts say Russia's advance has been a tactical fiasco, with poorly maintained columns now confined to roads as spring thaw turns Ukrainian ground to mud. Each day the main attack force lies stuck on the highway north of Kyiv, its condition deteriorates, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.

""The longer Russian forces sit forward, the lower their readiness and performance will be. Everything from state of tires, to supply availability, and in the end morale,"" he tweeted.

The great fear is that, as the likelihood of rapid victory recedes, Russia will fall back on tactics it used in Syria and Chechnya, where it pounded the cities of Aleppo and Grozny to ruins.

Russia has already acknowledged nearly 500 of its soldiers killed. Ukraine says it has killed nearly 9,000, though this cannot be confirmed. Ukrainian authorities have offered to free Russian prisoners if their mothers come fetch them.

Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, is the only significant urban centre to fall. Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said he had asked the Russians who entered city hall ""not to shoot people"".

The International Criminal Court's top prosecutor said an advance team had left The Hague for the Ukraine region on Thursday to start investigating possible war crimes. Russia denies targeting civilians and says its aim is to ""disarm"" Ukraine and arrest leaders it falsely calls neo-Nazis. read more

Energy Department activates Nuclear Incident Response Team amid fire at Ukrainian nuclear plant

11:08 p.m.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Thursday night that the Department of Energy had activated the Nuclear Incident Response team after Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant caught fire amid shelling by Russian troops.

“.@ENERGY has activated its Nuclear Incident Response Team and is monitoring events in consultation with @DeptofDefense, @NRCgov and the White House. We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility,” Granholm tweeted.

“The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she added.

Granholm said she had spoken with the Ukrainian energy minister about the matter, and called operations by Russian forces near the nuclear power plant “reckless.”

The development comes over a week since Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson became the first city to fall to Russia on Wednesday.

Zelensky: For first time ever ‘the terrorist country has reverted to nuclear terror’

11:05 p.m.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address on Thursday that “the terrorist country has reverted to nuclear terror” for the first time ever after a fire broke out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant following a Russian attack.

“No country has ever shot at nuclear blocks except for Russia,” the Ukrainian president said, according to CBS News. “First time ever. For the first time ever in our history, in the history of human kind, the terrorist country has reverted to nuclear terror.”

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on Thursday that the nuclear power plant’s radiation levels and “essential” equipment were unaffected by the Russian shelling on the plant.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm called the Russian shelling “reckless.”

“I just spoke with Ukraine’s energy minister about the situation at the Zaphorizhizia nuclear plant. Russian military operations near the plant are reckless and must cease,” she tweeted.

Canada drops some visa requirements for Ukrainians

8:36 p.m.

Canada announced on Thursday that it would be dropping its normal visa requirements for Ukrainians and allowing them to temporarily stay in the country for at least two years amid Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.

“We’re creating a new program for Ukrainians who want to come to Canada temporarily. This will eliminate many of the normal visa requirements – and it’ll be the fastest and safest way to come to Canada,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted.

The country will be creating a Canada-Ukraine authorization for emergency travel that will allow Ukrainians to stay in Canada temporarily, with applications expected to be open in two weeks, according to a news release from the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada department.

Canada is also creating a special family reunification sponsorship pathway for Ukrainians with relatives that are Canadian citizens or permanent residents. The pathway would allow such Ukrainians to take up residence in the country.

Ukrainians staying in Canada through these programs will also be eligible to apply for work permits.

Fire breaks out at major nuclear plant in Ukraine amid fighting

8:13 p.m.

Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was on fire early Friday local time following a Russian attack, Mayor Dmytro Orlov of the nearby town of Energodar said, Reuters reported.

Orlov said that Russian and local Ukrainian forces have engaged in fierce fighting, resulting in casualties.

“As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,” Orlov said, according to Reuters. He added that the situation poses a threat to world security.

Ukrainian authorities wrote a letter hours earlier to Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), sounding the alarm that Russian tanks had broken through “the block-post” into Energodar.

“The battle is going on in the town of Enerhodar and on the road to the ZNPP (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) site,” the letter read, describing the situation as “critical,” according to the agency.

Russian opera star Anna Netrebko has withdrawn from her planned performances with the Metropolitan Opera after refusing to repudiate her support for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Met announced on Thursday.

“It is a great artistic loss for the Met and for opera,” Met General Manager Peter Gelb said in a statement. “Anna is one of the greatest singers in Met history, but with Putin killing innocent victims in Ukraine, there was no way forward.”

Netrebko was scheduled to perform Puccini’s “Turandot” in April and May in addition to Verdi’s “Don Carlo” for the next season.

Ukrainian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska will perform in “Turandot,” taking Netrebko’s place. The Met said they would announce her replacement in “Don Carlo” later this year.

“In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States,” he added.

In addition to the Echo of Moscow radio station, TV Rain had used banned terms such as “invasion” and “war” to describe the Russian invasion in Ukraine, violating a ban in Russia, The New Yorker reported. The prosecutor general’s office in Russia pushed for the blocking of the both news outlets’ websites.

White House knocks down talk of banning Russian oil imports

2:06 p.m.

The White House on Thursday knocked down talk of banning Russian oil imports, warning doing so could further spike the already high price of gas for Americans, after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) threw her support behind the idea.

“Our objective and the president’s objective has been to maximize impact on President Putin and Russia while minimizing impact to us and our allies and partners,” press secretary Jen Psaki said at a briefing with reporters.

“We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy and that would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people around the world because it would reduce the supply available,” she continued. “And it’s as simple as less supply raises prices, and that is certainly a big factor for the president at this moment. It also has the potential to pad the pockets of President Putin, which is exactly what we are not trying to do.”

Biden speaks with Quad leaders about Ukraine

12:45 p.m.

President Biden held a call on Thursday to discuss the conflict in Ukraine with the leaders of the Quad, an alliance made up of the United States, Australia, India and Japan.

Biden spoke with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida about the Russian invasion of Ukraine “and its broader implications.”

“They agreed to stand up a new humanitarian assistance and disaster relief mechanism which will enable the Quad to meet future humanitarian challenges in the Indo-Pacific and provide a channel for communication as they each address and respond to the crisis in Ukraine,” the leaders said in a joint readout of the call.

The group also agreed to meet in-person in Tokyo, “in the coming months,” according to the readout.

The U.S., Japan and Australia have each imposed sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but India has largely remained on the sidelines as Western nations project a united front in response to the invasion.

Asked last week whether India was on the same page as the United States in its approach to Russia, Biden said the two sides were in “consultation.”

“We haven’t resolved that completely,” Biden said.

Ukraine’s top diplomat: Direct confrontation between Russia, NATO ‘inevitable’ without help from allies

11:32 a.m.

Ukraine’s foreign minister on Thursday warned NATO allies that direct confrontation with Russia is “inevitable” if they don’t do more to help counter Moscow, NBC News reported.

“You can think as much as you want about how to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said. “But if you do not help us to stop it now, a direct confrontation will be inevitable because you will be next.”

“Your restraint and your unwillingness to take the next steps — all this gives Russia the opportunity to continue the killings without punishment,” Kuleba said.

In a tweet, Kuleba wrote that “Russia’s barbaric war tactic is to manipulate the civilian suffering it itself inflicts.”

“Now Lavrov accuses Ukraine of preventing civilian evacuations. Tell your boss to stop the indiscriminate shelling of Ukrainian cities. Show the world that Russia is serous about negotiations,” Kuleba added.

Explosions rock two cargo ships near Ukraine

10:34 a.m.

A Bangladeshi vessel was hit by a missile or bomb, killing one crew member, while an Estonian-owned cargo ship sank off a major Ukrainian port as Russia’s invasion of the country escalates.

“We have no power supply. Emergency generator power supply is running. We are on the verge of death. We have not been rescued yet. Please save us,” a surviving seafarer on the Bangladeshi ship said in a video on social media after the ship had been hit, according to Reuters.

“The vessel has finally sunk,” Igor Ilves, managing director of Vista Shipping Agency, said of the other cargo ship. “Two of the crew are in a raft on the water and four others are missing. I don’t know where they are at the moment.”

Some shipping companies have suspended voyages to Ukrainian terminals and certain Black Sea ports affected by the conflict, Reuters reported.

Biden weighing sanctions on India over Russian military stockpiles

10:30 a.m.

The Biden administration is weighing whether to impose sanctions against India over its stockpile of and reliance on Russian military equipment as part of the wide-ranging consequences the West is seeking to impose on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.

Donald Lu, the assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, on Thursday told lawmakers in a hearing that the administration is weighing how threatening India’s historically close military relationship with Russia is to U.S. security.

“It’s a question we’re looking at very closely, as the administration is looking at the broader question over whether to apply sanctions under CAATSA or to waive those sanctions,” Lu said, referring to the Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.

Lu told lawmakers that the administration is “in the process of trying to understand whether defense technology that we are sharing with India today can be adequately safeguarded given India’s historical relationship with Russia and its defense sales.”

“It is critical that with any partner, that the United States is able to assure itself that any defense technology we share is sufficiently protected,” he said.

A top official in the coastal city of Mariupol says Russian forces have battered critical infrastructure with shelling and cut off access to water, food and power in a massive siege,

Sergei Orlov, the deputy mayor of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine, told CNN on Thursday that Russian forces have blasted the city for at least 26 hours.

“We do not have electricity in the whole city, we do not have water supply, we do not have sanitary system, we do not have heating,” Orlov said. “The situation is very bad.”

Orlov estimated that at least 200 residents have died, but did not know the exact toll. He pleaded for help from the Ukrainian army, saying the city could only hold on for seven or eight days.

Zelensky says Ukrainian defenses holding

10:04 a.m.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that the country’s defense lines were holding against the Russian incursions and referred to the attack as “another virus” the country had to face.

“It’s been a week now that another virus attacked” and Ukrainians “have nothing to lose but our own freedom,” he said in an emotional speech, according to Reuters.

Zelensky told Ukrainians that the defense forces had held their lines against Russia’s invasion through another night filled with airstrikes.

“They wanted to destroy us so many times. They couldn’t. We’ve been through so much! And if someone thinks that, having overcome all this, Ukrainians will be frightened, broken or surrender — he knows nothing about Ukraine, and he has nothing to do in Ukraine,” he said in a video message according to CBS News.

The president said that Ukrainians have endured tragedies and hardship including two world wars, the Holodomor famine, Holocaust, Soviet terror, the Chernobyl nuclear explosion and Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

“We don’t have the biggest territory … we don’t have nuclear arms, we don’t provide oil and gas to international markets. But we do have our people. We do have our land. This is what we are fighting for,” he said, according to Reuters.

“Total resistance … this is our Ukrainian trump card and this is what we can do best in the world,” the presidential aide also said, encouraging people to build barricades in the city, rally, create online networks and defend the country to the best of their ability.

Russian officials have suspended deliveries of rocket engines to the U.S. in retaliation for the sanctions placed on them over the invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported.

State-space agency Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin told state media Thursday that his agency will stop servicing rocket engines it has previously delivered to the U.S.

Rogozin said the U.S. still has 24 engines that will be left without Russian technical assistance, according to Reuters.

“In a situation like this, we can’t supply the United States with our world’s best rocket engines. Let them fly on something else, their broomsticks, I don’t know what,” Rogozin told state media.

Rogozin said Russia has delivered a total of 122 RD-180 engines to the U.S. in the 1990s, of which 98 were used to power Atlas launch vehicles.

https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/262898602689892

The Armed Forces of Ukraine are beginning to seize the initiative of the Russian occupiers in some areas. The enemy is trying to keep the fighting capacity of their units, realizing that the ""easy walk"" did not work. He is trying to avoid direct clashes not only with the Ukrainian army but also with civilians blocking the movement of his columns. Russian propaganda ceases to operate in Ukraine and the ""liberators"" realize that no one was waiting for them here.

In the Volyn direction, the enemy has lost the initiative and is not taking active action.

In the Polissya direction, the Russian occupiers continue to advance in the direction of Makariv - Brusyliv - Fastiv, and a part of the forces - to Kyiv.

On the routes to Malyn and Irpin, the aggressor lost its offensive pace, suffered significant losses, and stopped at unfavorable borders.

In the Chernobyl direction, the enemy tried to develop an offensive toward Demidov and Irpin but having lost the offensive potential, stopped.

In the Zhytomyr region, Russian forces were trying to deploy advanced units in the areas of the settlements of Horenychy, Shpytky, and Petrushky.

At the same time, the enemy is deploying field and logistics camps in the areas of Borodyanka, Katyuzhanka, and Gavronshchyna.

In the Seversky direction, the enemy of the 1st Tank Army and the 20th Combined Army of the Russian Armed Forces, which launched offensive operations in the direction of Krasnograd and Izyum to create conditions to encircle the combined forces, suffered losses and was stopped at the borders of Bohodukhiv, Chuguiv, and Shevchenkove.

The enemy was stopped in the Chernihiv direction.

The movement toward Nova Basan, Kozelets was noted in the Nizhyn direction.

In the Donetsk direction the enemy focused its efforts with the 1st, 2nd and 8th armies on reaching the administrative borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. He didn't reach this goal and couldn't block Mariupol.

In the south, the enemy tried to continue the offensive in the direction of Zaporizhzhia, part of the forces - in Mariupol.

In the Black Sea Operational Zone, the Russian occupiers continue preparations for a naval landing operation on the Black Sea coast of Ukraine (Zatoka, Odesa districts). The deployment of naval fleet groups on the high seas was noted.

The enemy is demoralized and continues to suffer losses in personnel and equipment.

For the safety of civil navigation, the Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine restricted navigation in the north-western part of the Black Sea. At the same time, the Russian Black Sea Fleet continues the tactics of Russian ground forces trying to hide behind civilian lives.

For example, on March 2, 2022, the Russian side requires the civilian ship HELT to enter the dangerous zone of the Black Sea so that the occupiers can cover themselves with a civilian ship as a human shield, otherwise Russian warships would open fire on the ship HELT. This is nothing but 21st century piracy.

It will be recalled that during the full-scale invasion on February 24, the Russian fleet had already fired on 2 civilian ships and captured 2 ships of the Russian occupiers (including the search and rescue ship Sapphire having been sailed on a humanitarian mission).

Minister of Defence of Ukraine

147 hours of defenсe. The nature of events is changing. The Russian occupiers are trying to somehow maintain the combat effectiveness of their units. But it is getting worse and worse. This is evidenced by the repeated facts of the capture of groups of Russian soldiers and officers. As well as refusal to continue the offensive.

The enemy was afraid of direct contact with Ukrainian defenders. Therefore, it turned to the criminal tactics of long-range shelling of peaceful cities. Air and missile strikes from Russia and Belarus on residential buildings and schools, shelling of maternity hospitals - this is coward behavior of those who have no honor. These are not military - they are terrorists, representatives of the terrorist state.

The enemy viciously fired on peaceful Zhytomyr. This is an attempt to take revenge for the successful completion of the 95th Brigade task. The occupiers aimed at the brigade #39’s barracks and at nearby houses.

Many of our cities and villages are now suffering from Russian terror, but most of all - Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kherson.

Yesterday I had a long conversation with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Even the experienced American military was astonished by the professionalism of our defenders and the resilience of our people. The amount of help we receive is increasing. The number of countries that provide this assistance is growing.

New bayraktars have already arrived in Ukraine and are on combat duty.

There will be more Stingers and Javelins. Europe is becoming our rear and supplying what is critical for defense. We are at the forefront of the free world.

POLICY

President of Ukraine

It is the 7 day of war, and Ukrainians have shown the unprecedented unity that we never had before, even in 30 years of Ukraine’s independence. The President continued:

“Yesterday morning on the Svobody square we were all residents of Kharkiv, later the enemy destroyed us by striking at residential buildings in Borodianka, we were all bombed in Kyiv last night. And we all died again in Babyn Yar – from a missile strike. Although the whole world promises constrantly – never again.

For every normal person who know history, Babyn Yar is a special part of Kyiv and Europe, a place for prayer and remembrance for the hundred thousand people killed by the Nazis. The place of old Kyiv cemeteries. Who should you be to make it a target for missiles? You are killing Holocaust victims for the second time. During the Soviet era times, a Soviet era, a TV center was built on the bones there and also a sports complex, outbuildings, and a park to erase true history of Babyn Yar. But why was it bombed? This is beyond humanity. Such a missile strike shows that for many people in Russia, our Kyiv is completely foreign. They know nothing about our capital, about our history, but they have an order to erase our history, our country and all of us.

On the first day of war, Uman was brutally bombed, where hundreds of thousands of Jews come every year to pray. Then – Babyn Yar, where hundreds of thousands of Jews were executed. I am addressing all the Jews of the world – don’t you see what is happening? That is why it is very important that millions of Jews around the world do not remain silent right now, as Nazism is born in silence. So shout about the killing of civilians, the killings of Ukrainians”.

The President also informed about the continued shelling of the Ukrainian cities with bombs, missiles, artillery, machine guns targeting at civilians and residential areas. Mariupol, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr and other cities became targets. President Zelenskyy also wondered whether other sacred places such as Lavra and Sofiia Kyivska would be targeted, too.

The President highlighted that the standing ovation the European Parliament yesterday was an assessment to the Ukrainian efforts and unity, which became a powerful impetus for the European Union to start a special accelerated accession procedure for Ukraine.

Ukrainian diplomats and our partners around the world work for the sake of Ukraine and peace. Neutral Switzerland has aligned the EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs, officials, the state and enterprises. Many new countries, on which Russia relied before, have joined the anti-war coalition. “You can’t stay neutral right now!”, - said the President.

The sanctions Russia faced include restrictions in sport competitions, in popular culture, Russian goods are being banned, Russian banks are switched off from SWIFT. Its citizens are losing their savings and prospects. Russian mothers are losing their children in an absolutely foreign country to them - almost 6000 Russian soldiers died in 6 days (not counting the losses of the enemy last night) of a pointless war for them.

Cabinet of Ministers

It is the 7th day of the national liberation war against Russia. Our troops are fighting like lions in all directions and holding defence firmly. The enemy is getting exhausted, and in some areas is forced to retreat tactically.

At the same time, tens of thousands of reservists are joining our army. Weapons are coming to Ukraine from all over the world. Most importantly is that confusion and fear that many people had experienced in the first two days of the war have changed into concentration and valour.

Everyone understands that we are waging a liberation war for our land and for our future. And we will not forgive the enemy for the committed crimes. Not only the perpetrators but also the architects of this inhumane plan will incur punishment in the Hague for missile salvos against the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, and others..

The Iron Curtain is increasingly falling over the aggressor. Global companies are leaving Russia, as they do not want to soil their hands on blood-stained money. Russia is near default. Most civilized countries have closed their skies from Russia.

At the same time, Ukraine is getting stronger. The European Parliament has accepted Ukraine's application to join the EU.

Ukraine is connecting to the European power grid ENTSO-E.

Rallies in support of our nation are taking place all over the world. Ukraine is now the centre of the world’s struggle for freedom.

The Government team is working together with the President of Ukraine in Kyiv and in the determined under martial law places. We are not going anywhere and will never surrender to the enemy.

Yesterday we simplified the state budget’s contingency drawdown procedure during martial law, which will allow us to quickly make decisions to allocate funds for the needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

The Government has also decided that humanitarian and technical assistance will be received with no delay and exempt from customs control procedures on the basis of a summary declaration.

The Government is now actively developing mechanisms for reliable supplies of food, medications and essential commodities throughout the country.

The Coordination Centre for Food, Medicine, Drinking Water and Fuel Supplies is fully operational and led by the First Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Economy Yulia Svyrydenko.

The Humanitarian Aid Coordination Centre is working under the leadership of Olha Stefanishyna, Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration.

The whole Government and the whole state machinery are working hard to ensure stability of the country in this time.

Moreover, yesterday, on March 1, the first war bond auction took place. More than UAH 8 billion was raised. These funds will be used to support Ukrainian defenders and finance the state budget.

I thank every Ukrainian and every company that supports the state.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine has established an emergency hotline for foreign students wishing to leave Ukraine because of the Russian armed aggression.

Those who require assistance can call, Viber or Telegram the following number: +380 93418 56 84.

The questionnaire has also been created for collecting basic information about students and their whereabouts in order to advise them on the means available for their departure: https://cutt.ly/qAi9vBJ.

The Government of Ukraine is in close constant contact with diplomatic missions and consulates of foreign countries to ensure that their citizens are safe and able to return to their countries as soon as possible.

The Ukrainian border guards in cooperation with colleagues from neighboring EU countries and Moldova are doing everything possible to speed up the passage of all citizens from Ukraine and have never created obstacles that would hinder this.

The Ministry wishes to advise that all checkpoints on the western border are open 24 hours a day. Checks and check-in operations have been simplified as much as possible and the list of necessary documents has been minimized.

In Ukraine, there is no discrimination based on race, skin color or nationality, including when it comes to the crossing of the state border by foreign citizens. The first come first served approach applies to all nationalities.

In accordance with international humanitarian law, priority is given to women and children. All men, both Ukrainian nationals and foreign citizens, pass checks and check-in operations after women, children and elderly people.

All people at the border are asked to comply with law and order and to act responsibly in light of the challenging situation. This will allow the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine to speed up the border crossing process. Those who are crossing are asked to have documents ready and to be as organized as possible. In addition, we ask that those crossing show mutual respect and understanding to everyone at the border during this extremely difficult time. Border guard personnel are working around the clock on both sides, in difficult conditions, to make the crossing as fast and and as straight-forward as possible.

We would like to reiterate that the ongoing severe humanitarian situation in Ukraine, including the situation at the western border of Ukraine, was caused by the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Russia bears full responsibility for the killing and injuring of innocent people, destruction of civilian infrastructure, and creating obstacles for the safe departure of foreign citizens.

Ukraine calls on all foreign governments to demand from President Putin that he immediately stops his war in Ukraine. This will allow us to stabilize the situation and focus more on the safety and security of the population, including foreign students.

Appeal of the Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine Lyudmyla Denysova

In carrying out an aggressive attack on Ukraine, the troops of the Russian Federation are carrying out targeted shelling of medical facilities and medical transport, violating the right to life and health of Ukrainians.

Convention for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949, Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces of 12 August 1949, Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts), strict requirements for the protection of medical personnel, medical vehicles and medical institutions.

International humanitarian law prohibits attacks on medical personnel and facilities during armed conflict.

But the enemy insidiously targets hospitals and kills medics. Near Kyiv, the occupiers shot doctor M. Kalabina, who was trying to save a child injured by them.

The artillery fired at Hospital 3 in Kharkiv, Vasylivka Hospital in Zaporizhia Oblast, a military hospital near Kyiv, and maternity hospitals in mm. Zhytomyr and Mariupol and many other institutions.

At the same time, the occupier refuses to establish ""green corridors"" for the removal of the wounded and civilians and the delivery of medicines. Leaving both Ukrainians and their own military to their deaths.

Such actions of the interventionist are another evidence of the genocide of the Ukrainian people and should be taken into account by the criminal court in The Hague.

I appeal to the Delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Ukraine, as part of my mandate, to promote the establishment of ""green corridors"" for the evacuation of civilians and the wounded from active combat areas and the provision of appropriate humanitarian assistance.
