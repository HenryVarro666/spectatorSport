The vessel in question was the Project 1171 Alligator class landing ship Orsk, while another two Project 775

The incident seems to have begun at around 7:45 AM local time, when a significant explosion was noted aboard one of the vessels at Berdyansk, later identified as the Orsk. Soon after, the other two landing ships left the port. Differing reports suggest that either one or two of these vessels was also on fire, although it’s also been reported that these blazes were fairly quickly extinguished.

Ironically, the arrival of the landing ships in Berdyansk earlier this week had been heralded by Russia as a significant development in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the event had been covered extensively by Russian state media. At the time, a video appeared showing BTR-82A armored personnel carriers in the process of being unloaded from the Orsk.

However, it’s unclear what was aboard these vessels and to what degree they had been unloaded at the time of today’s incident. The Alligator class is able to transport up to 425 troops as well as 20 tanks or 40 armored vehicles, or other cargoes.

The size of the explosion and intensity of the fire aboard the Orsk was such that there have been some claims it was loaded with ammunition at the time. While there is no confirmation of this, the dramatic inferno does show some evidence of what looks like ammunition ‘cooking off’ — unfired weapon ammunition exploding prematurely due to the intense heat.

Unconfirmed reports also suggest there may have been eight sailors killed on the Tsesar Kunikov and three killed and three injured on the Novocherkassk.

Soon after the news of the incident, claims began to surface of a successful Tochka strike on Berdyansk, although the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense so far seems not to have presented this narrative, instead noting that “The large landing ship Orsk of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian occupiers was temporarily destroyed in the Russian-occupied port of Berdyansk.”

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar told Ukrainian TV that the armed forces had hit a “huge target, capable of carrying 20 tanks, 45 armored vehicles, and 400 troops,” but did not disclose how this had been achieved.

If reports of an SRBM strike turn out to be true, this would be a major coup for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which are strictly limited in their ability to target Russian vessels when they’re at sea, with few if any operational anti-ship missiles. With that in mind, a collection of high-value landing ships in port would certainly have presented a very tempting target for the Ukrainians. The only other confirmed successful Ukrainian attack on a Russian ship is an incident that came to light earlier this week in which a Russian Navy Project 03160 Raptor class patrol boat was damaged with anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) while underway near Mariupol. There remains the possibility that an ATGM team could have penetrated close enough to the port to take a shot against the warships there.

On the other hand, it’s questionable whether a Tochka SRBM would have the accuracy to target a particular ship unless the strike was simply a very lucky hit and the missile had been directed at the area of the port in general. The later Tochka-U version of the missile is assessed as having a circular error probable (CEP) of around 100 yards, although using an optional submunition warhead would mean that even a hit in the vicinity of the vessel could have led to its destruction.

Evidence in favor of a successful SRBM strike includes video from earlier this month showing the remains of a Tochka-U missile reportedly at the port in Berdyansk. At the time, Russian media reported that this particular missile had been brought down by its air defenses.

There are also unconfirmed reports, citing only anonymous “Odesa sources,” that a Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 drone was also used in the supposed attack on the port, either as a strike asset or, more likely, to provide targeting coordinates

It’s conceivable, too, that, some other kind of Ukrainian action led to the incident, perhaps via some kind of sabotage operation, like the aforementioned ATGM team.

On the other hand, there remains a strong possibility that the explosion noted in the port was not the result of any kind of hostile activity, but instead the ammunition — or other volatile cargo — aboard the Orsk ‘cooking off’ after a fire had been started by other means, perhaps accidental. As The War Zone

The significance of the loss of the Orsk is compounded by the fact that Russia is now no longer able to bring additional warships into the Black Sea, and the adjacent Sea of Azov, after Turkey closed access via the Dardanelles as is its right under the Montreux Convention. This prohibits warships of all navies from entering these waters unless they are returning to their homeports in the Black Sea. As such, the incident greatly degrades Russia’s amphibious capabilities in the region.

What’s more, Russia has been more generally struggling with the logistical burden of its multi-pronged assault on Ukraine and the removal of another means of bringing supplies to support its troops is a major blow.

Footage of the Orsk being unloaded at Berdyansk earlier this week:

If this was indeed a planned Ukrainian attack, rather than an accident of some kind, it could also threaten to derail Russian plans to use Berdyansk — and perhaps by extension other captured Ukrainian ports. It’s unclear where the two Ropucha-II class landing ships are now headed, but their departure could signal a withdrawal to Sevastopol, the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in occupied Crimea. Overall, the inability to secure port facilities in Ukraine will only make the challenge of sustaining an occupation harder still.

Even if the incident was an accident, it remains to be seen what condition the port facilities have been left in, but that may also influence the degree to which the port can be used by Russia in the near term.

While the exact long-term results of whatever happened today at Berdyansk remain more uncertain, there are obviously many details of the incident that remain to be disclosed. In the meantime, Russia has almost certainly lost an important asset in its ongoing campaign and one that is impossible to simply replace.

Multiple photos and videos showed thick black smoke rising from the port as one ship sat at the harbour in flames, while another two sailed away – one of which also appeared to be damaged. The strike caused a significant explosion onboard the ship. After the explosion, the other landing ships in the port (Ropucha-II class landing ships Tsesar Kunikov and Novocherkassk), quickly left the port.

OTR-21 Tochka is a Soviet tactical ballistic missile. Its GRAU designation is 9K79; its NATO reporting name is SS-21 Scarab. It is transported in a 9P129 vehicle and raised prior to launch. It uses an inertial guidance system. The OTR-21 forward deployment to East Germany began in 1981, replacing the earlier Luna-M series of unguided artillery rockets. OTR-21 is a mobile missile launch system, designed to be deployed along with other land combat units on the battlefield. A third variant, Scarab C, range increased to 185 km (115 mi), and CEP decreased to less than 70 m (229 ft). Scarab C weighs 1,800 kg (4,000 lb).

The missile itself can be used for precise strikes on enemy tactical targets, such as control posts, bridges, storage facilities, troop concentrations and airfields. The fragmentation warhead can be replaced with a nuclear, biological or chemical warhead. The solid propellant makes the missile easy to maintain and deploy. OTR-21 units are usually managed in a brigade structure. There are 18 launchers in a brigade; each launcher is provided with 2 or 3 missiles. The vehicle is completely amphibious, with a maximum road speed of 60 km/h (37 mph) and 8 km/h (5.0 mph) in water. It is NBC-protected. The system has been in development since 1968. Three variants were developed.

Project 1171 (Tapir-class) landing ship tank (NATO reporting name: Alligator) is a class of Soviet / Russian general purpose, beachable amphibious transport docks. Labelled Large Landing Ship, its displacement was 4,360-tons full load and could transport 313 troops and 20 tanks. Additional vehicles could be stored on the upper deck. A total of 14 vessels were completed between 1964 and 1975; all were retired between 1992 and 1995. As of September 2008, two vessels, currently named Orsk and Saratov, were in active service with the 197th Brigade of Landing Ships in the Russian Black Sea Fleet.

Russia’s Alligator-class amphibious landing ships, sometimes referred to as transport dock ships, are large vessels capable of transporting a great deal of firepower. Originally commissioned in 1968, the Orsk (BDK-69) has seen a great deal of use over its decades of service, most recently delivering Russian hardware to Syria. It is one of just three Alligator-class vessels still in service with the Russian Navy.

“The destroyed ship in Berdyansk could carry up to 20 tanks, 45 armored personnel carriers and 400 paratroopers,” the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, Anna Malyar, said in a statement on Thursday. “This is a huge target that was hit by our military.”

Although the ship can clearly be seen burning in drone footage, Sandboxx News could not confirm that the vessel has indeed been destroyed. Whether or not it can be repaired or salvaged remains to be seen.

The Orsk was recently shown on Russian state television delivering armored vehicles in the Berdyansk port. Per the Russian report, the vessel had been tasked with reinforcing Russian troops in the nation’s South East, not far from some of the fiercest fighting of the conflict.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

It said it destroyed a ship named the Orsk in the Russian-occupied port of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov.

Amateur video footage, filmed from Berdyansk, showed a large plume of smoke emanating from a fire on a large gray ship, as well as a large explosion.

As the ship burned, the footage showed two other vessels sailing out of the dock — one of them visibly damaged.

Russia did not confirm if it had lost the Orsk.

On Monday, Russia had announced that the Orsk was docked in that port, 70 kilometers (45 miles) southwest of the besieged city of Mariupol. Pro-Russian media had emphasized that port and ship's importance to Russian supply lines in the Black Sea.

Russian news agency TASS reported that the ship was capable of carrying up to 1,500 tons of cargo.

Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar said the ship was destroyed. She said it could carry 45 armored personnel carriers and 400 people.

Ukraine said a 3,000-ton fuel tank was also destroyed in the attack, with fire spreading to nearby ammunition depots.

Russia has struggled to maintain steady supply lines during its invasion of Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces deliberately targeting its logistics capabilities.

Moscow has captured most of the Ukrainian coastline on the Sea of Azov, but nearby Mariupol has refused to surrender. Russia has been heavily bombarding the city, repeatedly hitting civilian targets.

Video shows two Ropucha-(Project 775) class assault ships beating feet from the explosions on Orsk with one having a fire on deck amid debris raining down.

This points to Orsk being hit while unloading munitions.

Janes reports that a video of Orsk offloading BTR-82A armored personnel carriers in Berdyansk was posted on Twitter by Russia’s state-affiliated media channel RT on 21 March.

As the trio of lightly defended Russian ships docked at Berdyansk three days ago at a fixed location and everyone in the region knew it, this is just poor judgment on the behalf of the Black Sea Fleet– akin to the tragic British foul-up at Bluff Cove in the Falklands.

You just don’t leave ‘phibs in unprotected anchorages in daylight where the enemy may have some air power to whistle up, not in modern times.

What sank the Orsk is foggy as some Ukrainian sources claim simple Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 UAVs– which have claimed some 800 vehicle and bunker kills as a type in Syria, Libya, Ethiopia, Armenia and Ukraine in the past few years– launched missiles that resulted in serious secondary explosions on the old LST. If so, it is the first combat ship “kill” by a UAV, which is historic.

More on the Barayktar, the “Drone of the Decade” which is apparently at hit at the DimDex defense expo in Doha, and for good reason.

Of course, others speculate the vessel was hit by a land-based missile system, as the Ukrainian Army has operational Soviet-era 9K52 Luna-Ms/FROG-7s and OTR-21 Tochka-U/SS-21 Scarabs while the Navy has new Р-360 Neptunes– converted Kh-35/AS-20 Kayaks– all of which are truck-mounted.

After the explosion, the other landing ships in the port (Ropucha-II class landing ships Tsesar Kunikov and Novocherkassk), quickly left the port.

Now beyond any reasonable doubt that a #Russian Navy Alligator Class landing ship exploded in #Berdiansk, Ukraine

Author’s opinion

Without any doubt, this was the most significant loss of the Russian Armed Forces since the beginning of the war. Because, Russia can replace other casualties (aircraft, tanks, armored vehicles etc.), but cannot replace a landing ship, and cannot reinforce its amphibious forces because Turkey closed the straits for the military ships under the Montreux Convention.

The aging Alligator-class landing ships are the weakest link in the Russian amphibious forces, yet it is important because the Black Sea Fleet lacks modern landing ships. In addition, this ship has reportedly been deployed to provide logistical support, which is essential for Russian forces to maintain their combat power in the region. Russia’s logistics chain has been less than stellar, and any loss is significant in this context.

Alligator-class landing ship (Russian MoD image)

Another important aspect of the attack is psychological. No matter what type it is, losing a warship makes a major impact on the psychological status of both sides negatively or positively. This event will surely affect the Ukrainian soldiers’ will to fight in a positive way.

Moreover, such an effective attack would cause anxiety in the Russian decision-makers and change that attitude to keep their ships either in Sevastopol Naval Base or at sea rather than deploying them to the captured ports. Because, landing ships (either in the logistical or amphibious role) are “high-value units” due to their force projection capabilities but limited defensive weapons, so they must be protected.

Since Ukraine lacks anti-ship missiles, it is unable to attack Russian warships when they are at sea. It was Ukraine’s only chance to neutralize these ships while they are in port, so these ships are somewhat vulnerable to asymmetric attack while they are discharging their cargo. The Tochka missile has no guidance, so it cannot hit a moving ship at sea. Ukraine seems to have taken the rare opportunity to destroy the Russian ship.",https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/03/ukraine-strikes-alligator-class-lst-with-ballistic-missile/

Two other sea-going ships near Orsk were damaged in the attack. Here, the Russian forces made another mistake. Military ships are not kept so close to each other in times of conflict.

But like I said - I care less about it being from someone in the FSB, and more about whether it is from someone who has a good bead on how the FSB - and the security services in general - is approaching the war in Ukraine.

Osechkin runs gulagu.net site, which became famous because of it's anti-torture leaks. This has resulted in some success, Putin's government fired some people responsible for prison torture as a result, and also Osechkin establishing contacts inside FSB who were also against torture and reached out to him.

Osechkin says information later turned out to be true, but will only give it privately to representatives of the media, in order to protect the source.

- on March 19, WindOfChange warned Osechkin that another FSB department is planning to feed them with fake ""Ukraine prison torture"" information

- on March 21 they have received information with videos about Ukranian prison torture pipeline, which Osechkin thought was fake

Here’s some further validation of Osechkin (the activist) as a source, (the article also has some interesting commentary from the alleged FSB source about Xi) Quote: As for the authenticity of this document, Christo Grozev, a Bulgarian journalist who won the European Press Prize for Investigative Journalism, cautioned on Twitter on March 6 that Ukraine had released fake FSB documents as part of its psyops strategy, but he vouched for Osechkin as a reputable source. Grozev argued that the length of the letter points to its authenticity, based on the rationale that ""the longer the text, the more risk of making an error.""



In a follow-up tweet, Grozev stated that he had shown the letter to two confirmed FSB contacts and that they ""had no doubt it was written by a colleague."" He noted that his FSB contacts did not agree with all of the analyst's conclusions, ""but that's a different story.""

Also a repeat of the prediction of the propaganda of Ukrainian torture. Quote: On Feb. 19, the whistleblower warned the group two days in advance about a Russian disinformation campaign to spread false rumors of torture in Ukraine prisons to destabilize the situation just prior to the invasion.

The biggest issue I have with the Winds of Change letters is that the author makes some very basic analytical mistakes. The sort of thing you'd see an E-1 do before the Chief had time to sit with them and explain why their analysis was so obviously flawed and how to avoid that kind of mistake in the future. They are not the analytical errors of an experienced intelligence analyst.



I'm all for the gleeful teardown of the FSB and SVR and GRU but at this point absolutely nothing indicates that they're bad at basic analysis. They're trapped by political expediency and meddling, which is hardly unfamiliar in western nation-states.

“at this point absolutely nothing indicates that they're bad at basic analysis”, apart from their analysis of the reception and reaction from Ukraine. At least partly based on FSB commissioned social surveys in Ukraine in February 2022. Quote: the Ninth Directorate, targeting Ukraine, has been overseeing the gathering of intelligence on Ukrainian society to inform Russian decision-making. Its February 2022 surveys reveal much about how the Kremlin assessed the resilience of Ukrainian society.

…

These trends will have been factored into Russia’s invasion planning, and the implications are worth considering. It is notable that Putin, in his pre-invasion televised address, spoke extensively about the failures of Ukrainian governance in terms that mirrored the picture painted by the FSB’s surveys.

…

The problem with surveys of social attitudes is that they are a snapshot of a moment in time.

…

If Russia hoped that shock and awe in the destruction of the Ukrainian military might deter resistance, historical experience points to the opposite result. Thus, while the FSB survey may have been accurate in measuring opinions at the time it was conducted, it told the Russians little about how sentiments would evolve in the aftermath of an invasion. Ukraine Through Russia’s Eyes

Nick Reynolds and Dr Jack Watling, 25 February 2022



A fish is rotten from the head down, and the FSB is the mangy guts and ribs dangling from a rotten head.



Here we have an invasion where a first strike, with what now turns out to have been an adequate supply of reasonably accurate cruise and ballistic missiles—the two strikes near Lviv on the camp and the aircraft repair factory demonstrate this—failed to make a decisive dent in Ukrainian air defences. Tank columns parade, gun barrels neatly aligned, supporting troopers absent, down boulevards become shooting galleries. And you find it a stretch to imagine incompetence by analysts in the FSB. I grant, there may be competent individuals in there somewhere, but the structure is rotten to the core.



A law unto itself, riven with rival factions, with fingers and dicks and arseholes so deeply entangled in all sorts of everything corrupt and criminal and venal; and we expect competency to arise magically out of this morass?



The Atlantic Council has an interesting long read. Now, here I’m no expert, I’ve just been spending most of today reading in to the issues to reply to your post—one of the reasons I love debating on Ars , because it forces me most of the time to find out how utterly wrong my first impressions often are, and I shut up and don’t post. Sometimes, though, I think I have an inkling.

I don’t have a great love for Russia, as I do for the US; but I have a lot of sympathy for the poor suckers being ground under Putins heel, I hope this is the beginning of the end for the kleptocracy—and the prelude to a new day for Russians.



The Atlantic Council report



And having perused the report, I am much more inclined to believe in the validity of Wind of Change; I can utterly believe in somebody, whatever their competence, being thoroughly fed up and feeling the need to vent—not ultimately to the detriment of their motherland, but to it’s benefit, and the detriment of this obscene hydra.



Sorry folks, no other posts today from me, as I need to go to wind down a bit and go to bed. I do however commend today’s ABC

I'm definitely of a mind that the invasion was grossly misjudged, but my own experience leads me to believe most of the editorializing occurred well above the analyst level.
