And amazingly, the driver survived this terrifying encounter in the besieged city.

Onlookers — who recorded videos from different angles — could be heard crying out in horror as the tank swerved wildly on the street before barreling over the car, and then in reverse over it again.

Subsequent video showed good Samaritans rushing to the pancaked vehicle and freeing the driver from wreckage.

The car’s roof was ripped off in the mow down and its windshield obliterated as rescuers couldn’t even open doors of the gnarled automobile.

So, here are 10 military vehicles that you can buy today either new or used.

Military vehicles are popular amongst civilians. There are loads of military surplus vehicles in the market today, of which some are road-legal. As long as your military vehicle is free of armaments, rides on wheels, and is not wider than 102 mm, you can make it road legal. Of course, there are many more parameters, but these are the obvious ones.

After all, a military vehicle has higher chances of saving your ass than a sedan in case of an apocalypse LISTEN 08:36

The Jeep Staff Car Concept looks neat and it’s something you wouldn’t mind driving on the roads often. A layman will pass it off as customized Wrangler. The desert storm paint shade looks classy and has got matching steel wheels as well. It has a soft top and comes without any doors. While it looks like any other Jeep, it has a pretty long wheelbase and sits high off the ground. It is powered by Jeep’s famous 3.6-liter V-6 Pentastar engine that makes 285 horses and 260 pound-feet of torque. As it should be, the engine is mated to a six-speed manual gearbox.

Surprisingly, this Jeep is quick off the line as per military car standards and takes just eight seconds to hit the 60 mph mark. Although it is capable of hovering over rough terrains, it scores almost a zero when it comes to personal safety because of the lack of doors and a soft top.

GAZ Tigr - $110,000

Play

The GAZ Tigr’s claim-to-fame was when Russia included it in its forces in 2006. The Tigr is equally strong on tarmac as it is off the road. When you look at the stature of the vehicle, you wouldn’t expect it to have a good interior as such. However, the Tigr features leather seats, air conditioning, and an audio system, and that plays a big role in attracting civilian customers.

The GAZ Tigr weighs around 16,000 pounds and comes with stuff like an inflation system, electric winch, and fire extinguishing system, to name a few. The civilian version can’t be had with any armament, of course, but you can get different levels of armor protection based on your budget.

The Marauder is exactly the kind of vehicle that defines this list. The vehicle made its debut in 2007 in Abu Dhabi and has made its presence felt all across the globe ever since. The vehicle is as protected as one can be and can even withstand landmines.

The Marauder’s payload capacity was designed to carry armaments like machine guns and missile launchers.

The Marauder truck is built on orders and to date, around 250 examples have been sold worldwide.

It is road-legal in some variants and can make Hummer owners green with envy. Engine specs are listed quite vaguely even on the official site. This African beast is certainly not a cheap vehicle, but it will surely protect you in case of an apocalypse. Oh, and did I mention that it weighs over 24,000 pounds?

The Oshkosh L-ATV is a replacement to the aging Humvee in the U.S. Army’s cavalry. The Humvee was good for mobility in the fields but not for warfare. A few mods were made to make it an armored vehicle, but that took a hit on the mobility.

The Oshkosh L-ATV can do both the jobs, and hence, it replaced the Humvee. The $450,000 version is with all the weapons and armor included, but this isn’t available to civilians. The ripped-off, road-legal version starts at $250,000. It weighs just over 10,000 pounds and can go all the way up to 70 mph.

Oshkosh L-ATV specifications Engine: 6.6-liter, Duramax diesel Horsepower: 340 horses Torque: 455 pound-feet (unconfirmed) Transmission: Six-speed Automatic Gearbox

The Humvee is being phased out by the U.S. Army in favor of the Oshkosh L-ATV but it is still in production. As of 2014, the U.S. government had sold about 4,000 Humvees to civilians. The Humvee’s production started back in 1984 and was designed primarily for personnel and light cargo transport behind front lines, not as a front line fighting vehicle.

The original M998 model was powered by a 6.2-liter V-8 mill that was sufficient to make the Humvee sprint up to 70 mph.

The Humvee might be losing prominence now, but it is an icon nevertheless. You can find Humvees for sale for as low as $10,000 in the used markets.

Dodge WC Utility Truck - $5,000

Play

The Dodge WC is a true military truck with a lot of war-field experience in its arsenal (pun intended). The WC Series was built specifically for the military during World War II and came with an option of either a four-wheel-drive or six-wheel-drive. More than half the trucks supplied to the U.S. military during World War II were Dodge WCs. The truck itself looks classy and comes sans any doors or hardtop. The last of the batch came with a 6.5-liter, liquid-cooled engine. The WC can be found ranging from as low as $5,000 to six-digit figures. You’ll be able to find a good example if you spend a little extra time searching for them.

SdKfz 251 - $624,000

For the uninformed folks, no, that’s not a typo. The SdKfz 251 was a versatile truck that doubled up as a tank also. Pretty neat, right? This armored vehicle was used to transport German soldiers to the battlefield. 22 trims of this vehicle were based upon four models. It came with armor plates for the defense, and machine guns and rifle bullets for offense. Believe it or not, the SdKfz 251 is not as rare as most of the other models mentioned on this list. Over 15,000 examples of this truck-tank were built, although most of them aren’t in drivable condition today. That is precisely why the vehicle is can cost you over half-million dollars today.

Steyr Puch Pinzgauer - $25,000

The Steyr Puch Pinzgauer was born in early the 70s, and even today, it is as tough as it used to be back then. Don’t be fooled by its minivan-esque looks; the vehicle is one of the toughest ones out there. Fun fact: Pinzgauer is named after an Austrian-bred horse. Talking about its smart engineering,

The Pinzgauer has a central tube chassis with a transaxle which distributes the weight more evenly and keeps the center of gravity as low as possible. The differentials are all sealed units and require minimal additional lubrication.

Yes, this was back in the 70s. You can find well-maintained examples even today, ranging in the $30,000 ballpark.

Renault Sherpa is the perfect vehicle you could ask for in apocalyptic times. It looks quite similar to Dwayne Johnson’s Gurkha F5 from the Fast and Furious movie series. The Sherpa series consists of six vehicles in the lineup with varying protection for each one. Many armed forces across the globe have included the Sherpa in their cavalry.

The Sherpa is available only through special orders. It is mainly designed for tactical missions and that is what makes it a hit amongst civilians. The beast is powered by a 4.76-liter four-pot mill that churns out over 200 horses. If you’re looking to buy the Sherpa, be ready to shell out over $250,000.

Several people are heard in the clip shrieking in horror while the tank sits atop the car before rolling backward. Sporadic gunfire is also heard in the background.

Another video showed an elderly man being rescued from the flattened car moments later. He appeared to be alert, but the extent of his injuries was not immediately clear. Several people went to the scene to free him from the obliterated vehicle in the aftermath of the apparently intentional attack.

On Friday, multiple videos filmed by citizens in the Obolon district in Kyiv surfaced showing the moment a military vehicle ran over and crushed a car driven by an elderly man.

In one video, a military vehicle can be seen barreling down an almost-empty road, swerving into the lane of a civilian driving in the opposite direction. The armored vehicle drives over the smaller car, completely crushing what appears to be a four-door sedan, then continues to drive as those who recorded the footage gasp in disbelief and terror.

In a second video, a group of civilians can be seen working together to free the man from the wreckage with what looks like a crowbar and an ax, while also using sheer manpower to help get the man out of the demolished car.

While alive as he is pulled from the twisted metal that was once his car, the man's current condition and identity are unknown.

The gut-wrenching video has been verified by Sky News and the Independent. PEOPLE has yet to independently verify the video.

The video is just one of the latest visuals depicting the absolute horror of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and is a grave reminder of the cost of war on civilians.

Russia began its invasion of Ukraine earlier this week after Vladimir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" in a televised address Thursday morning local time.

The attack is still-evolving but explosions and airstrikes have been reported, with threats mounting against the capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million people.
