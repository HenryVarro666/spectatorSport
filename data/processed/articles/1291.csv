On Friday, an “anti-war exhibition” was due to open in Varna, gathering local and international artists. On Sunday, a free open-air concert in support of Ukraine in Sofia will unite several rock and blues musicians.

Posters calling for Russian ambassador Mitrofanova’s expulsion were widely seen on Thursday during a big rally in the capital, Sofia.

Ambassador Mitrofanova has riled many pro-Western Bulgarians after saying in several interviews that Bulgaria must remain neutral in the war between Russia and Ukraine – and that the condemnation of Moscow by the government in Sofia contrasts with the views of the majority of Bulgarians who, in her estimate, support Russian President Vladimir Putin and his politics.

A Facebook post by the Russian embassy, which slightingly dismissed Prime Minister Kiril Petkov and his cabinet as “clerks”, caused more irritation.

On Thursday, PM Petkov said he was withdrawing Bulgaria’s ambassador to Moscow for consultations, and that the outcome of these talks might result in Mitrofanova’s expulsion.

Mirela Zarichinova, 35, a human rights worker and lawyer based between Sofia and London, who was one of the several organizers of Thursday’s protest, called the ambassador’s interference in her country “appalling”.

“On Wednesday the Russian embassy called our democratically elected Prime Minister a ‘clerk’ and positioned herself as more powerful than him. What I find even more appalling is that the embassy tried to explain the theory that the Bulgarian society is predominantly pro-Kremlin by some “analysis of the public opinion”. If we don’t react today, the next [Russian] ‘analysis’ might point out that we want to get out of the European Union,” she told BIRN.

A peaceful demonstration in the centre of Bulgaria’s capital city Sofia on March 24 saw several thousand people express their solidarity with Ukraine and their revulsion at Russia’s war on that country.

The event was held a month to the date since the beginning of Russia’s current invasion of Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had appealed publicly for such shows of support for his country, under assault from Russia, with Putin’s regime under investigation for a succession of war crimes against civilians.

The turnout on the night of March 24 overwhelmingly dwarfed a previous event in favour of Putin by a pro-Kremlin party that is the smallest in Bulgaria’s Parliament, with just 13 seats out of 240.

The March 24 event began outside the presidential and Cabinet offices, before walking in silent procession to Orlov Most (Eagle Bridge), where minutes of silence were held in memory of victims of the war.

All ages were represented in the turnout, with a predominance of young people. Among those present were Ukrainian students studying at universities in Bulgaria.

On display were Ukrainian, Bulgarian and EU flags, while the flags of Romania, Georgia and the Baltic states were also represented. There were also flags of Free Belarus and Free Syria.

After the stop at Orlov Most, participants were proceeding to the street outside the Russian embassy.

Bulgaria’s government has condemned the war in Ukraine and joined in EU sanctions against Russian figures and entities.

While Bulgaria is leading the formation of a new multinational battlegroup that will be under ultimate Nato command, its government is not sending military aid to Ukraine, because of internal opposition from the Bulgarian Socialist Party, one of four parties in the governing coalition.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said on March 24 that his government was recalling Bulgaria’s ambassador in Moscow for consultations, noting that such moves by a country generally result in the other country recalling its ambassador.

The move by Petkov follows a succession of comments by the Russian ambassador in Sofia, insulting Bulgaria, Bulgarians and the country’s government.

The relevant statement was made by The Sofia Globe, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

The demonstration started near the Presidential and Cabinet offices. After that the silent procession walked towards Orlov Most (Eagle Bridge) to hold a minute’s silence for the victims of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Later, they also marched through the street, on which the Russian embassy is situated.

People, who came to support Ukraine, were of different age groups. There were also Ukrainian students, who are studying at Bulgarian universities.

Participants held different flags, namely those of Ukraine, Bulgaria, the EU, Romania, Georgia, Baltic states, as well as free Belarus and free Syria.

A reminder that, on February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, starting a war. Russian troops are shelling and destroying the key infrastructure facilities, launching missile strikes on Ukrainian cities and villages, killing civilians.

This nation managed to surprise the whole world with its dignity, courage and endurance.”

The rally, organized on social networks, will take place on March 24 at 6.30 p.m. on Nezavisimost Square in the capital Sofia.

“At the same time, Bulgaria is captive to the growing grip of the Russian propaganda war against our country. The Russian ambassador allowed herself to speak on behalf of the Bulgarian people. We are witnessing the rising extreme nationalism in Russia and understand what it means for Bulgaria if we do not demand an adequate and timely position in support of Ukraine from our government. We cannot allow marginal pro-Russian parties to dictate the most important decisions for Bulgaria's future. We should not let our voices be silenced,” protesters said on Facebook.

“It is time to say that we are here, that we are in the EU and NATO, that we have already made our civilizational choice and we stand behind it. Let us go out, make a bright, albeit symbolic gesture to the people of Ukraine. Together with Ukraine!”, the protesters call for.

Independence Square, 6:30 p.m., Thursday, March 24 - exactly 1 month since the beginning of the war!

One Month after the Invasion of Ukraine: Ongoing Clashes and People in Trap

“Get involved, invite friends and family, draw posters, take flags - Ukrainian, Bulgarian, EU, and musical instruments so we can be seen and heard! The event is peaceful and the participants will abide by the laws of the Republic of Bulgaria,” said the organizers of the protest.

“The Association of European Journalists - Bulgaria supports the peaceful march for Ukraine, which will take place in Sofia. Similar events will take place in Burgas on Wednesday and in Varna on Saturday. Vladimir Putin's insane war against independent and sovereign Ukraine has been going on for a month now. A war in which thousands, including hundreds of children, were killed. A war in which beautiful cities were torn down and millions were forced to flee their homes.

This war was made possible only by lies. He lies about everything, even the fact that there is no such war. Russia itself has passed legislation introducing military censorship, which provides for up to 15 years in prison for anyone who dares to tell the truth about the war. The anti-war protests were dispersed immediately, the participants were arrested and the independent media were shut down,” the AEJ said.

Zelensky Calls For a Global Rally Against the War in Ukraine

“Attacks on freedom of speech are nothing new to Vladimir Putin's regime. But after the bloody military invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a ‘special military operation,’ the noose around critical journalists and citizens has tightened into a situation where telling the truth is virtually criminalized. This is evidenced by the arrests of tens of thousands of Russian citizens and the closure of some of the last independent Russian media, such as Echo of Moscow and Dozhd TV. The legendary newspaper Novaya Gazeta, whose editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, has decided to continue working despite a de facto ban on broadcasting reality as it is. Dmitry Muratov said he would give his Nobel Prize for refugees from Ukraine.

And yet, the truth finds a way to make its way, even in the most unexpected places. Let's remember Marina Ovsyannikova, the journalist from the Russian Channel One - one of the main blades of Kremlin propaganda, who dared to appear on the air of the central evening news on state television with a poster ‘No war. Stop the war. Don't believe the propaganda. They are lying to you here. Russians against war’.

Russian Journalist Detained for Calling for an End to the War in Ukraine

The actions of Ovsyannikova, as well as thousands of Russians who find original ways to express their position against the war, show that in times of total darkness, it is very important to be active and to oppose evil. That is why we call on you to join the march and show that Bulgarians support peace and the Ukrainian people in their just fight against Vladimir Putin's criminal aggression”, the Association of European Journalists said.

Sofia's Independence square was filled up by people, urging for the military actions to stop. The demonstration, organized on Facebook, is mottoed ""Together for Ukraine"".

""We have gathered in support of Ukraine and against the Russian aggression and Vladimir Putin's aggression. Some say that the Russian people are not Putin, but who elects him? I have been to Ukraine on a humanitarian mission, as well as other missions, and have no words to describe this aggression,"" Ivan Belishki, a rescuer from the central town of Panagyurishte, told BTA.

""We are protesting against the unconventional methods of war, the use of cluster munitions and other prohibited ammunition,"" he further said.

The organizers call on people not only to support Ukraine, but also Bulgaria's Euro-Atlantic orientation.

The march, the first since the start of the war, gathered together Bulgarians, Ukrainian refugees, as well as Russians and other foreigners supporting Ukraine against Russia. According to estimations, the number of people was similar to that of the biggest protests ever held in the country.

“Praise Ukraine! Praise heroes!”, ""Putin, Shoygu, Lavrov, welcome to the Hague"", “Putin khuilo [penis]” and “Russian war ship, go f*ck yourself!” were among the most chanted along with the Ukrainian state anthem.

“Oh, it was beautiful! We had it all and we were so many,” 12-year old A. M., a refugee from Mykolaiv, said.

She was laughing for the first time since her escape from the war along with her mother and sister.

“I am proud of all Bulgarians who have come today,” Elisaveta Belobradova, MP of Democratic Bulgaria, wrote on Facebook after the rally.

The gathering was organised by several individuals and not backed officially by political formations. Its organisers called on people to stand together to show Ukrainians that Bulgaria is supporting them in their war for their homeland.

The rally took place on the day when Nato decided to strengthen its Eastern flank and send more troops to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

People were calling on their government to take more decisive steps to support Ukraine, sending much-needed military aid. The government in Sofia is refraining from that, claiming that the risks are too high as it is too close to the war zone.

President Rumen Radev went even further, saying that Ukraine is much better armed than Bulgaria and that Sofia must make efforts to obtain more defence equipment instead of sending it to Ukraine.

On the other hand, Radev expressed support for Nato’s decision to send troops to Bulgaria, saying they would add to the battle group the authorities are forming.",https://www.bne.eu/tens-of-thousands-march-in-bulgaria-to-support-ukraine-239266/
