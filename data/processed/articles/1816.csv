1:43 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Sorry to keep you waiting. Good afternoon. The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity.

This is a premeditated attack. Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months, as I’ve been — as we’ve been saying all along. He moved more than 175,000 troops, military equipment into positions along the Ukrainian border.

He moved blood supplies into position and built a field hospital, which tells you all you need to know about his intentions all along.

He rejected every good-faith effort the United States and our Allies and partners made to address our mutual security concerns through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering.

For weeks — for weeks, we have been warning that this would happen. And now it’s unfolding largely as we predicted.

In the past week, we’ve seen shelling increase in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

Rus- — the Russian government has perpetrated cyberattacks against Ukraine.

We saw a staged political theater in Moscow — outlandish and baseless claims that Ukraine was — Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war against Russia, that Ukraine was prepared to use chemical weapons, that Ukraine committed a genocide — without any evidence.

We saw a flagrant violation of international law in attempting to unilaterally create two new so-called republics on sovereign Ukrainian territory.

And at the very moment that the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for Ukraine’s sovereignty to stave off invasion, Putin declared his war.

Within moments — moments, missile strikes began to fall on historic cities across Ukraine.

Then came in the air raids, followed by tanks and troops rolling in.

We’ve been transparent with the world. We’ve shared declassified evidence about Russia’s plans and cyberattacks and false pretexts so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.

Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.

Today, I’m authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia.

This is going to impose severe costs on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.

We have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our Allies.

And I want to be clear: The United States is not doing this alone. For months, we’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half of the global economy.

Twenty-seven members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy — as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and many others — to amplify the joint impact of our response.

I just spoke with the G7 leaders this morning, and we are in full and total agreement. We will limit Russia’s ability to do business in Dollars, Euros, Pounds, and Yen to be part of the global economy. We will limit their ability to do that. We are going to stunt the ability to finance and grow Rus- — the Russian military.

We’re going to impose major — and we’re going to impair their ability to compete in a high-tech 21st century economy.

We’ve already seen the impact of our actions on Russia’s currency, the Ruble, which early today hit its weakest level ever — ever in history. And the Russian stock market plunged today. The Russian government’s borrowing rate spiked by over 15 percent.

In today’s actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets.

We’ve cut off Russia’s largest bank — a bank that holds more than one third of Russia’s banking assets by itself — cut it off from the U.S. financial system.

And today, we’re also blocking four more major banks. That means every asset they have in America will be frozen. This includes V.T.B., the second-largest bank in Russia, which has $250 billion in assets.

As promised, we’re also adding names to the list of Russian elites and their family members that are sanctioning — that we’re sanctioning as well.

As I said on Tuesday, these are people who personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies and they should share in the pain. We will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days ahead.

On Tuesday, we stopped the Russian government from raising money from U.S. or European investors.

Now, we’re going to apply the same restrictions to Russia’s largest state-owned enterprises — companies with assets that exceed $1.4 trillion.

Some of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russia’s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come.

Between our actions and those of our Allies and partners, we estimate that we’ll cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.

It will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military. It’ll degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program. It will hurt their ability to build ships, reducing their ability to compete economically. And it will be a major hit to Putin’s long-term strategic ambitions.

And we’re preparing to do more. In addition to the economic penalties we’re imposing, we’re also taking steps to defend our NATO Allies, particularly in the east.

Tomorrow, NATO will convene a summit — we’ll be there — to bring together the leaders of 30 Allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance.

Although we provided over $650 million in defensive assistance to Ukraine just this year — this last year, let me say it again: Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east.

As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power. And the good news is: NATO is more united and more determined than ever.

There is no doubt — no doubt that the United States and every NATO Ally will meet our Article 5 commitments, which says that an attack on one is an attack on all.

Over the past few weeks, I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to NATO.

On Tuesday, in response to Russia’s aggressive action, including its troop presence in Belarus and the Black Sea, I’ve authorized the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO’s eastern flank Allies: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania.

Our Allies have also been stepping up, adding — the other Allies, the rest of NATO — adding their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defense.

And today, within hours of Russia’s unleashing its assault, NATO came together and authorized and activated — an activation of response plans.

This will enable NATO’s high-readiness forces to deploy and — when and where they’re needed to protect our NATO Allies on the eastern boundaries of Europe.

And now I’m authorizing additional U.S. forces and capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO’s response, including some of U.S.-based forces that the Department of Defense placed on standby weeks ago.

I’ve also spoken with Defense Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, about preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our NATO Allies and support the greatest military Alliance in the history of the world — NATO.

As we respond, my administration is using the tools — every tool at our disposal to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pump.

You know, we’re taking active steps to bring down the costs. And American oil and gas companies should not — should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits.

You know, in our sanctions package, we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.

We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption. We have been coordinating with major oil producing and consuming countries toward our common interest to secure global energy supplies.

We are actively working with countries around the world to elevate [evaluate] a collective release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of major energy-consuming countries. And the United States will release additional barrels of oil as conditions warrant.

I know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting. I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump. This is critical to me.

But this aggression cannot go unanswered. If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.

Let me also repeat the warning I made last week: If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.

For months, we have been working closely with our private — with the private sector to harden their cyber defenses, sharpen our ability to respond to Russian cyberattacks as well.

I spoke late last night to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I assured him that the United States, together with our Allies and partners in Europe, will support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country. We’ll provide humanitarian relief to ease their suffering.

And in the early days of this conflict, Russian propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a made-up threat.

But history has shown time and again how swift gains in territory eventually give way to grinding occupations, acts of mass civil — mass civil disobedience, and strategic dead-ends.

The next few weeks and months will be hard on the people of Ukraine. Putin has unleashed a great pain on them. But the Ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence, and they have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.

This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for the freedom around the world. Putin has a — has committed an assault on the very principles that uphold global peace.

But now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin — and his Kremlin allies are really all about. This was never about genuine security concerns on their part. It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary — by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause.

Putin’s actions betray his sinister vision for the future of our world — one where nations take what they want by force.

But it is a vision that the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power.

The United States and our Allies and partners will emerge from this stronger, more united, more determined, and more purposeful.

And Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly — economically and strategically. We will make sure of that. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage. Any nation that countenances Russia’s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

Liberty, democracy, human dignity — these are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression. They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies. They cannot be erased by people — from people’s hearts and hopes by any amount of violence and intimidation. They endure.

And in the contest between democracy and autocracy, between sovereignty and subjugation, make no mistake: Freedom will prevail.

God bless the people of a free and democratic Ukraine. And may God protect our troops.

Q President Biden —

THE PRESIDENT: Associated Press, Zeke.

Q Chris Megerian. So, do you have any plans to speak with President Putin at this point? And what interactions have you had with the Russian government?

THE PRESIDENT: I heard the first part: Do I have any plans to speak with Putin at this point. And what?

Q What communications have you had with the Kremlin as far as military (inaudible) in Ukraine and making sure this does not spiral into a larger conflict?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, it’s a large conflict already. The way we’re going to assure it’s not going to spiral to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the Eastern European nations that are members of NATO. NATO is more united than it’s ever been.

And I have no plans to talk with Putin.

Wall Street Journal, Tarina [Tarini].

Q Mr. President, you didn’t mention SWIFT in your sanctions that you announced. Is there a reason why the U.S. isn’t doing that? Is there disagreement among Allies regarding SWIFT and whether Russia should be allowed to be a part of it?

THE PRESIDENT: The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence — maybe more consequence than SWIFT — number one.

Number two, it is always an option. But right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take.

Cecilia Ve- — Vega, ABC.

Q Thank you, sir. Sir, sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point. What is going to stop him? How and when does this end? And do you see him trying to go beyond Ukraine?

And a second question I’ll just give to you now: This statement that he gave last night will — that the We- — the threat that he gave — the West “will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.” Is he threatening a nuclear strike?

THE PRESIDENT: I have no idea what he’s threatening. I know what he has done, number one.

And number two, no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening. That has to sh- — this is going to take time. And we have to show resolve so he knows what’s coming and so the people of Russia know what he’s brought on them. That’s what this is all about.

This is going to take time. It’s not going to occur — he’s going to say, “Oh my God, these sanctions are coming. I’m going to stand down.”

He’s going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together. And we will. We will and it will impose significant costs on him.

Q Will he go beyond Ukraine, sir? Do you see him going beyond Ukraine?

Q Mr. President — Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT: (Points to reporter.) Yes.

Q Thank you. Two topics, just really quick. First, markets are down and gas prices are up. I know you always stress the difference between Wall Street and Main Street, but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain. How economically painful is it going to get for people in this country?

And I do have one more question.

THE PRESIDENT: First of all, there’s no doubt that when a major nuclear power attacks and invades another country that the world is going to respond and markets are going to respond all over the world. So, there’s no doubt about that, number one.

Number two, the notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely, as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions we’re going to impose on Russia, period.

What’s your next question? I’m sorry.

Q The next question is: Did you underestimate Putin? And would you still describe him the way that you did in the summer, as a “worthy adversary”?

THE PRESIDENT: At the time, he was — I made it clear he was an adversary, and I said he was “worthy.” I didn’t underestimate him.

And I’ve read most of everything he’s written. Did you read the — I shouldn’t sa- — I’m not being a wise guy. The — you heard the speech he made — almost an hour’s worth of speeches — why he was going into Ukraine.

He has much larger ambitions in Ukraine. He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is about.

And I think that his — his ambitions are — are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.

Q President Biden — President Biden —

Q And — and with that — with his ambitions, you’re confident that these devastating sanctions are going to be as devastating as Russian missiles and bullets and tanks?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Russian bullets, missiles, and tanks in Ukraine. Yes, I am.

Q Thank you, President Biden. If sanctions cannot stop President Putin, what penalty can?

THE PRESIDENT: I didn’t say sanctions couldn’t stop him.

Q But you’ve been talking about the threat of these sanctions for several weeks now —

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but the threat of the sanctions and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different things.

Q Okay, but —

THE PRESIDENT: They’re two different things. And we’re now going to — he’s going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions.

Q And what will that do — how will that change his mindset here, given he’s attacking Ukraine as we speak?

THE PRESIDENT: Because it will so weaken his country that he’ll have to make a very, very difficult choices of whether to continue to move toward being a second-rate power or, in fact, respond.

Q You said, in recent weeks, that big nations cannot bluff when it comes to something like this. You recently said that the idea of personally sanctioning President Putin was on the table. Is that a step that you’re prepared to take? And if not —

THE PRESIDENT: It’s not a bluff; it’s on the table.

Q Sanctioning President Putin?

THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

Q Why not sanction him today, sir? Why not sanction him today, sir?

Q Mr. President —

Q Mr. President, if I can, you detailed some severe and swift new sanctions today and said the impact it will have over time, but given the full-scale invasion, given that you’re not pursuing disconnecting Russia from what’s called “SWIFT” — the international banking system — or other sanctions at your disposal, respectfully, sir, what more are you waiting for?

THE PRESIDENT: Specifically, the sanctions we’ve imposed exceed SWIFT. The sanctions we imposed exceed anything that’s ever been done. The sanctions we imposed have generated two thirds of the world joining us. They are profound sanctions. Let’s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they’re working.

Yes.

Q Let me ask you about — can I ask you about Zelenskyy? Sir, you spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday, sir, if I could follow up —

Q What’s the risk that we are watching the beginning of another Cold War? And is there now a complete rupture in U.S. and Russian relations?

THE PRESIDENT: There is a complete rupture right now in U.S.-Russian relations if they continue on this path that they’re on.

And in terms of a Cold War, that depends. You have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what he’s doing — from Asia to South America to Europe to acr- — around the world.

And so, it’s going to be a cold day for Russia. The idea — you don’t see a whole lot of people coming to his defense.

Q And are you — are you — if I could follow-up, sir. Are you urging China to help isolate Russia? Are you urging China to help isolate Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: I’m not prepared to comment on that at the moment.

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

Q Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT: Wait. No, no. (Points to reporter.) Yeah.

No, no, no. He’s had his hand up a long time.

Q Thank you, Mr. President. How concerned are you that Putin wants to go beyond Ukraine into other countries and the U.S. will have to get involved if he moves into NATO countries?

THE PRESIDENT: Well, if he did move into NATO countries, he will be involved — we will be involved. The only thing that I’m convinced of is: If we don’t stop now, he’ll be emboldened. If we don’t move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened.

Look, you know, every — well, anyway.

Q And can you talk anything more about your conversation —

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

THE PRESIDENT: I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.

Q Sir, India, which is a major defense partner of the United States — is India with — fully with you on the issue of Ukraine and Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: Does the Defense Department of the United States —

Q Sir, India is one of your major defense partners. Is India fully in sync with United States on Russia?

THE PRESIDENT: We’re going to be — we’re in consultation with — with India today. We haven’t resolved that completely.

Q One more question —

(Cross-talk by reporters.)

THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you all very much. Thank you.

2:05 P.M. EST",https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/02/24/remarks-by-president-biden-on-russias-unprovoked-and-unjustified-attack-on-ukraine/
1,de744c8a-deda-48b7-9ee8-6dcfaad6e2ce,"['Jeremy Herb', 'Donald Judd', 'Phil Mattingly']",2022-02-23 00:00:00,"(CNN) US President Joe Biden condemned Russia's ""unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces"" in a statement Wednesday evening following explosions in Ukraine.

The US and allies are planning on Thursday to trigger the ""full scale"" of the sanctions that have been discussed over the last several weeks in response to the attack, according to a senior Biden administration official.

""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,"" Biden said. ""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.""

The White House statement came in response to explosions across Ukraine, including in the capital of Kyiv. Shortly before the explosions began, Russian President Vladmir Putin announced a ""special military operation"" and called for Ukraine's ""demilitarization"" in televised remarks.

An adviser for the interior minister of Ukraine, Anton Gerashchenko, said Russia's ""invasion has begun"" with ""missile strikes on Kyiv,"" in an official WhatsApp group with journalists.

The early assessment from the US is that this is the start of the full Russian invasion, according to a senior US official familiar with the latest US intelligence. The source said the belief is that the explosions heard near Kyiv and Odessa are likely missiles, while those around Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine are likely artillery, given the proximity to the border.

Biden held a secure call with members of his national security team from the White House Wednesday evening, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted . Biden was joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, she said.

Biden also spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In a statement on the call, Biden said he briefed Zelensky ""on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the United Nations Security Council.""

""He asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin's flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine,"" Biden said.

In an address Thursday morning in Ukraine, Zelensky said he was introducing martial law across the country and urged Ukrainians to remain calm.

""No panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything,"" he said. ""We will win over everybody because we are Ukraine.""

Biden said that he planned to speak to his G-7 counterparts and would give a speech to the American people on Thursday. He said he intended to announce ""further consequences"" that the US and its allies planned to impose on Russia over ""this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security.""

""We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance,"" Biden said.

While the administration official declined to lay out specifics, the US has planned to target Russia's two largest banks, as well as other financial firms, and has prepared to deploy export controls to cut off Russian access to critical Western technology for entire Russian economic sectors.

Additional members of Putin's inner circle and their families are also likely to be targeted.

Discussions were ongoing late Wednesday evening between US and European officials about the final shape of the package, the official said. It will also be a topic of discussion at the virtual G-7 meeting that has been scheduled, the official said.

US officials remain on high alert for any cyber activity against key domestic targets including banks and critical infrastructure, the official said.

Biden's national security team plans to brief the House and Senate in separate, unclassified phone calls Thursday on the situation in Ukraine. Lawmakers from both parties roundly condemned Russia's actions in statements Wednesday and called for the US to ramp up sanctions against Moscow.

UN meeting as explosions begin

The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on Wednesday evening in New York -- offering a remarkable split screen as the diplomats delivered speeches at the same time Putin's speech aired on Russian television and the explosions began in Ukraine. Ukraine's Ambassador to the United Nations

Sergiy Kyslytsya directly questioned Russia's representative in his speech.

""About 48 minutes ago, your President declared war on Ukraine,"" Kyslytsya said. ""You declared the war. It is the responsibility of this body to stop the war.""

US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield spoke for a second time as the UN meeting was nearing an end, stating Putin had ""delivered a message of war"" while the Security Council was meeting. She said the US would introduce a resolution in the UN on Thursday.

""At the exact time as we are gathered in the Council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war in total disdain for the responsibility of this council,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

As the final speaker of the meeting, Kyslytsya turned his attention again to Russia's UN ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, who was acting as president of the Security Council.

""I welcome the decision of some members of this council to meet as soon as possible to consider the necessary decision that would condemn the aggression that you launch on my people,"" Kyslytsya said. ""There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell, Ambassador.""

Nebenzya shot back by claiming Moscow wasn't being aggressive against the Ukrainian people but against the ""junta"" in power in Kyiv, before hastily gaveling an end to the UN meeting.

Franco Ordoñez, Brian Naylor | NPR

President Biden issued a new round of economic sanctions Thursday meant to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for attacking Ukraine.

""Putin is the aggressor,"" Biden said in remarks at the White House. ""Putin chose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequences.""

Biden said the U.S. will block four additional Russian banks, including the two largest — Sberbank and VTB — from having access to the U.S. financial system and limit Russia's ability to import Western technology. He said the actions will hamper Russia's ability to do business ""in dollars, pounds, euros and yen.""

""The U.S. stands up to bullies,"" Biden said. ""We stand up to freedom.""

Biden repeated that U.S. troops will not be deployed to Ukraine, but reiterated that he has sent ""thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland"" to protect NATO's eastern flank. Biden said NATO will convene a summit on Friday and that ""we'll be there to bring together the leaders of 30 allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity.""

""This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe,"" Biden said.

""If we don't move against him [Putin] now with these significant sanctions, he will be in Poland,"" Biden predicted.

Biden said he understood the effects on Americans of Russia's invasion

Biden vowed that he ""will do everything in my power to alleviate the pain"" that Americans are feeling at the gas pump as oil prices spike. But, he said, ""this aggression cannot go unanswered.""

Biden said that the U.S. and its allies would not take the step of keeping Russia from using the SWIFT system for global banking transactions because Europe did not want to, but he said it would be held in reserve.

Putin, he said, ""has much larger ambitions than Ukraine,"" adding that he thinks the Russian president wants to reestablish the Soviet Union. ""If we don't move against him now with these significant sanctions,"" Biden said, ""he will be emboldened.""

The White House has been saying for weeks that its threat of sanctions was aimed at deterring an invasion. But on Thursday, Biden said the sanctions were not expected to prevent one. Instead, he said, it would take time to have the intended impact: weakening Russia's economy.

Biden also again warned Putin against conducting cyberattacks against U.S. companies and infrastructure, vowing ""we are prepared to respond.""

Biden said Putin ""will be a pariah on the international stage""

Biden said he spoke Wednesday night with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and promised him the U.S. would provide humanitarian aid. Biden said Putin has ""unleashed a great pain"" on the Ukrainian people.

This morning, I met with my G7 counterparts to discuss President Putin’s unjustified attack on Ukraine and we agreed to move forward on devastating packages of sanctions and other economic measures to hold Russia to account. We stand with the brave people of Ukraine. pic.twitter.com/dzvYxj7J9w — President Biden (@POTUS) February 24, 2022

The Treasury Department said in a statement that on a daily basis, Russian financial institutions conduct about $46 billion worth of foreign exchange transactions globally, 80% of which are in U.S. dollars. ""The vast majority of those transactions will now be disrupted,"" according to the statement. ""The Russian financial institutions subject to today's action can no longer benefit from the remarkable reach, efficiency, and security of the U.S. financial system.""

Payments for energy will be allowed, the Treasury Department confirmed, as well as payments for agricultural and medical commodities.

Six Russian individuals were added to the sanctions list — two banking executives and four family members of other officials deemed close to Putin.

New sanctions take aim at cutting Russia off from critical technology

The Commerce Department on Thursday unveiled its new export controls for Russia, saying that semiconductors, computers, telecommunications, information security equipment, lasers and sensors would be subject to the new bans. In addition, 49 Russian military end users were added to a control list.

The department said similar measures would be taken by the EU, Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, and that more countries were expected to join.

Thursday's sanctions follow measures Biden announced Tuesday. The first wave of sanctions against Russia targeted two Russian financial institutions along with the government's ability to access Western financing. There were also sanctions against the Russian-owned company building the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline.

Biden has warned that these were the first ""tranche"" of sanctions and that the administration would ratchet up the response based on Russia's next steps. Senior administration officials say the group of Russian elites and their family members who are being sanctioned have ""shared in the corrupt gains of the Kremlin, and they will now share in the pain.""

Meanwhile, the administration and bipartisan members of Congress have been discussing providing additional assistance to Ukraine and allies and partners.",https://www.capradio.org/articles/2022/02/24/biden-is-expected-to-announce-new-sanctions-after-russia-attacks-ukraine/

The update from Biden comes as a wave of ongoing air strikes and Russian troop deployments have led to dozens of deaths across Ukraine, which Putin claimed he has no plans to occupy after “recognizing” rebel-held eastern regions and falsely suggesting the former Soviet republic isn’t a sovereign nation.

On Thursday morning, Putin announced plans to demilitarize and “denazify” Ukraine — a claim that experts quickly denounced as preposterous, as Russian troops and tanks poured into a country with a democratically elected Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

“There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell,” Sergiy Kyslytsya, the Ukrainian Ambassador to the United Nations, told the U.N. Security Council, in remarks directed at his Russian counterpart Wednesday night as airstrikes started to pound his country.

60 The Russian Invasion of Ukraine

Biden’s address can be watched here at MassLive through the above White House YouTube feed.

Ukraine won its independence in 1991.

Earlier this week, Putin asserted that Ukraine only exists because of Russia, which belies both countries’ long and complex histories and is at odds with the international community’s recognition of Ukraine.

Russia had ramped up its military presence around Ukraine’s borders for months, claiming to conduct military exercises and denying it planned any invasion.

U.S. intelligence officials, Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Pentagon leaders increasingly warned for weeks that the Kremlin planned to use disinformation and propaganda as a pretext for war.

On Thursday morning, Putin claimed that the newly “recognized” Russian-backed republics in Eastern Ukraine requested Russia’s help to face Ukrainian aggression, and that in response he’d decided to conduct a “special military operation.” U.S. officials and European leaders say there was no Ukrainian aggression and point to Russia’s unprovoked military buildup and continued false statements from the Kremlin.

Zelenskyy said he tried to call Putin days ago to re-engage in diplomacy, but Putin never responded. Zelenskyy pledged to fully defend Ukraine, which is not a member of the European Union or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The Biden administration and European allies have already announced punishing economic sanctions for Russia, which also was hit with severe sanctions after it rolled into the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and took control of the region from Ukraine.

Putin warned Western leaders Thursday: “To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside — if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.”

Biden on Thursday morning met with the Group of 7 conference of industrialized nations to discuss the joint response to the unprovoked attack.

“The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces,” Biden said Wednesday night. “President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.”

In a statement provided by the White House after a phone call with Zelenskyy, Biden said again that he’d pledged severe sanctions against Russia and continued support for the Ukrainian people.

“[Zelenskyy] asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin’s flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine,” he said.
