The remarks were made by US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield at a press avail in Bucharest, Romania on Monday.

She said she is returning to New York on Tuesday to start the process.

“I am immediately returning back to New York to do two things. One — I will take this to the Security Council tomorrow morning and address Russia’s actions firmly and directly,” she said.

Observing that 140 United Nations (UN) member states have already voted to condemn Russia over its unprovoked war and the humanitarian crisis it has unleashed upon the people of Ukraine, Thomas-Greenfield said Russia should not have a position of authority in that body, nor should the international community allow Russia to use their role on the Council as a tool of propaganda to suggest they have a legitimate concern about human rights.

“In fact, we see everyday, including yesterday, heartbreaking reports about how little they care about human rights. Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce. It hurts the credibility of the Council and the UN writ large. And it is simply wrong. Which is why we believe it is time for the UN General Assembly to suspend them,” she asserted.

Later in an interview with NPR, the senior official said the move is more than symbolic, and it does have force because it continues what they have started, and that is to isolate Russia and to call them out for what they are doing.

“They have a narrative that what they are doing is normal. This is not normal. They will hear from the entire world that we will not continue to allow their misinformation and propaganda to be used on a UN platform,” she said.

“We are continuing to look at every option we have on the table to call Russia out, to isolate Russia, to unify the world against Russia. And in fact, I think we have been extraordinarily successful in unifying the world.

“I do not think he expected that Nato would unify in the face of his extraordinary atrocities. But he is seen that he has — he actually has succeeded in unifying us, something I do not think he wanted to do,” Thomas-Greenfield said.

During the news conference, the US Ambassador to the United Nations said there is a need to isolate Russia in the UN Security Council.

“Sitting on the Security Council, I know exactly what we can do and what we have done. We have isolated Russia on the Security Council. And while they have a veto power, they cannot veto our voices. They cannot veto the unity that we have established in the Security Council and, more broadly, in the UN General Assembly. So, they can continue to spout their propaganda, but no one believes it and no one is listening to them,” she added.",https://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-russia-suspension-un-human-rights-council-7853233/

Speaking in Romania, Washington's envoy to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the United States would seek Russia's suspension from its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council amid growing signs of war crimes in Ukraine.

""Russia's participation in the Human Rights Council is a joke,"" said Thomas-Greenfield in Bucharest, quoted by The National News April 5.

""And it's wrong, which is why we believe it's time the UN General Assembly voted to remove it.""

Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was quick to back the move, saying Russia could not remain a member of the UN Human Rights Council, after the discovery of mass graves and the heinous massacre in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb.

Russia has faced global outrage over alleged killings of civilians in northern Ukraine, where a mass grave and tied-up bodies shot at close range were found in Bucha, which was retaken from Russian troops over the weekend.

Yesterday, US President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal and called for a war crimes trial.

""You may remember I was criticized for calling Putin a war criminal. Actually, we saw that happening in Bucha, this guarantees him, he is a war criminal,"" said President Biden.

The US is seeking a vote on Russia's suspension at the 193-member UN General Assembly this week. This is because a two-thirds majority is needed to suspend a country because it continues to commit gross and systematic violations of human rights.

Previously, the UN General Assembly had twice voted to condemn Russia for its aggression in Ukraine.

Some 140 anti-Moscow votes in the two polls exceeded the two-thirds threshold, but it remains unclear whether UN members will support Russia's expulsion from the Human Rights Council.

""My message to the 140 countries who are bravely standing together is this: the picture of Bucha and the devastation across Ukraine requires us to match our words with actions,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

Separately, Moscow denies attacking civilians in a military operation it says is necessary to prevent the NATO military alliance from expanding eastward. Moscow denies any violence against civilians as alleged, saying the so-called atrocities were engineered.

Russia's Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva Gennady Gatilov said the US initiative was unlikely to succeed. He said Washington was ""exploiting the Ukraine crisis for its own benefit"" and to isolate Russia, according to Reuters.

Moscow has experienced some resistance at the United Nations since it invaded neighboring Ukraine on February 24. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described it as ""morally unacceptable"" and called for an independent investigation into the deaths in Bucha.

The UN Human Rights Council has condemned the reported rights abuses by Russian troops and launched an investigation to hold perpetrators accountable. The United Nations International Court of Justice in The Hague has ordered Russia to halt the invasion, saying it has no justification.

Meanwhile, Russia and the four other permanent members of the UN Security Council, the UK, France, China, and the US, all currently have seats on the 47-member human rights council. The US rejoined the chamber this year.

Foreign Minister Truss said he urged allies to go further in tackling Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying the money was still flowing from the West to Vladimir Putin's 'war machine'.

Together with Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Warsaw, he said: ""It is the responsibility of the UK and our allies to increase our support for our brave Ukrainian friends.""

""That means more weapons and more sanctions. Putin must lose in Ukraine. This weekend the G7 foreign ministers and NATO foreign ministers will meet. We need to announce a new wave of tough sanctions,"" he said.

""The images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us to now match our words with action,"" U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a tweet Monday.

""We cannot let a member state that is subverting every principle we hold dear to continue to participate"" in the council, she said. A vote on Russia's suspension could be held by Thursday, according to the U.S.

""Given strong evidence of war crimes, including reports of mass graves and heinous butchery in Bucha, Russia cannot remain a member of the UN Human Rights Council. Russia must be suspended,"" said British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.

Russia reacted furiously. ""This is unbelievable,"" said Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the UN. ""What the West is trying to do with Russia, trying to exclude it from multilateral forums we are having in the world... this is unprecedented.""

""This will not facilitate or encourage or be helpful to what is happening between Russian and Ukrainians in peace talks,"" he said.

Journalists over the weekend found corpses in civilian clothes, some with their hands bound, in the town of Bucha outside Ukraine's capital after Kyiv's forces retook it from Russia's army.

Bucha Mayor Anatoly Fedoruk said many ""were shot, killed, in the back of the head.""

The scale of the killings is still being pieced together, but Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova said 410 civilian bodies had been recovered so far.

The UN's human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said the images from Bucha point to ""possible war crimes.""

The Kremlin denied Russian forces killed civilians, and alleged that the images of dead bodies in Bucha are ""fakes.""

Suspending Russia from the council would require a vote in favor by two-thirds of the UN General Assembly.

Abstentions are not taken into account in the required two-thirds majority, which the United States and Britain believe they can secure.

Such an action has been taken in the past against Libya.

Asked at the daily UN press briefing about UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' position on suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council, his deputy spokesman Farhan Haq appeared embarrassed.

""We will leave it to the member states to decide,"" he said.

""What the worry has been on this side is the precedent being set,"" he added, declining to explain further.

""Russia should not have a position of authority in that body, nor should we allow Russia to use its seat on the Council as a tool of propaganda to suggest they have a legitimate concern about human rights,"" said Thomas-Greenfield.",https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/04/05/us-britain-to-seek-russias-suspension-from-un-rights-council-a77208
3,2f708d73-c2df-4459-9e3d-30fe7fab0536,"['Edith M. Lederer', 'The Associated Press']",2022-04-06 00:00:00,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. General Assembly will vote Thursday on whether to suspend Russia from the U.N.’s premier human rights body. The move was initiated by the United States in response to the discovery of hundreds of bodies after Russian troops withdrew from towns near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, sparking calls for its forces to be tried for war crimes.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the call for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council in the wake of videos and photos of streets in the town of Bucha strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians. The videos and reporting from the town have sparked global revulsion and calls for tougher sanctions on Russia, which has vehemently denied responsibility.

“We believe that the members of the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine, and we believe that Russia needs to be held accountable,” Thomas-Greenfield said Monday. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce.”

General Assembly spokeswoman Paulina Kubiak said Wednesday the assembly’s emergency special session on Ukraine will resume at 10 a.m. EDT on Thursday when the resolution “to suspend the rights of membership in the Human Rights Council of the Russian Federation” will be put to a vote.

While the Human Rights Council is based in Geneva, its members are elected by the 193-nation General Assembly for three-year terms. The March 2006 resolution that established the Human Rights Council states that the assembly may suspend membership rights of a country “that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.”

The brief resolution to be voted on expresses “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, particularly at the reports of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation, including gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights.”

To be approved, the resolution requires a two-thirds majority of assembly members that vote “yes” or “no.” Abstentions don’t count.

The General Assembly voted 140-5 with 38 abstentions on March 24 on a resolution blaming Russia for the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and urging an immediate cease-fire and protection for millions of civilians and the homes, schools and hospitals critical to their survival.

The vote was almost exactly the same as for the March 2 resolution the assembly adopted demanding an immediate Russian cease-fire, withdrawal of all its forces and protection for all civilians. That vote was 141-5 with 35 abstentions.

Thomas-Greenfield said Monday that her message to the 140 members who voted in favor of those two resolutions to support Russia’s suspension from the Human Rights Council is simple: “The images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us now to match our words with action.”

“We cannot let a member state that is subverting every principle we hold dear to continue to sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council,” she said.

Supporters of the resolution are optimistic about its approval, though not necessarily with the support of 140 countries.

Russia asked an unspecified number of countries to vote “no,” saying an abstention or not voting would be considered unfriendly and would affect bilateral relations.

In its so-called “non-paper” obtained by The Associated Press, Russia said the attempt to expel it from the Human Rights Council is political and being supported by various countries to preserve their dominant position and control over the world and continue “the politics of neo-colonialism of human rights” in international relations.

Russia said its priority Is to promote and defend human rights, including multilaterally in the Human Rights Council.

Russia’s ambassador in Geneva, Gennady Gatilov, called the U.S. action “unfounded and purely emotional bravado that looks good on camera -- just how the U.S. likes it.”

“Washington exploits the Ukrainian crisis for its own benefit in an attempt either to exclude or suspend Russia from international organizations,” Gatilov said, in comments relayed by a Russian diplomatic mission spokesman.

Russia and the other four veto-wielding permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — Britain, China, France, and the United States — all currently have seats on the Human Rights Council, which the U.S. rejoined this year.

The only country to have its membership rights stripped at the council was Libya in 2011, when upheaval in the North African country brought down longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi, said council spokesman Rolando Gomez.

No permanent member of the Security Council has ever had its membership revoked from any U.N. body.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

Thomas-Greenfield made the call for Russia to be stripped of its seat in the Human Rights Council in the wake of reports over the weekend about violence against civilians in the town of Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, after Russian forces pulled out. The reports have sparked a wave of outrage and condemnation against Russia.

“We believe that the members of the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine, and we believe that Russia needs to be held accountable,” Thomas-Greenfield said at a press conference in Romania’s capital, Bucharest.

The U.S. ambassador called Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council a “farce” that “hurts the credibility of the council and the U.N. writ large” and is “simply wrong.”

The 193-member U.N. General Assembly in New York has final say, and any resolution to strip Russia of its membership rights would require support from two-thirds of member countries who vote.

Thomas-Greenfield said her message was simple to the 140 assembly members who voted last month to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: “The images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us now to match our words with action.”

“We cannot let a member state that is subverting every principle we hold dear to continue to sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council,” she said.

Russia and the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — Britain, China, France, and the United States — all currently have seats on the rights council which the U.S. rejoined this year.

In New York, General Assembly spokeswoman Paulina Kubiak said on Monday that no request for a meeting on the issue has yet been received.

Russia’s ambassador in Geneva shot back by calling the U.S. statement “(b)aseless, unfounded and purely emotional bravado that looks good on camera — just how the US likes it.”

Referring to the General Assembly, Gatilov said the U.S. effort “is unlikely to be supported by the majority of its member states.”

Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in Bucha and other towns around Kyiv that have been recaptured from Russian forces in recent days.

Thomas-Greenfield said she would go to the Security Council on Tuesday on her return to New York to “address Russia’s actions firmly and directly.”

The U.S. ambassador mentioned the U.S. plan during a bilateral meeting with Romania’s Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca, whose government she praised for its “extraordinary effort” in receiving hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine. More than 600,000 refugees have fled to safety in Romania since Russia launched its attacks.

Thomas-Greenfield also visited the Romanian capital’s main train station where she met with humanitarian workers helping to receive refugees.

Thomas-Greenfield’s visit to Romania came a day after she met with leaders in Chisinau, Moldova’s capital, where she announced that the U.S. will give the country $50 million (45 million euros) “to help the Government of Moldova and its people cope with the impacts of Russia’s brutal and unprovoked war.”

Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of around 2.6 million — has so far received around 400,000 refugees from war-torn Ukraine.

Russia must be suspended. — Liz Truss (@trussliz) April 4, 2022

Russia has faced global outrage over civilian killings in north Ukraine, where a mass grave and tied bodies shot at close range were discovered in Bucha, which was recaptured from Russian forces over the weekend. Moscow says the so-called atrocity was staged.

US President Joe Biden on Monday called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal and called for the holding of a war crimes trial.

""You may remember I got criticised for calling Putin a war criminal. Well, the truth of the matter – we saw it happen in Bucha – this warrants him – he is a war criminal,"" Mr Biden said.

The US is seeking a vote on Russia’s suspension at the 193-nation UN General Assembly this week.

A two-thirds majority is needed to suspend a country for persistently committing gross and systematic violations of human rights.

The General Assembly has twice voted overwhelmingly to censure Russia for its aggression in Ukraine.

The roughly 140 anti-Moscow votes in those two polls exceeded the two-thirds threshold, but it remains unclear whether UN members will back ejecting Russia from the rights chamber.

Nobody @UN thinks that you automatically get all 140 states that voted for previous UNGA resolutions to back HRC suspension, although the horrific images from Bucha will surely boost support.

""My message to those 140 countries who have courageously stood together is: the images out of Bucha and devastation across Ukraine require us to now match our words with action,"" said Ms Thomas-Greenfield.

Dr Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE President, said on Twitter that the ""horrific"" scenes from Bucha highlighted the need for ""an immediate ceasefire"" and called for an end the ""worsening humanitarian crisis"".

""The UAE plays its part in providing relief to those affected in Ukraine, and encourages a diplomatic approach to confront this crisis through an urgent political solution,"" he said.

Moscow has denied attacking civilians in a military operation that it says is necessary to prevent the eastward expansion of the Nato military alliance.

Russia's ambassador to the UN in Geneva Gennady Gatilov said the US initiative was not likely to succeed. He said Washington “exploits the Ukraine crisis for its own benefit” and to isolate Russia, according to Reuters.
