Bombardments predicted to continue: Britain's Ministry of Defence said Saturday in its latest intelligence update that Russia prefers “indiscriminate” bombardments and will likely continue using “heavy firepower” on urban areas.

In a video address on Friday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country's military had dealt ""powerful blows"" to Russia.

Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu held an official meeting on Saturday, state media reported, to discuss maintaining the supply of advanced weapons for the conflict.

On the ground: Russian troops have entered the city of Slavutych, north of Kyiv — a move that sparked protests among hundreds of Ukrainian civilians. Slavutych was built for workers at the Chernobyl nuclear plant after the 1986 disaster left the area uninhabitable.

The Russian military on Saturday also claimed new missile strikes on military targets in western, central and southwestern Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have staged a counteroffensive in areas around Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv, according to local officials.

Biden in Poland: After meeting with Ukrainian officials in Warsaw, US President Joe Biden is now holding talks with Polish President Andrzej Duda.

Biden is set to meet with Ukrainian refugees and will give a ""major address"" later in the day, according to the White House.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-26-22/h_93499623b0eb15a2472ccd22a83ab04a

CNN's Don Lemon is at the site of an industrial facility used for fuel storage in Lviv, Ukraine, where a blazing fire and thick black smoke are rising.

""According to the mayor, he believes it is a Russian military strike on this facility,"" Lemon reported.

Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said that ""habitable infrastructure was not injured,"" in a tweet confirming the burning of the facility. Firefighters and first responders are on the scene. Residents of a nearby neighborhood are also outside waiting for more information.

Sadoyvi advised residents to continue staying in shelters until the air alarm stops.

Lemon and his team were pushed back because there is concern about another explosion, he said.

5,9fa22a20-8d7e-46b6-a79a-c176a12d1d8c,[],,"The last No. 1 seed remaining in the men’s NCAA tournament is in line to be the favorite.

The Kansas Jayhawks are the final top seed alive ahead of their game against No. 4 Providence on Friday night. Baylor lost in the second round to North Carolina and the tournament’s top two seeds lost on Thursday night. Gonzaga fell to Arkansas while Arizona lost to Houston.

Kansas is a 7.5-point favorite against the Friars and is now +400 to win the NCAA tournament. The Jayhawks are the No. 2 favorite behind Houston despite still having to play their Sweet 16 game while Duke is third to win the tournament at +450.

A KU win means Kansas will likely be at +300 or better to win the tournament later Friday night. If you’re confident that the Jayhawks will get it done Friday night and win the tournament, we strongly encourage you to make that bet before the odds get shorter.

Friday night’s first game is the biggest spread of the evening. St. Peter’s is a 12.5-point underdog to Purdue and is in line to make history with a win. No No. 15 seed has ever made the Elite Eight. The other two No. 15s to make the Sweet 16 — Florida Gulf Coast and Oral Roberts — lost in their third game of the tournament.

St. Peter’s is facing a huge mismatch in Purdue center Zach Edey. The 7-4 sophomore scores 14.5 points in just 19 minutes per game. He’ll be the focal point of Purdue’s offense when he’s on the court, especially since the Peacocks’ top three forwards are all listed at 6-foot-7.

Both late games Friday night have much smaller spreads than the early games. UCLA is a 2.5-point favorite over North Carolina and Miami is a 2.5-point favorite over Iowa State.

The Bruins are aiming for back-to-back Final Four appearances and would potentially be a bigger favorite with a healthy Jaime Jaquez. He’s hoping to play on Friday after spraining his right ankle in the second round.

Jaquez (14 points per game) is the team’s second-leading scorer behind Johnny Juzang and leads the team in rebounds. If he’s not at full strength, North Carolina could have a significant advantage, especially if it can get out and run against the Bruins.

Story continues

Iowa State enters its game as an underdog as it looks to win more games in this year’s NCAA tournament (3) than it did through the entirety of the 2020-21 season (2). An Elite Eight run for the Cyclones — and a potential matchup with Kansas — would be a phenomenal accomplishment for a team that was one of the worst in college basketball.

Miami will rely heavily on its five starters against the Cyclones. All five of Miami’s starters play over 30 minutes a game as the Hurricanes love to go with a four-guard lineup alongside forward Sam Waardenburg.

Miami’s starters scored all but seven points against USC in the first round and all but four points in the team’s upset of Auburn in the second round. If Iowa State can somehow get Miami to rely on its bench — something easier said than done so far this tournament — it has a great chance.

76ers visit Clippers, Mavs face Wolves

There are seven NBA games on Friday night as the league takes its customary March backseat to college basketball before the playoffs become the focus of the basketball world for the next three months.

The biggest game of the night is Dallas’ trip to Minnesota. The Mavericks and Timberwolves are both aiming to avoid the play-in tournament in the Western Conference. Dallas is 3.5 games ahead of Minnesota in the standings and the Mavericks currently sit in fifth. The Wolves are in seventh and a game behind Denver for the final guaranteed spot in the playoffs.

Minnesota is a 2.5-point favorite against the Mavericks.

The Clippers host the 76ers and are 5.5-point underdogs on Friday night. Los Angeles is going to be in the play-in tournament while Philadelphia will likely do what it can to avoid the No. 2 seed in the East and a potential first-round matchup with the Brooklyn Nets.

The 76ers are currently 1.5 games out of first and a half game out of second. Finishing third in the East is a possible matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round — and a much more appealing scenario than facing Brooklyn right away.

Match play bracket decided Friday

Friday at the WGC Dell Technologies Match Play is always fun. The final set of round-robin matches is on the docket before the 16-player match play bracket is decided. We could see some three-hole playoffs to decide the groups on Friday afternoon as players end their pods with the same record.

Players like Patrick Cantlay and Bryson DeChambeau are already eliminated from contention through the first two days of the tournament and Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, Xander Schauffele and Scottie Scheffler each need to win and get some help to advance.

Who cashed tickets on Thursday?

BetMGM was thrilled with Gonzaga and Arizona losing. The two teams were the most bet to win the title at the sportsbook and combined for nearly 20% of bets and over 27% of the handle wagered on the champion. They were two of BetMGM’s three biggest liability.

The biggest liability remaining for the book is Duke. The Blue Devils were the third most-bet team at the book and will continue to be popular as long as they’re in the tournament.",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/the-daily-sweat-kansas-the-last-no-1-seed-remaining-is-in-line-to-take-over-favorite-status-115526333.html

7,9fa22a20-8d7e-46b6-a79a-c176a12d1d8c,[],2022-03-26 00:00:00,"Nights are spent huddling underground from Russian strikes pounding their encircled city into rubble. Daylight hours are devoted to hunting down drinkable water and braving the risk of standing in line for the little food available as shells and bombs rain down.

In the second month of Russia’s invasion, this is what now passes for life in Chernihiv, a besieged city in northern Ukraine where death is everywhere.

It isn’t — yet — quite as synonymous with atrocious human suffering as the pulverized southern city of Mariupol. But similarly blockaded and pounded from afar by Russian troops, Chernihiv’s remaining residents are terrified that each blast, bomb and body that lies uncollected on the streets ensnares them in the same macabre trap of unescapable killings and destruction.

“In basements at night, everyone is talking about one thing: Chernihiv becoming (the) next Mariupol,” said 38-year-old resident Ihar Kazmerchak, a linguistics scholar.

He spoke to The Associated Press by cellphone, amid incessant beeps signaling that his battery was dying. The city is without power, running water and heating. At pharmacies, the lists of medicines no longer available grow longer by the day.

Kazmerchak starts his day in long lines for drinking water, rationed to 10 liters (2 1/2 gallons) per person. People come with empty bottles and buckets for filling when water-delivery trucks make their rounds.

“Food is running out, and shelling and bombing doesn’t stop,” he said.

Nestled between the Desna and Dnieper rivers, Chernihiv straddles one of the main roads that Russian troops invading from Belarus used Feb. 24 for what the Kremlin hoped would be a lightning strike onward to the capital, Kyiv, which is just 147 kilometers (91 miles) away.

The city’s peace shattered, more than half of the 280,000 inhabitants fled, according to the mayor, unable to be sure when they’d next see its magnificent gold-domed cathedral and other cultural treasures, or even if they still would be standing whenever they return. The mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko, estimates Chernihiv’s death toll from the war to be in the hundreds.

Russian forces have bombed residential areas from low altitude in “absolutely clear weather” and “are deliberately destroying civilian infrastructure: schools, kindergartens, churches, residential buildings and even the local football stadium,” Atroshenko told Ukrainian television.

On Wednesday, Russian bombs destroyed Chernihiv’s main bridge over the Desna River on the road leading to Kyiv; on Friday, artillery shells rendered the remaining pedestrian bridge impassable, cutting off the last possible route for people to get out or for food and medical supplies to get in.

Refugees from Chernihiv who fled the encirclement and reached Poland this week spoke of broad and terrible destruction, with bombs flattening at least two schools in the city center and strikes also hitting the stadium, museums and many homes.

They said that with utilities knocked out, people are taking water from the Desna to drink and that strikes are killing people while they wait in line for food. Volodymyr Fedorovych, 77, said he narrowly escaped a bomb that fell on a bread line he had been standing in just moments earlier. He said the blast killed 16 people and injured dozens, blowing off arms and legs.

So intense is the siege that some of those trapped cannot even muster the strength to be afraid anymore, Kazmerchak said.

“Ravaged houses, fires, corpses in the street, huge aircraft bombs that didn’t explode in courtyards are not surprising anyone anymore,” he said. “People are simply tired of being scared and don’t even always go down to the basements.”

With the invasion now in its second month, Russian forces have seemingly stalled on many fronts and are even losing previously taken ground to Ukrainian counterattacks, including around Kyiv. The Russians have bombed the capital from the air but not taken or surrounded the city. U.S. and French defense officials say Russian troops appear to have adopted defensive positions outside Kyiv.

With Russia continuing to strike and encircle urban populations, from Chernihiv and Kharkiv in the north to Mariupol in the south, Ukrainian authorities on Saturday dismissed statements from the Russian military suggesting that it planned to concentrate its remaining strength on wresting the entirety of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region from Ukrainian control. The region has been partially controlled by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.

“We cannot believe the statements from Moscow because there’s still a lot of untruth and lies from that side,” Markian Lubkivskyi, an adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister, told the BBC. “That’s why we understand the goal of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin still is the whole of Ukraine.”

That skepticism was underscored hours later when explosions rocked Lviv, a city in western Ukraine about 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the Polish border where an estimated 200,000 displaced Ukrainians have taken refuge.

Among them is Olana Ukrainets, a 34-year-old IT worker from Kharkiv.

“When I came to Lviv, I was sure that all these alarms wouldn’t have any results,” Ukrainets told the AP from a bomb shelter after the blasts. “Sometimes when I heard them at night, I just stayed in bed. Today, I changed my mind and I should hide every time. … None of the Ukrainian cities are safe now.”

The strike happened as U.S. President Joe Biden was visiting Poland, which has taken in far more Ukrainian refugees than any other country.

Britain’s defense ministry said Saturday that it doesn’t expect a reprieve for citizens of Ukraine’s bombarded cities anytime soon.

“Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties,” the U.K. ministry said.

Previous bombings of hospitals and other nonmilitary sites, including a theater in Mariupol where Ukrainian authorities said a Russian airstrike is believed to have killed 300 people last week, already have given rise to war crimes allegations.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, appearing by video link at Qatar’s Doha Forum, on Saturday compared the destruction of Mariupol to the Syrian and Russian destruction wrought on the city of Aleppo.

The invasion has driven more than 10 million people from their homes, almost a quarter of Ukraine’s population. Of those, more than 3.7 million have fled the country entirely, according to the United Nations. Thousands of civilians are believed to have died.

In Chernihiv, hospitals are no longer operating, and residents cook over open fires in the street because the power is out. The utility workers who stayed behind aren’t enough to repair the broken powerlines and restore other essential services, and time has become a blur, the mayor said.

“We live without dates and days of the week,” Atroshenko told Ukrainian television.

Ever since a Russian blast hit a Stalin-era movie theater next to his 12-story residential building, Kazmerchak, the linguistics scholar, has been spending his nights in a bomb shelter. A Russian missile also destroyed the hotel not far from his house.

“The walls were shaking so much,” he said. “I thought my house would collapse any minute and I would be left under the rubble.”",https://robetnews.com/2022/03/26/shelled-city-in-north-ukraine-fears-becoming-next-mariupol-world-news/
