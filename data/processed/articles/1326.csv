Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has reportedly told Boris Johnson that the next 24 hours will be crucial as he leads the defence of his country against the invasion by Russia.

Mr Zelenksy made the comments in a phone call with the the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday evening, reports the BBC.

A UK government spokesperson said that, during the call, Mr Johnson praised Mr Zelensky's leadership since Russia's invasion.

Mr Johnson added the UK would do all it can to make sure defensive aid from the UK and its allies reaches Ukraine.

A Ukrainian delegation is due to meet the Russians “without precondition” on Monday on the border with Belarus, although Mr Zelensky has indicated he sees little prospect of any meaningful dialogue.

In the meantime, Russian and Ukrainian forces have again been engaged in heavy fighting ahead of the widely expected assault on the capital.

Earlier, Mr Johnson dismissed a dramatic announcement by Vladimir Putin that he was putting Russia’s nuclear forces on heightened alert as a “distraction” from the failure of his troops to breakthrough in Ukraine.

President Putin sent shock waves through Western capitals with his instruction on Sunday to his top military leaders to put the strategic nuclear deterrent on a “special regime of combat duty”.

The US said it was “completely unacceptable” while a senior US defence official was quoted as warning the Russian leader had made any “miscalculation … much, much more dangerous”.

It came on a day in which much of the world appeared to turn its back on Russia in revulsion at the invasion of neighbouring Ukraine.

At the same time the expected Russian assault on Kyiv again failed to materialise, while in the country’s second city, Kharkiv, the authorities claimed to have successfully driven out invading Russian troops.

Mr Putin’s increasing diplomatic isolation is expected to underline a rare special session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Monday called to discuss the crisis in Ukraine.

Mr Johnson said Mr Putin’s nuclear order appeared to be an attempt to divert from the fact that his efforts to re-make the post-Cold War order in Europe were failing.

“What’s actually happening is that they (the Ukrainians) are fighting back perhaps with more effect, with more resistance, than the Kremlin had bargained for,” he said during a visit to the Ukrainian Catholic Church in London.

Belarus reportedly approved in a referendum a new constitution renouncing the country’s non-nuclear status at a time when the country has become a launch pad for Russian troops invading Ukraine, Russian news agencies report. The move could theoretically allow Russia to place nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union. The package of constitutional reforms also extended the rule of leader Alexander Lukashenko.

High inflation is coming, as is an immediate lurch into recession.” Other market moves include a 5% jump in Brent crude oil and a more losses on Asian stock markets where Putin’s raising of the nuclear threat has spooked investors.
