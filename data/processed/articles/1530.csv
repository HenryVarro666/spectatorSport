Here's the latest:

Zelensky expects 'a firm, global response' to Kramatorsk: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to hold to account everyone behind the missile strike on a railway station in Kramatorsk, eastern Ukraine.

At least 50 people, including five children, were killed at the station which was being used by civilians trying to flee the fighting, Ukrainian officials said Friday.

Russia accused of war crimes: International leaders including the European Parliament President Roberta Metsola say the missile strike in Kramatorsk and other attacks on civilians in Ukraine constitute war crimes.

Speaking to CNN on Friday, Metsola said the attacks were: ""International war crimes being committed against sovereign people who are simply fighting for democracy and for their country.”

Ukraine expects huge new onslaught: The military governor of the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine said Russian forces are preparing for a ""massive breakthrough"" attempt in Donbas.

The UK's Ministry of Defence said some of the Russian troops that have withdrawn from northern Ukraine will be transferred to eastern Ukraine to fight in Donbas but “many of the forces will require significant replenishment before being ready to deploy further east, with any mass redeployment from the north likely to take at least a week minimum.”

Ukrainian officials have urged residents of some cities in Donbas to evacuate in anticipation of what they say may be heavy fighting.

Rerouting evacuation corridors: The Ukrainian military said it was working to ""adjust"" routes for civilians following the strike in Kramatorsk.

Serhii Haidai, the military governor of Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region, said the attack meant changes were being made to the routes, but stressed that efforts to get people out of the region will continue: ""We are ready, we will continue to evacuate people.""

Odesa under curfew: Authorities in the southern region of Odesa have imposed a curfew for Saturday following the deadly strike in Kramatorsk. Residents have been told to stay home from 9 p.m. local time on Friday (2 p.m. ET) until 6 a.m. on Monday morning (11 p.m. ET Sunday night).

Russians still facing logistical issues: The US believes the Russian military has not solved “their logistics and sustainment problems,” a senior US defense official told CNN.

The official said those problems mean that they will be unlikely to be able to reinforce their forces in the eastern part of Ukraine “with any great speed.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-09-22/h_d5018cd47dc150ffb1624e02855ea8c9
1,55aa6e4b-8e0b-42cd-8853-348f81a396a0,[],,"Announcement Day 51. Hard day. There was the shelling of the public district in Kharkiv. 10 people died, and over 30 were injured. A 7-month-old baby was killed. And tomorrow in Kharkiv underground, where over 40000 of people are living for over month already will take place a show for kids from our puppet theater. My city. Pain and pride.

Today we were collecting medicine for over 100 people in different parts of the city. Tomorrow they will be dispatched from Poltava. Our partners in Kharkiv will provide food and I will bring some food from the village (another trip to the city, please think of us and wish us luck) and we will also buy some pet food. And then our driver will try to deliver everything to the places where it is so needed.

We don't know for how long it will last. It feels like it will not finish soon. We will need to build our lives somehow in current circumstances. Today my friend asked me - why don't you leave. You are too close to the war. I have a lot of reasons, really. I named over 7. But the main is - it's my home.

Thank you for all your help. We stand.



Day 50. 50 days of war. Still feels like nightmare, like a bad dream you can't wake up from. Still hurts. Every minute. Still scary. Every second.

In these 50 days thank to you we've spent over 50000 USD to help over 1000 people and our army. We delivered food, medicine, food for animals. We've bought bulletproof vests and helmets, walkie-talkies and cars, night vision devices, petrol and more and more.

And we will proceed. Another 20% discount on every item in our shop. All money except taxes and salaries will be used to help army, people an animals in Kharkiv. Thank you all for your support! We are tired, exhousted , angry, sad... And full of pain. And yet full of Hope.

Pray for Ukraine. We stand.

Day 49. Today was the day of crazy requests. Over 20 adress request for medicine, food and medicine for 51 person, food for 15 people and 20 cats and finally evacuation request for 160 (!!!) cats and 2 (!) people.

We will do our best to solve it all tomorrow.

Kharkiv is being attacked 49 days in a row. More people are trying to leave the city now. They wanted to stay, but their houses are destroyed, or their blocks are under instsnt shellings. The war concetrated in several regions and it looks like final battles are all ahead.

Thank you all for your help. Thank you for reading this. Each your message, comment, purchase, donate make us belive in our victory. Make me personally feel not alone.

We stand. Pray for Ukraine.

Day 48. Just an ordinary day. Wake up, tea, walk with the dog under the rain, kid's breakfast, start of kids school, delivery list for our driver, calls about night vision devices, organisation of the car Poltava-Kharkiv, new requests for help, buy of clothes for family in Kharkiv, buy of milk products in our village, trip to nearest city Valky to dispatch your packages, telephone call ""old dog needs to be delivered to the vet"", unplanned voyage to the tine village in the forest, 14 years old dog in the trunk, unplanned trip to Poltava with this dog, short meeting with driver on the roadside to load him with milk products for Kharkiv bomb shelters, vet.clinic, way home, phone calls, new requests, coffee, kid's homework, financial questions about night vision devices, traditional evening ""are you ok"" questions to all who is still in Kharkiv...

Plus one day. One day closer to the victory.



Thank you a for your help and support. Tomorrow will be a new day. We stand.

Day 47. I fell asleep, really tired from the day. In 2 hours I was woken up by my friend we live with. She was shaking my shoulder and whispering: sorry, I'm sorry, but listen. What is it? And my kids' voices: Mom, what is it, mom! We are scared!

It was thunder. And rain.

Meanwhile, we've got the news that in Mariupol chemical weapon was used. We don't know if it's true. But there are no limits in this war. No bottom line.

Today we delivered food and medicine for 19 people in the bomb shelter and for 7 families in one house in Saltivka. We've bought over 100 kg of cat and dog food to be delivered tomorrow. It's all possible because of you.

Thank you for all your help and support. We stand. God knows for how long.



Day 46. I don't know really how long we will last. It gets more difficult from day to day. Today tactic walkie-talkie and glasses were delivered. Yesterday we've delivered night vision device and pair of glasses to the beyond brave guy who will try to get to Mariupol. We've packed another big bunch of medicine for tomorrow delivery. My dad and my friend are going to Kharkiv tomorrow to bring more food... We work, we stand, but I don't know for how long we will have streFtngh.

We are still collecting money to buy several night vision devices and tactic bulletproof vests. Deadline is tomorrow. You can buy anything in our shop today with discount and all money will be used for this purchase. Thank you for your help. It means a lot! Pray for Ukraine.



Day 45. Today we delivered medicine and food for another list of people. Today we take 12 more requests for help, including one for people in the bomb shelter. They are living there already a month. Their homes are destroyed. Today we were buying drugs, dog food, and more and more. It all looks like a job now. An everyday job with no vacation. When we started to sell the first digital items here, we were thinking that we will collect something like a couple of thousands and transfer them to the army. Somehow it all turned out to direct help to people who are counting on us. Civilians, police, militaries, refuges. Our contribution is not huge, but it helps real people and sometimes saves real lives. Because of you and your help.

Today we got 54 usd. We do understand no one will keep donating to us forever. So please, check our shop. We've added more items, our beautiful sets I managed to take from Kharkiv. All with 20% discount. Choose something beautiful for you or your friend. And we will be able to buy night vision devices and protection for our boys who are holding all this world on their shoulders. Pray for Ukraine. We stand.

Day 44. Kramatorsk. Google it. When you think you saw everything in this war, they drop missiles on the railway station of the evacuating city. Hundreds of wounded. 50 people were killed. Among them - 5 children.

Exact that day my mom was traveling by train. She left for Lviv to visit my brother who got ill. She is still on her way. Pray for her safe trip. The scariest thing now: is they can shoot anywhere. No place in Ukraine is 100% safe now. Today two huge explosions were in the small city 15 km from our village. No military objects.

But we will stand. Kharkiv is being prepared for the next attack. Kharkiv will stand, I do believe in that.

Today we've sent to Kharkiv another very big pack of medicine and animal food. Last day we have a lot of requests for pet food. One old lady called me today. And asked for some food for the cat, and her neighbors left for her. And them also for three parrots. Also from neighbors. And then, only at the end of our talk, she said quietly: and could you please bring something for me? Yes, sure, what do you need? Just something to eat...

We can help all these people because of you. Thank you! Every purchase means so much.

We still need to collect about 10000 Euro to buy night visors for the army. We will run a sale for all products in the shop for this weekend. ALL MONEY FROM ALL ITEMS will go right for this purchase.

Pray for us. We stand.











Day 42-43. Hi there, and sorry for the long silence. We had a very hard two days. The situation in the region is very tense. Kharkiv is getting ready to another attack. We've heard explosions very close to our village. But we are safe now.

The most important case of these two days was today's delivery of food and medicine to the village next to Kharkiv. This village is in the ""gray zone"". It means it's situated between our army and occupants. The situation there was extremely hard. Over 50 people were without food and medicine. No shops are working. No volunteers wanted to go there, because it's too dangerous. Finally, we've managed to contact the police and militaries, we found a driver, we bought full tank of food: grain, potato, pasta, sausages, milk products and so on. We' bought drugs for 25 people. Soldiers made a corridor for us to get there. There were over 16 people involved. It was hard and risky. But we sucseed. You sucseed with us. Your help gave hope for these people. Not only hope, buy real possibility to stand and to live until victoty.

Thank you so much. It's all really matters. Pray for us. We stand.

Later, Mariya is ok - she has hard task to bring urgent food to the small village beside Kharkiv. She is on the way, please pray for her. Pray for Ukraine.



Day 41. All day long I was getting calls and messages from my friends from all parts of Ukraine and the world: Kharkiv is going to be attacked again. Kharkiv region is going to be attacked. Be ready to flee away. Keep the tank full of fuel. Keep an emergency kit under your bed. Are all of your close people evacuated from Kharkiv? Have you seen Bucha? Are you ready. Yes, dear, I'm ready. I'm always ready. Every moment. But I do believe I won't. My close people are not evacuated. Because every person is Kharkiv is now my family. And we will do everything to help our army to defend the city and all of us.

Our friend in Sweden has found very important military devices for us. They are extremely needed in Kharkiv. The amount of purchase is 26000 Euro. We already have a part of this money. But we need the full amount fast. We appreciate every cent. Check our direct PayPal in FB and IG.

Finally, we've made a total report of all expenses for these 40 days. It's already available on my personal FB (https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4764484587007905&id=100003392335115) in Ukrainian and we will publish it today on our IG in English. Thank you very much for all your help. We've made a lot with your support. Today we've made an extremely fast buy of medicine for Kharkiv military hospital. Tomorrow in the morning it will be in Kharkiv already. We donated 1000 USD for another car for volunteers. We are ready for another adress delivery tomorrow. Our friends in police will deliver medicine for a hot region of the countryside. We keep working. And we stand.

Day 40. In orthodox religion, there is a dogma that on the 40th day the soul of the dead raise up to Heaven and stands before God. 40 days ago our peaceful life was killed. Today we need finally say farewell to our lives as they were. Everything changed. Everything changed forever. All-day long we got new and new pictures from the Kyiv region. You can't express it with any human words. It's pain inside, burning like hell. Our mistake was not in thinking about russians like brothers. Our mistake was in thinking of them as humans.

Another hard and long day. News about a new planning attack on Kharkiv. Still blocked Mariupol. Destroyed Izum.

But despite all this - we proceed. Today we found our friend's mother and evacuated her with her cat to the safe area. We've bought another full trunk of medicine, also for a village near Kharkiv, where no humanitarian help gets. Our policemen will bring medicine and food there. We delivered medicine to another 14 addresses including the Kharkiv region, not only the city. We've sent by post food for dogs in just liberated Sumy region. Our friends in USA found for us tourniquets, thank you! It's lifesaving. Our friend in Sweden found a bundle of very important devices for militaries. We got the discount, however the amount is huge. We do really thank you for all the help. It was turned into medicine, food, protection, petrol. Today we ask for your help to get devices for our victory. Our boys stand for all of us.

Pray for Ukraine. We stand.

P.S. Tiny good news helping to stay alive. My dog turned 13 today. Wish him health and long peaceful life. And I finally managed to visit my horse and to bring some apples for all the horses there. I missed her so much.

Day 39. Today I have no words except these:

Bucha, Irpin, we will never forget.

We will never forgive.

Hundreds of dead bodies of civilians. Women and girls raped and murdered. Mass graves. Dogs killed for fun. Horses burned alive...



P.S. We had a trip to Kharkiv and will have another one tomorrow. I will tell all about them later. Thank you for all your help and for being worried. Pray for Ukrain.





Day 38. Somehow today turned out to be one of the hardest days for the last weeks. I feel tired and angry and lonely and frustrated and scared. The morning begun with news about missiles and explosions in peaceful Poltava and Kremenchug. These are places where my friend and volunteers of our group left from Kharkiv. They are all fine, but scared again. Our plans to go to Kharkiv were ruined because there were no electricity in the building we need to get to. We will try again tomorrow. My friend can't get in touch with his mom for 3 days. We were about to evacuate her from Kharkiv today, but we can't call her now. Tomorrow volunteers will try to find her. Good news about russian troops left Kyiv region were spoiled with dozens of photos of killed civilians. Women, old people, with tied hands, shot in theback. I can't stop thinking about Mariupol and people there. There is litirally nothing I can do to help there even with all money of the Earth. Hard day ...

We packed another dozen of medicine, food and supplies for address delivery. Tomorrow I will bring it all to Kharkiv. My car is loaded up to the roof. We've sent some food for animals. A women left Kharkiv with 15 saved there cats ...

All this is possible thanks to you. I will never stop to appreciate your donations and purchases here. They are life-saving.

Pray for us. Pray for Ukraine. Pray for Mariupol.

We stand.

Day 37. Another day. Warm, sunny and full of hopes. Our army freed several regions near Kyiv and Sumy. But situation is getting worse not far from Kharkiv. Today we ordered another 60 first aid kits, bought two huge packages of medicine, started to work on military uniform for our boys. Now we will work together with Kharkiv police. We will buy food and medicine and they will deliver it to the worse regions of Kharkiv and nearest villages. I've also dispatched today another packages with your orders. Small ukrainian gift inside. Wish them fast and safe trip.

Tomorrow I will have a trip to Kharkiv with my father. We will deliver food for one school where volunteers make hot food for people living nearby.

But the best part of the day was a package from our Aanastasiya. We managed to buy and send me 4 bulletproof vests and helmets and they are already delivered to the soldiers. But also she has sent me a box personally. Sweets, coffee, handcream and more. Hello from Germany....

It was like...like she hugged me. From far away.

I do hope we will meet soon in Kharkiv and hug each other for real. I wish only it happened soon...

Thank you for all your help! We stand. And we will.

Please, pray for our military and civilians in Mariupol...It's real disaster there and we can't help it ..

Day 36. Had a small trip to Poltava, to repair my car. Beautiful Poltava with hills, river, churches, historical buildings, legendary galushki-dumplings, coffee to go, our dear team member Tanya...And air alerts. They are so loud there.

I've bought 500 kg of vegetables for my friend in Kharkiv, who cooks in the building of school for over 300 people every day.

And I found some fresh radish for myself. Was soo happy)

Small things now can make you feel above the sky. Pack of thyroxine arrived, a message from friend in far away country: bought you some bullet proof glasses, btw do you need a thermal imager? Yellow flower on the sunny spot in the middle of the city, simple ""I'm ok"" in the messenger.

Today I found out the friend of my parents has lost his home in Lubotine. It's a small city satellite of Kharkiv. He came there like in save place comparing to Kharkiv itself. And it was. Until missile got right into his house. House is destroyed. One woman died. His wife is without consciousness, he is wounded. No military objects were nearby....Just house of the family.

Thank you for your help and support! It can't be overrated.

Every purchase in thus shop will be converted to direct help.

Read more in our FB and IG. We stand.



Day 35. Day of small victories. Today we've managed to buy and complect 120 tactic first aid kits for our militaries for 24 hours. Today we found, bought and delivered 4 antibacterial lamps for shelters with kids and army needs. For 24 hours too. Today we've bought and delivered to volunteers' center 100 kg of milk products and apples. 15 address packages with medicine are on their way to people in Kharkiv. Every day I think that maybe I should stop writing daily. But each day is whole life here. So I will proceed. And thank you for all your help. We stand.

Day 34. We are still here. Still alive. Still stand. My friends in Kharkiv clean streets. My friends in Lviv make masking nests. My friends in Europe looking for tacting medicine and bulletproof vests. (If you can help us with buying some stuff from Europe and USA - please contact us in messages). My friends in Kyiv open pharmacies. We do our best every minute. But it's too little. Because bombs are still falling on our cities. Yesterday my friend was on the highway and there was an explosion not far from him. As we found out later - it was the part of the missile shot down by our air defense. It's our life now. Routine. But I do beliver we will win. If not, then all the death and destruction was in vain. Thank you for your help and support. We bought another big party of medicine for the army. Now we are collecting money for tactic walkie-talkies for our military. Each dollar from you matters. All sales in our shop - both digital and physical items are used to win this war. Check our vintage items and Christmas ornaments. We will pack them carefully and send to your via Ukrposhta by land transport and planes from Poland. Pray for Ukraine. We are exsausted but we won't give up.



Day 33. The car of our driver is repaired. We've made extremely fast buy of medicine for our soldiers and delivered it to Kharkiv together with 20 jars of jam made here in the village. Every jar has an unique label drawn by local kids. Words of thank. On some of them was written ""Magic power elixir"". I wish so much we could make one real. To help our boys to expel occupants from our cities, our land, our country. I wish to wake up and to read in the news: it's over, you can go home. I don't know when it will come true.

Thank you for all your support. Every item in our shop will be transformed into medicine, bulletproof vests and helmets.

Thank you for standing with us. We stand.

Day 32. Well, it's time to admit that all this shit happening will not finish tomorrow. And the day after tomorrow. And in a week. It's a marathon and the sooner I will accept it the less frustrating it will be. Today was the Sunday. I realized it only because my kids didn't have any online classes. We delivered another batch of medicine and finally received so needed here l-thyroxine. The car of our brave driver broke. We don't know yet how serious it is. But our friend helped us and all requests for medicine were covered. Now we are looking for tactic medicine for our army and trying to make a big buy of different protection. We connected dozens of people in the logistic net. We helped another family to leave Kharkiv. The good thing I realized - almost everything is possible with people's help. The only thing that kills me - is that I can't buy a fighter jet. Thank you for your help and support. Every purchase in our shop - both digital or physical - it's your donation to our victory. We use all the incomes to cover small but urgent needs of military and civilians. Thank you! We stand.

Day 31. Today was the day to tell about. First of all - we managed to dispatch your packages. From Kharkiv under shellings to our temporary office in the village and then to the working post office in small city Valky. Now the packages are on the way to Poland, where they will be loaded on planes. Our thankfulness and small Ukrainian gift inside of each one.

Then we made a huge buy of food in our countryside and delivered it to logistic canter in Kharkiv and also of milk products for kids in bomb shelters. On the way back from Valky we found a lost dog, a tiny shpiz on the road. We took her home, fed, and left to rest. Then we made a trip to Kharkiv, delivered food and medicine, took some more ornaments from the office. There are more destroyed buildings, but at the same time, there are more cars and people on the streets. The roads are being cleaned, garbage is being removed, people are walking their dogs and cleaning poops. The city is alive. I want to get back so hard. Not today. Not tomorrow. But hopefully soon.

Thank you for your help! Every dollar is taking us closer to our victory. Pray for Ukraine. We stand.

P.S. The spitz Lily found her masters. Family with kids. Baby is home.

Day 30. Today many people in Ukraine write about the first day of the war. To remember. I will tell you about mine. I was in the Carpathian mountains, learning snowboarding. My kids were in Kharkiv with their dad. It was my first vacation without kids for 11 years. It was the last day before going home. I woke up at 6 a.m. and turned on my phone to check sales on Etsy and messages from friends. All over the FB were ""bombs, explosions, we were attacked"". It was like I didn't wake up. Like I'm in the middle of a nightmare. But I wasn't. I called my husband and heard - yes, it's true, kids are still sleeping. I called my dad I was on vacation with. His voice... Dad?! Yes, it's true. It's the war.

It was still dark outside. Right before the sunrise. I smoked. I couldn't cry. I couldn't think. I felt like an animal in the trap. I cursed myself for leaving my daughters. The phone was vibrating from messages. Kharkiv, Kyiv, Chernigiv, Kherson...

And then started my 24 hours-long way back to Kharkiv. I took only my backpack. From all the souvenirs I put there the jar of honey for girls. We were struggling home, changing trains, hearing jets above our heads in Kyiv, reading news again and again...

Today I played a board game with my girls and friends in our country house. Under the small lamp. In the room with closed with black fabric windows. While glass in windows was shivering from another shelling in the distance. Today I realized that it's my life now. For an undetermined period of time. My place is here. And I will do everything I can to get back home. Tomorrow will be another trip to Kharkiv. The food from the village is being waited. Wish us luck again. Think of us getting back home safe.

And thank you for your constant help. Yesterday we've bought medicine for over 1500 USD and tomorrow they will be delivered. Now we are trying to buy a big batch of protection for our warriors. My mom is making masking mesh. My grandmother bakes for military people and volunteers. My kids are drawing a bird that will protect us from the sky. We do all we can. And all this is thanks to you. Pray for Ukraine. Wish us victory.

Day 29. 24th of March. One month. Feels like one year. Feels like the whole another life, I'm living. 1 month, over 1000 rockets to Ukraine. Over 1000 destroyed buildings only in my city. Much over 1000 lives of my people.

Over 1000 donations in our shop. Thanks to you we made through this month. And we will stand. As long as it will be needed to bring our peacful country back.

Check detailed report about this month in our FB later.

Thank you for your help and support.



Day 28. As I promised, today was a rest day. We went to Poltava to meet our friends and at the same time our volunteer team. We took our kids and our Tanya organized for us and her son, who turned 6 a real birthday party. With cake and fun. We were in a peaceful city. We drank coffee in the street cafe. We laughed. For long 4 hours, we felt like we have normal lives. It was both amazingly happy and unspeakably sad. It was a quiet day in Kharkiv too. Only a few shelling and two downed russian planes. I want to keep this day in memory separately from all other 27 days of the war.

While resting we've managed to buy 7 more bulletproof vests and our driver Dima finally got one for himself. We've fulfilled now over 100 address help requests. We collected another batch of medicine to be delivered in Kharkiv and now looking for go pro cameras and protection glasses. Tomorrow will be a new day with more things to do. Thank you very much for your constant help. We do understand you will not donate us forever and we don't know when this war will be over. We took from Kharkiv more vintage stuff and all incomes from them, except salary of our stuff will be used for the same purposes. To help our army win and to help people stay alive until that. Thank you very much for standing with us.

We stand. And we will. Pray for Ukraine.



Day 27. Somehow this day turned out to be one of the hardest from the beginning. I woke up at 6, had breakfast at 7, and then managed to eat only late evening. My body is exhausted and today I just fell down in the middle of the day with a killing headache. Couldn't move. My mind is exhausted trying to keep everything in it, trying to decide what to do, trying to calculate possible variants. Mixed up a piece of logistic, almost have lost an important package, the delivery of medicine was delayed for a day because of me. My soul is exhausted too. It is so hard to believe in a happy end when you see Mariupol. And Izum. And Chernigiv. I found out that horses in one stable near the Kiyv burned alive. I miss my friends. I miss my home. I miss my cup in my kitchen. I miss my city. I miss my life. I will try to have a little rest tomorrow. Tomorrow will be better. We stand.

P.S. But we did a lot this day. And among other things - we've packed the first packages with your order and tomorrow I will bring them to the post office. Wish them a happy way.

Day 26. 624 hours of war. Today bomb fell in the village not far from ours. There is no air alert here, so our local mayor just wrote in chat: stay at home, be ready to go in shelter. We don't have a shelter here. Just a small cellar for potato. It was scary, but nothing happened. Meanwhile over 750 residential buildings were destroyed in Kharkiv. I don't know how to write here about all the hate in my heart now. They came here and took our homes, our friends, our life as it was. Please, don't wish us peace. Wish us victory.

And thank you so much for each purchase here. All money both for digital and physical items will be used for one goal. We will be selling out our collection as long as we it will be needed.

We have already spent over 15000 USD for food, medicine, protection, evacuation, cars, petrol etc.

Thank you from all heart.

I don't know how long it will last. But now - we stand. Stand with us and pray for Ukraine.



Day 25. We were in Kharkiv and we are back safe. Thank you for your thoughts and prays. The City today was like a small wounded bird. With broken wing and burnt feathers but willing to live. Streets are being cleaned while bombs and rockets are falling down. We were passing through the houses in city center with broken windows. My favorite cafe with missing front window. Free access inside - nothing touched. My neighbours in the house where our office is situated - came to help me pack some stuff. They are like one family now, helping each other to went through another day. I managed to take away some more ornaments, some instruments, packing materials. My wooden suitcase I'm makin all photos on. And flower in the pot. I fed pigeons on the window. We also brought full trunk of food for volunteers, and some sweets for our driver and some milk for old people. Today I felt really frustrated closing the door. But I do beliver I'll be back. I took only a tiny piece of our work and life. You just can't pack everything in the trunk. You can't pack feeling home. Short before last Christmas, we've managed to get a very rare vintage glass ornament. Chernomor. The knight from old fairytail. I was about to take it with, but then suddenly changed my mind. I left this figurine on the table. Protect our office, Chernomor. Protect all 50000 ornaments I left. And we'll be back. Thank you for your everyday help and your donations. We do our best to use them wisely. Today we registered help request #100. And this number changed to 110 by now. Over 80 of them are fulfilled. People are getting medecine, food, supplies, protection. And a lot of request we are solving without counting. Help with evacuation, transport, logistics. My contacts in messangers doubled at least. We have friends in all districts of our country and abroad trying to help. Thank you all. We stand. Pray for Ukraine and our victory.

Day 24. Today was the first day of the real spring sun. We did the enormous quantity of things. Found rare medicine, delivered food and drugs to Kharkiv and our amazing driver brought them to people in Saltivka, the worst and most dangerous district in Kharkiv. My dad and my friend are now on duty at the checkpoint here. We've bought body armor and helmets for them and other guys on the checkpoint. 4 sets of protection cost over 2500 USD. And we were able to find them only in Munich. My granny and kids made us vareniki. We returned some Christmas ornaments in our shop. A small and tiny piece of our collection. Tomorrow I will try to get to Kharkiv again and to bring some more. Think of us and pray for us being safe during this trip. Thank you for your help. We wouldn't be able to do all of this without your help. This are good news. And bad news are - nothing is over yet. The enemy proceeds to kill our people and destroy our homes. Chernigiv, Melitopol, Izum, Kharkiv - these cities are being erased right now. Our army do impossible things, but they are coming closer and closer. I'm so afraid I will need to run further. But for now - we stand. Pray for Ukraine.



Day 23. Paradox. The days feel really short now. Morning, phone check of all friends and family. Alive? Yes. Thank God. Computer. New help requests, logistics, search. Buy and deliver food. Computer again. Phone calls. New help requests. Food, medicine, armor... Phone calls. Messages. And then - it's late evening. Short days and at the same time - it feels like one endless day - 24th of February. It's still cold here and no signs of spring. Like time stopped. Today we've bought a big pack of fabric. Blue and yellow. For flags. These are not victory flags yet. These are flags for coffins of our soldiers.

Thank you for your help. We proceed with the daily delivery of food and medicine. We buy cars for volunteers, protection for our guardians and everyday care products for civilians in Kharkiv. We do our best feeling it's too little. Thank you for being with us. We stand. It's so hard, but we stand.

Day 22. My favorite number. 22. Today, russian bombs fell on the hugest market in Ukraine, situated in Kharkiv. Seven hectares are now in fire. In the middle of the city. Black smoke everywhere. Black sky. But all my thoughts today about Mariupol. About city theater. You know that there were two huge words KIDS on the ground near the theater. They were visible from the sky. And still the bombs fell. I thought the hate in me was already on the maximum level. But it looks like there are no limits. We proceed with our work. Today we've bought another batch of medicine for civilian and donated for a big batch of tactic medicine. We delivered two boxes of army shoes to Kharkiv for our guardians. We helped a mother-to-be with all needed for a birth giving. Drop in the ocean of pain. But it may save someone's life.

Thank you for your help, messages, support, words, donations! This feeling that we are not alone can't be described in words.

P.S. Takeshi, you are amazing. Thank you.

Day 21. Three months ago I was crying about my life being hard. Kids, schools, work, daily routins... Three weeks ago I was crying about my life being changed. Evacuation, appartment left, all my stuff...Three days ago I was crying about buildings. Destroyed city center, parks, cafe. Today I know the only reason to cry is people. My old friend died today in Kharkiv. Volunteer, he was delivering food in all districts of the city. His car got under the shelling. He has daughter same age as mine left. Today the world fell apart.

Thank you for all your help. Not everything can be solved by money, unfortunately. I would gave all money of the world to bring Yura back. I can't. But thanks to you I will buy more medicine and protection tomorrow. And it will save some other lives. And we will stand. For Yura. For all others, who gave their lives. Pray for Ukraine.

Day 20. Even spring is getting late here. Snow, wind, frosty mornings. Spring is waiting for victory. And we do. Yesterday was another delivery of medicine and food for old and abandoned people in Kharkiv. And we finally bought a car for volunteers. GAZelle:). I'll post photos later in FB and IG. Yesterday I activated some listings. All the physical items in the shop are now here in my hands and we are able to dispatch them from the city nearby. Ukrposhta is working and we do believe you will get your orders soon and safely. If not - we will make a full refund. Thank you for your help! Yesterday we've transferred: 500 usd - for dog food, 500 usd for medicine, 1000 usd for the army, 1000 usd for food purchase. Stand with Ukraine.

Day 19. The day I went to Kharkiv. I was really afraid to go there. Not because of the danger of shelling. I was afraid to see my city in ruins. But you know what? It's wounded, but it's alive! Under the blue sky I saw the city, with cars and people, not as many as usual, but like in early Sunday morning of peaceful time. We delivered a full truck of food for my volunteer-friends and for abandoned people in Saltivka, most suffered part of the city and also for the neighbors in the house, where our office is. While we were unloading, there was a laud explosion nearby. Nobody even stopped). People, who stayed in Kharkiv have nerves of steel. Later we found out that it has been a historical building in two blocks from us. Then I got to our office. I opened the door and freeze. Everything was like usual. Like, I just came to work in the morning. Blue slippers. Camera. Kettle to make coffee. Unpacked orders and ornaments. Ornaments everywhere. I cried. I wanted to close the door to keep this small piece of previous life safe. But I couldn't. We need to start work somehow. To help our families and our guardians. Your donations are precious and we will spend every cent for help. But we can't live on your help. We need to work. Thank you for your help and support. For your feedback and personal messages. We stand. And we will.

P.S. We left Kharkiv safely. And after we left the whole day and night were the hardest shelling from the beginning of war. Over 600 multistory residential buildings are destroyed. Malls, parks, theaters, old historical buildings. Military objects as they are. Pray for Ukraine. Close the sky. More in our FB.

Day 18. Another day. Another 1000 of phone calls. Another batch of medicine. Another trunk of food. Tomorrow I'm going to Kharkiv with my father. Wish us luck and a safe sky. We will deliver food to volunteers and hopefully will get into our office. If everything will be ok - we will try to get some stuff from it and to relaunch our work. We are waiting for a car for our army and for another for volunteers. If we will be able to buy them - it will help a lot of people. All this is possible thanks to you. Thank you for your amazing support. We stand. Pray for us. Pray for Ukraine. Pray for the whole world.

p.s. I'm so tired today. Deadly. But tomorrow it will be better. I hope.

Day 17. Today was the day of the hardest decision in my life. I was about to send my kids with their granny to Bratislava, to the ballet school. But they said no. They said they will stay with me trying to help. My brave daughters. 9 and 11 y.o. And I agreed and kept them here, by me. We will stay together and we will proceed with our attempts to make the peace in our country closer. Nastya is now in Germany with her kids and she is trying to keep our shop alive attending flee-markets and finding there beautiful things for you. All money for digital items in our shop (2000 USD today) will be used to help people and the army. Today we've bought more bulletproof vests and some dog food. Tomorrow we will try to buy a car for the delivery of food and everything needed to Kharkiv. Volunteers are lack cars and it will be so useful. Thank you all for being with us these days. Check our FB for photos and detailed info. Pray for Ukraine. We stand.

Day 16. Today was a very difficult day. We've delivered medicine and food to over 30 people, who are still in kharkiv. Another box of insuline is on the way from Lviv. I'm here, I'm alive. I will write more detailed report tomorrow, please forgive me for lack of words. Thank you for your help. It gives hope. To me and to many people we can help.



Day 15. Two weeks are behind. Looks like a whole life. How many are ahead? Today is deadly freezing here. Cold wind. Snow. I'm allergic to frost and my thumbs look like sausages. All I can think about now is how lucky I am. I'm still alive, I'm in my country in my own country house. My kids and parents and even cats and dog are here with me. A couple of my friends we share a house with are here for me to talk and to cry and to laugh (yes, we still can laugh). My kids sleep in the beds their grandpa made. No shellings, just sounds of explosions far enough. I have a change of underwear and access to the shower. We have food. And thanks to you we can share this food and our time and efforts with those, who are less lucky. You transferred us 1100 USD this day. We managed to buy bulletproof vests for brave forester who guard to board of small village. We made an impossible ride over 3 cities to collect medicine and tomorrow it will be in Kharkiv. We bought 16 pair of army shoes for volunteers and rescuers. We made a lot today. We made so little. Thank you so much, for this possibilty to be helpful. To do something to help our army and people to save our lives and our country. Pray for Ukraine. P.S. Check our FB for photos and detailed reports. P.S.2. For these two weeks in Kharkiv were destroyed 400 of the apartment house and a lot of administrative buildings...

Day 14. While I'm writing this we can hear the explosions. Far away from us, but the window glasses are shivering. It's scary, however, our friends, who came from Kharkiv barely react. They say - it's tooooo far, don't worry. Can you get used to war? No. But you can get used to shelling. Today we've collected 1300 USD. The amounts are getting smaller and we do understand this. Even the most unfair war can't be on the cover forever. We are enormous grateful for every dollar you've donated. Today your money helped to save an old couple from the small village near Kharkiv, to buy a big batch of medicine and the most important to get 30 walkie-talkies for rescuers in Kharkiv. Thank you so much. We stand and we will.

Day 13. I'm really tired today. But tired good. We've managed to bring the precious freight of insulin and other medicine to Poltava. Tomorrow it will finally be in Kharkiv. It was an almost impossible quest 5 days and nights long. We bought a pack of big bottles for petrol to deliver to Kharkiv and paid the petrol itself for tomorrow. We delivered a big batch of farm products to hospitals in Kharkiv. Our goal is to help exact people and to cover small urgent needs. It was a really long day. Another day we've survived. From tomorrow we will publish a report of all our expenses on our FB. Check our profile. Tomorrow I will show you what 100 USD here looks like. In my city today was a quiet day. Only a couple of air attack alerts. Today we laught in evening at our small country shelter for 9 adults, 3 kids, 6 cats and an old dog. We stand and we will stand. Thank you very much for your support. It can't be overrated. Your money is saving lives here. Right now. We got over 1700 USD this day. God bless you. And pray for Ukraine.

Day 12. Today came the understanding that it will not end soon. And that nobody will come to save us. No superman in shining armor will fall from the sky to stop rockets and to take all these troops back to russia. We are alone here. We have only us. And we need not only to survive but to win. Because if we won't it will mean all these deaths and tragedies all these destroyed cities and ruined lives were wasted. Today I realized I will not leave this country. Until there will be no direct danger for my kids I will stay here trying to do something, trying to help. Oh my, I love to travel so much. And now the whole world is open. Free tickets, no visas. Friends from all over the world are ready to give us shelter. And all I want now is to come back to my city and to wipe streets and to paint houses. All I want is to be sure all my friends are safe.

Saying we are alone here I meant the governments of other countries. Not you. Support of you, strangers from far away countries is something that helps us not to give up. It's a shoulder when we are falling. Thank you for your donation. We've got over 3000 USD this day. Thanks to them we've managed today to rescue an abandoned old man from the most dangerous district of Kharkiv. In several hours we will load the car to Kharkiv with another batch of supplies. We do what we can. And we stand. Stand with us.



Day 11. We work hard. Today we've managed to organize delivery of food for animals in Kharkiv under air attack. We've organized the transfer of insulin and some armor to Kharkiv, it's on the way. We are ready to help with big buy of petrol for Kharkiv's needs. We also helped some people who just needed money to survive. Every dollar of your help is very important. Thank you. These are good news. And bad news are - our country and my beloved city are being killed. Fighter planes are in the sky every day, missiles are falling into residential area, squares and univercities. We need help. We need planes. We need closed sky. Don't forget about us tomorrow.

Day 10. No more tears, no more reflection. The acceptance. We are the country in war. A lot of people left, saving their kids. A lot of left saving their lives. We are still here and it's time to do something to stop it. Or to help those who can stop it. Today we made a lot. We've created a small coordination center. We've collected requests for help and started to solve them. There are a lot of needs now. Medicine, supplies for people, petrol, food for animals. We do our best at our places and we do believe in victory. Your help can't be overrated. Your support is so important. Every cent will be used to stop this, I promise. Today we've collected 2365 USD (!!!). Another 1000 USD for the army and other for small requests and for volunteers. We stand. Stay with us. Our country is so small in front of Russia. But the whole normal world is behind our backs. We need NATO to close the sky above Ukraine. Pray for us.

Day 9. Nine days. The whole life. A week ago we left our home for a country house near Kharkiv. We thought it would be for 2-3 days. We are still here. We are still alive. We still stand. A lot of tears and fears came today. I'm afriad not to see my city again. I'm afraid for each and every guardian of the city and country. I'm afraid I will never see my friends again. I'm afraid that we will need to run away further. But still. We stand. You support is precious. Now we are collecting money for medicine and protection. We do what we can at our place and will do it as long as needed. You transferred us 1850 USD this day. And from all people of Ukraine - thank you. We added some kid's pictures to the shop. All money from these listings will be transferred to volunteers and the army too. It's all we can do right now. Thank you.

Day 8. Is it possible to get used to war? I don't know. I still can't. Today in Kharkiv were destroyed more houses, publik transport, plants and even park, oh my god. People are hiding in the underground already full week stright. Airforces of the russian army bomb the city. And not only my. It looks like the main idea is just to ruin my beatiful country.

Thanks to you today we've collected 1755 USD. We've transfered them to military, civilian in Chernygiv and lost dogs in Kyiv.

Thank you. We stand.

Day 7. Hard day. Finally managed to write. We are alive. My city is being ruined. City center, historical buildings, church, and hundreds of houses. It's beyond all human laws. It's beyond understanding. We are standing. Real super-heroes - they are here. They are called the Ukrainian army and volunteers. For the day that passed, we've gathered 1650 USD. Thank you! We've managed to buy some food supplies in the countryside and tranfer them by train to the Kharkiv. The rest of the money we would like to keep for the rebuliding of our city and help for those who have lost their houses. Thank you. We stand.

Day 6. I don't have more words. I don't have more tears. Yesterday and today my beautiful city is being destroyed. Residential area, the center of the city. Today a bomb fall on the main square. It's called the Square of Freedom. It's a lack of food in the city. Over 90 houses were broken. Multiple cutoffs of electricity. We are still alive. My friends are still alive. But many civilians are not. Including children. In last 24 hours we've collected another 1000 USD. Thank you all. We will try to buy food in country area and deliver it to the city.

Day 5th of Russian aggression. From now on I will update this announcement every morning to let you know how we are doing. I'm 40 km from Kharkiv, hiding my kids, parents, granny, and pets in our country house. We are alive and relatively safe now. We hear volleys in the distance. Our friends are still in shelters in Kharkiv. Bombs are falling on the city and neighborhood. But we are standing. Thank you for your help. This night we've gathered 1350 USD, thank you! We will transfer them today to the partialy to the official bank account of Ukraine and partially tomorrow due to the ecxhange procedure to the perinatal center in Kharkiv and to the city guard. From all heart - thank you. See you tomorrow, I hope. Pray for Ukraine.",https://www.etsy.com/shop/Grannysbox
