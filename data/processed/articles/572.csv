After the negotiations between the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine failed, the war continues with the same harshness of previous days. Today we have seen paradigmatic actions of this conflict, such as the artillery bombardment of a column of Russian tanks as it advanced towards Brovary, east of Kiev. An action in which several of the errors that are causing an unusual number of casualties among the Russian troops come together. Beyond the fighting, the evacuation processes in cities such as Irpin have continued, albeit in minimal numbers. Humanitarian aid has also arrived in cities such as Mariupol, where sanitary conditions and lack of food could increase the size of the tragedy. In the international sphere, everything has revolved around the European Summit held in Versailles, in which crucial issues have been discussed, ranging from support for Ukraine to energy dependence or defence capabilities.

After a certain expectation regarding the talks that were going to be held this morning in Anatolia (Turkey) between the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine, hopes have collapsed. There has been no agreement of any kind, beyond the need for further dialogue in the future. The Ukrainian and Russian positions are still too far apart on the fundamental points and this has been expressed by both representatives. In the case of the Ukrainian minister, he has directly accused Russia of seeking a Ukrainian surrender and not an agreement. For his part, Lavrov has not hesitated to affirm that Russia has never attacked Ukraine.

Today has been a day without changes in the military section. However, it has left us some impressive images that we consider are representative of what we have seen in the past few days. Specifically, we are talking about a video that we shared this morning on Twitter in which a column of Russian tanks is seen piled up on a road that crosses the town of Skybyn in the direction of Brovary, east of Kiev. In this case, in a completely flat area full of crop fields, the Russian tanks, instead of taking advantage of the possibilities of the terrain, are concentrated on the only road for kilometers around. In this area thay have been beaten by the Ukrainian artillery after they probable located and signaled the target by means of a drone. Of course, with the map in hand, it is an almost obligatory point of passage if you want to reach Brovary. In this sense, there are forests to the west and more populated areas to the east, such as Krasykivka and Trebukhiv. However, such a concentration of vehicles is not understood without having previously beaten the Ukrainians with their own artillery, without having received news of counter-battery fire a posteriori, without the use of drones for reconnaissance, etc. We already warned yesterday of how complex it would be for Russia to cross this entire area in the direction of Kiev. If the tactic to be used is to constantly carry out reconnaissance in force of this type, the level of attrition will be unbearable.

For the rest, throughout the day there have been reports of civilian evacuations in Kiev, Irpin, Mariupol or Sumy, as well as the arrival of humanitarian aid in Mariupol and Energodar. Regarding casualties, we still do not have reliable information. The Ukrainians already offer figures that are close to 15.000 dead on the Russian side. That is, a rate of 1.000 deaths per day, something clearly impossible. On the other hand, clashes continue regarding yesterday's attack on the Mariupol maternity hospital, with some saying that it was used for military purposes and others denying the major. In fact, there has been an intense exchange of versions about the identity of the pregnant woman who appeared in one of the photos we shared yesterday.

As we anticipated yesterday, in regards to the international section, the informal meeting of the European Council has begun. In addition to the presence of the Heads of State and Government of the Member States, it gathered the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, the President of the European Commission Ursula Von der Leyen, the High Representative Josep Borrell and the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola. This meeting, which is being held in Versailles, is being hosted by Emmanuel Macron as France holds the rotating presidency of the Council.

Upon arrival, several representatives have spoken on the main issues that will be addressed until tomorrow afternoon: how to strengthen defence capabilities, reduce energy dependence on Russia, build a stronger economic base and also how to address food independence.

Of course, they will discuss the latest developments on the ground and the action being taken by the European Union to respond to the aggression by Russia. In the same way, they will discuss the Ukrainian request to obtain the official candidacy for a Member State of the European Union, as well as the repeated messages of President Zelensky to obtain membership as soon as possible. These days we have been commenting that there is no accelerated or ""express"" accession procedure and more and more the leaders of the Member States are speaking out on the matter, alluding to the fact that it is necessary to comply with the procedure established in the Treaties and that it will take time .

It should also be underlined that throughout the month of March all the issues mentioned will be dealt with again at the highest level. In this sense, the next dates to mark on the European calendar will be 21 and 22 March, when there will be a session of the Foreign Affairs Council, and 24 and 25 March, when the Heads of State and Government will meet again in the European Council.

On the other hand, in parallel with the informal meeting of the European Council, the French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian held a video call with his Chinese counterpart, Minister Wang Yi. The main items on your agenda have been the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the importance of reaching an agreement that would allow the return of Iran and the United States to the Vienna agreement on Iranian nuclear energy, and the bilateral relationship between France and China.

Another remarkable fact has been the Russia's decision of not continuing to be part of the Council of Europe after the suspension of their rights on 25 February. In addition, they have given the green light to the nationalization of foreign companies in Russia. This could mean that some of the companies that have decided to suspend their operations in the country because of the war, could see their assets transferred in favor of a Russian state company.

Finally, we briefly review the situation by front, which has hardly changed compared to yesterday:

North: The Russian setback in Brovary would add, according to the Ukrainian General Staff (unconfirmed data), the retreat of Russian troops due to a Ukrainian attack, towards the surroundings of Chernobyl, towards Polinskyi and Volysnke, which could threaten its logistics. However, despite what was seen in the video in which the Russian tanks are attacked by the Ukrainian artillery, there are sources that affirm that the Russian spearhead would be consolidated and just five kilometers from Kiev from the east.

Northeast: No position changes. According to some analysts, it is likely that Russia is trying to leave Kharkov in the background, in favor of Sumy, a city that threatens its logistical deployment and that would be easier to take by storm. In recent days there has been intense fighting in the surroundings that could be a Russian attempt to test the defenses, trying to explore possible weak points. Of course, none of this is to say that the bombing of Kharkov will abate. In fact, this very night the Nikolsky shopping center was destroyed.

East: Out of moves.",https://www.revistaejercitos.com/en/2022/03/10/guerra-de-ucrania-dia-15/
