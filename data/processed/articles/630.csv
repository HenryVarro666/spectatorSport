0,5e5cb375-596a-4db2-81f8-3e928b459af0,[],2022-03-16 00:00:00,"President Biden today announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine to $1 billion in just the past week, and a total of $2 billion since the start of the Biden Administration. The assistance will take the form of direct transfers of equipment from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military to help them defend their country against Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion.



The new $800 million assistance package includes:

800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;

2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems;

100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems;

100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns;

Over 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds;

25,000 sets of body armor; and

25,000 helmets.

In addition to the weapons listed above, previous United States assistance committed to Ukraine includes:

Over 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;

Approximately 2,600 Javelin anti-armor systems;

Five Mi-17 helicopters;

Three patrol boats;

Four counter-artillery and counter-unmanned aerial system tracking radars;

Four counter-mortar radar systems;

200 grenade launchers and ammunition;

200 shotguns and 200 machine guns;

Nearly 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition and over 1 million grenade, mortar, and artillery rounds;

70 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) and other vehicles;

Secure communications, electronic warfare detection systems, body armor, helmets, and other tactical gear;

Military medical equipment to support treatment and combat evacuation;

Explosive ordnance disposal and demining equipment; and

Satellite imagery and analysis capability.

In addition to the U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the Ukrainians have been using to great effect, the United States has also identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire additional, longer-range systems on which Ukraine’s forces are already trained, as well as additional munitions for those systems.

The United States continues to expedite the authorization and facilitation of additional assistance to Ukraine from our Allies. At least 30 countries have provided security assistance to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. In 2022, the Department of State authorized third-party transfers of defensive equipment from more than 14 countries, a number that continues to grow as Allies and Partners increase support to Ukraine.

1,5e5cb375-596a-4db2-81f8-3e928b459af0,"['Valerie Insinna', 'Breaking Defense', 'General Atomics Aeronautical Systems']",2022-03-16 18:30:22+00:00,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden announced today that the US will provide Ukraine with an additional $800 million in weaponry, committing a total of $1 billion in military aid to Kyiv this week alone.

The latest security assistance package doubles the $1 billion in security assistance previously given by the administration.

However, the military tech that the US will provide to Ukraine — which includes anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft systems — falls short of the more sophisticated air defense systems and combat aircraft Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for during a speech to US lawmakers earlier today.

“The American people are answering President Zelensky’s call for more help, more weapons for Ukraine to defend itself, more tools to fight Russian aggression,” Biden said during a speech at the White House announcing the new military aid.

The arms package includes 800 shoulder-mounted Stinger anti-aircraft systems and 9,000 anti-armor systems, including 2,000 Javelin systems, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons and 6,000 AT-4 antiarmor systems, according to a White House fact sheet.

For the first time, the US is providing drones to Ukraine in the form of 100 “tactical unmanned aerial systems,” the White House stated. Biden did not specify what drones will be delivered to Ukraine, but Politico reported that the drones are AeroVironment’s Switchblade system, which loiters in the sky before crashing into its target.

Drones have already played a major part in Ukraine’s defense, with the Turkish-made TB2 becoming something of a local celebrity for its ability to take out Russia armor. Unlike the TB2, however, the Switchblade is a one-time-use system, more of a loitering munition than a true UAV.

The package also includes 7,000 small arms — including 5,000 rifles, 400 machine guns, 400 shotguns and 100 grenade launchers — as well as 20 million rounds of ammunition, mortars and artillery. In the realm of protective gear, the package provides 25,000 sets of body armor and helmets.

Biden’s announcement came just hours after Zelensky virtually addressed a joint session of Congress this morning, where the Ukrainian president pleaded US politicians to instate a no fly zone or, as an alternative, to send additional weapons to Ukraine — specifically air defense systems and additional combat aircraft.

“Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people. Russian troops have already fired nearly 1,000 missiles on Ukraine, countless bombs. They use drones to kill us with precision. This is a terror that Europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for a reply, for an answer to this terror,” Zelensky said.

“Is this a lot to ask for, to create a no fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask?” Zelensky said. “If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative. You know what kinds of defense systems we need — S-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the battlefield, on the ability to use aircraft, powerful strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom our land.”

While the S-300 or other comparable Russian anti-aircraft systems were not listed as part of today’s arms package, the White House stated that “the United States has also identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire additional, longer-range [air defense] systems on which Ukraine’s forces are already trained, as well as additional munitions for those systems.”

Biden did not address the prospect of a no-fly zone this afternoon, but US officials —as well as key allies such as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson — have continually rebuffed Ukrainian requests for a no-fly zone over fears it would be tantamount to direct war with Russia.

On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Biden “continues to believe that a no-fly zone would be escalatory, could prompt a war with Russia.”

However, Biden said the United States was committed to ensure that Russian President Vladimir Putin pays a high price for his decision to invade Ukraine.

“Putin is inflicting appalling, appalling devastation on Ukraine, bombing apartment buildings, maternity wards, hospitals,” Biden said. “Yesterday we saw reports that Russian forces were holding hundreds of doctors and patients hostage in the largest hospital in Mariupol. These are atrocities. They’re an outrage to the world.”",https://breakingdefense.com/2022/03/armed-drones-stingers-and-20-million-rounds-biden-announces-1b-in-weapons-for-ukraine/

Why it matters: The announcement, which came just hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered an emotional address to Congress pleading for more assistance, brings the total amount of military aid to Ukraine authorized in the past week to over $1 billion.

Biden directed $200 million in military aid to be sent to Ukraine from his presidential drawdown authority on Saturday.

The rest of the funding will come from a $13.6 billion aid package to Ukraine that Congress passed last week, which was divided between humanitarian and security assistance.

Details: The U.S. will directly transfer the following equipment to the Ukrainian military as part of the latest package, according to a White House fact sheet:

800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems

2,000 Javelin anti-armor missiles

1,000 light anti-armor weapons

6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems

100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems (armed drones)

7,000 small arms for both military and civilian use (100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 shotguns)

Over 20 million rounds of ammunition

25,000 sets of body armor

25,000 helmets

The big picture: The U.S. provided $650 million in military aid to Ukraine in 2021, more than it had in the previous eight years that Ukraine had been fighting a war against Russian-backed forces in the east.

After Russia's large-scale invasion began, the Biden administration surged an additional $350 million into Ukraine.

""We're going to give Ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead,"" Biden pledged on Wednesday.

What they're saying: ""I want to thank President Zelensky for his passionate message this morning. I listened to it in the private residence. He was convincing and [it was] a significant speech,"" Biden said in his announcement.

""Now, I want to be honest with you. This could be a long and difficult battle. But the American people will be steadfast in our support and the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin's immoral, unethical attacks on civilian populations,"" he continued.

""We're united in our abhorrence of Putin's depraved onslaught and we're going to continue to have their backs as they fight for freedom, democracy, their very survival.""

What to watch: Zelensky and bipartisan members of Congress have urged Biden to send advanced anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine in the absence of a NATO ""no-fly"" zone.

Acknowledging Zelensky's request, Biden said the U.S. has ""identified"" and is ""helping Ukraine acquire longer-range anti-missile systems, and the munitions for those systems.""

That's likely a reference to the S-300 anti-aircraft systems possessed by NATO allies in Eastern Europe.

What You Need To Know President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced his administration will release another $800 million in military assistance for Ukraine



The new supply of equipment will include 800 anti-aircraft systems, 9,000 anti-armor systems, 20 million rounds of ammunition and more



The president’s speech came several hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed both chambers of Congress



Congress already approved $13.6 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, and the newly announced aid will come from that allotment

“The world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make [Russia’s President Vladimir Putin] pay a very heavy price,” Biden said from the White House. “America is leading this effort, together with our allies and partners, providing enormous levels of security and humanitarian assistance that we're adding to today and we're going to continue to do more in the days and weeks ahead.”

Biden delineated a number of items the U.S. will provide to Ukraine as part of Wednesday’s package, which included:

800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems to fend off attacks from Russian warplanes

9,000 anti-armor systems, including 2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons and 6,000 AT-4 systems

7,000 weapons including 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 shotguns

20 million rounds of ammunition for artillery

100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems, or drones

“The United States and our allies and partners are fully committed to surging weapons of assistance to the Ukrainians, and more will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that we're ready to transfer,” Biden said.

“Now I want to be honest with you: this could be a long and difficult battle,” he added. “But the American people will be steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin’s immoral, unethical attacks on civilian populations.”

The president’s speech came several hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed both chambers of Congress in a virtual speech, where he implored the United States to implement a no-fly zone over his country, to send MiG fighter jets to Ukraine and to issue “more new packages of sanctions [...] every week until the Russian military machine stops.”

Biden mentioned neither the request for MiG planes nor the implementation of a no-fly zone during his address. When asked what it would take to send the planes to Ukraine, Biden responded: “I'm not going to comment on that right now.”

Already the Biden administration has sent Ukraine more than 600 Stinger missiles, 2,600 Javelin anti-armor systems, unmanned aerial system tracking radars, grenade launchers, 200 shotguns, 200 machine guns and nearly 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition, along with helicopters, patrol boats, satellite imagery and body armor, helmets, and other tactical gear, a U.S. official told the Associated Press.

Congress has already approved $13.6 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, and the newly announced security aid will come from that allotment, which is part of a broader bill that Biden signed into law Tuesday.

The Ukraine aid included $6.5 billion for the U.S. costs of sending troops and weapons to Eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion and bellicose threats. There was another $6.8 billion to care for refugees and provide economic aid to allies, and more to help federal agencies enforce economic sanctions against Russia and protect against cyber threats at home.

NBC News first reported that Switchblade was under consideration by the White House.

McCaul also said that the U.S. was “working with allies” to send more S-300 surface-to-air missile systems to Ukraine. The country has had the S-300 for years, so troops should require little-to-no training on how to operate the Soviet-era anti-aircraft equipment. CNN reported that Slovakia had preliminarily agreed to transfer their S-300s to Ukraine.

The revelations come shortly after President Joe Biden announced the new $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine, which also includes 800 more Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 2,000 anti-armor Javelins, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems. The AT-4 is a lightweight recoilless rifle already used by American special operations forces.

“The United States and our allies and partners are fully committed to surging weapons of assistance to the Ukrainians, and more will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that we’re ready to transfer,” Biden said.

Hours earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered a virtual speech to members of Congress, imploring the president and lawmakers to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine and provide his country with more materiel.

A Western diplomat familiar with Ukraine’s requests said Kyiv specifically has asked the U.S. and allies for more Stingers and Starstreak man-portable air-defense systems, Javelins and other anti-tank weapons, ground-based mobile air-defense systems, armed drones, long-range anti-ship missiles, “off-the-shelf” electronic warfare capabilities, and satellite navigation and communications jamming equipment.

“I have a dream. These words are known to each of you today,” Zelenskyy said. “I can say, I have a need. I need to protect our sky. I need your help.”

“We need to give him more defense mechanisms. He kept saying no-fly zone. I think that’s probably still a non-starter,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) told POLITICO. “That doesn’t mean we can’t up the amount, do more with equipment and drones and other things that would be just as helpful.”

Ukraine has succeeded in defending Kyiv, the capital, and stalling Russia’s advances three weeks after the invasion started. The U.S.-led Western push to put advanced, lethal weaponry in Ukrainian hands boosted the resistance, which to date has met a shambolic Russian advance lacking in strategy and logistics.

To further help, there is a push to get Eastern European allies to send new air defense systems to Ukraine that the U.S. doesn’t have. At the top of the list are mobile, Russian-made missile systems such as the SA-8 and S-300. Like the S-300, Ukraine also possesses SA-8s.

The SA-8 is a mobile, short-range air defense system still in the warehouses of Romania, Bulgaria and Poland. The larger, long-range S-300 is still in use by Bulgaria, Greece and Slovakia.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s trip to Europe this week will include not only NATO headquarters in Brussels, but also stops in Bulgaria and Slovakia — countries that own S-300s and SA-8s — before heading back to Washington, D.C.",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/16/us-sends-switchblade-drones-to-ukraine-00017836

In a White House list of weapons being sent to Ukraine as part of a new $800 million military support package announced by President Joe Biden Wednesday -- among nearly 10,000 anti-armor weapons, 800 anti-aircraft Stinger systems, and thousands of rifles -- appeared 100 ""tactical unmanned aerial systems.""

But these aren't the large U.S. drones you're used to seeing.

The 100 unmanned systems heading to Ukraine are actually small ""Switchblade"" drones, a U.S. official told ABC News.

Unlike long-range Predator drones, which look similar to small planes and fire missiles at targets, the smallest Switchblade model fits in a rucksack and flies directly into targets to detonate its small warhead.

Less than 2-feet long and weighing only 5.5 pounds, the Switchblade 300 can be launched from a small tube that resembles a mortar, after which it can fly for up to 15 minutes. The larger Switchblade 600 is effective against armored targets and can fly for more than 40 minutes, but weighs 50 pounds, according to the manufacturer.

The U.S. official could not say whether one or both of the systems would be included in the 100 units destined for Ukraine.

Both Switchblades use onboard sensors and GPS to guide them to their targets. Both also have a ""wave-off"" feature so that human operators can abort an attack if civilians appear near the target or if the enemy withdraws.

""These were designed for U.S. Special Operations Command and are exactly the type of weapons systems that can have an immediate impact on the battlefield,"" said Mick Mulroy, former deputy assistant secretary of defense and an ABC News national security and defense analyst.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/100-us-switchblade-drones-heading-ukraine/story?id=83490886

US President Joe Biden has earmarked an additional $800m in military equipment that will be directly transferred to Ukraine.

The announcement on Wednesday came the same day Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to the US Congress for more security aid to repel the Russian invasion, which has killed at least 1,834 civilians since it began on February 24.

The package includes a surge in US-provided anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons, as well as drones. The aid demonstrates Washington’s “commitment to sending our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defence”, Biden said.

He later told a reporter he thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin is a “war criminal”, although White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki later said Biden was “speaking from his heart”, and the State Department was still in the process of determining if Putin has indeed committed war crimes.

The latest pledge does not include any reference to fighter jets that Zelenskyy has called for during the ongoing Russian attacks. The United States and other NATO allies have so far resisted Zelenskyy’s appeal to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine over fears it would lead to a larger confrontation between the bloc and Russia.

The White House also said Washington is “helping the Ukrainians acquire additional, longer-range” air-defence systems, but did not provide further details.

The most recent package brings the total US security aid to Ukraine announced since the Russian invasion began to $1bn. The Biden administration previously approved another $1bn in aid before the invasion began.

What’s in the latest package?

The Pentagon will send 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems in the latest round of security aid. The systems can be used to defend against helicopters and low-flying aircraft using infrared sensors to find a target.

The package will also include thousands of anti-tank weapons, including 2,000 Javelin systems, a shoulder-mounted weapon that is guided by a computer for deadly accuracy.

The US will also transfer 100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems, or drones, as well as an array of lighter weapons – 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 shotguns – and additional body armour, helmets and ammunition.

What has the US previously given Ukraine?

Washington previously provided Ukraine with more than 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems and about 2,600 Javelin weapons.

In addition, the Pentagon gave Ukraine five Mi-17 helicopters, three patrol boats, an array of smaller arms, and several radar systems to track artillery, mortar, and drone attacks.

At least 30 countries have upped military assistance to Ukraine since the Russian attack, including Germany, which reversed a longstanding policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/17/whats-in-the-new-us-military-aid-package-to-ukraine
