Scholz and Macron called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine during the 75-minute phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin, a German government spokesman added.

Their demand echoed a statement made by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, earlier on Saturday, who said negotiations must begin with a suspension of hostilities.

The Kremlin readout of the call said Putin briefed Macron and Scholz about the state of play in negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv and responded to their concerns about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. It did not mention a ceasefire and accused Ukraine of using civilians as human shields.



The participants agreed to say nothing further about the substance of the phone call, according to the German spokesperson, who added: “The conversation is part of ongoing international efforts to end the war in Ukraine.”

Crisis talks between Moscow and Kyiv, which had been conducted in person in Belarus, have continued via a video link, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday, according to the RIA news agency.

Speaking at a news briefing, Zelenskiy said Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams had started discussing concrete topics rather than exchanging ultimatums.

Stating that about 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed since the invasion began, he claimed the conflict meant some small Ukrainian towns now no longer existed.

Zelenskiy said Ukraine could not stop fighting but was upholding a ceasefire around an agreed “humanitarian corridor” out of the besieged southern port of Mariupol and called on Russia to do the same.

He further suggested negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to end the war could be held in Jerusalem.

He said he hoped the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would have a “positive influence” on peace talks.

Bennett visited Moscow on 5 March, spending three hours with Putin before travelling on to Berlin to brief Scholz.

Vladimir Putin has ""no plans"" to end the war in Ukraine, according to the French President Emmanuel Macron.

Mr Macron spoke to the leader of the Kremlin on a call, alongside German Chancellor Olaf Schulz on Saturday evening.

He pleaded with Putin to lift the siege on Mariupol, one of the heaviest-shelled cities of the last week.

Many in the region are living without power, food or water, and the city's hospitals were targeted by Russian airstrikes over recent days.

An official spokesperson for the French President told the Associated Press that Mr Putin: ""did not appear ready to end the war"" in Ukraine.

The leaders of France and Germany had asked for a ceasefire as a condition before structured negotiations.

They also told Mr Putin that the destruction by Russian forces must stop, the official added.

The City Council of Mariupol, confirmed there have been at least 1,582 civilian deaths in Ukraine's southeastern city as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade.

Today, as the violence enters its 17th day, EU officials are preparing to hit Russia with a fourth package of sanctions in response to the invasion.

EU Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen said: ""The three sweeping waves of sanctions and the extension of their scope this week have hit Russia's economy very hard.

""The 4th package will be an additional blow to Putin’s regime.

""The invasion of Ukraine has to stop.""",https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/world-news/putin-no-plans-end-war-26451557

Today, Saturday, March 12, French media reported that French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Schulz were having a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the situation in Ukraine, according to the Elysee Palace.

On the ground, the Russian military operation in Ukraine continues for the seventeenth consecutive day, since it began on February 24.

The Russian-Ukrainian conflict gained a new turning point, on February 21, after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics of Ukraine, in an escalatory step that drew great anger from Kyiv and its Western allies.

In the wake of this, the Russian forces began, at dawn on Thursday, February 24, to launch a military operation in eastern Ukraine, which opened the door to the possibility of the outbreak of a “third world war”, which would be the first in the twenty-first century.

The European Union said the world has been living in a “blacker atmosphere” since World War Two, while the European Union and the United States imposed a package of sanctions against Russia, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described as “the toughest ever”.

However, the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization “NATO” have so far insisted not to engage in any military operation in Ukraine, and the EU countries also refuse to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine, contrary to the desire of Kyiv, which called on European countries to take that step, Which the US administration said would cause a “third world war”.

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, earlier, that the outbreak of a third world war would be “nuclear and destructive,” as he described it.

On the scene of the events, the Russian Defense Ministry said, at the beginning of the military operation, that the Ukrainian air defense system and its bases had been destroyed and the infrastructure of the Air Force was out of service.

Later, the Russian Defense announced, on Saturday, February 26, that it had issued orders to the Russian forces to launch military operations on all axes in Ukraine, following Kyiv’s refusal to enter into negotiations with Moscow, while Ukraine attributed that refusal to Russia putting conditions on the table before negotiating. rejected for Ukraine.

However, the two sides sat for negotiations for the first time, on Monday, February 28, in Gomel, on the Belarusian border, and a second round of talks was held on Thursday, March 3, while the two sides held a third round of talks in Belarus on Monday, March 7. The three rounds of negotiations ended without a noticeable change on the ground.

The head of the Russian delegation said that his country’s expectations from the third round of negotiations “did not materialize”, but indicated that meetings with Ukraine would continue, while the Ukrainian delegation spoke of a slight progress in negotiations with the Russians on “safe corridors.”

Prior to that, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed, on February 28, a decree on his country’s application to join the European Union, in a move that did not find Russian opposition, as the issue of Kyiv’s accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization “NATO”.

Russian Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the European Union is not a military-political bloc, noting that the issue of Kyiv’s accession to the union does not fall within the framework of strategic security issues, but falls within a different framework.

At the international level, the United Nations General Assembly voted, on Wednesday, 2 March, to condemn the Russian war on Ukraine, with 141 countries approving the draft resolution, while only 5 countries rejected the issue of condemning Russia, while 35 countries around the world abstained.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian authorities have imposed martial law throughout the country since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukrainian territory.

Before starting a military operation against Ukraine, Russia had always rejected the West’s accusations of preparing for an “invasion” of Ukraine, and said that it was not a party to the internal Ukrainian conflict.

However, this was not convincing for Western circles, which were basing their accusations of Moscow of preparing for the invasion of Ukraine, on Russia’s deployment of about 100,000 Russian soldiers a few weeks ago on its borders with Ukraine, a country close to the West, saying that “this invasion could take place in any time”.

But Russia justified this at the time that it only wanted to ensure its security, at a time when Washington sent military reinforcements to Eastern Europe and Ukraine as well.

For its part, Moscow accused the West at the time of using these accusations as a pretext to increase the military presence of NATO near its borders, at a time when Russia was and still insists on rejecting the issue of NATO expansion, or Ukraine joining the alliance, while Kyiv is eager to join the NATO banner.

It's been more than two weeks since the Russian invasion began and conversations with my friends back home in Ukraine have become more precious than ever.

Several of them are resolutely staying in Kyiv, some have moved to Lviv, the western city now bursting at the seams with evacuees, and many are strewn around the countryside where it is deemed to be safer than in cities and towns.

My very best friend, Oksana, is in the capital and on day 17 of the invasion many things have changed.

In her building, only 20 out of 60 flats remain occupied and the concierge, who used to watch the lobby and open the front door, is now gone.

The residents have set up a rota to replace her, each day split into four-hour shifts.

Oksana and I chat while she is “on duty”.

I overhear one neighbour walking in and asking Oksana if she’d seen an elderly lady from the ninth floor recently, they are worried if she has enough food and will now go and check.

A few minutes later another neighbour appears, offering Oksana a chicken.

“I was in the shop,” she says, “there was chicken available, so I bought a few, do you want one?” Oksana politely refuses but suggests the neighbour offers it on the building’s WhatsApp group.

I ask Oksana about food.

There isn't a shortage per se, she says, but things have become random. Like you can sometimes buy a pineapple and crayfish but not always bread or milk.

A third neighbour stops by and talks about evacuation.

She had been hoping to get on a coach going abroad but it was cancelled.

She is philosophical about whether this was a good or a bad thing and wonders if it's better to stay home after all.

It seems that the Kyivites who remained in the city this long are now more determined than ever not to abandon it.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60717902/page/13

Zelenskyy says Ukrainians have right to self-determination

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed fellow Ukrainians in an online speech and reiterated their right to live in their land on their own terms.

""The Russian invaders cannot conquer us. They do not have such strength. They do not have such spirit. They are holding only on violence. Only on terror. Only on weapons, which they have a lot,"" he said in the speech posted on Instagram.

He said Russian invaders were not capable of sustaining normal life. ""Whenever Russia has come to a foreign land, dreams are impossible. Only a very hard struggle for survival,"" he said.

Zelenskyy said the Russian state was trying to create the DPR and LPR, but the regions would end up being isolated from the rest of the world and face poverty, crime and exodus.

Zelenskyy said the withdrawal of IT professionals, businesses and artists from Russia was the fate that awaited Donetsk and Luhansk as well.

Urging Ukrainians to continue their fight, he said they would regain what is theirs. ""Ukraine will not forget. Ukraine will find and prosecute,"" he said. Zelenskyy said the agreed-upon humanitarian corridors worked and that aid would be arriving in Mariupol tomorrow.

He also thanked Europe and the US for their support, adding that ordinary citizens across the world supported Ukraine. He called Russia an even bigger evil than North Korea.

He conferred titles and awards upon some Ukrainians who had fought against Russian forces, many of them posthumously.

Ukraine military notes partial success in Russian offensive

Efforts by Russian forces to launch an offensive to the northeast of the capital Kyiv have been ""partially successful,"" the Ukrainian military says.

The comments were published on Facebook early on Saturday.

Russian units are attempting to blockade the city of Chernihiv from the southwest, and, as part of their efforts, are attempting to capture the towns of Shestovytsya and Mykhailo-Kotsiubynske.

However, the message from the Armed Forces of Ukraine was generally positive.

Ukrainian troops were said to be repelling their enemy and ""inflicting losses on Russian invaders in manpower and military equipment, which significantly reduces their will to continue the confrontation.""

The briefing also noted that anti-invasion demonstrations were being held in ""temporarily occupied territories.""

Zelenskyy: Kidnap of city mayor 'crime against democracy'

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has demanded the release of the mayor of the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol.

The Ukrainian parliament earlier said civic leader Ivan Fedorov was seen being taken away by Russian soldiers occupying the city.

Fedorov had reportedly refused to cooperate with the occupying forces.

Zelenskyy confirmed the abduction, calling Fedorov ""a mayor who bravely defends Ukraine and the members of his community."" He said it revealed Russian weakness, and was a crime against democracy.

""This is obviously a sign of weakness of the invaders... They have moved to a new stage of terror in which they are trying to physically eliminate representatives of legitimate local Ukrainian authorities,"" he said.

""The capture of the mayor of Melitopol is, therefore, a crime, not only against a particular person, against a particular community, and not only against Ukraine. It is a crime against democracy itself.

""The acts of the Russian invaders will be regarded like those of 'Islamic State' terrorists,"" he said.

Russian forces captured Melitopol, home to 150,000 people, on February 26.

Mariupol under siege

Zelenskyy has also accused Russia of not allowing people to leave the besieged city of Mariupol, claiming that Moscow was torturing its residents.

The Ukrainian president said there would be a fresh effort to deliver aid to Mariupol on Saturday, although the Russians were refusing to allow supplies in.

""Russian troops have not let our aid into the city and continue to torture our people ...tomorrow we will try again, try again to send food, water and medicine,"" he said.

Zelenskyy said a total of 7,144 people were evacuated from four other Ukrainian cities on Friday, a sharp drop on each of the two previous days.

In the same address, Zelenskyy called on the mothers of Russian soldiers to prevent their sons from being sent to fight in the war in Ukraine.

""I want to say this once again to Russian mothers, especially mothers of conscripts. Do not send your children to war in a foreign country,"" he said.

""Ukraine never wanted this terrible war. And Ukraine does not want it. But it will defend itself as much as necessary,"" he added.

The two sites have been seized by Russian forces, but are still being operated by Ukrainian staff.

""We remain concerned about Russia’s reckless actions and violations of nuclear safety principles,"" Granholm wrote on Twitter.

""We are monitoring reports of damage to a research facility in Kharkiv. Near-term safety risk is low, but the continued Russian firing on nuclear facilities must cease,"" she said.

Summary of events in Ukraine-Russia crisis on Friday

Russia has widened its offensive in Ukraine, striking airfields in the west for the first time.

Russian airstrikes also targeted for the first time the eastern city of Dnipro, a major industrial hub and Ukraine's fourth-largest city, on the Dnieper River.

New satellite photos also appeared to show that the massive Russian convoy outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, had fanned out.

The 40-mile (64-kilometer) line of tanks and other vehicles had massed outside the city early last week. The Russian military is widely expected to try to encircle Kyiv.

President Zelenskyy said his country has reached a strategic turning point in its war with Russia. But he cautioned that time and patience were still needed until victory is achieved.

At least 1,582 civilians have been killed in Ukraine's southeastern city of Mariupol as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade, the city council said in an online statement.

Russia's Defense Ministry on Friday said its offensive, led by fighters from the separatist-held Donetsk region, was further squeezing Mariupol, which lies on the Sea of Azov that runs into the Black Sea.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has said some 2.5 million people have now fled Ukraine since Russia invaded on February 24.

“For now, environmental politics is succeeding in panicking minds and making them yawn with boredom,” they wrote.

Hoping to shake off this negative image, Mr. Jadot recently embarked on a tour of France that will bring him to some 15 cities by early April. All of the campaign stops have been designed to create connections with voters, with Mr. Jadot addressing them from a small octagonal podium.

Mr. Jadot said he wanted to solve “both sides of the equation” by convincing voters that it is time for real climate action and that doing so can also bring about a better lifestyle, or what he called “a new kind of enthusiasm.”

“Taking action for the climate means economic innovation, eating well thanks to sustainable and small-scale farming,” he said. “Basically, it’s about regaining control of one’s life.”

In Montpellier, where some 500 people had gathered, Mr. Jadot’s speech was filled with concrete proposals, including an $11 billion “Marshall Plan” for home insulation to cut energy consumption in half. He also plans to ban the use of dangerous pesticides and to create a new wealth tax that reflects the environmental impact of some investments.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/12/world/europe/france-elections-greens-environment.html
