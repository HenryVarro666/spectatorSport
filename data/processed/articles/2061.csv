2,3d0b68a7-c42b-42c3-8f2a-4e1075cb8482,[],2022-03-12,"Mikhail Podolyak, a member of Putin's negotiating team, told Israel Today: ""I believe that preliminary compromise documents regarding a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces will be formulated very soon."" The approach ""

""Russia is behaving like Hamas, only bigger and more dangerous, and Israel needs to understand this more than anyone else,"" Mikhail Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zlansky, told Israel Today.

Brief background: Podoliac (50) is one of the people closest to Zlansky.

He is a former journalist, who two years ago was elected by one of the media in Ukraine as the third person under his influence in the country.

Lazlansky has been advising since 2020 and in the presidency headquarters is responsible for crisis management and media policy coordination.

These days he is also a member of the small team that is in contact with the Russian team in an effort to end the war.

In a call from the world's most famous briefing room right now, Podoliak talks about the humanitarian catastrophe that Russia is causing by bombing the civilian population, and also about Israel's role in mediation.

PM of üáÆüá± @naftalibennett, just like other conditional intermediary countries, does NOT offer Ukraine to agree to any demands of the Russian Federation.

This is impossible for military & political reasons.

On the contrary, Israel urges Russia to assess the events more adequately.

At the weekend, it was reported in Israel that Prime Minister Bennett had offered President Zalansky to accept Putin's demands. What can you say about this information?

""This is distorted information.

The ultimatums in the initial Russian package were fundamentally unacceptable because they were based on a distorted perception of what Ukraine is, what the leadership of Ukraine, the Ukrainian army and the like are.

Russia's expectation was for a quick operation that within a day, at most two, would bring the desired result.

Now, after 17 days of war, it seems to me that Russia understands much more where it has fallen and with what results it will emerge from this war.

Therefore the package of Russian requirements takes on a more appropriate character.

Their package is not ready yet, and currently no mediator, including Prime Minister Bennett, has offered to 'accept the Russian offer', given the way Ukraine is fighting.

""Something needs to be understood, and I think your prime minister understands this very well: public opinion is very influential in Ukraine. We are a free country, society influences government positions. We are not an authoritarian country where the government has made a decision and society aligns. The potential mediators understand this, they see Zalanski's aggressive and decisive approach, so no one will simply suggest 'let's meet the demands of the Russian Federation'. .

Also today (Saturday) President Zlansky said that he had proposed to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to hold talks with Russia in Jerusalem, and that Israel could provide Ukraine with ""security guarantees"".

Podoliak commented: ""Yes, we are talking about the issue. Israel is seen as a central place for talks.""

He added: ""Israel is very sensitive to conflicts - you are constantly under external pressure - and we are in a similar situation, but our opponent is much stronger. Look, mediation allows you to take a neutral look at where there is special difficulty in compromising. Contemporaries, with military escalation, will explain to Russia that this is a dead end. This is a road that will lead to serious losses to Russia in particular. And it seems to me that Prime Minister Bennett and the Israeli leadership understand this and bring it to the attention of Russia.

I think this is a very, very helpful role.

According to Podoliak, he ""does not understand Israel's approach to sanctions because they are important,"" but understands the Israeli sensitivity that ""Russia works with your enemies and helps them with weapons, advice and financial support.""

""Israel is in a very complex situation, we understand this and treat Israel's position with great respect, in any case.""

Referring to Zalanski's planned speech to the Knesset, Podoliak said he was in the preparatory stages.

""I can not say that it will be tomorrow-the day after tomorrow, but it will not be bad to talk to the Israeli political elite and bring to its attention the vitality of more intense involvement in the conflict.""

The message it seeks to convey is likely to be similar to the one it has already conveyed to other legislatures around the world: to objectively assess the damage Russia is doing to the world today and accordingly to ease the extent of aid you are willing to provide to Ukraine.

""It can be military, financial or technological aid. After all, Russia does not sell anything in the global market: no technologies, no new products, it does not sell anything that contributes to the development of human civilization. Russia sells territorial claims, expansion, conflicts, arms trade, to some Hamas Or his ilk will wreak havoc.Russia markets destruction of civilization.

""Zelsky wants to make it clear that Ukraine is ready to deal with it directly, but Ukraine is significantly smaller than Russia militarily. For 20 years Russia has invested a fortune in the military, increased the percentage of GDP that goes to security.

Now Ukraine says: Help us stop all this and explain to a country as aggressive as Russia that military expansion is not a path to development, but a dead end.

This is the message in every and every request of Zelanski.

""I think Israel will understand this message much more because Israel itself is constantly in conflict with countries or territories laden with military weapons that are supported by Russia and promote its destructive philosophy. Russia and Hamas act similarly, and Israel understands this much more than Italy, France, ""Germany or Britain. Israel is supposed to better understand the situation in which Ukraine finds itself and I believe that Zalansky will be able to convey this message.""

What do you think about the claim coming from Russia regarding the ""liberation of Ukraine from the Nazis""? It is very important to many Israelis.

""We have radical movements, as there are in all other European countries where there are also parties with extremist and even Nazi elements. In some district states in Germany they even have prominence. So too in Hungary or France. We have 3-4% years under the influence of these extremist views. A global trend. But to say that we have Nazism or nationalism in power here is a Russian illusion. We are a free country, we have competitive politics, we communicate with all countries, our borders are open; we and Russia are different stars. We have competition, pluralism and freedom as a supreme value, ""In Russia - in the best tradition of a camp, where half are policemen and half are prisoners, and then change places. This is their civilization idea, so it is very difficult to talk to them.""

Is there progress in negotiations between your team and the Russian team?

""There are shifts. The (Russian) Minister Medinsky's staff is very constructive and objectively assesses the scale of the crisis now and the devastating consequences for Russia. We give them a clear picture of what is happening, try to teach them to think critically about their own propaganda, and we seem to succeed. ""I believe that very soon initial compromise documents will be formulated regarding a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces. But the overall agreement needs to be negotiated and signed between the two presidents. They will have to decide between them.""

In your opinion, does the situation permeate Putin himself?

""Without a shadow of a doubt. Minister Madinsky (Vladimir, Minister of Culture; DB) is quite effective as the Russian representative for the talks and as far as I understand from his rhetoric and how we are progressing, he is talking directly with Putin so there are issues that are progressing well.""

On the other hand, there are statements like that of Foreign Minister Lavrov over the weekend, according to which Russia did not attack Ukraine at all. Or allegations by the Russian Ministry of Defense regarding the development of biological weapons against the Russians in Ukraine.

""We live in parallel realities. Russia lives in a parallel reality to the real world. For years they built internal myths. At first they were required so that the Russian population would not pay attention to internal problems. Then the elite began to believe in these myths. It is absurd to gather almost 200,000 soldiers around To Ukraine and then to tell that the smaller Ukraine in its army and equipment intended to attack Russia. .

If there is progress in the negotiations, what is the point of bombing and deepening the humanitarian catastrophe?

‚ÄùBecause their tactics have changed.

First, they want to cause panic.

Secondly, they think primitively that through direct bombing their negotiating positions will be strengthened. Thirdly, they have a hawkish wing, also in the army, that wants to prove to the whole world that the army still has value. Heavy equipment, aided by fighter jets and helicopters, from five to six directions of invasion, against a small country whose bulk of its GDP has been devoted to improving the quality of life of its citizens, and for two weeks is unable to militarily solve the 'Ukraine problem'.

It looks awkward.

I think Russia is zeroing in on its reputation as a country to be feared.

This is good, Ukraine is ready to help.

And the fourth reason is the pressure on Russia itself: Russian citizens are entering an economic panic,

How do you see the development of the conflict in the coming weeks?

""The war of excavations on the fronts will continue. We wanted them and they do not know how to fight, but they will stand in large numbers along the long front without any real progress. Do not forget that the Russian soldiers are hungry here and looting shops. Soldiers, who will loot and die. On the other hand, they will try to attack the cities with the remnants of their rocket weapons. Then Russia will lose its last advantage. ""

What is Ukraine actually building on in the negotiation process? Closing the sky? It does not sound like it is on the table.

""I was not outright deceived.

What is special about Zelsky is that he makes the impossible possible.

For the first three days, our Western partners pretended nothing was happening.

There was no aid, neither humanitarian nor military and no other.

Everyone thought Ukraine was finished.

Then all of a sudden, they opened the borders, started to get sufficient assistance in the field of equipment, finance, in the humanitarian field, so now we are in a pretty comfortable situation now.

This is also Zalanski's achievement.

I am convinced that the sky will also be closed, and there will be an interception of cruise missiles. ""

Zalansky in a speech to the nation: ""We will win""

But time is running out, both for Russia and the Ukrainians who are under siege.

""Every hour someone is killed or experiences indescribable suffering without food, heating or medicine. I want you to understand the meaning of this moment: Ukraine pays and pays the highest price of all, perhaps because in the West they have become accustomed to living comfortably and afraid to look up and face the truth. But for Ukraine Freedom has a supreme value. We will fight for it. Just as Israel proved its right to exist in its territory, and once it considered its existence as its neighbors, so too Ukraine proves that there are strong people in the country, people who value freedom. Not a pathos, it's an awareness that sometimes some countries have to pay a high price for other countries to return to a reasonable position. I mean the Western Partnerships now. ""A great man at the head of Ukraine is a man like Zlansky. It is not impossible that if there was another leader here, we would have been preyed on a long time ago.""

Podoliak estimates that if pressure on Russia and aid to Ukraine increase, the war could continue for another month.

""But it could also be delayed if Russia is willing to go back to the 17th century.""

Were we wrong?

Fixed!

Russian forces inched towards Kyiv early on Saturday and pounded civilian areas in other Ukrainian cities as concerns grew over the besieged southern port of Mariupol, where officials said more than 1,500 people had been killed.

Air raid sirens sounded in several cities, including the capital Kyiv, Odessa, Dnipro and Kharkiv, according to Ukrainian media.

More than two weeks after Moscow shocked the world by invading Ukraine, the United Nations and others said it may be committing war crimes in cities such as Mariupol, which for days has been under attack by Vladimir Putin's forces.

Survivors have been trying to flee Russian bombardment in a freezing city left without water or heating and running out of food. The situation is ""desperate,"" a Doctors Without Borders official said.
