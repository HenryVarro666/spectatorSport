The Office of the Prosecutor General has launched 56 criminal proceedings under articles on war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Ukrainian law enforcement officials as of Sunday, April 10, confirmed the death of 1,222 residents of the Kiev region who died as a result of the invasion of the Russian military, Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said in an interview with Sky News.

“As of the morning of April 10, we found the bodies of 1,222 residents who died during the Russian occupation of the Kiev region,” she said.

Venediktova said that the Office of the Prosecutor General has launched 56 criminal proceedings under articles on war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Ukrainian prosecutor Irina Venediktova reported bodies found in kyivwhich add up to 1,222 bodies in the region around the capital kyiv, which was partially occupied by Russian military forces for several weeks.

“We have so far 1,222 deaths in the kyiv region alone,” Venediktova said.

In an interview in English for the British channel Sky News, Venediktova said that there have been 5,600 investigations for alleged war crimes since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which occurred on February 24.

Ukrainian prosecutor Irina Venediktova he did not say that the bodies found were exclusively of civilians, but last week it indicated that 410 civilians had been found dead in the liberated regions in the vicinity of kyiv.

Although in the interview she confirmed 1,222 bodies, the Ukrainian prosecutor then pointed out that there were undoubtedly more bodies that had not yet been found and examined.

Previously, the town of Bucha, northwest of kyiv, became a symbol of the horrors of war in Ukraine, with around 300 people buried in mass graves.

The official said that among the 5,600 investigations for alleged war crimes against Russia, the Russian missile that fell on the Kramatorsk train station (east), in which 52 civilians died, including five children, is included.

“These people just wanted to save their lives, they wanted to be evacuated,” said Irina Venediktova, a Ukrainian prosecutor.

The attorney general also thanked British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who paid a surprise visit on Saturday, during which he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and promised new weapons.

“What Putin did in Bucha and Irpin were war crimes that have permanently damaged their reputation,” Johnson said, referring to the two small towns near the Ukrainian capital now confirmed to find bodies in kyiv.

Heavy shelling bombarded residents in eastern regions of the country throughout the weekend - adding to mounting casualties six weeks into the conflict.

The UN said on Sunday that 4,232 civilian casualties had been recorded in Ukraine to date, with 1,793 killed and 2,439 injured.

And Ukraine's prosecutor Venediktova confirmed 1,222 bodies had been found in the region around Kyiv alone so far.

It includes at least two corpses discovered inside a manhole at a petrol station on a motorway outside the capital yesterday, with the bodies appearing to be dressed in a mix of civilian and military clothing.

One distraught woman peered into the manhole before breaking down, clawing at the earth and wailing, 'my son, my son'.

As Russian forces were engaged in an offensive against Kyiv in the first weeks of Moscow's invasion, a number of communities surrounding the capital, including Makariv, Bucha, Irpin and Dmytrivka remained under constant fire.

With most of the towns and villages around Kyiv now seized back, discoveries of mass graves and civilian casualties have triggered a wave of international condemnation, in particular over deaths in the town of Bucha, northwest of the capital.

Residents have been urged to flee the east of the country ahead of 'important battles', but the bombing of civilians at a train station in the city of Kramatorsk - leaving many too afraid to attempt to escape.

Meanwhile, officials have said shelling also claimed two lives in Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv, in the northeast, on Sunday morning - the day after 10 civilians, including a child, died in bombing to the southeast of the city.

Regional Governor Oleg Sinegoubov said on Telegram: 'The Russian army continues to wage war on civilians due to a lack of victories at the front.'

It comes after a new grave with dozens of Ukrainian civilians was found on Saturday in Buzova, a liberated village near the capital Kyiv that for weeks was occupied by Russian forces, a local official said.

Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova and several other nearby villages, told Ukrainian television that the bodies were found in a ditch near a petrol station. The number of dead is yet to be confirmed.

'Now, we are returning to life, but during the occupation we had our ""hotspots"", many civilians died,' Didych said.

Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the report.

President Volodymyr Zelensky again condemned atrocities against civilians and, after speaking with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said they had agreed 'that all perpetrators of war crimes must be identified and punished'.

Ukraine's prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova also said the country was examining the alleged culpability of 500 leading Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, for thousands of war crimes.

Meanwhile, the death toll at a railway station in the city of Kramatorsk struck by a Russian bomb on Friday is understood to have now risen to 57 people, according to the governor of the Donetsk region.

Residents have been attempting to flee the east of the country in their thousands ahead of 'important battles' against Putin's forces, Zelensky has said.

He added: 'We see the preparations for important battles, some people say decisive ones, in the east.

'We are ready to fight and to look in parallel to end this war through diplomacy.'

As Russian forces continue to regroup, Ukrainian officials are urging residents to leave the area.

But Lugansk governor Sergiy Gaiday said in a new video that civilians are afraid to flee the region after the tragedy in Kramatorsk.

On Saturday, Zelenskiy said that while the threat to Kyiv had receded, Ukraine was preparing for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country. Ukrainian officials have called on people in the east of the country to flee.

Only hours before, the bodies of 132 civilians were found shot dead in Makariv, a town in Kyiv Oblast and about 30 miles west of the capital. All died from bullet wounds, the town's mayor said.

Roughly 40 percent of the town has been destroyed, according to reports, which came after Ukrainian troops recaptured it from Russian occupation on March 22. Officials have been counting the dead ever since.

Similar scenes have been found in the nearby town of Bucha, where more than 400 dead civilians were discovered. The majority had also been gunned down.

Workers unearthed bodies from a mass grave in the commuter town, as graphic evidence of dozens of killings emerged following the withdrawal of Russian forces.

As evidence of war crimes mount against the Kremlin, its forces continue to face strong Ukrainian resistance.

According to a Friday update from Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD), Russia's attempts to establish a land corridor between Crimea and the eastern Donbas region 'continue to be thwarted by Ukrainian resistance.'

After failing to take Kyiv in the face of stiff resistance, Russian forces have set their sights on the eastern Donbas region, the mostly Russian-speaking, industrial area where Moscow-backed rebels have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years and control some places.

The MoD said that in northern Ukraine Russian forces have 'fully withdrawn' to Belarus and Russia.

'At least some of these forces will be transferred to East Ukraine to fight in the Donbas,' it said early on Friday morning.

Some analysts have suggested that the focus on the Donbas and the pledge to de-escalate may merely be an effort to put a positive spin on reality: Moscow's ground forces have been thwarted - and have taken heavy losses - in their bid to seize the capital and other cities.

Before Russian president Vladimir Putin launched his invasion on February 24, Makariv had been a picturesque home to around 15,000 people.

According to reports, the town has a historic Jewish community. Putin - and Russian propaganda - has claimed Moscow's invasion is 'de-nazifying' Ukraine, as an attempt to justify the war.

'As of yesterday, we have found 132 civilians who have been shot dead by the Russian orcs,' Vadym Tokar, Makariv Village Head, said on television on Friday.

He added that 40 percent of the town had been destroyed, saying it would not be possible to restore many of the buildings.

Pictures from the town - that lies 18 miles south-west of Bucha - show scenes of devastation that have become all-too common in Ukraine.

Homes lie in ruins from artillery fire, twisted metal from destroyed military hardware lines the streets, and locals walk amongst the rubble.

In one photo posted by Ukraine's territorial defence forces, a teenage boy is shown lying face-down in a forest.

The officials said his hands were bound and he was shot in the back. In another, a grenade has been fastened to a pair of double doors in an apparent booby-trap set by retreating Russian forces.

Police said earlier this week they had found at least 20 bodies in Makariv. In the village of Andriivka, residents said the Russians arrived in early March, took locals' phones and detained and then released some people.

Others met unknown fates. Some described sheltering for weeks in cellars normally used for storing vegetables.

Bodies are still being collected in Bucha. Cemetery workers on Wednesday began loading more than 60 bodies into a grocery shipping truck so they could be taken to a facility for further investigation.

Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk has said investigators found at least three sites of mass shootings of civilians and were still finding bodies in yards, parks and city squares - 90 percent of whom were shot.

Russia has falsely claimed that the scenes in Bucha were staged.

Makariv is also close to the E40 highway, which was the scene of more horrific discoveries last week, when BBC investigators found 13 civilian bodies along one short stretch of the road.

Two of the bodies were of a couple who were killed in early March trying to escape the capital when they came under fire from a Russian tank crew.

The man - a husband and father - was shown in other drone footage stopping his car and getting out with his hands up in a sign of surrender. The crew gunned him down anyway.

Earlier this week, a Russian commander allegedly ordered his troops to shoot at Ukrainian civilians near the besieged southern port city of Mariupol.

In a foul-mouthed radio dispatch intercepted by Ukraine's SBU and published on the security service's official Facebook account, an unnamed soldier details the positions of non-combatants to nearby troops in a village near the southern port city.

His superior then demands: 'Take them all f**king out', before doubling down on his bloodcurdling instructions as the troop says that two people emerging from a nearby grove were dressed in 'civilian clothes'.

The commander screams: 'Off them all, f**k!'.

The horrific scenes from the region began to emerge as Russian forces began to pull back, allowing Ukraine's forces and journalists back into the area for the first time in more than a month.

The discoveries in Bucha and the regions outside of Kyiv have resulted in Ukrainian allies tightening sanction on Russia further, with the European Union announcing an embargo on Russian coal and a ban on Russian vessels at its ports.

And at the United Nations on Thursday, the General Assembly voted to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council, only the second-ever suspension of a country from the body.

The attack on Kramatorsk's station has led to calls for sanctions to go even further, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying he wants a tough global response to the attack.

The Kremlin insists its troops have committed no war crimes and alleged the images of brutality coming out of Bucha were staged by the Ukrainians. It claimed yesterday that the attack on the station was also carried out by Ukraine's military.

Mr Zelensky's voice rose in anger during his nightly address on Friday, when he said the strike on the Kramatorsk train station, where 4,000 people were trying to flee a looming Russian offensive in the east, amounted to another war crime.

Dozens of people were severely injured in the strike and the dead included children.

Photos taken after the attack showed bodies covered with tarpaulins and the remnants of a rocket painted with the words 'For the children' in Russian.

The Russian phrasing seemed to suggest the missile was sent to avenge the loss or subjugation of children, although its exact meaning remained unclear.

It is believed to be the result of Russian propaganda brainwashing troops into believing Ukraine is carrying out atrocities in the east of the country.

The strike seemed to shock world leaders.

'There are almost no words for it,' European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters during a visit to Ukraine. 'The cynical behaviour (by Russia) has almost no benchmark any more.'

Mr Zelensky said: 'Like the massacres in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile attack on Kramatorsk should be one of the charges at the tribunal that must be held.'

Although the train station is in Ukrainian government-controlled territory in the Donbas, Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out the attack, as did the region's Moscow-backed separatists who work closely with Russian troops.

Western experts, however, dismissed Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov's assertion that Russian forces 'do not use' that type of missile.

A Western official said Russia's forces have used the missile - and that given the strike's location and impact, it was likely Russia's.

Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, added that only Russia would have reason to target railway infrastructure in the Donbas, as it is critical for the Ukrainian military's efforts to reinforce its units.

Mr Bronk pointed to other occasions when Russian authorities have tried to deflect blame by claiming their forces no longer use an older weapon 'to kind of muddy the waters and try and create doubt'.

He suggested Russia specifically chose the missile type because Ukraine also possesses them.

Ukrainian authorities and Western officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of atrocities in the war that began on February 24.

More than 4 million Ukrainians have fled the country, and millions more have been displaced.

According to the mayor of Bucha, Anatoly Fedorouk, almost 300 people in total had to be buried “in mass graves” in the city, the scene of fierce fighting and which has just been recovered by Ukrainian soldiers.

“In Bucha, we have already buried 280 people in mass graves” because it was impossible to do so in the three cemeteries in the municipality, all within reach of Russian soldiers, Fedorouk told AFP by telephone.

In the south, the Red Cross is struggling to evacuate thousands of people trapped in the port of Mariupol without food, water and electricity.

After five weeks of the military campaign ordered on February 24 by Vladimir Putin, which left some areas of Ukraine in ruins, Russia announced in recent days that it would reduce attacks on Kiev and the city of Chernihiv (north).

On Saturday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhaylo Podoliak confirmed that a “rapid withdrawal” from Russia is observed in the regions.





“With the rapid withdrawal of the Russians from Kiev and Chernihiv (…) it is quite clear that Russia has chosen another tactic of priority: withdrawing to the east and south, maintaining control of vast occupied territories and conquering a powerful foothold. in the region,” Podoliak wrote on Telegram, echoing President Volodymyr Zelensky’s warning about a reorganization of Russian forces.

The governor of the Chernihiv region, Viacheslav Chaus, said the town of the same name, devastated by fighting in recent weeks, did not suffer new attacks in the early hours of Saturday.

“The Russians are withdrawing from the Chernihiv region,” he said.

The horror of war, however, does not stop at the capital. Ukrainian photographer and documentary filmmaker Maks Levin was found dead near Kiev after being reported missing for more than two weeks.

“He disappeared in the hostilities zone on March 13, in the Kiev region. On April 1, his body was found near the town of Gouta Mezhyguirska,” said Presidential Cabinet Secretary Andrey Yrmak.

In addition to regaining control around Kiev, Ukrainian troops were advancing in the southern Kherson region, the only major city Russia has managed to occupy since February 24.

“We certainly cannot avoid using heavy weapons if we want to liberate the east and Kherson and push the Russians as far away as possible,” Podoliak said.

The situation is different in the strategic port of Mariupol, on the Sea of ​​Azov, in the south of the country, which is surrounded and where humanitarian conditions are catastrophic.

Mariupol has endured weeks of intense Russian bombardment, with at least 5,000 inhabitants dead, according to local authorities, and the 160,000 people remaining in the city suffering from a lack of food, water and electricity.

“We managed to rescue 6,266 people, including 3,071 from Mariupol,” President Zelensky said in a video message on Saturday.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Friday that 42 buses with speakers from Mariupol left Berdiansk, 70 km to the southeast, and another 12 departed Melitopol with city residents.

Dozens of buses carrying Ukrainians who fled the destruction in Mariupol arrived on Friday in Zaporizhzhia, 200 km to the northwest.

“We cried when we got to this area. We cried when we saw the soldiers at the checkpoint with Ukrainian flags in their arms,” ​​said Olena, who was carrying her little daughter on her lap.

“My house was destroyed, I saw it in pictures. Our city no longer exists,” he added.

The International Red Cross announced that it intends to make another effort to evacuate civilians in Mariupol, after a failed attempt on Friday “when conditions made it impossible to proceed”, according to the organization.

The UN reported that more than 4.1 million people had fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion.

This Saturday, during a visit to Malta, Pope Francis called for “broad and shared responses to the growing migration emergency”.

“The expansion of the migratory emergency – let us think of the refugees from the martyred Ukraine – requires broad and shared responses. They cannot let just a few countries bear the whole problem, while others remain indifferent,” the pope declared in a speech at the presidential palace in Valletta.

Peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian authorities continued on Friday via video conference, but the Kremlin warned that a Ukrainian helicopter attack on a fuel depot in the Russian city of Belgorod would affect the talks.

“This cannot be seen as creating appropriate conditions for the continuation of negotiations,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

The air strike hit a fuel depot belonging to the Rosneft energy group 40 km from the Ukrainian border.

Kiev has refused to claim responsibility for the attack. Interviewed by Fox News about the Russian accusation, Zelensky said: “Sorry, I don’t discuss any of my orders as commander in chief.”

The Ukrainian president reiterated his call for the West to provide more military support to the country.

The Pentagon has announced that it will allocate $300 million in “security assistance” to bolster Ukraine’s defense, in addition to the $1.6 billion that Washington has provided since the start of the Russian invasion.

The package includes laser guided rocket systems, drones, munitions, night vision devices, tactical communication systems, medical equipment and spare parts.

Russia faces unprecedented Western sanctions that have driven multinational companies to flee the country. US officials said the Russian economy is likely to face a 10% contraction.

China, Russia’s major trade ally, has denied that it “deliberately” avoids Western sanctions against Moscow, a day after receiving an EU warning that any Beijing support for the Kremlin would damage economic ties with Europe.

The Ukrainian economy also suffers from the devastating effects of the war: GDP fell by 16% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, according to estimates by the Ministry of Economy.",https://playcrazygame.com/2022/04/03/russia-withdraws-from-northern-ukraine-after-weeks-of-devastating-bombing-news/
