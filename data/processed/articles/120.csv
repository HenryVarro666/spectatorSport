It's the most destructive known strike the Ukrainian military has conducted against Russian helicopters during the war, with at least three Russian helicopters seen on fire, or destroyed, at the airport.

Military vehicles seen near the airport have also been hit.

Another image, taken by a drone hovering above the nearby village of Komyshany, also shows the large plume of smoke rising from the airport.

CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the image.

The military strike at the airport was picked up by NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), which tracks large fires around the world.

According to the sensory data collected by FIRMS, the military strike occurred around 1:42 p.m. local time.

This is the second major Ukrainian attack in as many weeks on this base. Russian forces first claimed to have taken control of Kherson, which occupies a strategic location on the northern shore of the Dnieper River, some two weeks ago.

The image, portions of which are seen below, was taken at 11:35 AM UTC, or 1:35 PM local time on March 15th, 2022. Multiple large fire sources, including a number of burning helicopters, can be clearly seen on one of the base's main ramps. Thick black smoke emanating from various points could well be obscuring additional damage beyond what is readily visible. There do appear to be other fires burning under the smoke plume, indicating core infrastructure at the base was also damaged or destroyed. A number of other small fires burn around the base — which is just covered with vehicles following Russia's seizure of it — as well.

There are destroyed helicopters visible elsewhere around the airfield, as can be seen below on the facility's northwest landing pads area. However, none of them appears to be actively burning and some of these losses are the result of prior attacks.

Reports that Ukrainian forces had used unspecified weapons to strike Kherson Airbase, which is collocated with the Kherson International Airport, began to emerge on social media earlier today. Pictures and videos showing a large plume of black smoke rising from the facility have also been circulating online. Heat mapping data typically used to track forest fires had already indicated that there were a number of significant fires at the airfield.

The Planet Labs satellite image that The War Zone obtained also underscores how much of a target-rich environment the base is at present, both in terms of aircraft and ground vehicles, some of which may have been left behind by withdrawing Ukrainian forces. Previous satellite imagery had indicated that Russian forces had moved dozens of helicopters to Kherson Airbase after taking control of the city. In addition, an absolutely massive number of vehicles are now there, which were not present in a prior image taken on February 28th.

Though it is unknown what type of weapons Ukrainian forces may have employed in today's attack, there are indications that they have previously used artillery rockets to strike Kherson Airbase. On March 7, Ukrainian officials claimed to have destroyed 30 helicopters in an earlier attack, but satellite imagery that subsequently emerged showed more limited destruction. The base is now pock-marked all over with impact craters, which indicates indirect fire, and likely rockets, did the damage.

Though the full of extent of the damage caused by both attacks remains unclear, there seems to be little doubt that Russian forces have sustained significant losses in both instances and that their Ukrainian opponents continue to have the ability to hold the base at risk.

Update 3/16/2022:

A new Maxar image of Kherson Airbase taken today shows even more damage than was visible in the shot The War Zone obtained yesterday.

Video footage reportedly shot by Russian forces within Kherson Airbase after the attack has now emerged online. Though unconfirmed, what is seen in the clip, including multiple damaged and destroyed helicopters and ground vehicles, is well in line with what is visible in the latest available satellite imagery and depicts widespread destruction at the base.

We will continue to update this story with more information as it becomes available.

Reports claim that three military helicopters were destroyed on Monday as black smoke was seen billowing from the airport. Large fires around the world are tracked by NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) and the burning wreckage of the Russian aircraft was picked up by the system.

The data collected from the NASA system has said that the military strike occurred around 1.42pm local time. Russian forces claimed control of Kherson two weeks ago with this strike being the second major attack from Ukrainian forces in an attempt to reclaim their key port. The amount of smoke coming from the tarmac at the international airport may be obscuring further damage caused by the military strike. Other smaller fires can be seen around the base including under the plume of smoke which shows that core infrastructure at the airport has also been damaged.

At other areas of the base, wreckage of scorched helicopters can be seen that are no longer burning and showing some of the results of previous attacks on the base. People have taken to Twitter to express their views on the attack on the airbase, with one user Tim McMillan, a retired Police lieutenant, posting his analysis of drone footage. He said: “Drone footage, likewise, shows smoke billowing from the airport. “Russia has been using the airport to stage large formations of helicopters and equipment, so it’s likely today’s strike put a dent in Russia’s combat power in the south.” READ MORE:Covid travel rules change - Every measure that's been lifted

The Kremlin claimed to have full control of the Kherson region on Tuesday, though the claim made by Russia’s defence ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenov, has not been verified. The UK Ministry of Defence has issued a warning that Russia may attempt to appoint a pro-Moscow government in Kherson in an attempt to assert “political control”. Russia “may seek to stage a ‘referendum’ in Kherson in an attempt to legitimise the area as a ‘breakaway republic’ similar to Donetsk and Luhansk and Crimea.” DON'T MISS:

At least two people were killed this morning in an air strike on an apartment building in Kyiv, the rescue service announced, stating that several neighborhoods of the capital of Ukraine are being shot at, which the Russian army is trying to surround.



The emergency service announced on Facebook that a 15-storey skyscraper in the Sviatoshynskyi Raion in the western part of Kyiv was hit by an air strike, and then the entire building caught fire.



It is stated that two bodies were found on the spot and that 27 people were rescued.



In that explosion, all the windows of that building were broken, as well as the building in its vicinity, a journalist from the Agency France-Presse reported from the scene.



The intensity of the fighting has doubled in recent days around Kyiv, which is almost completely surrounded by Russian forces. More than half, out of a population of three million, have left the city.
