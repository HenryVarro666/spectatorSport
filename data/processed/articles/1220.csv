Russian forces have seized Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to a local authority, after intense fighting during which shelling caused a fire to break out a training facility on the site.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate said on Thursday that “armed forces of the Russian Federation have occupied the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant” shortly after the fire was extinguished.

The blaze at a training building in the complex – Europe’s largest nuclear power plant – had prompted global concern, with the United States and the United Kingdom calling for an end to fighting in the area.

Ukraine’s emergency services said the hours-long fire was extinguished at 6:20am local time [04:20 GMT] on Thursday and that there were no victims.

Local authorities also said the blaze did not affect “essential” equipment at the plant, which provides more than a fifth of total electricity generated in Ukraine, and did not cause an immediate rise in radiation levels.

Ukraine’s President Volodomy Zelenskyy angrily denounced the attack, in a video message saying: “No country other than Russia has ever fired on nuclear power units.”

“This is the first time in our history. In the history of mankind. The terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror,” he added, calling for global help.

“If there is an explosion, it is the end of everything. The end of Europe. This is the evacuation of Europe. Only immediate European action can stop Russian troops.”

Russia’s defence ministry blamed the attack on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a “monstrous provocation”.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson meanwhile accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of “reckless actions” that he said “could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe” and called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council.

The US Department of Energy also activated its nuclear incident response team as a precaution.

‘Reactors being shut down’

The fire broke out early on Thursday morning following fierce fighting in the area about 550km (342 miles) southeast of Kyiv, the mayor of the nearby town of Enerdohar said in an online post.

“As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,” Mayor Dmytro Orlov said on his Telegram channel.

Images on a live feed from the plant at the time showed blasts lighting up the night sky and sending up plumes of smoke.

Shortly afterwards, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said the Russian army was “firing from all sides” on the plant.

“Fire has already broke out … Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!” he wrote on Twitter.

Despite the fears, after several hours of uncertainty, Ukrainian authorities said the site had been secured.

“The director of the plant said that the nuclear safety is now guaranteed,” Oleksandr Starukh, head of the military administration of the Zaporizhzhia region, said on Facebook.

“According to those responsible for the plant, a training building and a laboratory were affected by the fire,” he added.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had been told by Ukraine’s regulator that “there has been no change reported in radiation levels” at the site.

“Ukraine tells IAEA that fire at site of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant has not affected ‘essential’ equipment, plant personnel taking mitigatory actions,” the watchdog added in a tweet.

US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm also tweeted that “the plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”.

US President Joe Biden also spoke with Zelenskyy to get an update on the situation at the plant.

“President Biden joined President Zelenskyy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said.

Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, about 100km north of Kyiv, which spewed radioactive waste over much of Europe when it melted down in 1986.

The Zaporizhzhia plant is a different and safer type, some analysts said.

“The power plant itself, if it was hit, would not generate the radioactivity or in all likelihood that Chernobyl did,” Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, told Al Jazeera. “But if the spent fuel pond, which is where they put the used fuel, was hit – it could easily be a multiple of the effect of Chernobyl.”

The hit on Zaporizhzhia came as the biggest attack on a European state since World War II entered its ninth day.

The conflict has killed and wounded thousands of people, while one million refugees have fled Ukraine and Russia’s economy has been rocked by international sanctions.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that is not designed to occupy territory but to topple the democratically elected government, destroy its neighbour’s military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

Ukrainian authorities said on Friday Russian shelling had caused a fire at a building in the plant complex that was later put out. The blaze raised alarm from leaders worldwide of a potential massive disaster. Russia blamed the attack on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a “monstrous provocation”.

Here is what we know so far:

Where is it located?

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is located in the southern Ukraine steppe on the Dnieper River, some 550 kilometres (342 miles) southeast of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and about 525km (325 miles) south of Chernobyl, the site of the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident in 1986, which has also now been seized by Russian forces.

The plant has a total capacity of about 6,000 megawatts, enough to power about roughly four million homes.

On Wednesday, residents carrying Ukrainian flags had blocked the road to the plant, in an apparent standoff with Russian forces.

What happened?

But on Friday Russian troops were accused of attacking the plant, in an assault Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy branded “nuclear terror” and said could endanger the continent.

A video feed from the plant showed shelling and smoke rising near a building at the plant compound.

The night-time footage showed one building aflame, and a volley of incoming shells, before a large candescent ball lit up the sky, exploding beside a car park and sending smoke billowing across the compound.

The emergency services, in a statement on Facebook, said “the fire in the training building of Zaporizhzhia NPP in Energodar was extinguished” at 06:20 (04:20 GMT).

“There are no victims,” it added.

The Ukraine regulatory authority also said the fire at the site had not affected “essential” equipment and personnel were taking mitigatory actions. They also said there “was no reported change in radiation levels at the plant”.

The mayor of the nearby town of Enerdohar said fierce fighting and “continuous enemy shelling” had caused casualties in the area, without providing details.

Later on Friday, local authorities said Russian military forces had seized the power plant, while operational personnel “were monitoring the condition of power units”.

Is there a radiation danger?

The reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant operate on fuel enriched with fissile isotope uranium-235.

They work by the core heating steam, but unlike other reactors, the nuclear-contaminated steam is not used to generate energy. Instead, it is used to power another uncontaminated steam circuit which then turns the turbines.

This means that radiation levels for workers at the plant are relatively low.

Background radiation levels around the plant are currently about 0.1 microsieverts per hour, according to the plant’s operator.

That is below the global average of background radiation and much less than flying on an aeroplane or getting an x-ray.

During the Chernobyl disaster, radiation levels were about 300 sieverts per hour, many millions of times higher.

United States energy secretary Jennifer Granholm and The International Atomic Energy Agency also confirmed there were no “elevated radiation readings near the facility”.

“These plants were never designed to be in a warzone and they are not capable of dealing with the vulnerabilities that are inherent with being in a fire zone,” Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, told Al Jazeera.

“If they do other military operations either there or in other reactors, something relating to the main power core or the spent fuel pond would release an enormous amount of radioactivity.”

Reactions

Early reports of the incident at the power plant sent financial markets in Asia spiralling, with stocks tumbling and oil prices surging further.

There were quick reactions to the attack. Zelenskyy in a video address called on “Europeans, please wake up. Tell your politicians Russian troops are shooting at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi blamed Russia for having shelled the nuclear power plant.

“For the first time in history, a country has committed nuclear terrorism”, he said in a video.

He reminded that Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors and the Russian army action could force “the evacuation of Europe”.

The mayor of the nearby town of Energodar about 550 km (342 miles) southeast of Kyiv said fierce fighting and “continuous enemy shelling” had caused casualties in the area, without providing details.

Thousands of people are believed to have been killed or wounded and more than 1 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin last Thursday launched the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

Early reports of the incident at the power plant sent financial markets in Asia spiralling, with stocks tumbling and oil prices surging further.

“Markets are worried about nuclear fallout. The risk is that there is a miscalculation or over-reaction and the war prolongs,” said Vasu Menon, executive director of investment strategy at OCBC Bank.

Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, about 100 km north of Kyiv, which spewed radioactive waste over much of Europe when it melted down in 1986. The Zaporizhzhia plant is a different and safer type, some analysts said.

US President Joe Biden spoke with Zelenskiy to get an update on the situation at the plant.

“President Biden joined President Zelenskiy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said.

Energy Secretary Granholm said on Twitter the reactors at Zaporizhzhia were “protected by robust containment structures” and were being “safely shut down”.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a tweet that it was “aware of reports of shelling” at the power plant and was in contact with Ukrainian authorities.

Fighting rages, sanctions mount

On Thursday, Russia and Ukraine negotiators agreed to the need for humanitarian corridors to help civilians escape and to deliver medicines and food to the areas where fighting was the fiercest.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said a temporary halt to fighting in select locations was also possible.

The negotiators will meet again next week, the Belarusian state news agency Belta quoted Podolyak as saying.

Only one Ukrainian city, the southern port of Kherson, has fallen to Russian forces since the invasion was launched on 24 February, but Russian forces continue to surround and attack other cities. Mariupol, the main port on the Sea of Azov, was surrounded and under heavy bombardment. Water and power was cut off, and officials say they cannot evacuate the wounded.

Video posted on Twitter from Mariupol, and verified by Reuters, showed parked vehicles burning while non-stop firing reverberated around surrounding apartment blocks.

The northeastern city of Kharkiv has been under attack since the start of the invasion, but defenders are holding out in the heavily shelled city.

While no major assault has been launched on Kyiv, the capital has been shelled, and Russian forces unleashed devastating firepower to break resistance in the outlying town of Borodyanka.

In Washington, a US defense official said Russian troops were still 25 km from Kyiv city centre. Earlier on Thursday, the British Ministry of Defence said a huge Russia convoy rumbling southwards toward Kyiv, was advancing slowly, partly due to resistance, but also due to logisitical issues.

The United States and Britain announced sanctions on more Russian oligarchs on Thursday, following on from EU measures, as they ratcheted up the pressure on the Kremlin.

More companies including Alphabet Inc’s Google, footwear giant Nike and Swedish home furnishing firm IKEA shut down or reduced operations in Russia as trade restrictions and supply constraints added to political pressure.

Ikea suspends Russia, Belarus operations, affecting 15,000 staff Swedish furniture giant Ikea said Thursday (3 March) it would suspend its activities in Russia and Belarus, affecting nearly 15,000 employees, 17 stores and three production sites, in response to the war in Ukraine.

Sanctions have “had a profound impact already,” Biden said.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that is not designed to occupy territory but to topple the democratically elected government, destroy its neighbour’s military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. It denies targeting civilians.

Russian human rights activist and former world chess champion Garry Kasparov called on Western countries to eject Russia from the global police agency Interpol, and impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

“Russia should be thrown back into the Stone Age to make sure that the oil and gas industry and any other sensitive industries that are vital for survival of the regime cannot function without Western technological support,” Kasparov said.

With Russian forces occupying one of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants as well the site of the decommissioned Chernobyl facility, the world is getting an unprecedented look at the first major war to ever take place in a country with an established nuclear power infrastructure.

Ukraine runs 15 nuclear reactors accounting for about half of its electricity generation, according to the World Nuclear Association. But seven of these reactors have been disconnected from the grid since Russian attacks began on February 24 in order to keep them cool.

Last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency and Ukrainian nuclear authorities acknowledged that the six reactors of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine had fallen into Russian hands after an intense fire fight that saw a training laboratory on plant premises catch fire.

Now, according to reports from the BBC, Russian troops are training their sights on the three reactors South Ukraine nuclear power plant near the city of Mykolaiv in the country’s southern central region.

The Zaporizhzhya plant – which is Europe’s largest nuclear power station – is now surrounded by the invading troops while Ukrainian technicians continue monitoring plant functions from the inside. Ukrainian regulators have claimed that Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear corporation, has sent engineers to the plant who are now giving orders to the captive staff.

But in a March 12 statement on its website (which may be inaccessible after an attack by the Anonymous hacker group) Rosatom denied that, and characterizing the presence of its engineers at the Ukrainian plant as “consultative assistance” which takes place on “a regular basis.”

Last week, Russian troops detonated ammunition on Zaporizhzhya plant territory that hadn’t exploded during their March 4 attack, though reportedly caused no damage to plant structure. None of the plant’s six reactors, only two of which are currently operational, were affected and there was no radiation leak.

On February 25th, the second day of the invasion, Russian troops overran Chernobyl, which now stores 20,000 spent nuclear fuel rods. The defunct site also houses the remains of the plant’s exploded Number 4 reactor, which is slowly being dismantled under a huge steel dome. The staff that perform those critical activities had been held hostage until last weekend, when about half of them were finally allowed to rotate out after 600 hours on the job since the Russian invasion began.

On two separate occasions, power has been cut to the plant by fighting in the area, leaving critical spent fuel storage pools and radiation ventilation structures without electricity. Power has since been restored, the IAEA reported, but the situation highlights how vulnerable Ukraine’s nuclear facilities are to Russian military aggression.

Now that the coming days could bring the seizure by Russian troops of the South Ukraine plant, we thought it would be useful to revisit our 2018 report on the Ukrainian nuclear industry and highlight the basic characteristics of each of the country’s four Soviet- and Russian-built nuclear power stations.

The Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: Ralf1969

Reactor type: Six Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000/320s

Location: The Zaporizhzhya plant is situated on the steppes along the Kakhovka reservoir in the Zaporizhzhya Oblast of Ukraine, near the city of Enerhodar, 690 kilometers southeast of Kyiv. It is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, consisting of six nuclear power units, each with a capacity of 1000 mW. The power produced by the plant provides one fifth of the total power used in Ukraine.

Reactor construction: Soviet authorities adopted the decision to build the plant in 1978 and construction started in 1981. Between 1984 and 1987, Units One, Two, Three and Four were commissioned.

Unit Five was commissioned in 1989 and Unit Six began operations only in 1995, after a post-Chernobyl moratorium on new reactor construction was lifted.

Special spent fuel storage features: The Zaporizhzhya plant is the first in Ukraine to use a dry spent fuel storage facility. Under this scheme, spent fuel elements that have been previously cooled in spent fuel pools for at least five years, during which their residual energy is released, are then transferred to the dry storage facility. There, the assemblies are stored vertically and ventilated by air. The dry spent fuel storage facility at Zaporizhzhya when into service in August of 2001.

Reactor Lifetime extensions: Units One, Two, Four and Five at the Zaporizhzhya plant have received lifetime extensions. Unit One was due to retire in 2015 but will run until 2025. Unit Two was due to retire in 2016 but will run until 2026. Unit Four was due to retire in 2018 but will run until 2028. Unit Five was due to retire in 2028 but will run until 2030. Unit Three was shut down in 2017 for upgrades associated with a lifetime extensions, though one has not yet been granted.

Notable events: The startup of Unit One was delayed by 11 months because of a fire that occurred at the reactor on January 27, 1984. News about the fire was concealed from the public until Gorbachev’s policy of Glasnost began six years later.

In May of 2014, several armed men representing a far-right political group attempted to gain access to the plant but were stopped by Ukrainian police. The plant’s proximity to the fighting that has ground on in the Donbas region for the last eight years, prior to the outbreak of the current war, has made the plant vulnerable to military attack.

How many reactors currently running: Two, both at reduced power.

The Khmelnitsky Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: RLuts

Reactor type: Two Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000s

Location: The Khmelnistky nuclear plant is located in the northern part of the Khmelnitsky region 350 kilometers west of Kyiv in an area of high seismic activity. The plant operates 2 Russian-built VVER-1000 reactors, each produced 1000 mW.

Reactor construction: Soviet authorities adopted the decision to build the plant in 1975 and originally envisioned that it would consist of 4 reactors. Construction on Unit One began in 1981 and finished in 1987, and construction on Unit Two commenced in 1983 but its completion was delayed by a 1990 government-imposed moratorium on new reactor construction. After the moratorium was lifted, construction on Unit Two resumed. But lack of financing protracted the project, and it wasn’t completed until 2005.

The plant’s remaining two reactors were originally planned for construction under a 2011 deal with Atomstroyexport, Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom’s foreign wing. That deal was annulled in 2015, following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea. A 2016 deal with a Korean power firm to complete the reactors has made little progress.

Also unclear is whether a 2021 deal between the plant and Westinghouse to build an AP 1000 reactor at the site will ever go forward.

Reactor Lifetime Extensions: One reactor at the Khmelnitsky plant has received a lifetime extension. Unit One reactor was scheduled to retire in 2018 but will run until 2028.

Notable Events: In 1987, there was a release of radioactive steam in Unit One’s containment room. The incident was rated by the International Nuclear Event Scale as a 3 its seven-point scale, denoting a “serious” incident with consequences contained within the plant.

How many reactors currently running: One.

The Rivne Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: Victor Korniyenko

Reactor Type: Two Soviet/Russian built VVER 440, two Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000

Location: The Rivne Nuclear plant is located near the town of Varash (known as Kuznetsovsk until 2016) in the Rivne Oblast in Ukraine’s northwest, 390 kilometers west of Kyiv. The combined power of the four units it operates is 2835 mW.

Reactor Construction: The plant operates four reactors, two Soviet-built VVER-440s and two Soviet/Russian-built VVER-1000s. It was the first nuclear plant in Ukraine to see the construction of the VVER series reactor, which were a departure from the Soviet designed graphite moderated RBMK-type reactors, one of which exploded at Chernobyl in 1986.

Originally conceived by the Soviets in 1971 as the West Ukraine nuclear plant, the name was changed to Rivne during commissioning. Construction in 1973 and two VVER-440 units were commissioning in 1980 and 1981. Unit Three, which was the first of the two VVER-1000s, was commissioned in 1986.

Unit Four was scheduled to be commissioned in 1991, but the Ukrainian government’s 1990 moratorium on new reactor builds prevented that. After the moratorium was lifted, construction on Four resumed in 1993, and it finally entered commercial service in 2006.

Reactor Lifetime extensions: Units One, Two and Three at the Rivne plant have received lifetime extensions: Unit One was due to retire in 2010 but will run until 2030. Unit Two was due to retire in 2011 but will run until 2031. Unit Three was due to retire in 2017 but was granted a 20-year extension to run until 2037.

Notable Events: In December of 2010, Units One and Two of the Rivne plant were granted lifetime extensions of 20 years, nearly doubling their original 30 life expectancy, and putting off their decommissioning until the early 2030s. In 2018, Unit Three received an identical extension, putting off its retirement until 2037.

Another safety issue at the plant is the ground on which it stands, which is characterized by shifting soils and sinkholes, which, if not properly monitored, could endanger plant infrastructure.

Location: The South Ukraine nuclear plant is located near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk in the Mykolaiv Oblast 350 kilometers south of Kyiv. It is Ukraine’s second largest functioning nuclear plant and is part of the South Ukrainian Energy Complex, along with the Tashlyk Pumped-Storage Power Plant and the Oleksandrivska hydroelectric plant. The plant lies on the steppes on the banks of the Pivdennyi Bug River and its three reactors generate 2850 mW of electicity.

Reactor Construction: Construction of the South Ukraine nuclear plant’s Unit One began in 1975 and was completed in 1983. Units One and Two followed in 1985 and 1989, respectively. A fourth reactor was planned but its construction was suspended by Soviet order.

Reactor lifetime extensions: Two reactors at the South Ukraine nuclear plant have received lifetime extensions and one was shutdown in 2019 to accommodate upgrades toward an extension.

All three reactors at the South Ukraine nuclear plant have received lifetime extensions. Unit One was due to retire in 2013 but will run until 2023. Unit Two was due to retire in 2015 but will run until 2025. Unit Three was due to run until 2020 and is undergoing upgrades that would see it run until 2030.

Notable events: The South Ukraine plant became the first to burn fuel fabricated by western nuclear fuel supplier Westinghouse – part of an effort to wean the Ukrainian industry off its dependents on fuel produced in Russia by TVEL.

In 2005, the plant’s Unit Three was loaded with a mixture of Russian and experimental Westinghouse assemblies for a period of pilot operation. However, the test was unsuccessful with Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear operator, claiming the Westinghouse assemblies had defects. For its part, Westinghouse alleged that its fuel assemblies were loaded incorrectly. This led to a lengthy outage of Unit Three.

Nevertheless, in 2008, Energoatom contracted with Westinghouse for 630 assemblies that would be loaded into the South Ukraine plant’s three reactors.

In 2008 Energoatom and Westinghouse Electric Sweden contracted to ship fresh fuel to as many as six reactors. However, during trial use at South Ukraine NPP in 2012, the fuel became deformed and caused serious damage to the reactor. The use of Westinghouse fuel was then suspended by Ukraine pending its redesign. However, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the contract was revived and extended.

Invading Russian forces have now taken control of Chernobyl and Europe’s largest nuclear power plant Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine.

Russia has not said why they have taken control of the two sites but there are theories abound. The action has caused alarm and increased fears of a nuclear accident with would know no borders.

Chernobyl gives Russia direct access to Kiev

One of the first targets Russian troops captured upon invading Ukraine was the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The facility is located 10 miles from the Belarussian border within a 1,660 square mile exclusion zone, the majority of which is located in Ukraine. Control of the largely uninhabited area gives the Russian forces the ability to approach Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital from the northwest along the shortest route without having to cross the Dnieper River on hostile territory.

This was most likely the reasoning behind capturing the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster where radiation levels are considered tolerable for a limited amount of time. But Evelyn Farkas, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia in the Obama administration says Moscow may want to secure the facility in the event of a protracted war in Ukraine. Insurgents could get their hands on radioactive material to make dirty bombs so ""they certainly don’t want loose nuclear material floating around,"" she told NBC News.

Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant concerns international community

Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is “extremely concerned” about the developments at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power which Russian forces captured in the early morning of 3 March. Their assault on the facility started a fire at a training facility and although none of the six reactors were damaged, interference by Russian commanders in the day-to-day operations could cause an unintended mishap.

The head of the international nuclear watchdog in a statement pointed to the occupation of the site contravening two of the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security he had laid out just days before. The operators of the facility are working under gunpoint and despite regular shift changes being allowed, they are short on food, lowering morale among staff. This violates Pillar 3 which states that workers must have “the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure.”

Another disturbing development is reports from Ukraine that Russian forces have switched off mobile networks and the internet compromising normal channels of communication, without which authorities cannot gather reliable information on operations at the site. This goes against Pillar 7 which states “There must be reliable communications with the regulator and others.”

What does Russia want with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power?

Ukraine is heavily reliant on nuclear power to supply its energy grid making up over 50 percent of the nation’s total generating capacity. The Zaporizhzhia facility is the largest in Europe containing six reactors that produce up to 6,000 megawatts a quarter of Ukraine’s overall power production. By taking control of the facility and others Russia will have the capability to turn the lights on and off in Ukraine.

Another reason that the site and other nuclear plants would be strategically important to Moscow are the transportation links to them according to Clint Watts, research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute speaking on the Rachel Maddow Show. There have been reports of Russian tanks running out of gas as they push into Ukraine, the railheads at the nuclear power plants would allow the Russians to move their armor divisions around faster and without using up as much fuel.

There is also the psychological impact of using “fear as a weapon.” Possessing the nuclear assests allows them to “create disinformation, misinformation at home, scare their population.” Jon B Wolfsthal, a senior adviser to Global Zero in Washington, opined that maybe Putin needs the nuclear facilities to back up the story he’s been pitching that Ukraine was pursuing nuclear weapons as a justification for the illegal invasion.

This is quite improbable and a blatant fabrication as Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and materials have been thoroughly inspected by the IAEA. Over the years since the last nuclear weapon left Ukraine in 1996 there have been no signs the country has had an interest in creating a military nuclear program.

Wolfsthal wonders if attacking the facility in southern Ukraine was done by a rogue group of Russian soldiers, a prospect that he finds “almost more worrisome than if they were ordered to take the plant by force.” But if they were ordered to take control of the facility by force it “would indicate a level of recklessness and brinkmanship that we had not anticipated,” he wrote.",https://en.as.com/en/2022/03/07/latest_news/1646686014_463478.html

Russian forces have captured a Ukrainian nuclear power plant — the largest in Europe.

Heavy fighting caused a fire to break out near one of the Zaporizhzhia plant's six reactors, but Ukrainian authorities say the fire has been extinguished. They also say there were many casualties from the fighting around the plant, which started late Thursday.

At a press conference Friday morning, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said the plant's safety systems are intact. ""There has been no release of radioactive material,"" Grossi said.

NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has this update on Morning Edition:

How serious is the damage?

Any sort of damage to a reactor is never good, but these reactors are huge machines. The nuclear material in the reactor sits inside a thick metal pressure vessel, known as its containment, and it's really tough. So it's entirely possible this building sustained some type of damage superficially, but that the reactor itself is safe. Still, though, we've just never been here before, either in terms of nuclear power or modern warfare.

Why would Russia want to take control of this plant?

About half of Ukraine's electricity comes from nuclear power, and this plant is the biggest. It's located in the southeast and is hugely important to the nation. The six reactors provide up to 6,000 megawatts of power.

And we've already seen Russia move on other essential infrastructure, like hydroelectric dams, so it makes sense they'd try to seize this facility.

Could we be looking at a Chernobyl-like meltdown?

Probably not. These reactors are a different design and overall they're much safer than what was in operation at Chernobyl [in 1986]. But this remains a superserious situation. Large reactors like these — you can't just flip a switch and turn them off. Their nuclear cores remain hot for days or even weeks after a shutdown. This plant still needs operators working there, it needs power and water to cool the cores. And there are still three other nuclear plants in other parts of the country, including one near Odessa. So I think we are still dealing with a very fluid situation, and there's a lot of risk here.",https://www.npr.org/2022/03/04/1084477966/nuclear-power-plant-zaporizhzhia-ukraine

(Zaporizhzhya NPP via YouTube/via REUTERS)

A fire broke out in a training building at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe during intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces, Ukraine's state emergency service said on Friday.

U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said there was no indication of elevated radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which provides more than a fifth of total electricity generated in Ukraine.

A video feed from the plant verified by Reuters showed shelling and smoke rising near a building at the plant compound.

The footage shot at night showed one building aflame, and a volley of incoming shells, before a large candescent ball lit up the sky, exploding beside a car park and sending smoke billowing across the compound.

The mayor of the nearby town of Energodar about 550 km (342 miles) southeast of Kyiv said fierce fighting and ""continuous enemy shelling"" had caused casualties in the area, without providing details.

Thousands of people are believed to have been killed or wounded and more than 1 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin last Thursday launched the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

Early reports of the incident at the power plant sent financial markets in Asia spiraling, with stocks tumbling and oil prices surging further.

""Markets are worried about nuclear fallout. The risk is that there is a miscalculation or over-reaction and the war prolongs,"" said Vasu Menon, executive director of investment strategy at OCBC Bank.

Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, about 100 km north of Kyiv, which spewed radioactive waste over much of Europe when it melted down in 1986. The Zaporizhzhia plant is a different and safer type, some analysts said.

U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy to get an update on the situation at the plant.

""President Biden joined President Zelenskiy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,"" the White House said.

Energy Secretary Granholm said on Twitter the reactors at Zaporizhzhia were ""protected by robust containment structures"" and were being ""safely shut down"".

The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a tweet that it was ""aware of reports of shelling"" at the power plant and was in contact with Ukrainian authorities.

On Thursday, Russia and Ukraine negotiators agreed to the need for humanitarian corridors to help civilians escape and to deliver medicines and food to the areas where fighting was the fiercest.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said a temporary halt to fighting in select locations was also possible.

The negotiators will meet again next week, the Belarusian state news agency Belta quoted Podolyak as saying.

Only one Ukrainian city, the southern port of Kherson, has fallen to Russian forces since the invasion was launched on Feb. 24, but Russian forces continue to surround and attack other cities.

Mariupol, the main port on the Sea of Azov, was surrounded and under heavy bombardment. Water and power was cut off, and officials say they cannot evacuate the wounded.

Video posted on Twitter from Mariupol, and verified by Reuters, showed parked vehicles burning while non-stop firing reverberated around surrounding apartment blocks.

The northeastern city of Kharkiv has been under attack since the start of the invasion, but defenders are holding out in the heavily shelled city.

While no major assault has been launched on Kyiv, the capital has been shelled, and Russian forces unleashed devastating firepower to break resistance in the outlying town of Borodyanka.

In Washington, a U.S. defense official said Russian troops were still 25 km (16 miles) from Kyiv city centre. Earlier on Thursday, the British Ministry of Defence said a huge Russia convoy rumbling southwards toward Kyiv, was advancing slowly, partly due to resistance, but also due to logistical issues.

The United States and Britain announced sanctions on more Russian oligarchs on Thursday, following on from EU measures, as they ratcheted up the pressure on the Kremlin.

More companies including Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, footwear giant Nike and Swedish home furnishing firm IKEA shut down or reduced operations in Russia as trade restrictions and supply constraints added to political pressure.

Sanctions have ""had a profound impact already,"" Biden said.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that is not designed to occupy territory but to topple the democratically elected government, destroy its neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. It denies targeting civilians.

Russian human rights activist and former world chess champion Garry Kasparov called on Western countries to eject Russia from the global police agency Interpol, and impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

""Russia should be thrown back into the Stone Age to make sure that the oil and gas industry and any other sensitive industries that are vital for survival of the regime cannot function without Western technological support,"" Kasparov said.
