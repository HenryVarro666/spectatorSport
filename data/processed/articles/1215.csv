“Terror Russia” as Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya called the country, is not only attacking Ukraine but “all of Europe.”

U.N. and Ukrainian officials say no radiation was released from a Russian attack at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant in Ukraine and firefighters have extinguished a blaze at the facility.

Russian forces are still pressing their invasion into the country despite global condemnation.

Many of the Security Council's 15 envoys expressed ""grave concern"" and shock, warning against the possibility of a repeat of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster - a nuclear accident in Ukraine when it was part of then Soviet Union considered to be the worst in history.

They said the attack was against international humanitarian law and urged Moscow to refrain from any military operations targeting the nuclear facilities and allow Ukrainian personnel to be allowed onto the plant to carry out their work.

""The world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,"" Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, told an emergency meeting of the Security Council, convened following the seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine by Russian troops.

""Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk. It was incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

As shells hit the area early on Friday, a blaze broke out in a training building - triggering a spasm of alarm around the world before the fire was extinguished and officials said the facility was safe. read more

Ukraine ambassador to the U.N. Sergiy Kyslytsya called for all Russian forces to be withdrawn from the plant and a no-fly zone over the country to protect the civilian population from air attacks.

Officials remained worried about the precarious circumstances, with Ukrainian staff operating under Russian control in battlefield conditions beyond the reach of administrators.

""France strongly condemns this attack on the integrity of a nuclear structure, which we need to guarantee,"" Nicolas de Riviere said in his speech. ""The results of the aggression of Russia against Ukraine are possibly devastating for human health and the environment,"" he added.

United Kingdom ambassador to the United Nations Barbara Woodward said: ""It must not happen again. Even in the midst of an illegal invasion of Ukraine, Russia must keep fighting away from and protect the safety and security of nuclear sites.""

International Atomic Energy Agency chief Raphael Grossi described the situation as ""normal operations, but in fact there is nothing normal about this.""

Thousands of people are believed to have been killed or wounded and more than 1 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russian began its invasion on Feb. 24. Western nations retaliated with sanctions that have plunged Russia into economic isolation.

Russia's envoy to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia dismissed Western uproar over the nuclear power plant and called Friday's Security Council meeting another attempt by Ukrainian authorities to create ""artificial hysteria"".

""At present, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and adjacent territory are being guarded by Russian troops,"" he said.

Separately, France and Mexico are working on a resolution to the U.N. Security Council next week that will address the humanitarian impact of Russia's invasion, diplomats said.

Attacks on nuclear facilities are contrary to international humanitarian law. And what we are witnessing in #Ukraine is inconsistent with the principles of the @UN Charter. The fighting must stop immediately. https://t.co/HO3T30ioLo — Rosemary A. DiCarlo (@DicarloRosemary) March 4, 2022

She was joined by Rafael Mariano Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who offered to deploy rapidly to Ukraine to develop a framework aimed at ensuring the safety and security of the country’s nuclear facilities.

Violating Geneva Conventions

Briefing the 15-member Council a week after it failed to adopt a draft resolution condemning the Russian Federation’s ongoing actions in Ukraine, Ms. DiCarlo reported that cities there remain under heavy assault by Russian forces and over one million people have already fled across the country’s borders.

Those that remain in Ukraine are suffering heavy bombardments and shelling, with thousands of casualties reported – and that number still growing.

Noting that the UN is expanding its work in response to the crisis, she reported that heavy fighting at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) overnight affected a training facility, and not the cooling system or power centre.

Describing the actions over recent hours as both unacceptable and “highly irresponsible,” the UN political chief reminded that attacks on nuclear power facilities run counter to international humanitarian law, specifically, Article 56 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions.

“The Chernobyl disaster in 1986 stands as a lasting example of why it is vital to ensure all nuclear power plants have the highest standards of safety and security,” she said.

IAEA ready to deploy

Briefing the Council on a remote connection from a plane heading to Iran, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi reported that Russia informed his agency several days ago that its forces were moving into the area of Zaporizhzhia NPP.

They were met with opposition by Ukrainian civilians, but later hit, with a projectile missile, a building near the nuclear reactors, setting a fire, which has been extinguished.

No safety systems have been compromised and no nuclear reactors themselves were hit.

While the plant’s operations continue normally, Mr. Groissi emphasized that “there is no normalcy about this situation when there are military forces in charge of the site.”

Against that backdrop, IAEA stands ready to travel to Ukraine as soon as possible, with the goal of establishing a framework to ensure that the safety and integrity of all nuclear facilities can be observed.

He emphasized that the mission would be restricted to nuclear safety and security, and in no way be connected to the political or diplomatic aspects of the crisis, which fall under the purview of the Security Council.

Nuclear catastrophe 'narrowly averted'

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the emergency session that the assault on the Zaporizhzhia atomic plant “represents a dire threat to the world.”

“By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the Security Council. “Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk…it was incredibly reckless and dangerous and threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine, and Europe,” she said. “Nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict.”

UK Ambassador Barbara Woodward observed that it was the first time that a State has attacked a fuelled and functioning nuclear power plant.

“International law requires special protection for nuclear facilities and it is difficult to see how Russia’s actions were compatible with its commitments…It must not happen again,” she said.

French Ambassador Nicolas de Rivière also expressed grave concern over the risks to nuclear security.

“Russia must immediately cease its illegal and dangerous activities, in order to restore the control of the Ukrainian authorities over all nuclear facilities,” he said.

Diplomatic face-off

Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said that for eight years, no one noticed the crimes of Ukrainian nationalists in Donbas nor offered words of sympathy for the people there.

Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said, “we have survived the night that could have stopped the history of Ukraine and Europe.”

He upheld that every day provides new evidence that it is not only Ukraine under Russian attack but also Europe and the entire world.

‘Very challenging’ situation

Previously, in Geneva, the IAEA chief had made a statement, relaying the NPP operator's assessment that the situation there remains “very challenging,” and it has not yet been possible to access the whole site to ensure that all safety systems are fully functional.

Of the plant’s reactor units, he detailed that Unit 1 is shut down for maintenance, Units 2 and 3 have undergone a controlled shut down, Unit 4 is operating at 60 per cent power and Units 5 and 6 are being held “in reserve” in low power mode.

And two people were reported injured.

On high alert

Meanwhile, the IAEA Incident and Emergency Centre (IEC) has been put in full response mode at Zaporizhzhia NPP.

“The IEC will be manned around the clock to continuously receive, assess and disseminate information about developments,” he said.

The Director General reiterated his gravely concern.

“I’m extremely concerned about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and what happened there during the night,” he explained.

“Firing shells in the area of a nuclear power plant violates the fundamental principle that the physical integrity of nuclear facilities must be maintained and kept safe at all time.”

The main priority is to ensure the safety and security of the plant, its power supply and the people who operate it, he concluded.

“We’ve agreed that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory,” Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at a news conference in Brussels.

He warned that the days to come in Ukraine “are likely to be worse” with “more deaths, more suffering and more destruction,” and appealed for dialogue.

NATO is not seeking a war with Russia, Stoltenberg emphasized.

“Ministers agreed that NATO's relationship with Russia has fundamentally changed for the long term. But we remain committed to keeping channels for diplomacy and deconfliction open to avoid any fundamental escalation, misunderstanding or miscalculation,” he said.

This week, NATO deployed the NATO Response Force for the first time and has “130 jets at high alert and over 200 ships from the high north to the Mediterranean” to reinforce NATO’s defensive posture in the eastern part of the alliance. Stoltenberg pledged that the alliance will “continue to do what it takes to protect and defend every inch of NATO territory.”

“President Putin has failed to divide us. NATO's more united more determined and stronger than ever,” Stoltenberg said.

More background: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been calling for NATO and Western allies to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine amid Russia’s ongoing invasion and aerial bombardment of its cities.

European Council President Charles Michel said on Thursday that enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine is a NATO decision, but that it would be “one step too far” with a “real risk of escalation and a real risk of a possible third international war.”

Several western countries, including the U.S., U.K, slammed Russia for endangering nuclear facilities

United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members expressed alarm at the prospect of a nuclear incident in Ukraine, at an emergency meeting on Friday, convened hours after a training building at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant caught fire, as Russians moved in on the facility and seized control of it. The International Atomic Energy (IAEA) chief told the Council that no reactors had been damaged.

Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said after the attack on the power plant that he would call for a UNSC meeting. Several western countries, including the U.S. and the U.K, spoke out against Russia for endangering nuclear facilities, while others — including India and China — more generally expressed alarm about the situation without blaming anyone in particular.

“No security or safety systems have been compromised, ” said Director General of the IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, based on information received via the agency’s contacts as well as directly from the power plant. Mr. Grossi, who joined the Council meeting via video link, from onboard a flight to Tehran, reactors were hit by the projectile which hit the training building. He expressed his willingness to travel to Chernobyl to establish a “stable framework” for the governance of the nuclear power plant. The plant was taken over by Russian forces last week — although it is still being run by Ukrainians.

During his remarks, India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UNPR) T.S. Tirumurti warned of the danger a nuclear incident.

“India attaches the highest importance to ensuring safety and security of nuclear facilities, as any accident involving the nuclear facilities may have severe consequences for public health and the environment,” Mr. Tirumurti said. He also emphasised that a humanitarian crisis was confronting Ukraine. India has been concerned about the lives of several thousand of its nationals caught in the conflict.

Mr. Tirumurti reiterated India’s position — calling for a resolution of differences through dialogue and respect for the U.N. Charter and sovereignty of nations.

U.A.E. UNPR Lana Nusseibeh said there would be grave consequences for generations if an accident was to happen, either due to an attack on a facility or as a consequence of fighting. The UAE holds the Security Council presidency for March and, after abstentions at the Security Council, voted to support a General Assembly resolution on Wednesday that condemned Russia.

At Friday’s meeting, the U.S. condemned Russia and called for the cessation of the war. “By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” the U.S.’s UNPR Linda Thomas Greenfield said.

“Mr. Putin must stop this madness and he must stop it now,” she said, warning that the Russians were closing in on the country’s second largest nuclear plant.

“So this imminent danger continues,” she said.

“Russia must keep fighting away from and protect the safety and security of nuclear sites,” Britain’s representative, Barbara Woodward said.

The Russian Defence Ministry had blamed Ukrainians for the fire at Zaporizhzhia and Russia’s representative Vasilly Nebenzya and his Ukrainian counterpart Sergiy Kyslytsya traded charges on who was responsible.

“Together with the people of Belarus and Ukraine, we lived through the tragedy of Chernobyl, and so we are more interested than most in maintaining a normal radiation situation throughout the territory of Ukraine,” Russia’s representative Vassily Nebenzya said.

He also accused Ukrainian “nationalists” of holding foreign students — Indian, Chinese and Ghanaian nationals — hostage in the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy. On Thursday, the Ministry of External Affairs had said it was not aware of its citizens being held hostage by Ukraine and used as “human shields” as Russia had alleged.

During his speech Mr. Kyslytsya asked Mr. Nebenzya to appeal to Russian forces to allow a safe corridor for foreign students to pass. He also accused Russia of shelling civilian areas. He listed the damage caused to the nuclear power plant and said personnel had not been rotated, i.e., let off their shift, since Thursday morning. (Ukrainians continue to man the plant, following their capture by Russian forces). Mr. kyslytsya asked the Security Council to discuss a ban on all flights over Ukrainian airspace. On Friday, NATO rejected Ukraine’s appeals for a ‘no fly zone’ over its airspace.

Quoting Albert Einstein as saying, “The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything,” Mr. Kyslysta appeared to take a shot at those who did not condemn Russia in recent days.

“Shamefully, there is a handful of those around us... or among us, rather,... who do nothing,” Mr. Kyslytsya said, presumably a reference to India and others who have consistently abstained during U.N. votes on the issue.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-security-council-meets-to-discuss-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-fire/article65191581.ece
