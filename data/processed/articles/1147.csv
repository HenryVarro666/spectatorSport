Additional jurisdictions we are tracking include: Japan, Republic of Korea, UK and US.

March 24, 2022: The Council issued a Joint Readout with the US President affirming the readiness to adopt additional measures and stop attempts to circumvent sanctions. The Council Conclusions also note the EU’s readiness to move quickly with coordinated sanctions on Russia and Belarus.

March 15, 2022: The Council endorsed a fourth package of sanctions against Russia. Sanctions included prohibition on transactions with certain state-owned enterprises and expands the list of persons connected to Russia’s defense and industrial base, on whom tighter export restrictions are imposed regarding dual-use goods and goods and technology, which might contribute to Russia’s technological enhancement of its defense and security sector.

Furthermore, restrictions were imposed on new investment across the Russian energy sector, as well as a comprehensive export restriction on equipment, technology and services for the energy industry in Russia, with the exception of the nuclear industry and the downstream sector of energy transport.

Sanctions were also imposed (applicable as of April 15, 2022) on the rating of Russia and Russian companies by EU credit rating agencies and the provision of rating services to Russian clients, resulting in a further loss of access to the EU’s financial markets. The Council also introduced further trade restrictions concerning iron and steel, as well as luxury goods, introducing the prohibition to sell, supply, transfer or export directly or indirectly, these goods.

Council also endorsed a new package of sanctions where key oligarchs (including Roman Abramovich and German Khan) and prominent business people in the iron and steel, energy, banking, media, military and dual use products and services are added in the sanctions list with their assets being frozen and a travel ban imposed. Sanctions are also imposed to lobbyists and propagandists, and to companies in the aviation, military/dual use, shipbuilding and machine building sectors.

March 11, 2022: European Heads of State and Government announced following a meeting on March 10 in Versailles reiterating their support for Ukraine and confirming their willingness to issue further sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus. Additionally, the statement called for funds to be made available “without delay” through the adoption of the proposal on Cohesion’s Action for Refugees in Europe (CARE) and through ReactEU.

The statement also indicated support for Ukraine’s joining the EU, noting the Council has also invited the European Commission to submit its opinions on the applications of the Republic of Moldova and Georgia as well.

Group of Seven (G7) Leaders issued a statement reaffirming their commitment to sanctions on Russia as well as confirming efforts to reduce energy dependency on Russia through means, “[i]n addition to announced plans.” Further, the statement indicated the G7 will work through their national processes to deny Russia Most-Favored-Nation status on certain products. Additionally, the statement noted efforts to prevent Russia from obtaining financing from multilateral financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

March 9, 2022: Council endorsed the decision to ban three Belarusian banks from SWIFT and the prohibition of (i) transactions with the Belarusian Central Bank, (ii) listing of Belarus state-owned entities on EU trading venues from April 12, 2022, (iii) acceptance of deposits exceeding €100,000 from Belarusian nationals or residents, and (iv) provision of euro banknotes to Belarus.

Additionally, the Council introduced additional restrictive measures with regard to the export of maritime navigation goods and radio communication technology to Russia. By virtue of this decision, it will be prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly, maritime navigation goods and technology to any natural or legal person, entity or body in Russia, for use in Russia, or for the placing on board of a Russian-flagged vessel.

The Council also expanded the list of legal persons, entities and bodies subject to the prohibitions related to investment services, transferable securities, money market instruments, and loans.

Finally, the Council clarified the term “transferable securities” so as to clearly include crypto-assets, and thus ensure the proper implementation of the sectoral restrictions in place.

The Council endorsed a decision to add 14 oligarchs and business people as well as 146 members of the Russian Federation Council to the EU sanctions list.

March 2, 2022: The Council endorsed decision to ban certain Russian banks from SWIFT, prohibited the participation to projects financed by the Russian Direct Investment Fund, prohibited the sell, supply, transfer or export of euro banknotes to Russia.

Additionally, the Council suspended broadcasting activities of Sputnik and RT/Russia Today in the EU.

Council further endorsed sanctions against 22 high ranking members of the Belarusian military personnel (asset freeze and travel ban) and imposed export controls on dual-use goods and technology products, particularly these used for military and defense purposes.

February 28, 2022: The Council of the EU (the Council) endorsed the decision for the shutting down of EU airspace for all Russian-owned, registered, or controlled aircraft. Transactions with the Russian Central Bank have been prohibited.

Additionally, the Council endorsed 26 additional individuals added and 1 additional entity with asset freeze and travel ban within the EU sanctions package.

February 27, 2022: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced shutting down EU airspace for all Russian-owned, registered or controlled aircraft. Banning of the state-owned RT/Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries was also decided.

February 26, 2022: The European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, Canada, and the US issued a Joint Announcement on the imposition of further targeted sanctions against Russia, namely through removing Russian banks from the SWIFT banking system and imposing restrictive measures on the Russian Central Bank. Further coordination through a transatlantic task force has been agreed.

February 25, 2022: EU Foreign Ministers endorsed sanctions targeted at the financial, energy and transport sectors, dual-use goods, export control and export financing and visa policy. Export bans on oil refining technologies, aircraft, spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines as well as sensitive technologies have been included in the package of sanctions. Russian President Putin and Foreign Minister Lavrov were also the target of sanctions, with an asset freeze and travel ban in the EU.

February 24, 2022: EU heads of state of government agreed on a set of sanctions

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union preserved a sense of rarely seen unity through four rounds of unprecedented sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. But at a summit Thursday, the 27 leaders faced division on the biggest issue of all: energy.

During the first month of war, EU nations imposed tough measures targeting Russia’s economy and financial system as well as President Vladimir Putin and Russian oligarchs.

Unlike the U.S., they have so far spared Russian fossil fuels, highlighting the EU’s reliance on the country’s oil, natural gas and coal to keep homes warm and the wheels of industry turning.

“We are not at war with ourselves,” Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said at the summit in Brussels, where sanctions and energy were key topics. “Sanctions must always have a much bigger impact on the Russian side than on ours.”

He reflected the position of EU nations like Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. They are running up against other member states situated closer to Russia that want tougher action now.

“As long as we are purchasing energy from Russia, we are financing the war, and this is the big problem that we have,” Finland Prime Minister Sanna Marin said.

She was joined by Baltic leaders in demanding swift action.

“We have to continue to isolate Putin’s economy — Russia’s economy — to stop the money flowing into the war machine,” Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins told reporters. “The most logical place to move forward is in oil and coal.”

The EU imports 90% of the natural gas used to generate electricity, heat homes and supply industry, with Russia supplying almost 40% of EU gas and a quarter of its oil.

Instead of an embargo, the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, has proposed slashing the bloc’s dependency on Russian gas by two-thirds this year. The EU is in talks with the U.S. to ensure extra deliveries of liquefied natural gas and have also started discussions with other suppliers.

Speaking to the EU leaders via video, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked them for working together to support Ukraine and impose sanctions on Russia, including Germany’s decision to block Russia from delivering natural gas to Europe through the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline. But he lamented that these steps were not taken earlier, saying there was a chance Russia would have thought twice about invading.

He then appealed to the EU leaders to move quickly on Ukraine’s application to join the bloc. “Here I ask you, do not delay. Please,” Zelenskyy said. “For us this is a chance.”

Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said Thursday that European nations that don’t want to work with Russia on energy should “just tell their citizens who is destroying their prosperity and how. We will cooperate with those who are interested in ensuring their own energy security.”

High energy prices triggered by a supply crunch in Europe have for months triggered rising energy bills and prices at the pump, worsening as the war has jolted energy markets.

Last year, the EU’s imports of Russian goods were worth 158.5 billion euros, with mineral fuels accounting for 62%, or 98.9 billion euros, according to the European Commission.

Karins said the Ukraine war was a prime example where morals should trump money. Despite Latvia’s “high dependency on Russian oil and gas,” businesses support a halt to trade in these goods, he said.

“They’re telling to me sanctions are a necessity because we have to stop Putin’s regime,” he said. “It’s just money. If you’re alive, if your infrastructure is fine, you can re-earn the money.”

Greenpeace has accused the European Union of bankrolling Russia’s war by continuing to purchase its energy supplies.

“Fossil fuels have a history of being connected with conflict and war — wherever they come from, governments must phase them out as quickly as possible, not look for new suppliers,” Greenpeace EU director Jorgo Riss said.

But Dutch Premier Mark Rutte signaled that EU countries were still too divided over the question of energy sanctions against Russia to produce an agreement on the matter at the summit. He stressed the four sets of sanctions that the EU has already imposed against Russia over the past month.

“We will discuss sanctions; I don’t think we will decide on sanctions,” Rutte told reporters. “Don’t forget that the sanctions package in place at the moment is by far the toughest package I’ve seen in my lifetime as a politician.”",https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-business-europe-european-union-cae80283ff9e29e7e71c17613298b9e6

The United States and the European Union have unveiled a plan to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels following the invasion of Ukraine.

US President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the creation of the joint task force aimed at cutting the bloc’s reliance on Russian imports during a joint news conference in Brussels on Friday.

“Putin has used Russia’s energy resources … to manipulate its neighbours,” said Biden, who arrived in Europe this week to take part in several emergency meetings. “He’s used the profits to drive his war machine.”

“Today, we’ve agreed on a joint game plan toward that goal, while accelerating our progress toward a secure clean energy future,” he said. “This initiative focuses on two core issues. One, helping Europe reduces dependency on Russian gas as quickly as possible Secondly, reducing Europe’s demand for gas overall.”

Under the agreement, Biden said the US will work with partners to ensure an additional 15 billion cubic metres of liquified natural gas (LNG) for the EU in 2022.

The European Commission will in turn work with EU member states to ensure the demand of at least 50 billion cubic metres of US LNG a year, according to the White House.

“In a world faced with disorder, our transatlantic unity upholds fundamental values and rules that our citizens believe in,” von der Leyen said at the news conference.

“We want as Europeans to diversify away from Russia towards suppliers that we trust, that are friends and that are reliable,” she added. “Therefore the US commitment to provide the European Union with additional at least 15 billion cubic metres of LNG this year is a big step in this direction because this will replace the LNG supply we currently receive from Russia.”

The new plan will be overseen by a task force chaired by a representative from the White House and a representative of the president of the European Commission, and will work to “ensure energy security for Ukraine and the EU in preparation for next winter and the following one while supporting the EU’s goal to end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels”, according to a White House statement.

Russia is the world’s largest supplier of LNG, accounting for about 45 percent of the EU’s imports in 2021. Overall, the EU imports about 90 percent of its LNG, which is predominantly used for home heating and in the industrial sector.

Russia, along with Qatar and Iran, accounts for half of the world’s natural gas reserves.

The February 24 Russian invasion of Ukraine has set European and US officials scrambling to find alternatives to the continent’s reliance on Russian fossil fuels.

The EU in early March announced plans to slash its dependence on Russian gas by two-thirds in 2022.

However, shifting suppliers has been difficult, with many of the most likely candidates already locked into long-term contracts.

On Sunday, Germany and Qatar announced they had reached a deal on a long-term energy partnership to offset the country’s reliance on Russian gas.

The move comes after Germany put a hold on its Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, a controversial but all-but completed project designed to bring Russian natural gas directly to Germany via the Baltic Sea.

On Thursday, NATO leaders meeting in Brussels discussed increasing defence capabilities along the bloc’s eastern edge and contingencies in the event of Russia using chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.

Amid consecutive meetings of EU and G7 leaders, Washington also announced a raft of new sanctions against Russia, including punitive measures against Duma – the lower house of the country’s Federal Assembly – and more than 300 of its members.

They also issued new guidance on Russia’s estimated $130bn in gold reserves, saying it was also subject to US sanctions. Leaders of G7 countries agreed to crack down on Russia’s ability to sell its gold reserves during the meeting on Tuesday.

This client alert summarizes the UK and EU’s latest actions, which have been closely coordinated.

UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has urged firms “to think very carefully about their investments in Russia … there is no case for new investment in Russia.”

The European Commission’s President Ursula von der Leyen made clear that the EU would “continue to work in lockstep [with its allies] to ramp up the economic pressure against the Kremlin.”

On 11 March 2022, a number of additional measures were announced in a joint statement by the leaders of the G-7. The majority of those are yet to be implemented, including:

further debt and equity restrictions targeted at Russian entities that are directly or indirectly supporting the war;

restrictions on Russia obtaining financing from leading multilateral financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development;

a crackdown on evasion and closure of loopholes in existing sanctions, including evasions through the use of digital/cryptoassets; and

efforts to combat the Russian government’s attempts to spread disinformation.

On 17 March 2022, the Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs Task Force (REPO Task Force), a global task force focused on coordinated enforcement of sanctions and export control measures, held its first meeting. In a joint statement published on the same date, the REPO Task Force confirmed its commitment to prioritising its resources and working together to take all available legal steps to find, restrain, freeze, seize, and, where appropriate, confiscate or forfeit the assets of sanctioned individuals. The signatories to this statement included officials from the US, the UK, Australia, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and the EU.

In recent days, relevant authorities in the UK and EU issued important guidance on topics such as the aggregation of ownership interests (as discussed below), and we expect that authorities will continue to issue further guidance and FAQ on sanctions topics.

I. UK Sanctions and Export Controls

The UK has continued to adopt further legislation to implement its sanctions and export control measures.

The Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022

The Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 (Economic Crime Act) received royal assent on 15 March 2022, following an expedited passage through Parliament. It introduced a number of provisions relating to economic crime and money laundering, as well as provisions relevant to sanctions.

The most significant provisions involving sanctions include:

Urgent designation procedure: This allows a person to be designated for sanctions despite the absence of reasonable grounds to suspect that they have been involved in sanctionable conduct. It applies where (i) the person is subject to similar sanctions by the US, EU, Australia, Canada or any other specified country and (ii) it is in the public interest to make such a designation. Urgent procedure designations end after 56 days, unless by then the person is certified as an involved person. The urgent procedure came into force on 15 March 2022 and has already been utilised by the UK to impose further blocking sanctions.

Urgent procedure designations end after 56 days, unless by then the person is certified as an involved person. The urgent procedure came into force on 15 March 2022 and has already been utilised by the UK to impose further blocking sanctions. Strict liability regime: This will remove the requirement that a person must have “known, suspected or believed” that they were breaching sanctions prohibitions in order to be subject to a determination that a breach has occurred. This is not yet in force.

This will remove the requirement that a person must have “known, suspected or believed” that they were breaching sanctions prohibitions in order to be subject to a determination that a breach has occurred. This is not yet in force. Reporting on sanctions breaches: The Treasury may publish reports where no monetary penalty has been imposed, so long as it is satisfied (on a balance of probabilities) that a person has breached a prohibition. This is not yet in force.

Asset Freezes

On 10 March 2022, the UK imposed blocking sanctions on seven business owners,1 and on 11 March 2022, it imposed them on 386 members of the State Duma of the Russian Federation who voted in favor of laws recognising the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent states.

Further blocking sanctions were announced on 15 March 2022 on 364 persons, including members of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation, senior political figures,2 several more business owners3 and seven businesses.4 A number of these sanctions were imposed pursuant to the new urgent designation procedure.

Transport Restrictions

On 8 March 2022, the UK passed legislation that strengthened the existing restrictions on Russian aircraft.5 This legislation establishes powers to remove aircraft owned, operated or chartered by designated persons from the UK register. In addition, the legislation makes it a criminal offence for any Russian aircraft6 to fly over or land in the UK.

The legislation also extends the UK’s existing restrictions in relation to Russian ships and, granting powers to detain Russian-registered ships in UK ports.

Russian Oil Restrictions

On 8 March 2022, the UK announced its intention to gradually phase out the import of Russian oil over the current year. No sanctions legislation relating to this has been published. The government also announced the establishment of a Taskforce on Oil to assist companies in finding alternative supplies.

Additional Import Tariffs

A list of Russian and Belarusian products will face an additional 35% increase in import tariffs, the government announced on 15 March 2022. Those include: wood, paper, iron, steel, copper, machinery, cement, iron ores, fertilisers, cereals, beverages, spirits (including vodka) and vinegar. We expect the legislation relating to this to be passed this week.

Further Export Control Measures

Additional measures restricting exports to Russia and Belarus were announced on 15 March 2022. In particular, the UK will ban luxury goods exports to Russia, which is expected to affect luxury vehicles, high-end fashion and works of art. This is not in force yet. The UK also announced its intention to deny Russia and Belarus access to Most Favoured Nation tariff treatment in relation to a number of key exports. The government also said it will no longer issue any new guarantees, loans and insurance for exports to Russia and Belarus.

Suspension of Tax Co-Operation

On 17 March 2022, the UK announced that it was suspending the exchange and sharing of tax information with Russia and Belarus under the UK’s exchange of information agreements. This tax information is exchanged as part of a global collaboration to address tax compliance risks.

General Licences

The UK’s sanctions regulator, the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), has issued limited exemptions to certain sanctions restrictions.

The following new general licences have been issued:

General Licence INT/2022/1327076: This allows Chelsea FC to make certain payments for the purposes of its continued operation (including the payment of employee wages) from 10 March 2022 until 31 May 2022, following the blocking sanctions imposed on its owner, Roman Abramovich.

This allows Chelsea FC to make certain payments for the purposes of its continued operation (including the payment of employee wages) from 10 March 2022 until 31 May 2022, following the blocking sanctions imposed on its owner, Roman Abramovich. General Licence INT/2022/1381276: This allows persons to provide financial services for the purposes of winding down any derivatives, and repurchase and reverse-repurchase transactions entered into prior to 1 March 2022 with (i) the Russian Central Bank, (ii) the Russian National Wealth Fund, and (iii) the Russian Ministry of Finance. It is in force from 22 March 2022 until 2 May 2022.

In addition, OFSI has published amendments to two existing general licences:

General Licence INT/2022/1272278: This licence, covering persons winding down transactions to which they are a party related to VTB Bank or its UK subsidiaries, extended from 25 February 2022 to 27 March 2022. It was amended on 7 March 2022 to expand the definition of subsidiaries to cover any entity owned or controlled by VTB Bank. In addition, OFSI (i) confirmed that the existing rules do not require that funds payable to VTB in the course of winding down transactions be paid into a frozen account and (ii) suggested that, if funds become payable to a subsidiary of VTB as part of winding down transactions with those subsidiaries, consideration should be given to how the ownership and control provisions in The Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 could apply to such payments.

This licence, covering persons winding down transactions to which they are a party related to VTB Bank or its UK subsidiaries, extended from 25 February 2022 to 27 March 2022. It was amended on 7 March 2022 to expand the definition of subsidiaries to cover any entity owned or controlled by VTB Bank. In addition, OFSI (i) confirmed that the existing rules do not require that funds payable to VTB in the course of winding down transactions be paid into a frozen account and (ii) suggested that, if funds become payable to a subsidiary of VTB as part of winding down transactions with those subsidiaries, consideration should be given to how the ownership and control provisions in The Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 could apply to such payments. General Licence INT/2022/1277778: This licence, from 1 March 2022 until 31 March 2022, allows UK credit or financial institutions to (i) continue a correspondent banking relationship with Sberbank and (ii) process sterling payment to, from or via Sberbank or a non-UK or UK credit or financial institution owned or controlled directly or indirectly by Sberbank. On 11 March 2022, OFSI amended the licence to make it clear that the authorizations granted in relation to both activities extended to conduct with a non-UK or UK credit or financial institution owned or controlled directly or indirectly by Sberbank.

The Department for International Trade’s Export Control Joint Unit has also issued a General Trade Licence in relation to the restrictions on providing technical assistance, financial services and funds, and brokering services relating to certain restricted goods and technology:

General Trade Licence (Russia Sanctions, Vessels): This allows the provision of technical assistance, financial services and funds, and brokering services relating to vessels, their component parts and related technology where (i) the vessel is moving from a third country to Russia, or to the UK or a third country from Russia, or transiting Russian territorial waters, (ii) the vessel is moving under its own power, and (iii) the movement of the vessel is not for the purpose of transfer of ownership of the vessel or any of its component parts, or a change of the operator of the vessel, from 17 March 2022.

Insurance/Reinsurance

As noted in our 9 March 2022 client alert, on 8 March 2022, the UK passed legislation that prohibits those who are subject to UK jurisdiction from providing insurance or reinsurance services relating to aviation or space goods and technology (i) to persons connected with Russia or (ii) for use in Russia.

The Export Control Joint Unit issued a general trade licence specifically in relation to these new prohibitions:

General Trade Licence (Russia Sanctions, Aviation Insurance): From 8 March 2022 until 28 March 2022, this allows the provision of:

(i) insurance services relating to aviation or space goods and technology if, prior to 8 March 2022, the insurance provider (a) did not reinsure any of their obligations; or (b) reinsured their obligations and that reinsurance cover has not been rendered unenforceable, suspended, frustrated or prohibited by any applicable sanctions; and (ii) reinsurance services relating to aviation or space goods and technology if the insurance obligations they are reinsuring have not been rendered unenforceable, suspended, frustrated or prohibited by any applicable sanctions. 7

From 8 March 2022 until 28 March 2022, this allows the provision of:

Guidance

OFSI published updated guidance on 4 March 2022 on the UK’s Russian sanctions framework summarising the financial sanctions that have been imposed against Russian entities and individuals, including, inter alia, asset freezes and restrictions on dealing in transferable securities or granting new loans and credit arrangements, as well as available exceptions.

On 10 March 2022, OFSI published a blog post providing further guidance in relation to the new sanctions that made it clear that OFSI considers crypto assets to be an economic resource, and encompassed by UK financial sanctions regulations.

An 11 March 2022 joint statement from OFSI, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England reiterated that financial services firms operating in the crypto asset sector must ensure they are in compliance with the UK’s sanctions. The statement: (i) outlines a number of sanctions-specific compliance measures that the government encourages crypto asset firms to consider and (ii) identifies red-flag indicators that may suggest an increased risk of sanctions evasion.

Although OFSI has not yet updated its FAQs regarding Russian sanctions, it hosted a public webinar on 17 March 2022 in order to address certain questions on the new regime.

On 22 March 2022, OFSI published updated guidance on the UK’s financial sanctions framework. In particular, the updated guidance confirms that when making an assessment on ownership and control, OFSI will not aggregate different designated persons’ holdings in a company unless the shares or rights are subject to a joint arrangement between the designated parties, or one party controls the rights of another.

II. EU Sanctions and Export Controls

On 11 March 2022, shortly after the EU’s third set of measures against Russia and its collaborators was finalised, the European Commission announced that it would extend the scope of restrictive measures on Russia and Belarus with a fourth sanctions package.

This was implemented on 15 March 2022, and includes a comprehensive prohibition of any transactions with certain Russian state-owned companies, an export ban of European luxury goods to Russia, an import ban on Russian iron and steel, and a far-reaching ban on new investments in the Russian energy sector.8 However, unlike the US, the EU did not impose an import ban on Russian oil and gas.

In addition, on 11 March 2022, the EU issued further amendments to other recent sanctions, including major additions to the EU Consolidated Sanctions List and comprehensive sectoral sanctions toward Belarus because of its support for Russia in the war in Ukraine.9

Expanded Export/Import Controls and Sectoral Sanctions

The EU expanded the scope of its Russia-related export and import restrictions by amending sectoral sanctions under Council Regulation No. 833/2014 (Amended Regulation 833).10

As of 16 March 2022, it is prohibited to import iron and steel products listed in Annex XVII to Amended Regulation 833, directly or indirectly, that originated in or were exported from Russia11 or to provide related technical or financial services. Related contracts that were concluded before 16 March 2022 may be executed until 17 June 2022. This also applies to any ancillary contracts that are necessary for the execution of such contracts.

It is also now prohibited to export to Russia luxury goods listed in Annex XVIII to Amended Regulation 833 that originated in the EU if their value exceeds €300 per item (or other values specified in the annex).12 Listed goods include caviar, truffles, alcoholic beverages, cigars, perfumes, leather goods, clothes, carpets, jewelry, watches, porcelain, works of art, electronic items for domestic use of a value exceeding €750 and vehicles of a value exceeding €50,000.

As of 10 March 2022 it is also prohibited to export to Russia any maritime navigation goods or technology listed in Annex XVI to Amended Regulation 833, regardless whether or not these goods originated in the EU, or to provide related technical or financial assistance.13

With this fourth set of measures against Russia, the EU also comprehensively amended the list of entities to which it is prohibited to sell or export dual-use goods (as listed in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2021/821) or goods that might contribute to Russia's military and technological enhancement or the development of its defense and security sectors (as listed in Annex VII to Amended Regulation 833). Such entities are listed in Annex IV to Amended Regulation 833.14

With respect to the energy sector, the new sectoral sanctions include:

investment restrictions. 15 For example, article 3a of Amended Regulation 833 prohibits (i) the acquisition of any new participation, or the extension of any existing participation, in any Russian entity operating in the energy sector in Russia or (ii) granting any new loan or credit to those entities. By derogation, the competent national authorities may grant exceptions (i) when necessary for ensuring critical energy supply within the EU or (ii) when the activity exclusively concerns a legal person operating in the energy sector in Russia owned by a legal person that is incorporated or constituted under the law of an EU member state; and

For example, article 3a of Amended Regulation 833 prohibits (i) the acquisition of any new participation, or the extension of any existing participation, in any Russian entity operating in the energy sector in Russia or (ii) granting any new loan or credit to those entities. By derogation, the competent national authorities may grant exceptions (i) when necessary for ensuring critical energy supply within the EU or (ii) when the activity exclusively concerns a legal person operating in the energy sector in Russia owned by a legal person that is incorporated or constituted under the law of an EU member state; and export restrictions relating to goods or technology, whether or not originating in EU, and technical or financial assistance, to any Russian entity acting in the energy industry or for use in Russia (see article 3 and Annex II of Amended Regulation 833).16 However, the prohibition does not apply to the sale or export of goods and technology or related technical and financial assistance necessary for the transport of fossil fuels from or through Russia into the EU. By derogation, the competent national authorities may authorize the export or sale of targeted goods or technology and related technical/financial assistance necessary for ensuring critical energy supply within the EU.

The blanket prohibition to perform any transactions with certain state-owned enterprises (see below) includes major Russian entities acting in the energy sector.17

As laid out in our 9 March 2022 client alert, the Amended Regulation 833 expanded the sanctions targeting Russia’s financial, energy and defense sectors that have been in place since 2014, which prohibit, among other things, dealing in new transferable securities (including equity and debt instruments). Amended Regulation 833 expanded the definition of transferable securities to include securities that are negotiable on the capital markets in the form of crypto assets.

Sanctions Prohibiting Credit Ratings

The Amended Regulation 833 also prohibits as of 15 April 2022 the provision of credit rating services and subscription services relating to credit ratings to any Russian national, any person residing in Russia or any legal person established in Russia.18 This prohibition does not apply to nationals of an EU member state or natural persons having a temporary or permanent residence permit in an EU member state.

Sanctions on State-Owned Entities

In addition to the sectoral sanctions already imposed on Russian state-owned entities (i.e., debt and equity restrictions), new measures prohibit engaging in any transaction with publicly-owned or controlled Russian entities listed in Annex XIX of Amended Regulation 833. In general, it is prohibited to engage directly or indirectly in any transaction with those entities under any contract concluded on or after 16 March 2022.19 However, the execution of contracts concluded before 16 March 2022, or ancillary contracts necessary for the execution of such contracts, is not prohibited until 15 May 2022.

The same prohibition applies to transactions with any legal person established outside the EU that is more than 50% owned by a listed state-owned entity, directly or indirectly. It also applies to transactions with a legal entity acting on behalf or at the direction of a listed state-owned entity or a non-EU entity more than 50% owned by a listed stated-owned entity.

However, there are exceptions with respect to transactions that are strictly necessary for the purchase, import or transport of fossil fuels or transactions related to energy projects outside of Russia in which a listed state-owned entity is a minority shareholder.

Amendments to Sanctions Targeting Deposits in Europe by Russian Nationals

The EU extended the exemption for deposits over €100,000 at EU credit institutions on behalf of Russian nationals and residents to exclude nationals and temporary or permanent residents of an EU member state, countries within the European Economic Area and Switzerland.20

Sanctions Targeting Belarus

The EU extended to three Belarusian credit institutions the same ban on the use of the SWIFT bank transfer system that applies to some Russian credit institutions.21 As of 20 March 2022, it is prohibited to provide specialized financial messaging services (which are used to exchange financial data) to these Belarusian institutions. This prohibition also applies to any legal person, entity or body established in Belarus that is owned more than 50% by one of those entities. The measures do not impose an asset freeze but have the effect of removing the institutions from SWIFT, undercutting their ability to actively participate in the international financial system.

The EU also extended to Belarusians the deposit restrictions that apply to Russians. It is prohibited to accept deposits exceeding €100,000 from Belarusian nationals, natural persons residing in Belarus, or legal persons, entities or bodies established in Belarus. The term “deposit” includes any credit balance resulting from funds or transactions. This measure is not limited to specifically listed individuals. In addition, central securities depositories may not provide any services for transferable securities issued after 12 April 2022 to any Belarusian national, resident or legal person, entity or body established in Belarus.

Furthermore, euro-denominated transferable securities issued after 12 April 2022 may not be sold to any Belarusian national, resident or legal person, entity or body established in Belarus. The measures are effective as of 10 March 2022. They do not apply to nationals of an EU member state or to deposits necessary for non-prohibited cross-border trade in goods and services between the EU and Belarus.22

Additionally, it is prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export euro-denominated banknotes to Belarus or any person in Belarus, including the government and the Central Bank of Belarus or for use in Belarus.

As of 12 April 2022, it is also prohibited to list and provide services on trading venues registered or recognized in the EU for the transferable securities of any legal person established in Belarus with over 50% public ownership.

The EU sanctions prohibit transactions with the Central Bank of Belarus related to the management of reserves or assets, and the prohibition of public financing for trade with and investment in Belarus. Exceptions may be granted upon authorization by the competent national authority in order to secure the financial stability of the EU as a whole or of one of the member states.

Asset Freezes

The EU amended the EU Consolidated List of Financial Sanctions to add nine entities operating in the aviation, military and dual-use, shipbuilding and machine-building sectors23 and 175 individuals, including 14 businesspeople as well as the 146 members of the Russian Federation Council who ratified the Russian government’s decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine as independent nations. New additions also include persons playing a role in Russia's efforts to spread disinformation among the Russian population. In total, 893 individuals and 65 entities are now subject to restrictive measures by the EU.

Guidance

The EU Commission is publishing guidelines as to the interpretation of the new Russia/Belarus sanctions on a rolling basis in the form of FAQ.24 These guidelines supplement and refer to prior guidelines on EU sanctions generally and Russia sanctions in particular.25

Under EU law, an entity is also subject to asset-freeze sanctions if it is owned more than 50% by a listed person, or if it is otherwise “controlled” by a listed person. In its most recent guidance, dated March 20, 2022, the EU Commission stated for the first time that aggregated ownership should be taken into account regarding the threshold of 50% for an entity to be considered as being owned by a listed person in the EU. The Commission stated: “If one listed person owns 30% of the company and another listed person owns 25% of the company, the company should be considered as jointly owned and controlled by listed persons. Dealing with the company could then be considered as making funds or economic resources indirectly available to the listed persons.”

By amending the definition of “transferable securities” in Amended Regulation 833 (as described above), the European Council noted that it was commonly understood that the notion of “assets” and “economic resources” subject to freezing also includes crypto assets, and that loans and credits can also be provided via crypto assets.26

Further Measures

On 17 March 2022, the European Commission announced an enhanced partnership between the EU's “Freeze and Seize” task force and the REPO Task Force established by other G-7 nations, including the US and the UK, in order to guarantee the global efficiency of asset freeze sanctions.27

4,5b00dc08-a109-4e11-9058-2e4d5df850e0,['Rfe Rl'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Despite the energy transition to renewables, Germany still relies heavily on imports of oil, gas and coal. Most fossil fuels are imported from Russia. Read more

BRUSSELS — With stunning speed, Russia’s war in Ukraine is driving Western Europe into the outstretched arms of the United States again, especially apparent when President Joe Biden offered a major expansion of natural gas shipments to his European Union counterpart Friday.

Talking to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Biden said the core issue was “helping Europe reduce its dependency on Russian gas as quickly as possible.” And Europe, which relies on Moscow for 40% of the natural gas used to heat homes, generate electricity and drive industry, needs the help.

An economic miscalculation with massive geopolitical consequences, many European Union nations let themselves become ever more reliant on Russian fossil fuels over the years, vainly hoping trade would overcome Cold War enmity on a continent too often riven by conflict.

That longstanding practice meant the 27-nation bloc could not simply stop Russian energy imports as part of Western sanctions to punish Moscow for the invasion a month ago.

And changing energy policy is about as cumbersome as turning around a liquefied natural gas carrier on a rough sea. In reality, it will take years.

This is where Biden stepped in Friday. Under the plan, the United States and a few like-minded partners will increase exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Europe by 15 billion cubic meters this year. Those exports would triple in the years afterward, a necessary move if the EU can back up its claim to be rid of Russian imports in five years.

“We are right on track now to diversify away from Russian gas and towards our friends’ and partners’ reliable and trustworthy suppliers,” von der Leyen said.

It will take huge investments, and getting more liquefied natural gas to Europe could be difficult. U.S. export facilities are already operating at capacity, and most new terminals are still only in the planning stages. Most U.S. shipments already go to Europe.

Even if more gas can be shipped to Europe, the continent may struggle to receive it. Import terminals are in coastal areas, and Europe’s pipeline system doesn’t have all the connections needed to send the natural gas throughout the continent.

But Europe is looking anywhere it can for solutions. Some countries — Germany, Italy and Bulgaria among them — are more heavily dependent on Russian gas than others, complicating efforts to agree on either a faster exit or a complete boycott now.

Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said an immediate embargo through energy sanctions would cost thousands of jobs and leave schools and homes unheated. Meanwhile, Europe must still replenish gas reserves that were heavily depleted during the past winter.

Yet, LNG can’t simply be conjured out of thin air. It requires export terminals that turn the gas into super-chilled liquid, then a reception terminal on the other end to turn it back into gas form to go into Europe’s pipeline system. The terminals cost billions and take years to build. With gas prices high from an energy crunch and the war’s jolt to volatile energy markets, terminals and tankers around the globe are fully booked already, leaving customers competing for available shipments.

Although the U.S.-EU initiative will likely require new facilities for importing liquefied natural gas, the White House said it is also geared toward reducing reliance on fossil fuels in the long run through energy efficiency and alternative sources of energy.

But climate campaigners criticized the agreement and called instead for the U.S. and EU to focus on renewable energy and reducing fossil fuel demand.

That “is a more affordable and sustainable solution that does not lock Europe into infrastructure or deals it does not need,” said Raphael Hanoteaux, senior policy adviser at the Brussels-based environmental group E3G.

The U.S. has been dramatically increasing its LNG exports in recent years, and most already go to Europe, according to the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, an industry lobbying group. Although much of the supply is already contracted out to buyers, there are still opportunities to shift its destination.

“The U.S. is in a unique position because it has flexible LNG that can be rerouted to Europe or to Asia, depending on who’s willing to pay that price,” said Emily McClain, gas markets analyst at Rystad.

Under the deal, a senior U.S. administration official said the government will continue existing efforts to supply LNG, while over time, Europe will be committing to stable demand of some 50 billion cubic meters.

Germany, Europe’s industrial juggernaut, has already started making major efforts to bring that gas in from coastal terminals , especially after it suspended approval of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia last month.

The government’s plan to shut down Germany’s last nuclear plants this year and phase out coal-fired power by 2030 relies heavily on natural gas as a “bridge” until sufficient renewable energy can be produced for Europe’s biggest economy.

Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said Germany now expects to be able to become almost entirely independent of Russian gas by mid-2024. To do this, the government has secured the use of three “floating” terminals capable of turning LNG brought in by ship back in gas form and is working hard to build permanent LNG terminals for long-term imports.

“By the time the terminals could help us, we could already have achieved the transition” to renewable energy, youth activist Clara Duvigneau said at a climate rally in Berlin.",https://www.inquirer.com/business/energy/us-european-union-natural-gas-energy-deal-russia-ukraine-war-20220325.html

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Good morning. Today I’m proud to once again be standing together with President von der Leyen as we announce a new groundbreaking initiative between the European Union and the United States.



First, we’re coming together to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy. Putin has issued Russia’s energy resources to coerce and manipulate its neighbors. That’s how he’s used it. He’s used the profits to drive his war machine.



And that’s why, earlier this month, I announced the United States would ban all imports of Russian energy to make it clear that the American people would not be part of subsidizing Putin’s brutal, unjustified war against the people of Ukraine.



At the time, I noted that we were able to take those steps when others could not because the United States is a net energy exporter of energy, with a strong domestic industry.



And the United States welcomed the European Union’s powerful statement earlier this month committing to rapidly reduce its dependence on Russian gas.

Today we’ve agreed on a joint game plan toward that goal while accelerating our progress toward a secure clean energy future.



This initiative focuses on two core issues: One, helping Europe reduce its dependency on Russian gas as quickly as possible. And, secondly, reducing Europe’s demand for gas overall.



To address the first point, the United States, together with our international partners, they’re going to — we’re going to work to ensure an additional 15 — one-five — 15 billion cubic meters of liquified natural gas — LNG — for Europe this year.



And as the EU works to discontinue buying Russian gas well before 2030, it will also work to ensure additional EU market demand for 50 billion cubic meters of LNG from the United States annually by 2030.



To accomplish this, the European Commission is going to work with the member states to store gas across the continent, to build more infrastructure to receive LNG, and to take steps to increase the efficiency of gas.



This build-out — this build-out will occur in a way that consists — is consistent with, not in conflict with, the zero — net-zero climate goal we — that we’re shooting for. It’s going to take some time to adjust gas supply chains and infrastructure as is built the last decade — for the last decade.



So we’re going to have to make sure the families in Europe can get through this winter and the next while we’re building an infrastructure for a diversified, resilient, and clean energy future.



At the same time, this crisis also presents an opportunity. It’s a catalyst — a catalyst that will drive the investments we need to double-down on our clean energy goals and accelerate progress toward our net-zero emissions future.



That’s what the second part of this initiative is all about.



The United States and the European Union are going to work together to take concrete measures to reduce dependence on natural gas — period — and to maximize the available — the avail- — the availability and use of renewable energy.



We’re going to accelerate widespread adoption of energy-efficient technologies and equipment, like smart thermostats, the work — that work to — and work to electrify heating systems all across Europe.



We’re going to invest in innovative solutions and technologies to make the switch from fossil fuels.



And together, we’ll advance the use of clean and renewable hydrogen to reduce our carbon emissions.



This — these steps will increase energy security, economic security, and national security.



And we’re going to stand up a joint task force to implement these changes and drive progress that will be co-chaired by representatives from the White House and the President of the European Union’s team — Commission’s team.



Madam President, I know — I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe. But it’s not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it’s going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing.



And I’m proud to announce that we’ve also reached another major breakthrough in transatlantic data flows. Privacy and security are key elements of my digital agenda.



And today, we’ve agreed to unprecedented protections for data privacy and security for our citizens.



This new agreement will enhance the Privacy Shield Framework; promote growth and innovation in Europe and the United States; and help companies, both small and large, compete in the digital economy.



Just as we did when we resolved the Boeing-Airbus dispute and lifted the steel and aluminum tariffs, the United States and the EU are finding creative, new approaches to knit our economies and our people closer together, grounded on shared values.



This framework underscores our shared commitment to privacy, to data protection, and to the rule of law. And it’s going to allow the European Commission to once again authorize

transatlantic data flows that help facilitate $7.1 trillion in economic relationships with the EU.



So thank you again, Madam President, for your personal friendship, for your partnership, and above all, your leadership.



All of this is bringing the European Union and the United States even closer together, and that’s a win for all of us.



So I thank you all, and I’m now going to yield the podium to the President.



Let me pull this out. (Pulls out the step stool.) Got to earn my salary here. (Laughter.) Is it out enough? There you go. Thank you. (Laughs.)



PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN: Thank you. Mr. President, Dear Joe, your presence here in Brussels this week — at the NATO summit, at the G7, and at our European Council — sends a very powerful message to the world.



The transatlantic partnership stands stronger and more united than ever. And we are determined to stand up against Russia’s brutal war. This war will be a strategic failure for Putin.



Our cooperation on the four successive waves of sanctions against Russia has been extraordinary and exceptional. The sanctions are now working their way deep into the Russian system, draining Putin’s resources to finance this atrocious war.



Our work on sanctions also shows that when we act together, we’re stronger and we really can make a difference.



And we are continuing to reinforce our cooperation in many strategic ways: on humanitarian and security assistance to Ukraine; on energy; on fighting the threats against our democracies; on solving outstanding issues in the EU-U.S. cooperation, including in data protec- — protection and privacy.



In a world faced with disorder, our transatlantic unity upholds fundamental values and rules that our citizens believe in. Let me focus first on refugees.



Until now, around three and a half million people have left Ukraine, half of them children. Every second refugee is a child. And the numbers will keep rising. So, together, we are mobilizing massive resources to support those displaced by the conflict, be it in Ukraine or in the neighboring countries.



Just this week, for example, I announced that the European Union will allocate an extra 3.4 billion euros for this purpose, and more will come. This demonstrates our deep support for Ukraine and its citizens.



And I want to tell the American people how grateful Europe is for their unwavering support. This support also extends to strengthening Europe’s energy security and independence from Russian fossil fuels. As you know, we aim to reduce this dependency on Russian fossil fuels and to get rid of it. And this can only be achieved through, of course, first of all, investment in renewables, but also through additional gas supplies, including LNG deliveries.



So we want, as Europeans, to diversify away from Russia, towards suppliers that we trust, that are friends, and that are reliable.



And therefore, the U.S. commitment to provide the European Union with additional at least 15 billion cubic meters of LNG this year is a big step in this direction because this will replace the LNG supply we currently receive from Russia.



And looking ahead, the United States and Europe will ensure stable demand and supply for additional at least 50 billion cubic meter of U.S. LNG until 2030. And if we look at that, this amount, 50 bcm per year, is replacing one third already of the Russian gas going to Europe today. So, we are right in — on track now to diversify away from Russian gas and towards our friends’ and partners’ reliable and trustworthy suppliers.



We need to secure our supplies not just for next winter but also for the years ahead. And this is a — an important, a big starting point to do that.



Our partnership aims to sustain us through this war, to work on our independence from Russian fossil fuels, but it also focuses on building a greener future with climate neutrality. We will work together also with our energy-intensive industry. And the good news is that the infrastructure that we use for gas today can be used for clean hydrogen in the future. So, this investment we are doing right now is also an investment in the decarbonizing of our economy.



The cooperation shows the power of our democracies. I particularly welcome that we will step up our respective action on strengthening democracies, the rule of law, the freedom of media in the world.



And we also need to continue adapting our own democracies to a changing world. This is particularly true when it comes to digitalization, in which the protection of personal data and privacy has become so crucial.



And therefore, I’m very pleased that we have found an agreement in principle on a new framework for transatlantic data flows. This will enable predictable and trustworthy data flows between the EU and U.S., safeguarding privacy and civil liberties.



And I really want to thank Commissioner Reynders and Secretary Raimondo for their tireless efforts over the past month to finish a balanced and effective solution. This is another step in our — strengthening our partnership. We managed to balance security and the right to privacy and data protection.



Mr. President, Dear Joe: Putin is trying to turn back the clock to another era — an era of brutal use of force, of power politics, of spheres of influence, and internal repression. I am confident he will fail.



We are working together to forge a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable future. And I know we will succeed.



Thank you very much.



PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you.



PRESIDENT VON DER LEYEN: Thank you very much.



PRESIDENT BIDEN: Thank you, everyone.

7,5b00dc08-a109-4e11-9058-2e4d5df850e0,['March'],,"The United States and European Union on Friday announced a new partnership to reduce the continent’s reliance on Russian energy, a step top officials characterized as the start of a years-long initiative to further isolate Moscow after its invasion of Ukraine.

U.S. President Joe Biden asserted that Russian President Vladimir Putin uses energy to “coerce and manipulate his neighbors” and uses the profits from its sale to “drive his war machine.”

Biden said the partnership he announced jointly with a top European Union official will turn that dynamic on its head by reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian energy sources, as well reducing the continent’s demand for gas overall.

The president said such a step is not “only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint” but “it’s going to put us on a stronger strategic footing.”

Under the plan, the U.S. and other nations will increase liquified natural gas exports to Europe by 15 billion cubic meters this year, though U.S. officials were unable to say exactly which countries will provide the extra energy this year. Even larger shipments would be delivered in the future. .

At the same time, they will try to keep their climate goals on track by powering gas infrastructure with clean energy and reducing methane leaks that can worsen global warming.

Although the initiative will likely require new facilities for importing liquified natural gas, the partnership is also geared toward reducing reliance on fossil fuels in the long run through energy efficiency and alternative sources of energy, according to the White House.

Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU’s executive arm, said it is important for Europe to shift away from Russia and toward energy suppliers that are trustworthy, friendly and reliable.

“We aim to reduce this dependence on Russian fossil fuels and get rid of it,” she said.

Russian energy is a key source of income and political leverage for Moscow. Almost 40% of the European Union’s natural gas comes from Russia to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry.",https://whyy.org/articles/u-s-eu-announce-new-partnership-to-undercut-russian-energy/

9,5b00dc08-a109-4e11-9058-2e4d5df850e0,['Anita Powell'],,"U.S. President Joe Biden met with American troops during a visit to Poland on Friday in support of allied responses to the humanitarian and human rights crises sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as allies take new action to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“You are in the midst of a fight between democracies and oligarchs,” Biden said as he met in Rzeszów with members of the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division, which is supporting thousands of other NATO troops in eastern flank countries that include Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bulgaria and Romania.

Biden’s first visit with U.S. service members was in a makeshift barbershop at the division’s temporary headquarters. Biden then stopped at a dining facility for the troops, where he sat and shared pizza with them.

""You are the finest fighting force in the world and that's not hyperbole,” Biden said before sitting down to eat with the troops.

Biden also received a briefing at the Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport on the allied response to the humanitarian crisis and the growing number of refugees who are fleeing the violence in Ukraine.

Also attending the briefing was Polish President Andrzej Duda, who was scheduled to greet Biden when he first arrived in Poland earlier Friday in the eastern town of Rzeszów, nearly 100 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. Poland, a NATO ally, has taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees.

The Polish president’s plane, however, experienced a mechanical issue en route, forcing him to return to the capital, Warsaw. Duda later met with Biden after eventually arriving in Rzeszów.

Biden’s arrival in Poland came hours after meeting Friday in Brussels with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, after which they announced formation of a joint task force to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels.

Biden said Putin has used the profits from its energy sales ""to drive his war machine"" in Ukraine. Biden said he wanted ""to make it clear that the American people would not be part of subsidizing Putin’s brutal, unjustified war against the people of Ukraine.""

""We are determined to stand up against Russia's brutal war,"" von der Leyen said. ""This war will be a strategic failure for Putin.""

The United States is providing Europe with 15 billion cubic meters of liquid natural gas this year.

In Ukraine, Russian forces are “faltering” east of the capital of Kyiv, British defense ministry official Mick Smeath said Friday, further denying Putin’s attempt to seize the capital.

Smeath told reporters that “Ukrainian counterattacks” and retreating Russian forces have allowed the Ukrainian military “to reoccupy towns and defensive position up to 35 kilometers east of Kyiv.”

Russia’s attempted drive toward the southwestern seaport city of Odesa is “being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance,” Smeath said.

On Thursday, Biden said there would be a Western military response if Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine.

""It would trigger a response in kind,"" Biden replied to a reporter's question during a news conference. ""Whether or not you're asking whether NATO would cross [into Ukraine to confront Russian forces], we'd make that decision at the time.""

He also said at NATO headquarters that Russia should be removed from the Group of 20 major economies and that Ukraine should be allowed to attend G-20 meetings.

Biden confirmed the issue was raised during his meetings with other world leaders Thursday as they marked one month since Russia invaded Ukraine.

Asked whether Ukraine needed to cede any territory to achieve a cease-fire with Russia, Biden responded, ""I don't believe that they're going to have to do that,"" but that is a decision for Kyiv to make.""

At his news conference, Biden said the United States was committing more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance ""to help get relief to millions of Ukrainians affected by the war in Ukraine.""

""With a focus on reuniting families,"" the United States will welcome 100,000 Ukrainians and invest $320 million to support democratic resilience and defend human rights in Ukraine and neighboring countries, the president said.

NATO also announced Thursday that the defense alliance would bolster its capabilities after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had called on the organization's leaders to provide more weaponry to his country ""without limitations"" as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its second month.

Zelenskyy's appeal came as Biden met with NATO leaders to discuss their short- and long-term response to the Russian invasion.

Addressing the summit via video, Zelenskyy said his military needed fighter jets, tanks, and improved air and sea defense systems, as he warned Russia would attack NATO member Poland and other Eastern European countries.

""Russia has no intention of stopping in Ukraine,"" he declared. ""It wants to go further. Against Eastern members of NATO. The Baltic states. Poland, for sure.""

A White House statement issued Thursday said that ""between now and the NATO summit in June, we will develop plans for additional forces and capabilities to strengthen NATO's defenses.""

A Biden administration official told reporters that Zelenskyy did not reiterate on Thursday his demand for a no-fly zone, which NATO previously rejected on the grounds it would lead to direct conflict between NATO and Russia.

NATO members said in a joint statement after the summit that they would ""accelerate"" their commitment to invest at least 2% of their national budgets on the alliance, allowing for a significant strengthening of its ""longer term deterrence and defense posture.""

The alliance also vowed to ""further develop the full range of ready forces and capabilities necessary to maintain credible deterrence and defense.""

In addition to participating in the NATO talks, Biden met Thursday with G-7 leaders and the European Council.

The White House on Thursday announced a new round of sanctions targeting 48 Russian state-owned defense companies and more than 400 Russian political figures, oligarchs and other entities — an action Biden said was being done in alignment with the European Union.

Britain said Thursday its new package of sanctions includes freezing the assets of Gazprombank, a main channel for oil and gas payments, as well as Alfa Bank, a top private lender in Russia. Oil tycoon Evgeny Shvidler, Sberbank CEO Herman Gref and Polina Kovaleva, stepdaughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, are among individuals sanctioned.
