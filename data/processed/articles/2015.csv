0,586000a6-2763-4571-a09d-cd5fddecf49e,[],,"Prime Minister Naftali Bennett left a cabinet meeting on Monday evening in order to hold back-to-back phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The call with Putin lasted for roughly an hour and a half, during which the two men discussed efforts to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine, as well as efforts to allow access to Israeli humanitarian aid, a diplomatic official told reporters.

The official said Putin complained to Bennett about the “barbaric” acts of Ukrainian soldiers in the separatist-held Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, where Russia claims 20 civilians were killed. Those reports remain unconfirmed.

A statement from the Kremlin carried by Russian news agencies said Putin shared with Bennett his “assessments” on the negotiation process with Ukraine.

Bennett last spoke with Putin on March 6, a day after the two met in Moscow.

Bennett’s trip was seen as an effort to further develop Bennett’s potential role as a mediator between the sides, as Israel has good relations with both Kyiv and Moscow.

Bennett has also spoken with Zelensky multiple times since Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine, though the two men have not met in person.

In a tweet Monday, Zelensky said, “We exchanged information on our joint steps and steps of our partners against the background of Russian aggression. Agreed on further actions.”

There was no immediate statement from Bennett’s office on either call.

During Monday’s cabinet meeting, Bennett said Israel was managing its response to Russia’s war on Ukraine with “sensitivity and responsibility,” pushing back against criticism over the fact that Jerusalem has failed to take stronger action against Moscow over the invasion of its neighbor.

“We are managing this complex crisis with sensitivity and responsibility, and are making an effort to offer assistance however we can,” Bennett said.

Details of Israel’s mediation efforts have remained obscure. Saturday saw a top adviser to Zelensky deny a report that Israel had pushed the Ukrainian leader to accept an offer from Putin that would see Ukraine make significant concessions to end Russia’s invasion.

Israeli officials have indicated that Jerusalem has not taken a position, nor has it brought forward a proposal for a ceasefire. Rather, they assert that Bennett’s role has been to clarify the two sides’ positions to each other and to other global players, thanks to Israel’s good relations with both nations.

Zelensky suggested on Saturday that negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to end the war could be held in Jerusalem, but the prospect of Israel’s capital hosting a summit for negotiators remains particularly low after Monday’s call with Putin, Channel 12 reported.

Though Israel has long had good relations with both Ukraine and Russia, its relationship with Kyiv has been strained because Bennett has avoided directly blaming Russia for the war, although Foreign Minister Yair Lapid has done so.

Ukraine has repeatedly pushed Israel for more support since Russia launched its invasion. But Israel has been seeking to avoid antagonizing Russia, which has a strong presence in Syria, where Israel carries out military action against Iran-linked groups.

Putin and Bennett spoke “about the efforts to reach a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine as well as humanitarian matters,” the Israeli official said. A separate set of discussions between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are slated to continue on Tuesday.

Senior diplomatic sources privy to the talks say there has been a softening of language on both sides, but they do not believe Putin is yet ready to engage in serious diplomacy as he maneuvers for a battlefield advantage in the nearly three-week-old war, during which Russian forces have been hampered by fierce Ukrainian resistance. The Russian military is advancing on the capital of Kyiv, but “almost all” Russia’s advances in the country “remain stalled,” a senior U.S. defense official told reporters in a background briefing on Monday.

Even so, Putin’s willingness to engage in talks with Bennett—the only Western leader he has met directly with since the war began—indicates he is looking to keep diplomatic channels open. Bennett last spoke with Putin last Tuesday, and the Israeli leader left a cabinet meeting on Monday to talk to him on what officials described as a preplanned call.

U.S. officials have not participated in any of the negotiations, which at times have also involved French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “We respect the efforts of our partners and allies, including France, Germany, Israel, Turkey, and others, to seek a diplomatic resolution,” a senior Biden administration official said in an email. “We maintain open and regular high-level channels of communication with all of them. We are encouraging them to remain in close consultation with President Zelenskyy and the government of Ukraine to ensure that diplomatic proposals reflect Ukraine’s interests and perspective.”

The diplomats engaged in the discussions say that Putin may soon be ready to negotiate a territorial compromise that could mean full Russian control of only the eastern parts of the country. Nonetheless, tensions remained as high as they were at the beginning, especially after Russian missiles struck the Yavoriv training base near the Polish border, killing at least 35 people.

For his part, Zelensky has left open the possibility for compromise on Russian demands that Ukraine never join NATO. In an interview last week with ABC News, he said: “I have cooled down on this question a long time ago, after we understood that NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine. The alliance is afraid of controversial things and confrontation with Russia.”

On the question of separatist territories in the east, the Ukrainian president also appeared ready to negotiate, saying that “we can discuss and find a compromise on how these territories will live on.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/14/putin-zelensky-still-talking-through-israelis/

The meeting took place in Rome as the US told NATO allies and several Asian countries that China had signalled its willingness to provide military and economic aid to Russia to support its war, two US officials who spoke to the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity said.

The Take podcast: Is Russia’s Syria playbook being used in Ukraine?

What can 11 years of war in Syria tell us about Ukraine? This week marks the anniversary of Syria’s uprising and there still seems to be no end to conflict in sight.

There’s also another date that resonates: September 30, 2015, when Russia intervened on behalf of President Bashar al-Assad’s government.

Russia said it tested at least 320 new types of weapons in Syria, some of which are now in use in the war in Ukraine, and it is using tactics that seem to come from what has been called the “Syria playbook”.

We look at how the people all too familiar with that playbook see Syria’s story in Ukraine.

Ukraine’s economy could collapse if war drags on: IMF

The Russian invasion could plunge Ukraine into a devastating recession, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.

At a minimum, the country would see “output falling 10 percent this year, assuming a prompt resolution of the war,” the IMF said.

The lender added that if the conflict is prolonged, the situation will worsen. Citing wartime data for conflicts in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, it predicted the “annual output contraction could eventually be much higher, in the range of 25 to 35 percent.”

Could China help end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?

Tense relations with the United States and Europe have pushed China and Russia even closer in recent years.

Russian troops focus efforts on capital Kyiv

Russian troops have refocused their efforts to seize Kyiv, firing artillery on suburbs, a local official said on Ukrainian television.

The official also said a town councillor for Brovary, east of Kyiv, had been killed in fighting there and shells fell on the towns of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, which have seen some of the worst conflict during Russia’s stalled attempt to take the capital.

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Kyiv, said residents in the capital were in for another nervous night, after the shelling of an apartment block in the early morning hours killed at least one person.

“A lot of the residents are very worried that that [attack] may have been an opening salvo for the war for control of the capital,” Khan said. “Military analysts are suggesting it may have been a way to keep pressure on the Ukrainians even as the talks were going on.”

A first convoy of cars was allowed to leave the city at 1pm (11:00 GMT), Andrei Rempel, a representative of the Mariupol city council who is now in Zaporizhzhia, told the Reuters news agency.

“In the first two hours, 160 cars left. There are probably already many more now. We don’t know when the first cars can get to Zaporizhzhia as there are still many Russian checkpoints that need to be passed,” Rempel said.

Erdogan says unclear whether Turkey will buy more Russian arms

Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan has said it is too early to comment on Turkey’s possible purchase of more Russian weapons given Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Under the current circumstances, it would be premature to talk about what the future shows right now. We have to see what the conditions bring,” Erdogan said, speaking in Ankara alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

NATO member Turkey was handed US sanctions in December 2020 over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence systems and had been criticised by Western allies over the move. Ankara has said it was forced to opt for the Russian weapons because allies did not provide arms on satisfactory terms.

Response to Russia could shape new era: Japan PM

The Russian invasion of Ukraine may have ushered in a new era, Japan’s prime minister has said.

“Whether the world can respond resolutely to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and protect the core of the international order is a litmus test to foresee the era that follows the post-Cold War period,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said.

Japan has frozen the assets of major Russian banks and the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders – and also blocked certain Russian banks’ access to the international payments system SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication).

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has confirmed the deaths of at least 636 civilians in Ukraine through to March 13, including 46 children.

Land corridor ‘links’ annexed Crimea, separatist-held Donbass regions

The deputy head of the annexed peninsula of Crimea claims that a land corridor now links the area with the separatist Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

Russian news agency RIA Novosti quoted Georgiy Muradov as saying that Russian forces had taken control of the road from Crimea to Mariupol.

According to Muradov, this could help provide people in the Donetsk region with humanitarian supplies. At the same time, Kyiv said that Russian troops blocked a convoy with aid supplies for the besieged port of Mariupol in Donetsk.

Observers assume that one of the goals of Russia’s attack on Ukraine is to establish a land corridor from the separatist areas bordering Russia in eastern Ukraine to the Crimean Peninsula. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

“Ukrainian troops are shooting in all directions”

Our correspondent Abdel-Azim Mohammad on the fighting between between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the eastern parts of Irpin – where thousands of civilians are trapped.

“We are in the heart of Irpin city, the front line where the Ukrainian army is engaged in fierce fighting with the Russians. We tried to advance towards downtown, but it seems that the Russians made it before us.

The Ukrainian troops are shooting in all directions, saying Russian snipers are stationed on rooftops to prevent the civilians from leaving the city. Dozens of residents were seen leaving from this area as well as the eastern side of Irpin.

The Ukrainians said they managed to fend off the Russians this morning. You can see the Ukrainian army’s forefront, they are trying to force the Russians back.

To my right, also fierce exchange of gunfire. It seems the Russians are advancing from more than one direction (natural sound… firing)… heavy machine guns and anti-craft guns are fired… (natural)…. (sky) they are firing into the air. It seems like a drone is hovering above… (natural)…. In this spot, and a few minutes before we arrived, dozens of civilian residents had left the city.

They claim the Russian forces granted them only a 15-minute window to leave the area before roads are closed. Many of the residents who were stranded in the eastern suburbs of Irpin managed to leave.

The Ukrainian troops are adamant to fight to force the Russians back since thousands of civilians are still trapped in northern and eastern parts of the city.”

Brands, the parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut, according to the business daily, citing sources familiar with the matter.

They have threatened to arrest officials who have criticised the government or to seize assets, including intellectual property.

Russian default no longer ‘improbable’

Russia may default on its debts in the wake of unprecedented sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, but that would not trigger a global financial crisis, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.

Georgieva told CBS’s “Face the Nation” programme that sanctions imposed by the United States and other democracies were already having a “severe” effect on the Russian economy and would trigger a deep recession there this year.

The sanctions were limiting Russia’s ability to access its resources and service its debts, which meant a default was no longer viewed as “improbable,” the IMF official said.

Asked if such a default could trigger a financial crisis around the world, she said, “For now, no.”
