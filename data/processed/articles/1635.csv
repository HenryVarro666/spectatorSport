06:14 am: Trump asks Putin to help dish dirt on Hunter Biden

Donald Trump has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched an invasion of Ukraine last month, to reveal any compromising information he might have on US President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter.

The former Republican president returned to accusations he had repeated many times during his unsuccessful campaign against Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

In an interview excerpt broadcast Tuesday by Real America’s Voice “Just the News” show, Trump claimed that the wife of the mayor of Moscow gave $3.5 million to Hunter Biden.

“That’s a lot of money,” he said. “She gave him $3.5 million so now I would think Putin would know the answer to that. I think he should release it.”

Trump has long claimed, without providing evidence, that the younger Biden received the funds from Elena Baturina, wife of the late Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, in a bid to curry favor with Joe Biden.

04:55 am: US State Department warns that Moscow may ‘detain’ Americans in Russia

The US State Department issued a travel advisory on Tuesday warning that Moscow “may single out and detain US citizens in Russia” and repeating earlier warnings for Americans not to travel to the country.

The warning was “due to the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces” as well as the potential for harassment of US citizens by Russian authorities, the travel advisory said, repeating calls for Americans travelling or living in Russia to leave “immediately”.

03:57 am: Death toll in Mykolaiv strike rises to 12

At least 12 people were killed and 33 wounded on Tuesday when a Russian missile hit a regional government building in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, emergency officials said.

“The bodies of 12 people have been recovered from the site of the destruction and 33 people have been injured,” Ukraine’s emergencies agency said in a statement on Telegram.

Photos posted by the agency showed rescue workers clearing the rubble and a female medical worker in a red suit helping an injured man lying on a stretcher, his face bloodied.

Earlier in the day officials spoke of nine people being killed and 28 injured in the strike, which hit the nine-storey building shortly before 9 am local time, destroying the entire central part of the structure.

After a lull in the fighting that lasted several days, the attack on Tuesday morning surprised this city, which is home to half a million people in peacetime. Mykolaiv stands on the road to Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port in the south.

The front line in the region has recently shifted southeast to Mykolaiv, which is located near Kherson, the only major Ukrainian city that Russia claims to have taken under full control since the war started over a month ago.

03:06 am: With Ukraine farmers on frontlines, UN food chief warns of ‘devastation’

The UN food chief warned on Tuesday that the war in Ukraine was threatening to devastate the World Food Programme’s efforts to feed some 125 million people globally because Ukraine had gone “from the breadbasket of the world to breadlines.”

“It’s not just decimating dynamically Ukraine and the region, but it will have global context impact beyond anything we’ve seen since World War Two,” WFP Executive Director David Beasley told the 15-member United Nations Security Council.

Beasley said 50 percent of the grain bought by the WFP, the food-assistance branch of the United Nations, comes from Ukraine, “so you can only assume the devastation that this is going to have on our operations alone.”

“The farmers are on the frontlines,” he said.

Beasley added that the crisis was compounded by a lack of fertilizer products coming from Belarus and Russia.

“If you don’t put fertilizer on the crops, your yield will be at least 50% diminished. So we’re looking at what could be a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe in the months ahead,” he told the council.

02:48 am: Ukrainian military remains wary of Russian promises

The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said Tuesday evening that Russia’s promise to curtail military operations in some areas was “probably a rotation of individual units and aims to mislead.”

01:14 am: Thousands of civilians may have died in Mariupol in past month, UN says

Thousands of civilians may have died in the besieged port city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine since bombing began four weeks ago, the head of the UN human rights mission told Reuters on Tuesday, providing its first estimate.

Nearly 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since Russian forces laid siege to it a month ago, a spokesperson for Mayor Vadym Boichenko said on Monday.

His office said 90% of Mariupol’s buildings had been damaged and 40% destroyed, including hospitals, schools, kindergartens and factories.

“We do think that there could be thousands of deaths, of civilian casualties, in Mariupol,” Matilda Bogner, head of the UN human rights mission in Ukraine which deploys some 60 monitors, said in a virtual interview.

She said the mission did not have a precise estimate but was working to gather more information.

Local officials, citing witness accounts, last week estimated that 300 people were killed in the March 16 bombing of a Mariupol theatre where people were sheltering.

As of Tuesday, the UN human rights office had confirmed 1,179 civilians killed and 1,860 injured across Ukraine in the five-week old conflict, amid reporting delays due to the hostilities, a statement said.

March 30, 00:36 am: Western diplomats accuse Russia of fuelling global food crisis

Western diplomats accused Russia before the UN Security Council on Tuesday of having caused a “global food crisis” and putting people at risk of “famine” by starting the war in Ukraine, which serves as a breadbasket for Europe.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “started this war. Vladimir Putin created this global food crisis. And he is the one who can stop it,” US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said during a Security Council meeting devoted to the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.

France’s ambassador to the UN, Nicolas de Riviere, furthered that “Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is increasing the risk of famine around the world” and that populations in developing countries would be the first to be affected.

“Russia will no doubt try to make us believe that it is the sanctions adopted against it that are creating an imbalance in the world security situation for food,” de Riviere added.

Moscow’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia indeed countered that potential turbulence in the global food market was in fact caused by “the unbridled sanctions hysteria that the West has unleashed against Russia.”

Sherman and the director of the World Food Program (WFP), David Beasley, reported that Ukraine and Russia, which are both major cereal producers, represent 30 percent of world wheat exports, 20 percent for corn and 75 percent for sunflower oil.

10:06 pm: Ukraine's Zelensky calls Russia talks 'positive' but wants to see results

""But we're not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal,"" he said. ""We think that what they probably have in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere.""

""We all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine,"" Kirby said. ""It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over.

""Russia has failed in its objective of capturing Kiev,"" the Pentagon spokesman said, but ""they can still inflict massive brutality on the country including on Kyiv"".

The leaders of the United States, UK, France, Germany and Italy on Tuesday urged the West not to drop its guard against Russia after Moscow signalled it would scale down fighting around two Ukrainian cities.

UK: Some Russian forces have been forced to return to reorganize Some Russian forces that have suffered heavy losses in Ukraine have been forced to return to their own country or Belarus, but setbacks on the ground mean more mass artillery and missile strikes, the United Kingdom's defense ministry said Wednesday. The U.K. in an intelligence update said that Russia's claimed focus on eastern Ukraine is an acknowledgment that its forces are struggling. ""Russia will likely continue to compensate for its reduced ground maneuver capability through mass artillery and missile strikes,"" the U.K. defense ministry said. The United Nations human rights office has said that most of the civilian casualties it has recorded in Ukraine have been from explosive weapons that affect large areas, like heavy artillery, rockets, missiles and airstrikes. The U.N. has recorded 1,179 civilians killed, including 104 children, since Russia attacked on Feb. 24. It says the real number of civilian casualties is higher than what has been able to be reported and corroborated so far.

Video shows damage in Ukrainian city of Irpin, said to be liberated Recaptured Ukrainian city of Irpin left with destruction from Russian invasion March 30, 2022 01:05 Video from the city of Irpin on Tuesday showed the devastation in the western Kyiv suburb a day after Ukraine's president and others said the city was back under their control.

Ukrainian and U.S. officials were dubious Tuesday of Russia's claims that it would ""drastically"" reduce military operations around Kyiv. Defense Department press secretary John Kirby said Tuesday it is clear that Russia considered Kyiv an objective. ""We ought not be fooling, and nobody should be fooling ourselves, by the Kremlin's now-recent claim that it will now just suddenly reduce military attacks near Kyiv,"" Kirby said. Kirby said only small numbers of units have been seen moving away from the Kyiv over the last day. ""But we believe this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal — and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine,"" he said. ""It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over."" Share this -







Satellite images show apparent devastation, hunger in Mariupol Satellite images published Tuesday by a U.S. defense contractor appeared to show widespread destruction in residential areas of Mariupol, Ukraine, and the grim reality faced by thousands of hungry civilians who remained there.

Ukraine lawmakers push for more help during visit to U.S. Congress WASHINGTON — Members of the Ukrainian parliament visiting the U.S. Congress are urging their American allies to send more military supplies — air support, tanks and other equipment — to push the Russians out of their country. As the Ukrainian legislators spoke Tuesday at a Capitol Hill news conference, one of their cellphones blared with the sound of an air raid siren going off in the country back home.

U.S. troops training Ukrainian troops to use equipment in Poland U.S. officials are trying to clarify what Biden meant when he said Monday that American troops are training Ukrainian troops. White House officials denied there was formal training going on but confirmed that U.S. troops in Poland are having regular ""interactions"" with Ukrainian troops there to teach them how to use U.S. and foreign military equipment.

25 senators demand expedited delivery of lethal aid to Ukraine In a letter to White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan, a bipartisan group of 25 senators led by Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., urged the Biden administration to rush lethal aid to Ukraine amid Russia’s ongoing war. “America’s commitments to Ukraine and to our NATO allies demand we expedite the delivery of weapons and capabilities to our allies and partners; Ukraine can win this fight if we help them win this fight,” they wrote. The senators, including members of a recent bipartisan congressional delegation to Poland and Germany, requested information that included a list of lethal and nonlethal aid provided to Ukraine along with its delivery status in addition to an inventory and assessment of equipment that could be provided to Ukraine from various sources. “The U.S. mission in Ukraine must go beyond ensuring the country merely has the means to defend itself against Russia aggression,"" they wrote.

Pentagon calls Russia's Kyiv claims a 'repositioning,' not a 'retreat' A small number of Russian troops have moved, mostly northward, away from Kyiv, Defense Department spokesperson John Kirby said, but he reiterated that the U.S. views it as a ""repositioning."" “We are not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal,” Kirby said at a news conference. He said the small number of troops the Pentagon has seen moving are “not a significant chunk of the multiple battalion tactical groups Russia has around Kyiv"" and warned that the threat to the Ukrainian capital was far from over. Pentagon officials believe the movement is “likely more a repositioning to be used elsewhere in Ukraine,"" Kirby said, warning that Russia could launch a ""major offensive against other areas of Ukraine.""

Atomic energy chief in Ukraine to ensure nuclear plant safety The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is in Ukraine for talks with government officials to ""ensure the safety and security of the country’s nuclear facilities and help avert the risk of an accident that could endanger people and the environment."" At the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which was taken by Russian forces on Feb. 24, technical staff members who had worked for nearly four weeks were rotated out last week and replaced with other nearby staff. Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi's visit confirmed that eight of Ukraine's 15 operational nuclear reactors across four sites were operational, including some in Russian-controlled areas. Others were offline for maintenance. The IAEA said a ""subcritical"" nuclear research facility near Kharkiv that was attacked has a ""low"" amount of nuclear material, too low to trigger any chain reaction. Share this -

Top U.S. commander in Europe says Russia launched 'multiple' hypersonic missiles in Ukraine NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Tod D. Wolters said Tuesday that Russia fired ""multiple"" hypersonic missiles in Ukraine, with most directed at military targets.

Wolters, who also serves as commander of U.S. European Command, did not specify the exact number of hypersonic missiles launched.

Russian troops seen moving away from Ukraine's capital As Ukrainian troops continue to claw back territory from Russia around Kyiv, Russian soldiers appear to be adjusting their activity and shifting away from the besieged country's capital. ""We're seeing some movement of troops away from Kyiv, which could be an indication of Putin having to adjust his original plan,"" a White House official said Tuesday. ""But no one should read too much into an adjustment — should momentum build, Russia could change its plans again at any moment, or this could just be a regroup."" On Monday, a senior U.S. defense official said Russia was not making any progress, advances or effort toward Kyiv, while last week, U.S. officials said Russia's assault on the capital failed to gain traction as Ukrainian forces were able to roll back Russian troops to the east and stymie them northwest of the city.

U.N. urges investigation into videos of alleged POW abuse by Russia and Ukraine A top U.N. official has called on both Russia and Ukraine to investigate videos that appear to show their soldiers mistreating prisoners of war during the conflict in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv has said it is looking into a video that purports to show Ukrainians shooting Russian prisoners in the legs. The commander of Ukraine’s army has suggested that the graphic video is a staged act of propaganda. NBC News was unable to authenticate the video. The Kremlin — whose disinformation efforts have varied as widely a accusing the U.S. of running a network of nonexistent ""biolabs"" across Ukraine to denying it has launched a war at all — said it is also investigating the video.

Ukraine pushes for international agreement for security guarantees Ukrainian negotiators involved in peace talks with Russia in Istanbul on Tuesday said they want to see an international agreement under which other nations would act as guarantors of Ukraine's security. David Arahamiya, a member of Ukraine's delegation, said the Ukrainian side wanted international security guarantees that would see guarantor countries act in a similar way to NATO's Article 5, which holds that an attack against one member country should be seen as an attack against all members. He said guarantor countries could include United Nations Security Council member states, including the United States, United Kingdom, China, Russia and France, as well as other countries such as Turkey, Canada, Germany, Italy, Poland and Israel. If other countries wanted to join, they would have the opportunity, he said. Arahamiya said there would also be a clause in the agreement stating that all guarantor countries will not only refrain from denying Ukraine's accession to the European Union, but would also assist in the effort. He said the agreement would first have to be approved in a referendum by Ukrainians and then ratified by the Parliament of Ukraine and approved by guarantor countries. Share this -

ICRC calls for clear agreement for safe evacuation of residents in Mariupol, other cities The International Committee of the Red Cross called on Ukraine and Russia on Tuesday to reach a clear agreement for the safe evacuation of civilians from the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol and other places as vital supplies run out. Robert Mardini, ICRC director-general, told Reuters that the neutral aid agency would not participate in any forced evacuations of civilians from Ukraine and it had no first-hand information that this is happening. ""Our concern is that the very intensity of the fighting is putting civilians in harm's way, the fact that in places like Mariupol civilians are not able to leave in safe conditions, there were no concrete agreements by parties to the conflict for safe evacuation of civilians, nor has there been a green light to get humanitarian aid in,"" Mardini said. Ukraine and Russia must allow the ICRC to visit captured prisoners of war, in line with the Geneva Conventions, and return the remains of people killed in the conflict, he said in an interview at ICRC headquarters in Geneva.

Ukraine calls on countries to criminalize the use of Pro-Russia 'Z' symbol Ukraine's foreign minister has called on states to criminalize the use of the ""Z"" symbol, which has been used as a way to publicly show support for Russia's invasion. “’Z’ means Russian war crimes, bombed out cities, thousands of murdered Ukrainians. Public support of this barbarism must be forbidden,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet Tuesday. The original meaning of the “Z” symbol has remained something of a mystery since it was first spotted on Russian tanks. In the weeks since, the letter ”Z” has become a symbol used to show support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Two German states have already banned the portrayal of the symbol. Share this -

The visit was planned during Tuesday's round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in Istanbul, which represent the first direct peace talks between the sides in more than two weeks.

Israeli and Ukrainian sources told Haaretz that the delegation would hold meetings with Israeli officials on cease-fire talks and Israel’s policy on Ukrainian refugees. Israeli diplomatic sources said they also expect the Ukrainians to reiterate their request for ammunition and defense equipment from Israel.

The delegation is led by Sergey Shefir, a top presidential aide and close confidante of President Zelenskyy. Shefir will be joined by former ambassador to Israel Hennadii Nadolenko and Jewish lawmaker Olga Vasilevskaya-Smaglyuk later on Wednesday.

""We would like to touch upon the whole range of issues. Our goal is to properly facilitate communication while considering Israel's stance,"" Vasilevskaya-Smaglyuk told Haaretz.

The delegation is expected to meet with Israel’s Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, although plans for the meeting have yet to be finalized. They are also set to meet with other senior Israeli officials, and possibly Prime Minister Bennett as well.

Also on Wednesday, a U.S. official said, citing declassified intelligence, that Russian President Vladimir Putin was misled by his advisers about how poorly the war in Ukraine is going and how damaging Westerns sanctions have been to Russia's economy.

""We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions, because his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.

During the talks in Istanbul, Russia promised at peace talks on Tuesday to scale down its military operations around Kyiv and northern Ukraine, while Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status but with international guarantees that it would be protected from attack.

The talks in a palace in Istanbul came as Russia's invasion has been halted on most fronts by strong resistance, with Ukrainians recapturing territory in counter-attacks, even as civilians are trapped in besieged cities.

A top aide to Zelenskyy said last week that Ukraine's intelligence services are cooperating closely with its Israeli counterparts.

“Today Ukraine is facing horrible humanitarian catastrophe. I feel sorry for Minister Shaked, who forgot that the Jewish people have been refugees for all of their lives. Unfortunately the lessons of history already forgotten. Let me remind you [of] the case of the St.Louis - a vessel boarded with Jews who were trying to escape the horrors of war in Europe and failed to find a safe harbor,” Yevgen Korniychuk said at the opening of a photography exhibition about the war.

The MS St. Louis was a passenger ship carrying hundreds of Jewish refugees which was turned back by various western countries, including Cuba and the United States, before returning its passengers to Europe in 1939.

“Today Ukrainians is facing artificial obstacles to enter Israel and escape horrors of war,” Korniychuk said, stating that he believed most Israelis agreed with him and calling on “the Israeli government to wake up and accompany the spirit of the Jewish people in their actions.”

Korniychuk’s comments came a day after the state informed Israel's High Court that it will continue to restrict the entry of Ukrainian refugees who are not eligible for immigration to Israel under the Law of Return and have no relatives in the country, despite the existence of a visa-free travel agreement between Jerusalem and Kyiv.

U.S. says troops in Poland are 'liaising' with Ukrainian forces

Traumatised Ukrainians scavenge in besieged cities

ISTANBUL/KYIV OUTSKIRTS/MARIUPOL, Ukraine, March 29 (Reuters) - Russia promised on Tuesday to scale down military operations around Kyiv and another city but the United States warned the threat was not over as Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status in a sign of progress at face-to-face negotiations.

Talks took place in an Istanbul palace more than a month into the largest attack on a European nation since World War Two that has killed or injured thousands, forced nearly 4 million to flee abroad and pummelled Russia's economy with sanctions.

Russia's invasion has been halted on most fronts by stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces who have recaptured territory even as civilians are trapped in besieged cities.

""A decision was made to radically, by a large margin, reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions,"" Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin told reporters on Tuesday.

He made no mention of other areas that have seen heavy fighting, including around Mariupol in the southeast, Sumy and Kharkiv in the east and Kherson and Mykolaiv in the south.

Russia has started moving very small numbers of troops away from positions around Kyiv in a move that is more of a repositioning than a retreat or a withdrawal from the war, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

""It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over,"" spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing.

A total of 10 U.S. F-18 aircraft and more than 200 troops are being deployed to NATO member and Russian neighbour, Lithuania, and U.S. troops in Poland are ""liaising"" with Ukrainian forces as they hand over weapons to them, he added.

Russia calls its assault a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" Ukraine. The West says it launched an unprovoked invasion.

Some analysts noted that Russia's promise to reduce fighting mostly covered areas where it has been losing ground.

""Does 'we'll drastically reduce military operations around Kyiv' = 'we’re getting our ass kicked, transitioned to a hasty defense?'"" tweeted Mark Hertling, a retired U.S. lieutenant general and former commander of U.S. forces in Europe.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said only a concrete result from the talks can be trusted.

""We can say the signals we are receiving from the talks are positive but they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells,"" he said.

PROPOSALS

Ukrainian negotiators said that under their proposals, Kyiv would agree not to join alliances or host bases of foreign troops, but would have security guaranteed in terms similar to ""Article 5"", the collective defence clause of the transatlantic NATO military alliance.

They named Israel and NATO members Canada, Poland and Turkey as countries that may give such guarantees. Russia, the United States, Britain, Germany and Italy could also be involved.

The proposals, which would require a referendum in Ukraine, mentioned a 15-year consultation period on the status of Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014.

The fate of the southeastern Donbas region, which Russia demands Ukraine cede to separatists, would be discussed by the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.

Kyiv's proposals also included one that Moscow would not oppose Ukraine joining the European Union, Russia's lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said. Russia has previously opposed Ukrainian membership of the EU and especially of NATO.

Medinsky said Russia's delegation would study and present the proposals to President Vladimir Putin.

To prepare a peace agreement, Medinsky later told the TASS news agency, ""we still have a long way to go"".

U.S. President Joe Biden spoke by phone about Ukraine with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

A source familiar with the situation told Reuters the allies discussed more financial aid of up to $500 million for Ukraine.

SCAVENGING

On the ground, reports of attacks continued.

A shell hit a temporary Russian military camp near the border with Ukraine late on Tuesday, Tass news agency said and cited a source as saying preliminary data showed it had been fired from the Ukrainian side.

Tass issued the report shortly after a senior local official reported a series of explosions outside the city of Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine. Reuters could not immediately verify the details.

In Mariupol, besieged for weeks by Russian forces, thousands of civilians may have died, the head of the United Nations human rights mission in the country told Reuters on Tuesday, providing its first estimate of the toll.

Those who remain there are suffering.

""We are eight people. We have two buckets of potatoes, one bucket of onions,"" said Irina, an engineer, in her apartment where windows had been blasted out. Her group boiled soup on a makeshift stove in the stairwell.

Elsewhere, however, Ukrainian forces have made advances, recapturing territory from Russian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv, in the northeast and in the south.

One recaptured area on a road towards the village of Rusaniv was littered with burnt-out tanks and bits of Russian uniforms. Surrounding houses were destroyed.

In the southern city of Mykolaiv, a missile blasted a hole through the main administrative building. Authorities said at least 12 people were killed and 33 injured. read more

The Moscow-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic in eastern Ukraine may consider joining Russia once it controls all of Ukraine's Donetsk region, its leader was quoted as saying. Kyiv has said any such move would have no legal basis.

Several European Union countries on Tuesday expelled dozens of Russian diplomats, some for alleged spying, in what the Irish prime minister said was a coordinated move. Russia vowed retaliation.

Russian and Ukrainian officials agreed to a temporary cease-fire in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, with evacuations planned for Friday, even as the Pentagon reported devastating airstrikes there and in Kyiv, the capital, over the previous 24 hours. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Dozens of buses began arriving in the area around Mariupol on Thursday to deliver humanitarian aid and transport civilians, an effort that a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross called “desperately important” for a city that has borne the worst of Russia’s invasion and where 100,000 residents may still be trapped.

Russian troops also appeared to be withdrawing from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, officials said.

A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said Moscow could be planning to seize Mariupol as a springboard into the eastern Donbas region, where Russians troops may try to envelop Ukrainian forces. Russia’s military has increasingly tried to seize towns in that part of Ukraine, the Pentagon has said, and forces pulled from the country’s north appear to be heading there.

The focus on Mariupol came as Western officials attempted to assess Russia’s next moves, with troops withdrawing from the Chernobyl nuclear plant, diplomats preparing for more discussions Friday and the war continuing to disrupt oil and natural gas supply around the world.

Ukraine’s state-owned firm Energoatom said March 31 that all of the Russian forces had withdrawn from the Chernobyl nuclear power station. (Video: Reuters)

There were also new claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin is being further isolated from his advisers, with a picture of chaos emerging around Russia’s front lines and tensions at the highest levels of the Kremlin.

Jeremy Fleming, head of Britain’s signals intelligence agency, said in a speech Thursday that Russian soldiers are short on morale and weapons and have refused orders, sabotaged their own equipment and shot down one of their own aircraft.

In Washington, President Biden said Putin “seems to be self-isolated, and there’s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers.”

“But I don’t want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don’t have that much hard evidence,” Biden said.

Both Biden and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expressed doubt Thursday about Russia’s claim that it is withdrawing from the area around Kyiv, with Stoltenberg saying Moscow has lied about its intentions before and appears to be repositioning troops for fresh attacks.

“We can only judge Russia on its actions, not its words,” he said at a news conference in Brussels. “According to our intelligence, Russian units are not withdrawing but repositioning.”

The chief of Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said Russian soldiers were withdrawing from what he characterized as the “main part” of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant site, which Russian forces captured in February shortly after the war broke out. But Minister German Galushchenko noted that some troops remain at the facility and cautioned that “no one can predict their next steps.”

Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-owned atomic energy firm, said Russian forces were handing over Chernobyl to Ukrainian authorities and withdrawing troops. In a statement on Telegram, the company shared a letter in which Russian and Ukrainian forces purportedly agreed to the “transfer of protection” of the site. The claims could not be independently verified.

The Pentagon said Thursday that it was “unclear” about the accuracy of unconfirmed reports that Russian soldiers who are leaving the Chernobyl nuclear station had been exposed to high levels of radiation and presented signs of illness.

Biden’s remarks on Putin came after he announced he had authorized the release of an average of 1 million barrels a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the next six months as a “wartime bridge” until U.S. production can ramp up later this year.

The Treasury Department, meanwhile, unveiled new sanctions on Russia’s technology sector, focusing on an area that enables Moscow to acquire technology critical for its military, including one firm that is Russia’s largest microchip producer.

“We will continue to target Putin’s war machine with sanctions from every angle, until this senseless war of choice is over,” Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said in a statement.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected claims that the Russian leader’s advisers have misled him about the invasion of Ukraine.

“They don’t understand President Putin,” he said of Western government and intelligence officials who made those assertions Wednesday. “They don’t understand the decision-making mechanism, and they don’t understand our style of work.”

Putin announced Thursday that he had signed a decree requiring “unfriendly countries” to pay for natural gas in rubles through Russian banks. He said in broadcast remarks that existing contracts would be terminated for those countries that refuse to comply. The stipulation takes effect Friday, a day later than the initial deadline.

But French, German and British officials are rejecting Russian demands to pay for gas deliveries in Russian rubles.

Speaking during a joint news conference later in the day, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner and his French counterpart, Bruno Le Maire, said they would continue paying in euros. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters that paying in rubles “is not something we will be looking to do,” Reuters reported.

The devastation wrought from five weeks of war showed no signs of ending. The death toll rose to 20 in Tuesday’s Russian missile strike on the regional government headquarters in the southern city of Mykolaiv, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said.

In a Facebook post Thursday, the agency said rescuers had removed 19 bodies from the scene and that one person died in intensive care. Dozens more were injured.

Drone video published Wednesday and verified by The Washington Post shows widespread destruction in Mariupol. The video, which compared recent images with footage from 2021, shows the stark contrast of before and after the siege, including the Mariupol Drama Theater that was bombed two weeks ago.

The destruction within the city has drawn comparisons with the siege of Aleppo in 2016, when Russian forces helped Syrian President Bashar al-Assad crush rebels in an eight-month campaign that featured the use of cluster bombs, chemical weapons and other banned munitions, in addition to heavy shelling and conventional airstrikes.

Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev, the Russian three-star general who led forces in Syria, has been identified as the architect of the devastating siege of Mariupol and has been given a new nickname: the Butcher of Mariupol. Ukrainian officials blame him for the bombing of a maternity hospital, the Drama Theater and other buildings in the port city and vowed to see him tried for war crimes in The Hague.

“Remember him,” Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of Ukraine’s Center for Civil Liberties, tweeted recently over a photo of the 59-year-old general, a man with close-cropped gray hair and pale blue eyes. “This is Mikhail Mizintsev. He is leading the siege of Mariupol.”

The thousands of expected evacuees from Mariupol will be brought to the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia. By Thursday evening, 45 buses had arrived in the region to transport people, according to local officials. Neither the Russians nor the Ukrainians specified when the cease-fire and humanitarian corridor would end, but Ukraine said its soldiers would “guarantee a full cease-fire regime.”

A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said its teams would travel with the convoy Friday “to facilitate the safe passage of civilians out of Mariupol.”

But the exact status of the convoy was uncertain late Thursday. A United Nations official said the organization had not been able to reach Mariupol and other places of great need, “despite extensive efforts.""

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a Telegram message that more than 30 buses remained at the city entrance waiting to pick people up and take them to Zaporizhzhia.

Despite the local cease-fire, part of the convoy was fired upon Thursday afternoon while driving toward the Russian-held city of Berdyansk, as the column of buses approached a checkpoint, damaging at least one vehicle, according Tetiana Ignatenkova, a spokeswoman for the Donetsk regional administration. Previous humanitarian corridors in the country also have been fragile, with each side accusing the other of violating cease-fires and obstructing supplies.

Since the start of the conflict, 80,000 residents have been evacuated from Mariupol using buses and private transport, according to the local government.

Ukraine will resume peace talks with Russia online on Friday, a senior Ukrainian diplomat participating in the negotiations said on his Telegram channel, after tentative progress in discussions in Istanbul on Tuesday.

The diplomat, David Arakhamia, said Ukraine stressed the need for a meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a venue not in Belarus or Russia. But Russian officials declined, saying the sides should first work out a more coherent draft agreement, he said. Ukrainian officials have said any peace deal should be signed by the two leaders.

The two sides have been exploring ways for Ukraine to become a neutral country as part of a broader peace deal. Ukrainian officials have demanded a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian forces to the borders that existed on Feb. 23 — a day before Russia launched its invasion, Arakhamia said.

The negotiations have been met with skepticism by Ukrainian and Western officials. Ukrainian lawmaker Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, who visited Washington, D.C., this week as part of a parliamentary delegation, repeatedly said Putin was using the talks as a smokescreen to buy time for his forces in Ukraine to regroup.

“It is difficult to negotiate with someone when the gun is being [pointed] at your head,” she said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. In remarks to reporters published by CNN on Wednesday, she said Putin was “sending false, lying messages” to the world.

The Russian military said Tuesday that it had ""drastically"" reduced its activity near the Ukraine capital of Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv as talks with Ukraine aimed at ending the war entered the “practical” stage.

Russia and Ukraine held face-to-face talks Tuesday in Turkey as the United Nations pressed for a cease-fire in Russia's brutal invasion. The talks took place in the Turkish presidential office in Istanbul and lasted more than three hours, Russia's Tass agency reported.

Alexander Fomin, Russia's deputy minister of defense, said the military cutbacks were made to “increase mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations.”

President Joe Biden, who had a call with European leaders Tuesday morning to discuss aiding Ukraine and pressuring Russia to end the war, was asked about the Russian claim of a military cutback near Kyiv.

""We'll see,'' he said.

The Pentagon sounded even more skeptical, as press secretary John Kirby said the pullout of troops was small and they may be reassigned.

""We're not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal,'' Kirby said in a news briefing. ""We think what they probably had in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere.''

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed mistrust in “the words coming from representatives of the country that continues fighting to destroy us,” pointing out that although the direction of the current peace talks is positive, it ""can’t silence explosions of Russian shells.”

Ukraine’s military said it had detected withdrawals around the cities, and U.S. Gen. Tod Wolters, commander of the U.S. European Command, said that is “exactly what we see.” The Russian advance on Kyiv had stalled in recent weeks, but missile strikes have battered the city and left shortages of food, water and other necessities for a population of almost 3 million people.

Negotiations for a cease-fire being held in Turkey are expected to continue Wednesday. The head of the Ukrainian delegation, David Arahamiya, said his side presented an official proposal for a new system of security guarantees. The proposed security pledge will not apply to the parts of Ukraine whose status remains in dispute – Crimea, which Russia considers its territory after annexing it in 2014, and the breakaway Donetsk and Lugansk areas.

""We insist that it be an international treaty signed by all security guarantors who ratify,"" Arahamiya said. ""We want it to be an international mechanism of concrete security guarantees for Ukraine.""

Lead Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said Ukraine pledged not to join any military alliance and not to host foreign military bases or foreign troops. Even military exercises would require prior approval from guarantors, according to the proposal.

Kyiv also pledged not to seek to obtain weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, Medinsky said. In return, Ukraine requires that Russia will not object to Ukraine joining the EU one day.

Zelenskyy has said his country was prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, and was open to working out a compromise over the contested eastern region of Donbas over the next 15 years.

'We’ll see': Biden not ready to believe Russia’s military reduction

President Joe Biden said Tuesday that he will wait until Russia follows through on its stated plans to scale back its military presence near the Ukraine capital of Kyiv before judging the significance of the move.

“We’ll see,” Biden told reporters when asked for his view on Russia’s announcement. “I don't read anything into it until I see what their actions are. We'll see if they follow through on what they're suggesting.”

Alexander Fomin, Russia's deputy minister of defense, said Russia has “drastically” reduced its military activity near Kyiv and Chernigov amid talks with Ukraine on a peace deal. He said the military cutbacks were made to “increase mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations.”

Biden referenced the negotiations as he discussed a Tuesday morning phone call he had with United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.

In the nearly one-hour call, they talked about continuing to provide military aid to Ukraine and making Russia pay a high price for ruthlessly attacking its neighbor, the White House said.

“There seems to be a consensus that let’s just see what they have to offer,” Biden said of his conversation with the European leaders. “We’ll find out what they do. But in the meantime, we're going to continue to keep (strengthening) the sanctions. We’re going to continue to provide the Ukrainian military with their capacity to defend themselves. And we're going to continue to keep a close eye on what's going on.”

Pentagon on Russia's withdrawal announcement: 'We're not taking anything they say at face value'

The Pentagon reacted with skepticism Tuesday to Russia’s claims that it has withdrawn forces near Kyiv.

While small numbers of Russian troops have moved back from positions around the Ukrainian capital, the Pentagon believes it is repositioning, not a real withdrawal, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said.

“It’s not anywhere near a majority of what they have arrayed against Kyiv,” Kirby said.

The Russians still have a significant majority of their combat power near Kyiv, Kirby said. President Vladimir Putin massed more than 150,000 troops for the invasion of Ukraine.

Ukrainian forces have retaken territory from the Russians west of Kyiv, Kirby said. To the east of Kyiv, the Ukrainians have pushed back Russian forces to more than 30 miles from the city.

It’s too early to judge what Russia will do next, Kirby said, but its aims have been clear.

“Russia has failed in its objective of capturing Kyiv,” Kirby said. “It’s failed in its objective of subjugating Ukraine.”

The British Defense Ministry Intelligence agreed the Russians have almost certainly failed in their effort to encircle Kyiv after repeated setbacks and counterattacks by Ukrainian forces.

Russian statements and reports that some units have left “may indicate Russia’s acceptance that it has now lost the initiative in the region,” according to a statement from Mick Smeath, Britain’s defense attache.

The Pentagon’s assessment that Russia is repositioning its forces is based in part on the shift of their military focus on eastern Ukraine, Kirby said.

“We’re not taking anything they say at face value,” Kirby said.

'We did not invite them here': Flow of refugees dwindles as some Ukrainians feel emboldened

Whether it stems from increased confidence in their military, an inability to flee or a desire to stay and fight, the flow of Ukrainians leaving the country nearly five weeks into the Russian invasion has slowed significantly.

Most of the 3.9 million refugees departed from Ukraine in early March, at a time when about 140,000 people were escaping into Poland every 24 hours. Now, about 30,000 refugees arrive per day in Poland, according to UN data. In Moldova, daily refugee counts have dropped from about 20,000 per day in early March to around 2,000, and 21,000 have actually gone back home.

As the Ukrainian military pushes back in the face of relentless bombardment, some citizens are feeling more emboldened.

“We are ready. We expect that Russia will come. And we will fight,"" said Odesa resident Alex Kobzev, 44, who has been coordinating aid distribution. “We are supposed to be all brothers, but we did not invite them here.''

Chechnya leader says his fighters could take Kyiv

The leader of Russia's Chechnya province wants to storm Kyiv. Ramzan Kadyrov, speaking to about 10,000 troops in Chechnya’s regional capital of Grozny, said that “we need to complete what we have started,"" a reference to the Kremlin announcing it was backing off its assault on Kyiv to allow for negotiations.

Kadyrov has posted numerous videos in recent days that appear to feature him and Chechen fighters on the outskirts of Kyiv and elsewhere in Ukraine. Kadyrov said Moscow should have allowed his fighters to press the offensive.

“I’m more than confident that we would have entered Kyiv and established order there,"" he said.

Kremlin: US-Russia dialogue crucial despite Biden 'insults'

President Joe Biden's blunt criticisms of Russian President Vladimir Putin have a negative impact on relations but dialogue between Moscow and Washington is in the interests of the whole world, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday.

""Insults cannot but leave their mark on relations between heads of state,"" Peskov said. ""Especially personal insults, which in general should have no place in the rhetoric of the head of state.""

Biden in recent days has referred to Putin as a ""war criminal'' and on Saturday said Putin ""cannot remain in power.'' The White House later clarified that Biden was not calling for regime change in Russia.

""One way or another, sooner or later we will have to talk about the issues of strategic stability, security and so on, in other words, those issues that only we can and should discuss,"" Peskov said.

Europe sends dozens of Russian diplomats home

At least four European allies expelled dozens of Russian diplomats Tuesday as relations between Russia and the West continue their plunge since the invasion. The Netherlands said it was expelling 17 Russians who it described as intelligence officers masquerading as diplomats. Belgium said it was ejecting 21 Russians, the Czech Republic one. Ireland told four senior Russian officials to leave the country because of activities deemed not “in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behavior."" All this after Poland expelled 45 Russians last week.

“Together with our allies, we are reducing the Russian intelligence presence in the EU,” the Czech Foreign Ministry said.

US troop presence in Europe almost doubles, to 100,000

U.S. troop presence in Europe has swelled from 60,000 to about 100,000 as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Gen. Tod Wolters, commander of the U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO, told the Senate Armed Services committee on Tuesday.

""Russia's premeditated and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has galvanized our allies and global partners,"" he told the committee. ""NATO's capabilities in space and cyberspace are more closely integrated than in any other time in the Alliance's history.""

Wolters said the U.S. is supplying Ukraine with military requirements ""to ensure they're getting the right equipment at the right time ... so they can best protect their forces.""

Asked why Russia would have used hypersonic weapons in Ukraine, Wolters said it was likely done ""to put fear in the hearts of the enemy, and I don't think they were successful."" He said most of those strikes were aimed at military targets.

Ukraine's defensive strategy could add to peril facing civilians

Ukraine's defense against Russian attacks could be increasing the risk to civilians in the war-torn nation, experts tell The Washington Post. Most neighborhoods in Ukraine's cities have become ""militarized,"" making them potential targets for Russian forces, the Post says. Russia has been pounding some cities, and Ukrainians have responded by deploying air defense systems, heavy weaponry, soldiers and volunteers to residential areas. All are rich targets for Russian missiles.

“I am very reluctant to suggest that Ukraine is responsible for civilian casualties because Ukraine is fighting to defend its country from an aggressor,” William Schabas, an international law professor at Middlesex University in London, told the Post. “But to the extent that Ukraine brings the battlefield to the civilian neighborhoods, it increases the danger to civilians.”

Russia will make no concessions in Ukraine: Chechen leader

Ramzan Kadyrov, the powerful head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, has said Moscow will make no concessions in its war in Ukraine, deviating from the official line and suggesting the Kremlin’s own negotiator was wrong.

Russia’s chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said on Tuesday that Moscow was taking steps to de-escalate the conflict, including scaling back military activity around Kyiv.

Kadyrov, who has Chechen forces fighting in Ukraine as part of Russia’s military operation, said Medinsky had used “incorrect wording”. If you think that [Putin] will quit what he started just the way it is presented to us today, this is not true,” Kadyrov said in comments on Telegram.

Putin advisers ‘too afraid to tell him the truth’ on Ukraine: US official

Russian President Vladimir Putin is being misled by advisers, a US official has told Reuters, citing declassified intelligence.

“We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions, because his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth,” the official said.

“Putin didn’t even know his military was using and losing conscripts in Ukraine, showing a clear breakdown in the flow of accurate information to the Russian president,” the official said.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later commented on Volodin’s words, saying “This is an idea that should definitely be worked on.”

Reuters cited two Russian sources saying that Moscow plans to keep a contract price for gas exports to “unfriendly” countries unchanged, but the payment should be done in the rouble equivalent on a pre-agreed settlement day, as one of the options to switch the currency.

UN rights chief warns of ‘war crimes’ in Ukraine conflict

The UN rights chief has said that Russia’s widespread and indiscriminate attacks in Ukraine are of “immense concern” and could amount to “war crimes“.

Speaking before the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Michelle Bachelet said her office had received “credible allegations that Russian armed forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times”.

The office was likewise probing allegations that Ukrainian forces had also used such weapons, she said.

“Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes,” Bachelet warned, adding that her office had verified 77 incidents in which medical facilities were damaged.

World facing the highest number of violent conflicts since WWII: UN Chief

The United Nations chief has said two billion people – one-quarter of humanity – are living in conflict areas today, as the world experiences the highest number of violent conflicts since the end of World War II in 1945.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres cited conflicts from Yemen, Syria, Myanmar and Sudan to Haiti, Africa’s Sahel and now the war in Ukraine, which he described as “a catastrophe shaking the foundations of the international order, spilling across borders and causing skyrocketing food, fuel and fertiliser prices that spell disaster for developing countries”.

He told the UN Peacebuilding Commission that last year 84 million people were forced to leave their homes because of conflict, violence and human rights violations. “And this year, we estimate that at least 274 million will need humanitarian assistance,” he said.

Ukraine’s State Emergency Service says that the death toll from a Russian attack on the regional administration building in the southern city of Mykolaiv has risen to 15 people.

It added that 33 others had been wounded in the strike on Tuesday morning, which saw Russian forces allegedly blast a gaping hole in the nine-storey building.

Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the figures provided.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” to demilitarise its neighbour. It denies targeting civilians and has not commented on the incident in Mykolaiv.

UK not aiming to remove Putin from power: Johnson

The United Kingdom is not aiming to overturn Russia’s government and remove President Vladimir Putin from power, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said.

“I understand the frustrations that people feel about Putin and to desire a change of government in itself is not an ignoble thing … that’s the objective of a lot of democratic politics,” Johnson told lawmakers at a committee hearing.

“But let’s be absolutely clear, it’s not the objective of the UK government, and it’s very, very important that everybody gets this. We are simply setting out to help to protect the people of Ukraine, and to protect them against absolutely barbaric and unreasonable violence.”

UN examining forced evacuation claims

The United Nations’ human rights chief has said her office is looking into allegations that some residents of Mariupol, in southeastern Ukraine, have been forcibly evacuated to areas controlled by Russian forces or to Russia itself.

Speaking to the UN’s Human Rights Council, Michelle Bachelet decried a life of “sheer terror” for people in the besieged port city since Moscow launched its offensive.

Ukraine has charged that Russian forces were forcibly taking people from Mariupol and other areas to Russia. Moscow has denied the claims, saying about 500,000 Ukrainians left for Russia voluntarily.

Bachelet added her office was also reviewing “credible allegations” that Russian forces have used cluster munitions 24 times and allegations that Ukrainian forces have done so too.

He added Ukraine had also signalled its readiness not to host foreign military bases and to hold joint drills with foreign militaries only in consultation with countries serving as guarantors of a peace deal, which would include Russia.

Medinsky said the proposals signalled Ukraine’s readiness to reach agreement “for the first time in years”, adding that “if it fulfils the obligations, the threat of creating a NATO bridgehead on the Ukrainian territory will be removed.”

Austria activates alert system to ensure gas supply

Austria has announced that it is following Germany in activating the first level of its emergency plan to ensure gas supply over fears that Russia could cut off exports of the energy source if Western countries refuse to make payments to Moscow in roubles.

Chancellor Karl Nehammer’s office said in a statement that the move involved the “strengthening of existing monitoring systems” which had been in place for weeks.

It added that measures such as gas rationing would only come into play if the third phase of the emergency plan were activated, which required an “immediate crisis”.

UN nuclear watchdog chief visits power plant in southern Ukraine

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has visited a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on his first trip to the country since Russia launched its invasion.

Director General Rafael Grossi said he was meeting with Ukrainian government officials and staff at the southern Ukraine nuclear power plant as part of the UN nuclear watchdog’s effort to provide the country with “technical assistance” to ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities.

He said in a series of tweets that the agency’s presence on the ground in Ukraine “will help prevent the danger of a nuclear accident that could have severe public health and environmental consequences” both within the country’s borders and beyond.

Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors at four active power plants, and is also home to the defunct Chernobyl facility, the site of a major nuclear disaster in 1986. Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl and the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the largest in Europe.

Russia ‘unable to cancel sowing season in Ukraine’ despite attacks: Analyst

Nikolay Mitrokhin, a Russia expert and researcher at Germany’s Bremen University, says Russian forces have not been able to “cancel the sowing season in Ukraine” despite alleged attacks on the country’s agricultural infrastructure.

“Even if they burn down all large fuel storages – the farmers mostly bought the fuel in the fall and have it in tanks by their side,” Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera.

But he added that there is an issue with the export of the remaining wheat from last year’s harvest because the Black and Azov seas are being blockaded by the Russian navy – a situation that is contributing to the panic on the global food market.

A Ukrainian minister had earlier accused Moscow of “purposefully” trying to destroy Ukraine’s agriculture infrastructure in order to disrupt the country’s sowing campaign and create a global food crisis.

Russia attempting to create a global food crisis: Ukraine

Russia is “purposefully” trying to destroy Ukraine’s agriculture infrastructure in order to disrupt the country’s sowing campaign and create a global food crisis, Ukraine’s UNIAN news agency has quoted a government minister as saying.

“Russia doesn’t want us to sow the agriculture lands we have in the areas we control,” Oleh Nemchinov, minister of the cabinet of ministers, was quoted as saying.

“It’s no secret to anyone that the strikes on oil depots that Russia has carried out over the past few days are, in fact, strikes on the sowing field,” he added.

Nemchinov went on to accuse Moscow of wanting to manufacture a “humanitarian catastrophe” in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as the other parts of the world to which Ukraine exports grain, in order to create a “point of geopolitical confrontation”.

Istanbul talks produced no ‘breakthrough’: Kremlin

The Kremlin has said there was no “breakthrough” during the latest round of talks between delegations from Moscow and Kyiv on Tuesday.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters it was a “positive factor” that Ukraine submitted its written proposals during the discussions in Istanbul, but added that “we can’t say there has been something promising or any breakthroughs”.

“There is a lot of work to be done,” he said.

On Tuesday, Ukraine set out a detailed framework for a peace deal under which the country would remain neutral but its security would be guaranteed by a group of third countries. It said it would also be willing to hold talks over a 15-year period on the future of the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014.

Russia, meanwhile, said it intended to scale back its military activity near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv.

Asked about the Ukrainian offer of talks over the status of Crimea, Peskov said there was nothing to discuss on the issue because Crimea is part of Russia under the country’s constitution.

Ukrainian officials believe Russian forces not retreating, but ‘regrouping’: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from the city of Lviv in western Ukraine, says the prevailing wisdom among Ukraine’s leaders is that Russia is “not making a retreat of any kind”, but its forces are instead “regrouping”.

“They continue to say that you cannot trust what Russia says, but that you have to see what they do and watch their actions on the ground,” Basravi said.

“And what we have seen is more attacks in the west of the country overnight – fuel depots were hit, and the Russian ministry of defence has said that is to hinder the resupply of Ukrainian forces fighting in the Donbas region,” he added.

“We have definitely seen an observable uptick in the number of missile strikes happening on this side of the country and we have also seen fighting continue in areas around Kyiv as well as Chernihiv.”

Ukrainian official says fighting continued overnight near Irpin

Ukrainian forces continued to battle Russian troops overnight near Irpin, close to Kyiv, despite Moscow’s claim that it would scale back its attacks in the region, an interior ministry official has said.

Vadym Denysenko, an interior ministry adviser, said in televised remarks that Moscow had pulled some troops and equipment out of Ukraine to neighbouring Belarus.

“But it looks more like rotation and the licking of wounds than the actual cessation of military action,” he said.

“So, it is [too] early to say that Russians are decreasing the intensity of military action in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions,” Denysenko added.

Ukrainian forces recaptured Irpin from Russian troops earlier this week.

Russia’s promised withdrawal aimed at ‘misleading’ Ukraine: Military

Ukraine’s military says it distrusts Russia’s announced withdrawal from around Kyiv and Chernihiv.

“There are indications that the Russian forces are regrouping to focus their efforts on eastern Ukraine,” the Ukrainian general staff said in a statement.

“At the same time, the so-called ‘withdrawal of troops’ is most likely a rotation of individual units and is aimed at misleading the Ukrainian military leadership” by creating the misconception that the Russians have decided not to try to encircle Kyiv, it said.

Russia ‘almost certainly failed’ in Kyiv offensive: UK

The British Ministry of Defence says Russian setbacks and Ukrainian counterattacks around Kyiv mean “it is almost certain” that Russia “has failed in its objective to encircle” the capital city.

In its latest intelligence update, the ministry said Russian pledges to cut back troops around Kyiv may indicate its “acceptance that it has now lost the initiative in the region”.

“It is highly likely that Russia will seek to divert combat power from the north to their offensive in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east,” the ministry added.

Russia, Ukraine trade accusations over naval mines

Russia and Ukraine have traded accusations about the naval mines that have been set adrift in the Black Sea.

The Russian military has alleged that the Ukrainian military had used old naval mines to protect the coast against a Russian landing and some of them have been ripped from their anchors by a storm and left adrift. Russian Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev reaffirmed on Tuesday that “the threat of Ukrainian mines drifting along the coastline of Black Sea states remains”.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry responded in a statement, accusing Russia of using Ukrainian mines it seized after the 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and setting them adrift to “discredit Ukraine before international partners”.

The conflicting claims by Russia and Ukraine couldn’t be independently verified.

US troops ‘liaising’ with Ukrainian forces: Pentagon

The Pentagon has clarified that US troops in Poland were “liaising” with Ukrainian forces as they hand over weapons to them, but were not training “in the classic sense” following remarks from Biden on the matter.

“It’s not training in the classic sense that many people think of training. I would just say it’s liaising,” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.

On Monday, Biden said that while in Poland last week, he talked to US troops who were helping “train” Ukrainian forces.

Zelenskyy says Russia talks gave ‘positive’ signals

Zelenskyy has described the signals from peace talks with Russia as positive, but he expressed caution about Moscow’s promise to sharply curtail military action in some areas.

“We can say the signals we are receiving from the talks are positive but they do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells,” he said, adding that Ukraine could only trust a concrete result from the talks.

“The Russian army still has significant potential to continue attacks against our state,” he said. “Therefore we are not reducing our defensive efforts.”

WFP warns of ‘devastation’ to global aid efforts

The executive director of the World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that the crisis in Ukraine, a major food producer, will have disastrous humanitarian consequences around the world, especially in places already suffering from food shortages, like Yemen and the Horn of Africa.

David Beasley said the world was already grappling with increased food and transportation prices – issues that will get worse as Ukraine goes from being “the breadbasket of the world” to being on “the breadline”.

“Fifty percent of the grain that we buy comes from Ukraine,” Beasley told the UN Security Council. “We feed 125 million people, before Ukraine ever happened. And so, you can only assume the devastation that this is going to have on our operations alone.”

UN calls for ‘unhindered’ humanitarian access in Ukraine

Joyce Msuya, UN assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, has said aid convoys are planned for Ukraine in the coming days and weeks, but warring parties must ensure “unhindered” humanitarian access in the country.

“Civilians in Ukraine desperately need this assistance and protection,” Msuya told a UN Security Council meeting.

“But to do that, all parties must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law to ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to help civilians in their homes and those on the road in Ukraine, and to allow those civilians who want to leave to get out.”

Pentagon says Russia repositioning, not withdrawing, troops around Kyiv

Russia has started moving small numbers of troops away from positions around Kyiv, the Pentagon has said, adding it was more of a repositioning than a retreat or a withdrawal from the war.

“Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yes, we think so. Small numbers,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said during a news briefing.

“But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over.”

Ukraine war threatens ‘rules-based international order’: Biden

Biden has warned that the war in Ukraine threatens the “rules-based international order”, including in the Asia Pacific region, where Washington is locked in growing competition with Beijing.

Speaking at the White House alongside the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong, the US leader said “all nations” have a right to territorial integrity and sovereignty regardless of their size or population.

“It’s clear that Putin’s war is unacceptable to nations in every region in the world – not just in Europe but in every region of the world,” Biden told reporters. “It’s an attack on the core international principles that underpin peace and security and prosperity everywhere.”
