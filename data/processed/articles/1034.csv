With evidence mounting of atrocities in the Kyiv suburbs, and Russian forces preparing for a new offensive farther east, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine delivered a scathing speech to the United Nations on Tuesday, accusing Russia of a litany of horrors and questioning whether a world body that takes no action to stop a war serves any purpose.

Speaking via video link to the U.N. Security Council, he compared Russian forces to the Islamic State, called for a Nuremberg-like war crimes tribunal and vented his bitter frustration, knowing that the council — where Russia is one of five permanent members with veto power — would do nothing but talk.

“Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?” Mr. Zelensky said, raising the question of whether Russia deserved to keep its seat on the council. “Are you ready to close the U.N.? Do you think that the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately.”

The chamber fell silent as a short video provided by Mr. Zelensky’s government played, showing some of the hundreds of corpses found strewn around the city of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, after Russian forces retreated last week — bloated, charred bodies of civilians, including children. Some victims, their hands bound, had been shot in the head.

Mr. Zelensky said that in Bucha, “they killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.” Civilians “were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road,” he added, asserting that “women were raped and killed in front of their children; their tongues were pulled out.”

China refrained from criticizing Russia in Tuesday’s session, saying that the Security Council should wait until investigations establish the facts in Ukraine. A rising global power, China has drawn closer to Russia in recent years, united by a shared antipathy to the United States. The divisions on the war appeared essentially unchanged since Feb. 26, when 11 of 15 Security Council members voted for a resolution condemning Russia’s invasion, Russia vetoed the measure, and three others abstained — China, India and the United Arab Emirates.

Russia’s U.N. ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, reiterated his government’s claims — rebutted by ample evidence — that atrocities in Bucha had been faked, or had not occurred when Russians held the city. He made a number of other unsupported claims, including stating falsely that in Ukraine — where the freely elected president is a Jew who lost family members in the Holocaust — Nazis are “running the show.”

After President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia launched the war on Ukraine on Feb. 24, his military became bogged down on several fronts in the face of logistical failures and unexpectedly fierce Ukrainian resistance. Russian forces spent weeks shelling and occupying cities and towns in northern Ukraine, where they took heavy losses as they failed to capture Kyiv, the capital. Last week they pulled back from that part of the country, preparing for what Russian officials and foreign analysts said would be a shift in focus toward eastern Ukraine.

“The next pivotal battle of the war” is likely to be for the eastern city of Sloviansk, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Institute for the Study of War, based in Washington.

Revulsion over the apparent executions discovered in Bucha deepened Russia’s economic isolation, despite its denials of responsibility.

The United States has started blocking Russia from making debt payments using dollars held in American banks, a move designed to deplete its international currency reserves and potentially push Russia toward its first foreign currency debt default in a century.

And as early as Wednesday, the Biden administration is expected to announce additional sanctions against Russia for the killings of Ukrainian citizens, according to a person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to detail them publicly. The administration will expand existing sanctions against Sberbank, the largest financial institution in Russia, and implement sanctions against Alfa Bank, one of the country’s largest private lenders. The administration also plans to announce sanctions against adult children of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president.

The Biden administration has also authorized an additional shipment of up to $100 million in military supplies that will be taken from existing Defense Department stockpiles, the Pentagon announced in an email sent to reporters Tuesday night. This comes days after an additional $300 million in defense aid was announced April 1.

And the European Union took a significant step toward overcoming resistance to curbing fuel imports from Russia, on which its member nations rely heavily. The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, proposed cutting off imports of Russian coal — oil and natural gas remain hotly debated — and barring Russian vessels from E.U. ports as part of a new round of sanctions.

The measures, which require unanimous approval, are expected to go to a vote of E.U. ambassadors on Wednesday. Diplomats said the sanctions package would target, among others, two daughters of Mr. Putin. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the chief E.U. diplomat, Josep Borrell Fontelles, announced plans to visit Kyiv this week and meet with Mr. Zelensky.

The Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office said that it, along with the Kyiv police, had discovered what it called a Bucha “torture chamber,” where Russian forces had left behind the bodies of five men, their hands tied, who had been tortured and killed.

Mr. Zelensky reinforced a point that U.N. officials have made repeatedly: The true extent of Ukraine’s destruction and casualties is unknown but far greater than what has been documented, because outside observers have been unable to reach some of the most devastated areas. “Now the world can see what Russia did in Bucha, but the world has yet to see what it has done in other parts of our country,” Mr. Zelensky said.

New York Times journalists on Tuesday were able for the first time to reach the town of Borodyanka, northwest of Kyiv, battered by Russian rockets and airstrikes, where the mayor estimated 200 dead lay beneath the rubble. In the besieged port of Mariupol, local officials have put the death toll in the thousands.

Fierce fighting continues along Ukraine’s southern coast, where Mariupol, largely reduced to ruins by Russian bombardment, is “the center of hell,” said Martin Griffiths, the U.N. chief of humanitarian relief.

More than 250 miles west of Mariupol, explosions shuddered through the port of Mykolaiv, a day after the mayor said Russian strikes had killed 10 people and wounded 46. He said that Russians had hit residential buildings, schools, a hospital and an orphanage in his city since the war began, and had used cluster munitions. Soldiers defending the city said that increasingly, Russian forces were hitting civilian targets.

After four consecutive days of trying and failing to send an aid convoy into Mariupol, where people are desperately short of food, water, power, heat and medicines, the International Committee of the Red Cross decided against another attempt on Tuesday.

Ukrainian officials say the Russians have prevented crucial supplies from reaching the city. Mr. Nebenzya, the Russian U.N. ambassador, said the Ukrainians had blocked the convoy, and he claimed that Russian forces had evacuated 123,500 people from Mariupol.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said that in fact, tens of thousands of Ukrainians, including from Mariupol, had been taken to “filtration camps” in Russia, where family members were separated and people were stripped of passports and cellphones. “I do not need to spell out what these so-called filtration camps are reminiscent of,” she said. “It’s chilling, and we cannot look away.”

Rosemary A. DiCarlo, a U.N. under secretary general, said there was credible evidence that Russia had used cluster munitions — shells that burst open to spew many smaller bomblets over a wide area — at least 24 times in populated areas of Ukraine. Most countries have signed a treaty banning cluster munitions as indiscriminate weapons with a high risk of civilian casualties, but Russia, like the United States, has not.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — about one in four — have fled their homes because of the war, including more than 4 million who have left the country, according to the United Nations, creating Europe’s largest and fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II.

Russian forces recently captured the eastern city of Izyum, and Western analysts say they are preparing for a drive to the south and southeast, to bolster efforts to seize more of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. Many of Ukraine’s best-equipped and most experienced military units have been concentrated in that area, known as Donbas.

“Russian forces continue to make little to no progress in frontal assaults” on the portions of Donbas still held by Ukraine, the Institute for the Study of War reported.

Whether the Russians aim simply to reinforce their units in Donbas, or are planning a more ambitious effort to encircle the Ukrainian forces, capturing Sloviansk is crucial, the institute said.

In the Luhansk region on Tuesday, an attack that Ukrainians blamed on Russian forces hit a storage tank containing nitric acid, releasing a toxic cloud and prompting the regional administrator to urge people to stay inside and close their windows.

The Russian units that withdrew from the region around Kyiv, having suffered heavy casualties, extensive equipment losses and poor morale, the institute said, “are highly unlikely to be effectively deployed elsewhere in Ukraine and are likely a spent force.”

An intelligence assessment released by the British defense ministry was less definitive, but said that any Russian forces redeploying from the north would first need considerable time to repair and replace equipment, and to make up for casualties.

(Vadim Ghirda/AP)

The Ukrainian town of Borodianka has been completely destroyed by fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces, new videos show.

CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the videos that were first published on Tuesday.

On March 1, a Russian airstrike destroyed at least two apartment complexes in Borodianka; it was the first report of damage in the village roughly 30 miles — 50 kilometers — northwest of Kyiv.

Since then, the town has been the site of intense firefights and military strikes. Drone footage from March 4 shows the middle of another apartment complex collapsed into a heap of rubble from a military. Video posted to Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov's Telegram channel showed his fighters walking the streets of the village around that time.

CNN previously reported that Russian forces took temporary control of a psychiatric hospital — it held nearly 700 patients — in Borodianka on March 5.

At the time, regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba said that the village had no water or electricity.

""There is no Borodianka — it is almost completely destroyed,"" Kuleba said. ""The city center is just awful. Borodianka is under the influence of Russian troops, they control this settlement.""

Now that Russian forces have retreated, the full scope of destruction is coming into view.

""There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodianka and some other liberated cities,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address on Monday. In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago.""

The complete and total destruction seen in the videos from Borodianka is only comparable to the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

Both videos start near the two apartment complexes that CNN reported were hit on March 1. Every single building along Lenina Street — the main thoroughfare through the town — has been hit.

Entire village blocks have been reduced to rubble. The burnt metal frames of military vehicles are also seen on the side of the debris-littered road.

The images over the weekend from the Ukrainian suburb of Bucha outside Kyiv — bound and battered bodies strewn in the streets, bags of corpses lining muddy trenches, limbs protruding from mass gravesites — have produced perhaps the most profound moment of “moral outrage” among the international community since the start of Russia’s bloody invasion.

But do the atrocities — uncovered amid Russian forces’ retreat from northern Ukraine — constitute genocide? It depends on who you ask.

Ukrainian President VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY has been unequivocal. “Indeed, this is genocide, the elimination of the whole nation and the people,” he told CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. Kyiv Mayor VITALI KLITSCHKO concurred, telling German newspaper Bild that “what happened in Bucha and other suburbs of Kyiv can only be described as genocide.”

In interviews Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” however, both Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN and NATO Secretary General JENS STOLTENBERG declined to use that term. Blinken pledged that U.S. officials “will look hard, document everything we see” and “put it all together” for the “relevant institutions and organizations.” Stoltenberg said only that the massacre was “a brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades.”

President JOE BIDEN weighed in Monday, telling reporters that “what is happening in Bucha is outrageous,” and calling Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN “brutal” and “a war criminal.” But pressed on whether he agreed with Zelenskyy’s assessment of genocide, Biden replied: “No, I think it is a war crime.”

National security adviser JAKE SULLIVAN also addressed the distinction at the White House news briefing Monday: “This is something we of course continue to monitor every day. Based on what we have seen so far, we have seen atrocities. We have seen war crimes. We have not yet seen a level of systematic deprivation of life of the Ukrainian people to rise to the level of genocide.”

The semantic debate between Ukraine and the West is reminiscent of other dust-ups in recent months over what kind of language to use with regard to Russia’s aggression. Zelenskyy’s government memorably broke with the Biden administration in the days before Moscow’s declaration of a “special operation” on the White House broadcasting that a Russian invasion was “imminent.” On the other hand, Biden has been slower than some of his fellow world leaders to accuse Russia of war crimes.

On the genocide question, though, it’s Zelenskyy who’s in the right, according to GREGORY STANTON, the founding president and chair of Genocide Watch. “My view is that these are crimes of genocide, as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity,” he said.

While war crimes and crimes against humanity refer to prosecutable crimes by individuals that are covered by the Geneva Conventions, genocide is typically a group crime — one that can be committed by a state against its own people or the people of another state, Stanton explained. In this case, he said, the invading Russian forces “have the intent to destroy, in part, a national group, and that’s the Ukrainian group.”

ALEXANDER HINTON, director of the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University, has a different view. While it’s apparent that Russia is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine, he said, it’s not exactly provable that genocide is taking place there — although such a possibility remains a “very real threat.”

The legal definition of genocide is the intent to destroy one of four types of protected groups — ethnic, national, racial or religious — “because of who they are,” Hinton said. Perpetrators of genocide “want to destroy a people as opposed to defeat an army,” and they operate with “an intent and a systematicity.”

Putin’s past statements about seeking to denazify Ukraine, for example, represent statements of intent, he said. But it’s unclear whether those sentiments have trickled down through the ranks, and “we don’t have the evidence yet” of a systematized, genocidal campaign in Ukraine.

So, apart from good-faith disagreements on technical definitions, how should natsec observers interpret the Biden administration’s reluctance to label the barbarity in Bucha as genocide? One reason for U.S. officials’ hesitation is that the word is “sort of a legal term” and “considered by lawyers to be their property,” Stanton said. But more importantly, he continued, “genocide is a powerful word,” and a declaration of genocide “places upon a nation greater duties” than a declaration of war crimes or crimes against humanity. “When you use the word, it has consequences.”

Indeed, the U.S. has historically been resistant to designate genocides; only two weeks ago did the Biden administration formally determine that Myanmar's military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the country’s minority Rohingya population in 2016 and 2017.

Hinton said that although the use of the term genocide is “starting to bubble up” outside Ukraine, it’s still a crime under international law — and one with “moral connotations” that “suggest you need to take a stronger form of action.” He added: “I think in this case … there’s a high risk of genocide. There’s a possibility that it’s begun. But it’s not really possible at this point to say for sure it has.”

PUTIN’S PALS WIN REELECTION: Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN’s two closest regional allies amid the invasion of Ukraine, Hungarian Prime Minister VIKTOR ORBÁN and Serbian President ALEKSANDAR VUČIĆ, coasted to reelection over the weekend after pledging during their campaigns to remain out of the war, per Bloomberg’s MARTON KASNYIK, VERONIKA GULYAS and MISHA SAVIC.

Orbán, who’s already ruled for 12 years and is Europe’s longest-serving head of government, won a fourth consecutive term. Vučić won another five years as president, and his ruling Serbian Progressive Party appears positioned to form a majority-backed government. Putin congratulated them both.

A day before Hungary’s election, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy described Orbán as “virtually the only one in Europe to openly support” Putin. After the vote, Orbán said his “huge victory” was “visible even from the Moon, but certainly from Brussels.”

In Serbia, Vučić has declined to join Europe’s sanctions against Russia. He said Sunday that “the most important” for his country “is to have good relations in the region and to continue on its European path, without ruining its ties with traditional friends.”

RUSSIA DRAFTS UNTRAINED FIGHTERS IN DONBAS: In the Donbas region of Ukraine, held by Moscow-backed separatists, Russia has drafted civilians to battle Ukrainian forces despite providing “no training, little food and water, and inadequate weapons” to the conscripts, per Reuters.

Several Donbas conscripts “have been issued with a rifle called a Mosin, which was developed in the late 19th century and went out of production decades ago,” Reuters reports, and a student conscript described having to “drink water from a fetid pond because of lack of supplies.”

In addition, some of the conscripts “were given the highly dangerous mission of drawing enemy fire onto themselves so other units could identify the Ukrainian positions and bomb them.” Roughly 135 conscripts reportedly laid down their arms after being pushed to the war’s front line near the port of Mariupol, and military commanders kept them in a basement as punishment.

FIRST IN NATSEC DAILY — POSSIBLE TERRORISTS AT SOUTHERN BORDER: Two Turkish men with links to ISIS are trying to travel from Mexico to the United States, according to an intelligence product distributed by a regional intelligence-sharing hub based in El Paso, Texas.

The product, which was read to POLITICO, is titled, “BOLO - ISIS Terrorists Possible Attempt to Enter the United States.” It’s dated April 1, and says the two men are traveling from Cancún to Ciudad Juárez. From there, they plan to enter the U.S. through El Paso. The bulletin did not detail the nature of the intelligence nor specify how they may plan to enter the U.S. A fusion center headquartered in El Paso distributed the intelligence product to its law enforcement partners. Fusion centers are regional hubs for intelligence-sharing. They work with federal law enforcement officials but are controlled by state and local law enforcement.

Attempts by terrorists to enter the U.S. via the southern border are rare but not unheard of. Axios reported in March 2021 that Customs and Border Protection officials had arrested four people at the southern border since October 2020 who were on the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database. A CBP spokesperson told Voice of America that encounters with known and suspected terrorists at U.S. borders “are very uncommon.”

News of El Paso’s ISIS-related concerns come as Republicans have targeted the Biden administration over border security. The Biden administration is slowly rescinding a Trump-era policy — known as Title 42 — that let law enforcement officials quickly expel most migrants from the U.S. because of the coronavirus pandemic. Because of that change, the Department of Homeland Security says it is bracing for “a potential increase in the number of border encounters.”

HONG KONG LEADER WON’T SEEK SECOND TERM: CARRIE LAM, Hong Kong’s fourth chief executive, announced Monday that she won’t pursue a second term, per The Associated Press’ ZEN SOO and VINCENT YU. Her successor is set to be picked in an election on May 8.

“I will complete my five-year term as chief executive on the 30th of June this year, and I will also call an end to my 42 years of public service,” Lam said at a news conference, adding that her decision was met with “respect and understanding” by the Chinese government when it was conveyed last year.

As the AP notes, Lam “presided over a period in which Beijing firmly established control over the former British colony that was returned to China in 1997.” Lam’s popularity sharply declined during her tenure, which saw “huge protests calling for her resignation, a security crackdown that has quashed dissent and most recently a COVID-19 wave that overwhelmed the health system.”

Chief Secretary for Administration JOHN LEE, the city’s second-ranking leader, is likely to enter the race to succeed Lam, according to Hong Kong media. Lee previously served as secretary of security, taking a tough stance against demonstrators during Hong Kong’s 2019 protests.

POLITICAL TURMOIL IN PAKISTAN: Pakistan’s Supreme Court adjourned Monday after hearing a challenge to Prime Minister IMRAN KHAN’s machinations to stay in power, and it plans to pick the case back up Tuesday, per The New York Times’ CHRISTINA GOLDBAUM, SALMAN MASOOD and ZIA UR-REHMAN.

Khan declared the National Assembly dissolved Sunday when his allies blocked a no-confidence vote that he was likely to lose, prompting opposition leaders to bring the case to the court. Khan repeated his accusation Sunday that the U.S. government was acting in coordination with the opposition to oust him from office.

UKRAINE WARNS AGAINST ‘ARMAGEDDON’ GROUP: The Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team warned Monday that a group Ukrainian authorities have previously attributed to Russia is targeting government agencies in Kyiv with malicious emails amid a steady increase of cyberattacks, reports our own MAGGIE MILLER.

According to UA-CERT, the effort involved a group known as UAC-0010, or Armageddon, sending emails with malicious links to government agencies masquerading as containing information on Russian war criminals. The Ukrainian Security Service last year attributed Armageddon to Russian intelligence efforts.

The effort is the latest in a string of Russian-linked cyberattacks against Ukrainian government agencies and critical infrastructure since the invasion began. These have included distributed denial of service attacks that temporarily took down Ukrainian government websites, with one attributed by the Biden administration to Russia in February. Ukrainian authorities announced last month that over 3,000 DDoS attacks had been directed against the nation since mid-February.

Last week, Ukrainian authorities confirmed that a “massive cyberattack” was launched against state-run telecommunications provider Ukrtelecom, with the confirmation coming days after The Washington Post reported that Russia was behind a cyberattack on satellite provider Viasat in February, which disrupted Ukrainian military communications. The stepped-up efforts prompted YURII SHCHYHOL, the chair of the Ukrainian cyber agency, to declare last week that “cyberwar is underway” during a press briefing.

The Ukrainian State Service of Special Communications said in a statement Monday that in the last week there has been an “increase in the number of cyberattacks on state information resources and objects of critical information infrastructure in Ukraine,” with a top Ukrainian official scheduled to brief the press Tuesday morning on the latest intelligence.



The Complex

INDO-PACOM’S $1.5 BILLION WISHLIST: U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has outlined over $1.5 billion in needs that weren’t included in the fiscal 2023 budget request, reports our own CONNOR O’BRIEN (for Pros!) The unfunded requirements list is one of several furnished to lawmakers by the military services and combatant commands as they weigh the Biden administration's budget request.

The list includes $643 million in operations and maintenance efforts. Another $496 million would go toward procurement and $322 million to research and development programs. The command also outlines just over $47 million in unfunded construction projects.

The Pacific region is a priority for the Pentagon and Congress as the U.S. looks to boost its presence to deter China — the “pacing threat” to U.S. national security. Indo-Pacom separately sent lawmakers a five-year, $76 billion plan to fund an array of missile defense systems, long-range precision weapons and new and upgraded airfields across the region.



On The Hill

ON RUSSIA, IT’S HOUSE VS. SENATE: House Democrats are growing frustrated with their Senate counterparts over the upper chamber’s continued stalling on overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation to suspend normal trade relations with Russia. The House cleared the bill with a whopping 424 votes last month, but the Senate has been unable to come to an agreement for a quick vote. It takes consent from all 100 senators to speed up floor consideration, and Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER doesn’t have time to jump through all of the necessary procedural hoops given the Supreme Court nomination votes this week.

“Nearly a month has passed since the House voted to ban the import of Russian energy products, and nearly three weeks have gone by since our chamber approved the suspension of normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus,” House Ways and Means Chair RICHARD NEAL (D-Mass.) said in a statement. “The Senate must consider and pass this legislation before breaking for recess at the end of the week.”

WHERE THINGS STAND… It’s complicated. Senate leaders bowed to pressure from Sen. RAND PAUL (R-Ky.) to change the underlying bill’s language related to Magnitsky Act sanctions for human rights abusers, and other senators have since piled on with their own demands. One of those is the establishment of a World War II-style lend-lease program for Ukraine, as our own ANDREW DESIDERIO detailed. Sen. JOHN CORNYN (R-Texas) is pushing for a lend-lease provision to be added to the legislation, pointing to broad bipartisan support and a recognition by lawmakers in both parties that the U.S. will need to be in the Ukraine fight for the long-haul.
