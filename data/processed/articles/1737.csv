For the latest developments of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, all times EDT:

11:00 p.m.: Russia is closer to defaulting on its debt after its sovereign bond coupon payments were stopped.

The bond coupon payments were not authorized by the U.S. Treasury to be processed by the bank JPMorgan, Reuters reported. The bank was supposed to process the payments from Russia and a payment agent would distribute funds to bondholders.

But the U.S. Treasury is no longer allowing these payments to move forward. “Today is the deadline for Russia to make another debt payment,"" a Treasury spokeswoman told Reuters. ""Beginning today, the U.S. Treasury will not permit any dollar debt payments to be made from Russian government accounts at U.S. financial institutions. Russia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default.""

Russia still has a 30 day grace period to make the payments. The country has 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion, Reuters reported.

9:33 p.m.: Russia's former president Dmitry Medvedev said on the social media app Telegram that Russia will expel diplomats from Western countries after Germany and France both announced Monday ordered a combined 75 Russian officials to leave.

""Now, there is information that in Borodyanka and some other liberated Ukrainian towns, the number of casualties of the occupiers may be even much higher,"" he said.

6:16 p.m.: The New York Times says that satellite images from Bucha, Ukraine refute Russia's claim that the bodies of civilians found in the streets of Bucha were placed there after Russian troops withdrew. Russia's defense ministry said on Sunday the bodies – some with their hands bound and with bullet wounds to the head – ""are another hoax, a staged production and provocation by the Kiev regime for the Western media"" and that no bodies were on the streets when Russian troops left March 30. But the Times posted a video that suggests the corpses found after Russian troops retreated can be seen in satellite images from March 19.

5:06 p.m.: US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Russia is ""revising its war aims"" to focus forces on Ukraine's south and east.

""Russia is repositioning its forces to concentrate its offensive operations in the eastern and parts of southern Ukraine, rather than target most of the territory,"" Sullivan said during a briefing Monday at the White House.

He said U.S. intelligence believes forces are starting to retreat from some areas around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, but he also warned that doesn’t mean citizens there or other cities are safe from attacks, as Russia will likely continue to launch air and missile strikes at targets across the country.

""We should be under no illusions that Russia will adjust its tactics, which have included and will likely continue to include wanton and brazen attacks on civilian targets,"" he said.

3:57 p.m.: It's called the Sweet Home neighborhood — but its streets are now burned out, the windows in the buildings are shattered.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Verashchuk said a total of 2,405 people were evacuated along a humanitarian corridor route running from Mariupol to the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday using the dwindling number of private vehicles left in the area. 1,553 of those came from Mariupol itself, The Associated Press reported.



3:25 p.m.: Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency on Monday that “the morale and the emotional state” of staff working at the country’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility were “very low,” Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement.

1:00 p.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden called Monday for a war crimes trial against Russian President Vladimir Putin, condemning him for the atrocities allegedly committed by Russian troops that have been discovered in recent days in Bucha, a suburb of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

Human Rights Council would be unlikely to enjoy majority support, Reuters reported.

Earlier Monday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said ""Russia's participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,"" adding, ""And it is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the U.N. General Assembly vote to remove them.""

10:17 a.m.: A professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies on Monday discussed on Twitter whether alleged atrocities committed in Ukraine by Russian forces amount to genocide.

10:06 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on national television Monday from the town of Bucha outside Kyiv, where hundreds of civilians were found dead after Russian troops retreated last week, The Associated Press reported.

Human Rights Council. In comments posted on Twitter Monday, she said that images of devastation in Ukraine “require us to now match our words with action.” She said the U.N. should not allow Russia “to use its seat on the Council as a tool of propaganda to suggest they have legitimate concern about human rights.” Last week the president of the U.N. General Assembly was asked at a press briefing if this is possible and she said it is.

3,fff9760e-9732-487e-9fd1-eb949608a057,[],2022-04-05 18:58:36,"The Irish premier said he would back an EU ban on coal and oil imports from Russia over its war in Ukraine.

Micheal Martin said the European Union must keep adding pressure on Moscow to stop its “appalling and immoral war” on the people of Ukraine.

It comes as the EU’s executive branch proposed a ban on coal imports from Russia in what would be the first sanctions targeting the country’s lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the EU needed to increase the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin after what she described as the “heinous crimes” carried out around Kyiv.

Protesters gathered outside the Russian embassy in south Dublin last month (Damien Storan/PA)

She said the ban on coal imports is worth four billion euros (£3.3 billion) per year.

She added that the EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

Ms von der Leyen did not mention natural gas.

A consensus among the 27 EU member countries on targeting gas would be more difficult to secure.

Speaking before the proposed ban, Mr Martin said that Ireland is pressing its EU counterparts for the strongest possible sanctions.

“We would favour the inclusion of oil and coal in this latest round of sanctions given the indiscriminate murder of civilians in Ukraine,” Mr Martin said.

“We have to do everything we possibly can to keep the pressure as a deterrent in this appalling, immoral war on the people of Ukraine.”

Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, said the European Commission had “responded strongly” with new sanctions against Russia.

Shocking scenes of atrocities in #Ukraine by Russian forces must be fully documented & pursued by an International Court. There can be no impunity for crimes like these. International Community has a duty to demand accountability. @CIJ_ICJ @IntlCrimCourt @UN_HRC @DmytroKuleba https://t.co/hmvyDUyKkT — Simon Coveney (@simoncoveney) April 3, 2022

Mr Coveney said: “The sanctions package needs to continue to get tougher so that we continue to provide a very strong deterrent to Russia continuing this war and that means moving into the space of energy, oil, gas and coal as well as access to ports, as well as road access in terms of Russian hauliers.

“The European Commission has announced a fifth round of sanctions which has to be confirmed by member states. That does include a ban on coal which is worth about four billion euro between now and the end of the year.

“They have also said they are working on oil but aren’t in a position to make a decision on that today. It is a pretty strong fifth round of sanctions that involves a recommendation to ban access into EU ports, with some exemptions in terms of humanitarian aid and food.

“And it is targeting Russian banks well beyond where we have been to date. I think the commission has responded strongly. We would like to go even further, particularly in relation to oil.

“In terms of sanctions, Ireland continues to be at the sharp end of wanting to ensure that the deterrent is as strong as we can possibly make it.”

Meanwhile, it has been reported that the Russian Embassy in Ireland is running out of fuel for heating and hot water following claims that Irish oil companies have refused to deliver supplies.

The Irish Daily Mirror reported that the embassy has written a letter to Mr Coveney’s department about the issue.

Mr Varadkar said that while he does not have sympathy for the Russian Embassy, there are rules in which Ireland must follow when hosting international diplomats.

“There are particular rules under the Vienna Conventions as to how we’re supposed to treat diplomats and diplomatic commissions in our country so I think they have to be followed.

“I actually didn’t have the chance to read that article so I don’t know the details.”

Protesters gathered outside the Russian embassy in south Dublin to mark one month since the invasion of Ukraine (Damien Storan/PA)

More than 18,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Ireland since the beginning of the war in February.

The Government has, in recent days, sought additional accommodation in hotels and is seeking other ways to increase supply.

“We’ve asked the Secretary General of the department to chair the task-force to deal with the pledges that are arrived in, to progress that as speedily as we can, so that we can take the pressure off,” Mr Martin added.

“I want to thank all the public servants in all departments including children, justice, housing, local authorities, and across the board for really rising up to this challenge, it has been an enormous challenge which has come very rapidly on the public and has been hot on the heels of the pandemic.”

Meanwhile, Ireland’s ambassador to the United Nations Geraldine Byrne Nason dismissed Russia’s attempt to deny responsibility for the atrocities in Ukraine.

She told the UN Security Council: “Just minutes ago, here in this chamber, we have seen the utterly shocking images of civilians lying dead in the streets of Bucha and elsewhere in Ukraine.

“Some, we know, are piled into improvised mass graves. Simply harrowing.

“So many innocent lives lost on our watch, as our pleas for peace go unheeded.

“The attempts here today to deny Russian culpability are frankly appalling in their cynicism and I see them as an insult to the memory of those slaughtered civilians.”",https://www.cumnockchronicle.com/news/national/20046412.irish-premier-backs-eu-ban-coal-oil-imports-russia/

The Foreign Secretary will hold talks with foreign minister Zbigniew Rau on Tuesday on her second day in Poland’s capital.

The discussions come after Ukraine claimed victory in Kyiv but warned that Russian president Vladimir Putin is turning his attention to taking the east and the south of the embattled country.

Ms Truss used a press conference speech on Monday to call for more weapons to be supplied to Ukrainians defenders as she urged European nations to strengthen Kyiv’s position in the peace talks with Moscow.

The Cabinet minister said the UK was “pulling all the stops out in terms of supplying Ukraine with the support they need”, in a bid to end the “appalling war” and ensure Mr Putin loses.

Speaking in Warsaw, the Foreign Secretary said: “We need even more weapons of the type the Ukrainians are asking for.

“The fact is that being tough is the only approach that will work.

“Putin has escalated this war and this approach is vital to ensuring he loses in Ukraine and that we see a full withdrawal of Russian troops and Ukraine’s hand is strengthened at the negotiating table.”

Ukrainian foreign affairs minister Dmytro Kuleba warned of a “large-scale” assault on the east and south of his country as Russian troops regroup, having been pushed back from the capital.

He told reporters, during a joint press briefing with Ms Truss, that there had been “some hesitation” in the West about providing Ukraine with “all the weapons that we are asking for”.

Mr Kuleba added: “The more weapons we have, the sooner we will be able to win this war and prevent Russia from committing more crimes.”

Ms Truss, in a united plea with her Ukrainian colleague, urged the West to step up economic sanctions on the Kremlin amid reports of splits in Europe on how to respond to what appeared to be deliberate killings of civilians by withdrawing Russian forces.

Mr Kuleba urged Nato foreign ministers, who are due to meet in Brussels later this week to discuss further sanctions, to visit Bucha and other towns and villages outside Kyiv, where atrocities have allegedly been carried out, if they have doubts about the need for further action.

Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians were found in towns around the capital that were recaptured from Russian forces in recent days.

Discoveries include mass graves and people dressed in civilian clothing who appeared to have been shot at close range, with some having had their hands tied behind their backs.

In the face of such bloodshed, Germany has faced criticism for opposing an immediate halt to Russian energy deliveries.

Berlin has said it hopes to end Russian coal imports this summer and oil imports by the end of the year, but halting gas will take longer since it relies more heavily on the power source.

Poland’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki used a speech on Monday to criticise German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, accusing him of paying too much heed to the “voices of German businesses” rather than the innocents slain in Ukraine.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to urge Germany to set a date for phasing out Russian gas when he meets Mr Scholz in Downing Street on Friday, according to The Times.

On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will address a UN Security Council meeting about allegations of war crimes committed by Russia.

Mr Zelensky visited the town of Bucha on Monday, where reports of mass civilian casualties have emerged.

Meanwhile, on Monday more people were successfully evacuated from the besieged port of Mariupol, where Mr Kuleba said there had been worse horrors than in Bucha.

Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a total of 2,405 people were evacuated along a humanitarian corridor route running from Mariupol to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia, with 1,553 of those coming from the city itself and the rest from other locations in the heavily contested area along the Sea of Azov.",https://www.cumnockchronicle.com/news/national/20044721.truss-calls-tough-approach-russia-ukraine-demands-weapon-resupply/

The Foreign Secretary will hold talks with foreign minister Zbigniew Rau on Tuesday on her second day in Poland’s capital.

The discussions come after Ukraine claimed victory in Kyiv but warned that Russian president Vladimir Putin is turning his attention to taking the east and the south of the embattled country.

Ms Truss used a press conference speech on Monday to call for more weapons to be supplied to Ukrainians defenders as she urged European nations to strengthen Kyiv’s position in the peace talks with Moscow.

The Cabinet minister said the UK was “pulling all the stops out in terms of supplying Ukraine with the support they need”, in a bid to end the “appalling war” and ensure Mr Putin loses.

Speaking in Warsaw, the Foreign Secretary said: “We need even more weapons of the type the Ukrainians are asking for.

“The fact is that being tough is the only approach that will work.

“Putin has escalated this war and this approach is vital to ensuring he loses in Ukraine and that we see a full withdrawal of Russian troops and Ukraine’s hand is strengthened at the negotiating table.”
