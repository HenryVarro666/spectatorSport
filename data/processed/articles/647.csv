The figure, based on the accounts of witnesses, came as the United Nations human rights team in Ukraine said it had reports of mass graves in the southern port city, including one that appeared to hold 200 people.

The death toll in Mariupol was revealed as the Kremlin hinted on Friday that it may be scaling back its war ambitions, saying it was close to completing the “first phase” of its military campaign and would now focus on the complete “liberation” of Donbas in eastern Ukraine.

“The combat potential of the armed forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which … makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,” said Sergei Rudskoi, the head of the Russian general staff’s main operational directorate.

He said that while Russia did not rule out that its forces would storm cities such as Kyiv, taking them over was not a primary objective.

The comments correspond with Ukrainian and western analysis that Russian forces have put their efforts around Kyiv on hold as they are unable to fight both there and in Mariupol, a key port in Putin’s war plan.

The Pentagon said that Russian forces had halted their ground offensive on Kyiv, while continuing to bomb it from the air.

“It appears that the Russians are, at least at the moment, not pursuing a ground offense towards Kyiv,” a senior US defence official said. “They are digging in, they are establishing defensive positions…We’re still seeing airstrikes but nothing from the ground.”

The official added: “That is in keeping with our assessment of a couple of days ago that they are going to prioritise the eastern part of the country, in terms of ground offense, and that is exactly what we’re seeing.”

But western officials cautioned that rather that pulling back, Russia was sending extra forces into Ukraine and preparing to deploy another 10 battalion tactical groups – a fighting unit of about 1,000 troops, plus tanks and heavy artillery – from Siberia in the east and Kaliningrad in the west to add to the original invasion force of 115,000 to 120,000. Committing the extra forces was a sign “how far Putin has gone all in”, one official said.

In other developments on Friday:

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, implored Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, to cut trade ties with Russia and join other EU countries in supplying arms to Ukraine. “Listen, Viktor, do you know what’s going on in Mariupol?” Zelenskiy said, adding that Hungary needed “to decide who you are with”.

Joe Biden visited the Polish town of Rzeszów, near the Ukrainian border, in a symbolic show of support for Nato’s eastern European members and for a first-hand look at international efforts to help more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees who have fled the country.

Vladimir Putin compared the cancellation of events involving Russian artists in protest over the invasion to the burning of books in Nazi Germany. “Today they are trying to cancel a 1,000-year-old country,” Putin said.

Britain believes about a sixth or maybe a fifth of Russia’s invasion force – an estimated 20 battalion tactical groups – is no longer “combat effective” – a high degree of losses reflecting the botched invasion and fierce Ukrainian fightback. Putin’s goal was understood by western officials to have been to secure Kyiv within days of the invasion being launched on 24 February.

In a sign of diminishing troop morale, western officials claimed that a Russian commander of the 37th motor rifle brigade was deliberately run over by his own troops in response to the massive military losses being endured.

Late on Friday, Emmanuel Macron said he would speak with Vladimir Putin in the coming days in the hope of negotiating the evacuation of Mariupol’s 150,000 remaining residents.

The city, which has seen some of the most horrific fighting and bombardment of civilian targets such as hospitals and apartment blocks, stands in the way of Russia securing a land corridor between Crimea and the eastern Donbas region that include the parts of Luhansk and Donetsk held by pro-Russian forces with Moscow’s backing since 2014.

Putin’s forces are now pushing deep into the administrative part of the city. Ukrainian sources told the Guardian that they were now clearing multi-storey buildings “one by one and methodically checking every square inch”.

The source said: “If nobody opens the door or the apartment is empty, they break down the door. They are looking for the military and potential saboteurs. They use a scorched-earth policy, to make sure there’s no one to shoot at them or to throw Mmolotov cocktails. I can tell they rely on their previous experience of urban warfare.”

The Ukraine government believes the Azov battalion in the city will continue to fight on, holding up Putin’s plans to create a land corridor enabling his forces to resupply through Mariupol’s port.

Officials in the besieged city said on Friday that at least 300 people were now known to have been killed in the bombing on 16 March of Mariupol’s Drama Theatre, which had been marked with white paint as containing sheltering children.

Civilians trapped in Mariupol, normally home to 400,000 people, have been sheltering in basements with little food, power or running water. About 1,300 people were believed to have been in the building when it was struck, and 150 survivors staggered out of the rubble after the attack.

Sources said the bulk of those in the theatre had been hiding from the shelling under the stage and that rubble was blocking their exit. There are no emergency services operating in Mariupol and the intense fighting and shelling near the theatre has prevented rescue attempts.

The Ukrainian government previously said it was impossible to tell how many were killed because Mariupol was in chaos and under almost constant bombardment from Russian forces.

In a statement on Friday morning, a spokesperson for the city council said they were able to share a death toll. The statement said: “From eyewitnesses, information appears that about 300 people died in the Drama Theatre of Mariupol as a result of a bombardment by a Russian aircraft.”

The Ukrainian defence was boosted on Thursday by the destruction of the Orsk landing ship docked in Berdyansk on the Azov Sea using Ukrainian ballistic missiles. Two other vessels were made inoperable.

The Orsk, which contained weapons and supplies for forces fighting in Mariupol, was capable of carrying 20 tanks, 45 armoured vehicles and 400 troops.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/mariupol-theatre-bombing-killed-300-ukrainian-officials-say

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

""The building is now fully ruined,"" tweeted Minister Dmytro Kuleba, along with a purported photograph of the destroyed theater. ""Russians could not have not known this was a civilian shelter.""

The Mariupol city council said on Telegram that Russia ""purposefully destroyed the Drama Theatre, where hundreds of people are hiding."" The council said a plane dropped a bomb on the building, destroying the ""central part"" of the theater and the ""entrance to the bomb shelter in the building.""

""It is still impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act,"" the city council said on Telegram.

Other images and video purportedly showing the aftermath of the strike were posted on social media.

Russia has denied targeting civilians. The Russian defense ministry said its forces had not struck the building and blamed the attack on the Azov Battalion, a far-right Ukrainian militia, RIA news agency reported.

Mariupol, a southern seaport of 430,000 residents, has become a symbol of Russian President Vladimir Putin's drive to crush democratic Ukraine - but also of a fierce resistance on the ground.

In the nearly three weeks since Russia's war began, two Associated Press journalists have been the only international media present in Mariupol, chronicling its fall into chaos and despair. The city is now encircled by Russian soldiers, who are slowly squeezing the life out of it, one blast at a time.

Several appeals for humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians went unheeded, until Ukrainian officials said Wednesday that about 30,000 people had fled in convoys of cars. Airstrikes and shells have hit the maternity hospital, the fire department, homes, a church, a field outside a school. For the estimated hundreds of thousands who remain, there is quite simply nowhere to go.

The surrounding roads are mined and the port blocked. Food is running out, and the Russians have stopped humanitarian attempts to bring it in. Electricity is mostly gone and water is sparse, with residents melting snow to drink. Some parents have even left their newborns at the hospital, perhaps hoping to give them a chance at life in the one place with decent electricity and water.

People burn scraps of furniture in makeshift grills to warm their hands in the freezing cold and cook what little food there still is. The grills themselves are built with the one thing in plentiful supply: bricks and shards of metal scattered in the streets from destroyed buildings.

Death is everywhere. Local officials have tallied more than 2,500 deaths in the siege, but many bodies can't be counted because of the endless shelling. They have told families to leave their dead outside in the streets because it's too dangerous to hold funerals.

Many of the deaths documented by the AP were of children and mothers, despite Russia's claims that civilians haven't been attacked. Doctors say they are treating 10 civilians for every injured Ukrainian soldier.

""They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to mock it, to constantly bomb and shell it,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on March 10.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-strike-theater-mariupol-residents-ukraine-foreign-minister-says/

As 21 people were reported dead in a strike on a school and community centre near Kharkiv, and 53 bodies arrived at morgues in Chernihiv, both in the north, rescuers cleared rubble from the basement of the Drama Theatre in the southern port city.

Nearly a day after the attack, there were no reports of deaths and the number of injured remained unconfirmed, but with intense street fighting cutting off communications in much of the city there were also conflicting reports about how many survivors had emerged from the basement shelter, which appeared to have held firm.

“The building withstood the impact of a high-powered air bomb and protected the lives of people hiding in the bomb shelter,” the Ukrainian parliament’s human rights ombudswoman, Lyudmyla Denisova, said.

Denisova and a Ukrainian parliament member, Serhiy Taruta, said some survivors had emerged. “After an awful night of not knowing, we finally have good news from Mariupol,” Taruta wrote on Facebook. “People are coming out alive.”

Others were more cautious, however. “The bomb shelter held. Now the rubble is being cleared. There are survivors. We don’t know about the number of victims yet,” said Petro Andrushchenko, an official with the mayor’s office, adding that the shelter was relatively modern and designed to withstand airstrikes.

Russia denied bombing the theatre. The Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said in Moscow on Thursday that allegations Russia had bombed the building were a “lie”, repeating the Kremlin’s assertion that Russia’s armed forces “don’t bomb towns and cities”.

Tetyana Ignatchenko, a spokesperson for the Donetsk regional military administration, said there had been 1,000 people inside the Mariupol theatre a week ago. “But after that, many people were able to escape,” she said. “We can’t say exactly how many people were in the theatre. We can only assume 400 to 500. Half of them.”

At least as recently as Monday, large white letters on the ground in front of and behind the theatre spelled out “CHILDREN” in Russian – “DETI” – to alert warplanes of those inside, according to images from the Maxar space technology company.

Officials posted a photo of the building, its middle part completely destroyed and thick white smoke rising from the rubble. “The only word to describe what has happened today is genocide, genocide of our nation, our Ukrainian people,” the Mariupol mayor, Vadim Boychenko, said.

James Cleverly, Britain’s Europe minister, said the attack “looks to be specific targeting” of a civilian building and thus a “self-evident breach of international law”. He called for evidence of the assault to be documented so those responsible, from “battlefield commanders right up to the top of the organisation, can be held accountable once this war is concluded”.

Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk regional administration, said Russian airstrikes also hit a municipal swimming pool complex in Mariupol where civilians had been sheltering. “There are pregnant women and women with children under the rubble there,” he said. The number of casualties was not immediately known.

In north and north-east Ukraine, meanwhile, at least 53 people had died over the past 24 hours in Chernihiv from airstrikes and artillery shells, the local governor Viacheslav Chaus said. The city “has never known such nightmarish, colossal losses and destruction”, he said. Russian artillery also reportedly killed 21 people, including five children, in a school and community centre in Merefa.

Vladimir, 52, a school PE teacher said he knew some of those who died. “They were customs and border control officers, stationed in Merefa,” he said. “One man, Oleg, 28, was a former student of mine. He was a good kid and he had just got married. His daughter was born a few months ago. Oleg was killed. Another one, Artem, only 20 years old. He was injured after the attack. I was teaching him from year one up to his graduation. He was a great football player.

“What a tragedy. We don’t have many jobs in our remote town. But these men had managed to find one as border patrols […] These boys had no idea there’s gonna be an actual war in the 21st century. In Europe. It’s terrifying.’’

Local officials say more than 2,300 residents of Mariupol have died under a rain of missile strikes and shelling. The Black Sea port has been under attack for almost all of the three-week war, leaving people struggling for food, water, heat and medicine.

Sergiy Orlov, the city’s deputy mayor, said 80-90% of the city had been destroyed by shelling and people were drinking water from puddles. “Our last humanitarian column has been on the road for four days, and Russians don’t let it go into Mariupol,” Orlov said.

“There are buses. We are ready to evacuate 3,000 people a day. They’re not letting us. What’s the solution? Give us a chance to bring humanitarian aid and evacuate everyone who wants to leave. We are ready to do it. They are not ready to give it to us.”

Residents who managed to escape said the most critical situation was to the west of the river that divides the city. “There is no food, no water, people are completely cut off from civilisation,” one man said. “They have no chance to be evacuated to Berdyansk,” a nearby village that displaced people are trying to reach.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/mariupol-theatre-ukraine-civilians-russia-war

Russian forces were also accused of shelling of a convoy of cars of civilians fleeing the city.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Wednesday that the strike on the theatre was deliberate and that the death toll was still unknown, adding: “Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people”.

He also compared the siege of the city to that of Leningrad in the second world war.

Mariupol has been facing a humanitarian catastrophe for days, and Russia continued to rain down fire on it and other Ukrainian cities on Wednesday, even as the two sides projected optimism over efforts at peace talks to negotiate an end to the fighting.

There was no immediate confirmation of numbers of deaths or injuries in what the Mariupol city council said was a “bomb on a building where hundreds of peaceful Mariupol residents were hiding.” “We don’t know if there are any survivors,” one witness said. “The bomb shelter is also covered with debris … there are both adults and children there.”

About 1,000 civilians were allegedly hiding inside the theatre, which was designated as a shelter for the displaced, including children and elderly people.

Later Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of Donetsk regional administration, claimed Russians had also targeted the Neptune swimming pool. “Now there are pregnant women and women with children under the rubble there,” he said in a post on Telegram. “It is impossible to establish the number of casualties from these strikes.”

A witness who posted a video of the aftermath of the attack said the pool had been destroyed and efforts were under way to rescue one pregnant woman trapped in the rubble.

As Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin a “war criminal”, local authorities in Mariupol posted an image of the city’s theatre showing it had sustained heavy damage in the attack. Russian forces had “purposefully and cynically destroyed the Drama Theater in the heart of Mariupol”, it said. Moscow denies targeting civilians and Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had not struck the building, RIA news agency said.

A satellite photograph from 14 March and released on Wednesday by Maxar Technologies showed the word “children” in large Russian script painted on the ground outside the red-roofed theatre building.

Ukraine’s ministry of defence has described Mariupol as the worst front of the war. Mass graves have been dug on the outskirts of the city and the bodies of men, women and children have been left on the streets. More than 400,000 of its inhabitants are either without or with dwindling access to running water, food and medical supplies.

Local officials have said more than 2,500 have been killed. But the reality is that, because of the shelling, the dead cannot be counted.

Ukrainian officials also accused Russian forces of shelling a convoy of cars of civilians fleeing the city, wounding at least five people, including a child.

Local officials shared photos and videos of the aftermath of the alleged attack. “Heavy artillery of the enemy forces fired on a convoy of civilians moving along the highway towards Zaporizhzhia,” the governor of the region, Oleksandr Starukh, said in an online post.

The Ukrainian military also reported the strike in a separate statement. Work was under way to confirm the number of casualties, it said. Authorities also shared a photo of a child it said had been wounded in the attack.

More than 400 people, whom Ukrainian authorities have compared to hostages, remain trapped in a Mariupol hospital seized by Russian forces.

“It is impossible to get out of the hospital,” one employee said on the Telegram social media platform. “They shoot hard, we sit in the basement. Cars have not been able to drive to the hospital for two days. High-rise buildings are burning around … Russians rushed 400 people from neighbouring houses to our hospital. We can’t leave.”

Officials have told families to leave their dead outside in the streets because holding funerals is too dangerous.

Witnesses tell of a city in chaos, under constant bombardment, which is becoming more and more difficult to escape. Thousands of people are trying to reach the city of Zaporizhzhia, where refugees are taking shelter, but according to the Ukrainian authorities, the Russians are trying to prevent citizens from fleeing.

The regional governor, Alexander Starukh, wrote on Telegram that “Russian rockets have landed in the area of the Zaporozhye-2 railway station”.

The right bank of Mariupol, which is divided by a river, is at the centre of a vicious battle between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

The left bank is under Russian occupation and almost completely cut off. One of the two bridges from the left bank has been destroyed and those in contact with relatives inside the city say the second bridge is the scene of intense fighting.

A senior Ukrainian official said it was an “open question” whether a “humanitarian corridor” would be opened on Wednesday to evacuate more civilians. So far, about 20,000 people have managed to leave the encircled port city, but only if they have access to cars.

According to one woman whose parents are trapped in the town, 2,000 vehicles left on Tuesday and about 500 on Wednesday. She has not heard from her parents for four days. The Ukrainian authorities have told those with transport to leave Mariupol, but most of the trapped citizens either do not have cars or their cars have been destroyed by the shelling, three people with relatives inside the city told the Guardian.

A number of witnesses trapped in the city say the Russians are bombing radio and telecommunications towers, meaning that contacting people there has become increasingly difficult. Relatives of those living in the city desperately searching every day for news about their loved ones have been unable to find a phone signal.

“From what I’ve heard from people I’ve managed to speak to, they shot at telecommunications masts, and that’s why there has been no signal, not because the electricity was cut off,” said Iryna Bakazheriva, whose family members are stuck on the right bank of Mariupol.

She was contacted by a neighbour who left the basement and climbed to the eighth floor of his building, where a signal was available. “They are waiting for official information about an evacuation, but there is none,” said Bakazheriva.

Hundreds of people left homeless have gathered in a large public building and have been crammed for days in the basement. “Some have developed sepsis from shrapnel in the body,” Anastasiya Ponomareva, a 39-year-old teacher who fled the city, at the start of the war, but was still in contact with friends there, told the BBC. “Things are very serious.”

“People who managed to hide in underground shelters basically live there permanently,” she said. “They practically cannot leave at all.”

Maryna Hammershmidt, whose elderly parents, sister, nieces and nephews are on the left bank, said she had heard no news from them for two weeks. On Tuesday, Hammershmidt’s sister put a sim card into an old mobile phone and managed to call her.



Hammershmidt’s sister said she and the rest of her family were living in a bomb shelter with 300 other people on the left bank. They have no access to transport. Her sister said a group had tried to leave, but the car in front of them was hit by a missile, so they returned.

01:25 Children's and maternity hospital hit by Russian bombs, say Ukraine authorities – video

Hammershmidt has written to all the officials she can think of in Poland and Ukraine to increase pressure to evacuate those trapped inside the city. “They’ve abandoned a city of half a million people,” she said. “My mother is 78 and my father is 80, they are sitting in a basement. My sister is with a baby who is just one month old.”



“The left bank is completely cut off, there’s about 80,000 people

living there,” she continued. “It’s a living hell. When are they going to evacuate people?”

In a Telegram chat where about 100,000 citizens of Mariupol are collecting testimonies from relatives and friends in the city, users have reported the “the police academy is completely occupied by the Russians”.

Taking Mariupol, which is 34 miles from Russia’s border, would mark a strategic breakthrough for Vladimir Putin.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

The city’s deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC between 1,000 and 1,200 people were in the cultural landmark when it was bombed.

The number of casualties was still unknown, he added.

The Evening Standard could not independently verify the information.

Ukranian MP Roman Hryshchuk accused the Russians of knowing that the theatre was full of children and other civilians. Posting a drone shot of the theatre before the bombing to Twitter, he wrote: “Giant white inscriptions on the ground say: “CHILDREN”. Russians knew there are civilians in the theater.”

The State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine, tweeted: “The Russians dropped a highly explosive bomb just in the heart of Mariupol - Drama Theatre. There were a lot of citizens in there hiding from the shelling, the number of the dead under the rubble remains unknown.”

The Southern city has been under constant Russian shelling since the start of the war, causing immense destruction.

Last week, an attack on a children’s and maternity hospital left five dead.While Russian forces took patients and doctors hostage in a different hospital, the regional governor said on Tuesday.

According to Pavlo Kyrylenko Russian forces captured 400 people and are holding them hostage in the city’s largest hospital.

In a statement on his Facebook, Mr Kyrylenko relayed a first-hand account from one of the apparent hostages saying: “It is impossible to get out of the hospital. Shooting is constant and we are sitting in the basement.

“Cars haven’t been able to leave the hospital for two days. In our hospital, the Russians chased 400 people from neighboring houses. It’s impossible for us to get out.”

As many as 300,000 civilians have been stuck in the since the outbreak of the Russian invasion.

They have become desperate for food and shelter after being left without power.

At least 130 people have been pulled from the Mariupol theater that was hit by a Russian airstrike, but hundreds more remain under the rubble as rescue crews work to find them, according to Ukrainian member of parliament Sergiy Taruta.

As many as 1,000 or more people were in the theater and its shelter Wednesday at the time of the attack, Ukrainian officials say. But it remains unclear how many might have survived. The theater's bomb shelter has three separate sections, Taruta said in an update, and it's not known if all of those portions remain intact.

The Azov Battalion, a paramilitary unit that is part of Ukraine's national guard, posted images online showing the devastated building.

Satellite imagery from March 14 shows that the word ""Children"" (Дети) had been written in Russian on the ground in front of and behind the red-roofed theater, according to Maxar Technologies. That same message is frequently seen on cars and elsewhere during the war, as civilians hope Russian forces will avoid firing on them.

The search and rescue work is complicated by a number of factors, Taruta said, including the lack of critical services in Mariupol, which has been under siege for weeks, and a scarcity of doctors to treat the wounded.

Italy is pledging to help rebuild Mariupol's Drama Theater as soon as possible.

""Theaters of all countries belong to the whole humanity,"" Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said via Twitter.

Ukrainian officials shared footage of the devastated theater on Thursday, with the Mariupol City Council saying the central part of the large building was destroyed.

People in Mariupol have been living under siege since Russian forces isolated it and began shelling the port city.

The city council said more than 350,000 Mariupol residents continue to hide in shelters and basements. The city has been encircled by Russian troops for 16 days — and fighting is raging on its outskirts.

The city council says that, on average, 50 to 100 bombs have been dropped on the city per day, Frayer reports.

Residents have been desperate to flee, as attacks disrupted critical services and infrastructure. Several attempts to establish humanitarian corridors have been marred by continued fire, but some people have managed to flee. In the past two days, the city's mayor said via Telegram, 6,500 private cars were able to leave the city.

Russia's military is razing Mariupol to the ground, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday.

""They just destroy everything there. Everything and everyone who is there,"" Zelenskyy said in a speech to German lawmakers. ""Hundreds of thousands of people are under shelling around the clock. No food, 24 hours a day without water, no electricity, 24 hours a day without communication. For weeks.""

“Occupiers from Russia purposefully destroyed the theater where hundreds of people were hiding,” the Mariupol City Council posted on Telegram.

The officials said they did not know the extent of the casualties, but said hundreds of civilians had been taking refuge in the building — which satellite images show large white letters in two spots directly outside the building with the word “children” written in Russian.

“A plane dropped a bomb on a building where hundreds of peaceful Mariupol residents were hiding,” they wrote. “It is still impossible to estimate the scale of this horrific and inhumane act.”

The council said that the entrance to the building’s bomb shelter had been destroyed in the strike.

Officials said they don’t know the extent of the casualties but that hundreds of people were sheltering in the building. AP
