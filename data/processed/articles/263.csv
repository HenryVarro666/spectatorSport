According to Ukrinform, he said this in an interview with CBC News.

""The allies are helping Ukraine uphold their right for self-defense, which is enshrined in the UN charter. Russia is the aggressor and Ukraine is defending itself. If there is any attack against any NATO country, NATO territory, that will trigger Article 5,"" Stoltenberg said after a meeting with Trudeau, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Latvian Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš at the Adazi base.

Article 5 is the self-defense clause in NATO's founding treaty which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all 30 member nations.

""I'm absolutely convinced President Putin knows this and we are removing any room for miscalculation, misunderstanding about our commitment to defend every inch of NATO territory,"" Stoltenberg said.

According to him, there's a clear distinction between supply lines within Ukraine and those operating outside its borders.

""There is a war going on in Ukraine and, of course, supply lines inside Ukraine can be attacked. […] An attack on NATO territory, on NATO forces, NATO capabilities, that would be an attack on NATO,"" Stoltenberg said.

Stoltenberg said NATO's message to Russia is that ""they have to end the war, that we will continue to support Ukraine and that we continue to impose unprecedented sanctions.""","https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3424729-nato-secretary-general-warns-russia-away-from-attacking-supply-lines-supporting-ukraine.html#:~:text=NATO%20secretary%20general%20warns%20Russia%20away%20from%20attacking%20supply%20lines%20supporting%20Ukraine,-09.03.2022%2016&text=NATO%20Secretary%20General%20Jens%20Stoltenberg,war%20raging%20in%20eastern%20Europe."

“For many years, you have helped to strengthen the Ukrainian armed forces and institutions, including with training for tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops – many of whom are on the front lines today. You have also provided Ukraine with hundreds of millions of dollars of support and essential equipment. We are all inspired by the way in which the Ukrainian forces are bravely resisting the Russian invasion; and Canada’s support has helped to make this possible,” he said.

“Canada is also making significant contributions to the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War,” the Secretary General added. “Yesterday, I was with Prime Minister Trudeau and Defence Minister Anand in Latvia, where Canada has led NATO’s multinational battlegroup with skill and dedication for several years. I thanked them for Canada’s decision to deploy hundreds more troops to reinforce our presence in the region, as well as other capabilities, including in the air and at sea,” he said.

Moderator Ghida Fakhry (TRT World):

Secretary General Stoltenberg, you're used to dealing with these sorts of thorny issues ever since you took over as Secretary General of NATO in 2014 – certainly tensions with former Soviet republics from that point onwards. You heard the Prime Minister's [of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal] repeated pleas: they want more help, they don't just want words of support. Is NATO able and willing to offer them concrete help?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:

Yes, absolutely. And NATO and NATO Allies are providing concrete support. First of all, we have supported them for many years since 2014 with equipment, but not least. Many Allies have trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian forces. And this proves extremely important now because so many of these troops are on the frontlines fighting invading Russian forces. It is of course first and foremost the courage of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian leadership that has stopped and slowed down the Russian invasion, but the support that NATO Allies have provided with training and equipment since 2014 has proven to be extremely important in support for those efforts.

Second, we have stepped up, so NATO Allies are now providing more support, both military support and humanitarian support, and fiscal support, financial support. And then of course, we are imposing unprecedented sanctions on Russia. And all this is actually crippling the Russian economy. So the combination of concrete support and sanctions on Russia puts heavy pressure on President Putin and increases the reasons he will have to at some stage sit down and engage in good faith in the diplomatic effort. So yes, of course…

Moderator Ghida Fakhry:

Do you really believe that these sanctions will have that sort of impact that they will compel President Putin to send back his troops in a week or two or even three, that these political pressures will go anywhere besides inflicting that economic cost, not just on the people of Ukraine, but on people around the world? Look at the rise in energy prices and the price of meat around the world.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:

No one wants these sanctions of course, these sanctions are costly for the whole world, including for those countries which are imposing sanctions. But at the same time, we have to react when we see Russia is blatantly violating international law, invading in a brutal way an independent sovereign country: Ukraine. And 140 nations at the UN condemned that strongly. NATO and NATO Allies have imposed severe sanctions to put maximum pressure on Russia. And that increased likelihood for them at some stage accepting that they have to sit down at the negotiating table – like we heard from the Prime Minister [of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal], every war has to end at the negotiating table. The question is how long we have to wait for that. And therefore with the pressure on Russia, both by the sanctions, but also by providing support to Ukraine – they are on the front line, they are paying by far the highest price. But NATO Allies and other countries all over the world are helping them, supporting them, including with military support.

Moderator Ghida Fakhry:

But what do you say to those who believe that NATO, in fact, should take a large part of responsibility, of the blame and letting the situation get to what it is today? In pursuing the Alliance’s provocative – many people would argue – so-called ‘Open Door Policy’, bringing in more and more countries from Eastern Europe, the Russians have had it as a red line for a long time preceding President Putin. You call this his war, but we know it has been well documented, senior US officials and others have said that the rationale in Russia has been – and in the Soviet Union proceeding that – that Ukraine and Georgia joining NATO was a major issue, that it could lead to this major conflagration and here we are today. Don't you take part of the blame, in fact a large part of the blame?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:

No, not at all. And just the idea that it is provocative that certain nations do what they want, just demonstrates the kind of completely wrong worldview that reflects.

I'm coming from a small country, Norway, bordering Russia. And when we joined NATO back in 1949, Stalin and Russia and the Soviet Union said that was a provocation. But I'm very glad that London, Paris and Washington said, “Well, that's for Norway to decide”. And we applied and they accepted us. So this idea that big powers can decide what small neighbours can do, and if they do something they don't like that's a provocation – you know, that's a world I don't want to live in.

Moderator Ghida Fakhry:

But let’s face it, this is the world we live in. Many see Ukraine as a pawn in a big power struggle between the United States and Russia, let’s face it. Is it a wise policy to continue–?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:

You speak as if NATO is moving east. No, it is independent… Slovenia is one nation, Romania is another, Poland, the Baltic countries – they have through democratic free decisions made their own choices and chosen their own path. And I think it's extremely important that we respect those free democratic decisions. If you start to re-introduce some kind of right for big powers to decide what neighbours can do, then we are moving backwards. Then we are moving into a world where we don't have free sovereign nations. Russia has subscribed to again and again – from the Helsinki Final Act to the Paris Accord, many other documents – that every nation has the right to choose their own path, including what kind of security arrangements they want to be part of. We respect Ukraine when they want to join, but also for us, of course, respect Sweden and Finland when they decide not to join. Russia should respect free and independent decisions by free and independent nations, that's all it’s about.

Moderator Ghida Fakhry:

It's about respecting freedom and the sovereignty of nations.

There's something called the Monroe Doctrine, are you suggesting that the 200 year old doctrine has ended, but the sphere of influence of the US had in the world does not exist anymore? Because let's imagine for a second that missiles were positioned, Russian or Chinese missiles were placed in Cuba or Mexico or Venezuela.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:

I'm not defending everything United States have done throughout 200 years. I have actually been going on the streets also protesting against some of these wars. But the fact that one nation does something wrong in decades, it doesn't in a way excuse the severe mistakes of another. So the whole thinking again, that… you have to start at the basics. The basic is: does an independent, sovereign nation has the right to choose its own path? Yes or no. If you start to question that, you move into a world, which Russia now tries to re-establish by using force. The Ukrainians have [been] standing up against that. They deserve our support. We are supporting that. And it's really impressive to see the strength and the courage they are now demonstrating in the fight against this [inaudible].

Moderator Ghida Fakhry:

Thank you. Before I move on, what is the price of peace for you? As Secretary General of NATO I know you don't hold all the decisions in your hand, but would you be willing to pay a small price by stating, by suggesting that NATO should not expand, expand eastward of course? And when you see the potential membership of Ukraine in NATO as a [inaudible]? Are you willing to state that NATO should not expand any further?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:

So, first of all it is for Ukraine to decide and I respect their decision whenever it's or whether it's to join or not to join.

Second what Russia has proposed the legally binding draft agreement for NATO is that we should sign the agreement with them stopping any further enlargement of NATO. And I think it was very interesting to listen to, for instance, Sweden and Finland. They're not currently applying for membership, but they came very strongly out against that idea. Because for them that was to limit their options in the future. So this goes beyond Ukraine. This, what Russia is asking for is actually a ban on any further enlargement of NATO. And again, it's not NATO moving east. It's actually those countries, again Slovenia, the Baltic countries, Poland…, who have chosen to join our family and this has been a great success. It has helped to spread freedom and democracy across Europe for several decades.

Moderator Ghida Fakhry:

The Russians have been more specific here in the case of Ukraine. They're asking for Ukraine to abide to the principle of neutrality? Just like Austria was forced to after World War II. Would that be a good idea?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:

But you said it forced to…Do you want to live in a world where big powers force small countries to do what they don't want to do? Because that's not the world that I could live in. So the whole idea that it is a provocation for Russia that Ukraine does what they want to do is to turn the worlds upside down, and violate the fundamental principles, which also Russia and subscribe to. So it is for Ukraine to decide whether they want to aspire for membership. And then there's of course for 30 NATO Allies to decide whether Ukraine is ready for membership. And it has been clear for a long time that membership for Ukraine was not something that was imminent, not something which is relevant in the near future. But again, this is what the principle of respecting every nations right to choose their own path.

Moderator Ghida Fakhry:

If it is the only way to stop the war tomorrow? Is the word considering yes or no?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg:

But again, this is for Ukraine to decide. I support Ukraine to decide on its own path. And then of course for 30 allies to decide when Ukraine is ready. And this is not something that is relevant or on the agenda for the near future.

Moderator Ghida Fakhry:

Thank you Secretary General.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193087.htm
3,1b1bdeb6-0ff1-4c07-ad3a-47b789c5d483,[],,"From the very beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2014, NATO has adopted a firm position in full support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. The Allies strongly condemn and will not recognise Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation. The Alliance also condemns Russia’s decision in February 2022 to extend recognition to the self-proclaimed “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic” in eastern Ukraine, which is a flagrant breach of international law that further undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Furthermore, NATO condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine starting in February 2022, which is entirely unjustified and unprovoked. This is a grave violation of international law and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.

As a result of Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, NATO Allies decided in 2014 to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia, while leaving political and military channels of communication open. In February 2022, Allies adopted an unprecedented package of restrictive measures, including massive and severe economic sanctions, which have been imposed on Russia as a result of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. NATO Allies call on Russia to immediately cease its military action and withdraw all its forces from in and around Ukraine, to fully respect international humanitarian law, and to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access and assistance to all persons in need. They also call on Russia to stop restricting navigation in parts of the Black Sea and impeding access to the Sea of Azov.

Throughout the crisis, regular consultations have taken place in the NATO-Ukraine Commission (NUC) in view of the direct threats faced by Ukraine to its territorial integrity, political independence and security. The NUC met for extraordinary meetings in view of Russia’s unjustified use of military force against Ukrainian ships near the Kerch Strait in November 2018 and Russia’s threatening military build-up in April 2021. Other extraordinary meetings of the NUC took place at NATO Headquarters in January and February 2022, focused on Russia’s continued military build-up and unprovoked attack on Ukraine.

In parallel to its political support to Ukraine, NATO has significantly stepped up its practical assistance to Ukraine. Immediately following the illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, NATO Foreign Ministers agreed on measures to enhance Ukraine’s ability to provide for its own security. They also decided to further develop their practical support to Ukraine, based on a significant enhancement of existing cooperation programmes as well as the development of substantial new programmes. At the 2016 Summit in Warsaw, NATO’s measures in support of Ukraine became part of the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP), which is designed to support Ukraine’s ability to provide for its own security and to implement wide-ranging reforms in the security and defence sector based on Euro-Atlantic principles and best practice.

NATO Allies are boosting their political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend itself against Russia’s full-scale invasion. The Alliance is helping to coordinate Ukraine’s requests for assistance and is supporting Allies in the delivery of humanitarian and non-lethal aid. Individual NATO member countries are sending weapons, ammunition, medical supplies and other vital military equipment to Ukraine. They are also providing millions of euros of financial assistance to Ukraine. Many Allies are also offering humanitarian aid to civilians and opening their borders to Ukrainian refugees.

NATO stands with the people of Ukraine and its legitimate, democratically elected president, parliament and government. The Alliance will always maintain its full support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_37750.htm
4,1b1bdeb6-0ff1-4c07-ad3a-47b789c5d483,"['Alex Boutilier', 'Global News']",,"Moscow will “fail” in achieving its objectives in its deadly invasion of Ukraine, NATO’s secretary-general says.

But Jens Stoltenberg told the Ottawa Conference on Security and Defence that the Russian invasion has “shattered” peace in Europe and the transatlantic alliance must prepare for a “dark time” ahead.

“Whatever happens in the months ahead, whatever Moscow seeks to achieve through violence and aggression, it will fail. It is failing already,” Stoltenberg said via videoconference.

“President (Vladimir) Putin wants less NATO on Russia’s borders, but he’s getting more NATO. He wants to divide Europe and North America. But we stand more united than ever. He wants to hold European nations hostage with Russian oil and gas and is instead pushing countries to diversify their supplies and move even faster to a renewable future.”

While Stoltenberg projected confidence in the NATO alliance, however, it is and will remain Ukrainians who are facing the brunt of Russian artillery and siege tactics.

The Kremlin has maintained that its invasion of Ukraine is a “special operation” meant to disarm the country and unseat its leadership, and claims to not be targeting civilians. But images of shattered villages and besieged cities continue to flood out of the conflict as the number of Ukrainians fleeing the war continues to rise.

On Wednesday, the Ukrainians accused Russia of levelling a children’s hospital in Mariupol, a town that has faced heavy bombardment in recent days. The Kremlin denied the claim, insisting that Russian forces do not target civilians.

But the International Committee of the Red Cross said the people of Mariupol are fast running out of electricity, heat, food and drinking water – a situation a Red Cross spokesperson described as “apocalyptic.”

Mariupol is just one front of an invasion that is now stretching into its third week, which has displaced millions of people and killed tens of thousands more. But the strong resistance from the outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian military has dashed Putin’s hopes of a quick victory.

A Ukrainian interior ministry advisor was quoted by Reuters Wednesday saying Russia was desperate for some kind of gains, with Mariupol or Kyiv the most likely targets.

“They need at least some victory before they are forced into the final negotiations,” the news agency quoted Vadym Denysenko saying.

“Therefore our task is to stand for the next seven-10 days.”

NATO chief credits Canada's contributions, but says all allies must do more

Stoltenberg praised Canada’s role in the diplomatic efforts to impose a cost on Putin’s invasion, as well as the country’s contributions to NATO security – particularly in Latvia, where the Canadian Armed Forces has hundreds of personnel stationed as part of the alliance’s Operation Reassurance.

But when asked about NATO allies’ 2014 commitment to spend at least two per cent of GDP on defence – a target Canada has not yet reached – Stoltenberg said that he’s encouraging all NATO allies to do more in the face of an increasingly belligerent Russia.

“Canada is contributing in many ways and I also welcome the announcements of further support and Canadian contributions,” Stoltenberg said.

“But then, of course, I would like to see all allies to do even more. And therefore I call on all allies to step up and I welcome the message from Prime Minister Trudeau that in light of the Russian brutal invasion of Ukraine, Canada will also assess the need for further increases in defence spending.”

Stoltenberg said NATO members must adapt to a “new reality, a new security environment” in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine – addressing not only Russia’s invasion, but what he sees as a direct challenge from Moscow for sovereign nations to decide their membership in the NATO alliance.

He said Putin’s demand that NATO remove troops and infrastructure from European countries that joined the alliance after 1997 – which would be 14 out of the 30 member nations – would create a “second class” membership from the defensive alliance.

When asked what this “new normal” looks like, Stoltenberg pointed to increased political and military cooperation between Russia and China.

“So we have two authoritarian powers which are challenging the rules-based order, who are openly against our core values – freedom of speech, freedom of expression, democracy, the rule of law – and are also oppressing those values in Hong Kong and in Ukraine and in many other countries,” Stoltenberg said.

5,1b1bdeb6-0ff1-4c07-ad3a-47b789c5d483,[],,"In response to Russia’s actions, Allies have activated NATO’s defence plans, deployed elements of the NATO Response Force, and placed 40,000 troops in the eastern part of the Alliance, along with significant air and naval assets, under direct NATO command supported by Allies’ national deployments. NATO is also establishing four multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The eight battlegroups will extend all along NATO’s eastern flank, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.

NATO Allies are also increasing the resilience of their societies and infrastructure to counter Russia’s malign influence. This includes enhancing cyber capabilities and defences, and providing support to each other in the event of cyber attacks. Allies are ready to impose costs on those who harm them in cyberspace, and are increasing information exchange and situational awareness, enhancing civil preparedness, and strengthening their ability to respond to disinformation. NATO Allies will also enhance their preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

In addition to these immediate responses, NATO is also strengthening its deterrence and defence posture for the longer term, to face a more dangerous strategic reality. This will include significant developments in all domains – from major increases to forces on land, in the air and at sea, to stepping up cyber defences, to making the best use of space assets. These steps will be supported by enhanced exercises with an increased focus on collective defence and interoperability.

NATO is not seeking a war with Russia. NATO is a defensive Alliance. All measures are and will remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.

As a former Prime Minister of Norway and UN Special Envoy, Mr. Stoltenberg has been a strong supporter of greater global and transatlantic cooperation. Mr. Stoltenberg’s mandate as NATO Secretary General has been extended until the end of September 2023.

Under Mr. Stoltenberg’s leadership, NATO has responded to a more challenging security environment by implementing the biggest reinforcement of its collective defence since the Cold War, increasing the readiness of its forces and deploying combat troops in the eastern part of the Alliance. He believes in credible deterrence and defence while maintaining dialogue with Russia. He has also advocated for increased defence spending and better burden sharing within the Alliance, and a greater focus on innovation. NATO has also stepped up its efforts in the fight against terrorism. He strongly supports a partnership approach, with cooperation between NATO and the European Union reaching unprecedented levels.

Before coming to NATO, he was the UN Special Envoy on Climate Change from 2013 to 2014. He has also chaired UN High-level Panels on climate financing and the coherence between development, humanitarian assistance and environmental policies.

As Prime Minister of Norway, Mr. Stoltenberg increased the defence spending and transformed the Norwegian armed forces with new high-end capabilities and investments. He also signed an agreement with Russia on establishing maritime borders in the Barents and Polar Sea, ending a 30-years dispute.

Mr. Stoltenberg was also Prime Minister during the deadly terrorist attacks, which killed 77 people in Oslo and Utøya on 22 July 2011, urging in response, ""more democracy, more openness, and more humanity, but never naïvete"".

Mr Stoltenberg holds a postgraduate degree in Economics from the University of Oslo. After graduating in 1987, he held a research post at the National Statistical Institute of Norway, before embarking on a career in Norwegian politics.

Military Cooperation

In September 2015, we launched Operation UNIFIER, the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) military training and capacity-building mission in Ukraine.

In addition to contributions through Operation UNIFIER, the CAF cooperates with the Security Forces of Ukraine through the Military Training and Cooperation Program (MTCP). Ukraine is the single largest recipient of training and funding under the MTCP. More than 2,500 military personnel have received training through the MTCP since 1993.

Since January 2019, Canada and the United Kingdom share the role of NATO Contact Point Embassy (CPE) in Kyiv. CPEs support NATO’s partnership and public diplomacy activities in partner countries. Canada also supports the NATO-Ukraine Joint Working Group on Defence Reform through the delivery of language training, staff officer training and peacekeeping training for Ukrainian military and civilian personnel.

Peace and Stabilization Operations Program

Since 2014, Canada has committed more than $100 million in programming in support of peace and stabilization in Ukraine through the Peace and Stabilization Operations Program (PSOPs).

Current PSOPs programming is mainly focused on security sector and defence reform initiatives; police reform efforts; peacebuilding and the peaceful resolution of the conflict; and supporting the women, peace and security agenda. Through PSOPs, Canada also provides support to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE’s) Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine to strengthen ongoing reporting of the security situation, including ceasefire violations, and to facilitate dialogue between parties to the conflict. Canada also supported Ukraine’s COVID-19 response effort by providing personal protective equipment to the National Police, as well as ventilators to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence for its hospitals.

Since 2016, PSOPs has supported police reform in Ukraine, with the establishment of the Department of the Patrol Police within the National Police of Ukraine as a fully professional and democratic policing institution. PSOP’s programming has also provided direct support to the establishment of Ukraine’s first national-level police training academy, as well as to the establishment in 2018 of the Ukrainian Association of Women in Law Enforcement.

International Police Peacekeeping and Peace Operations Program

Since March 2015, Canada has deployed Canadian civilian police officers to Ukraine through the International Police Peacekeeping and Peace Operations Program, which is jointly managed by GAC (through PSOPs), the RCMP and Public Safety Canada. The program supports Ukrainian police reform through police deployments to 2 missions:

A bilateral Canada-Ukraine mission (the Canadian Police Mission in Ukraine)

The European Union Advisory Mission for Civilian Security Sector Reform

Throughout 2021, Canada had an average of 16 police officers deployed to Ukraine. This increased to 24 deployed officers in early 2022. Police officers are deployed to enhance police training, investigation and gender-based violence response, implement community policing models and improve internal accountability and oversight mechanisms. Canadian officers have delivered training to the Territorial Community Policing Officer Program and coordinated the development of a new course on community policing for Vasyl’ Stus Donetsk University, among other initiatives.

Women, Peace and Security

The women, peace and security (WPS) agenda and Canada’s National Action Plan on WPS are central to Canada’s Feminist Foreign Policy. The Action Plan aims to increase women’s participation in peace and security efforts and advance gender equality through Canada’s programming, policy and advocacy efforts. In Ukraine, Canada supports the implementation of the WPS agenda through, for example, support to Ukraine’s National Action Plan on WPS and initiatives to increase the role of women in the security and defence sectors.",https://www.international.gc.ca/country-pays/ukraine/relations.aspx?lang=eng

Final decisions on the alliance’s new direction should be made closer to the NATO summit in late June, he said after delivering a speech to the CDA Institute’s Ottawa Conference.

The reexamination will take place as its members shore up the alliance’s forces in eastern Europe in response to the crisis in Ukraine.

The secretary-general told the defense conference that NATO has increased its presence along its eastern edge — where for the first time the alliance has “combat-ready battle groups.” Allies, he added, have also tripled the size of the NATO Response Force and increased its readiness.

Stoltenberg later offered more insight into the issues confronting NATO.

“It’s obvious that we are faced with a new reality, a new security environment, a new normal,” Stoltenberg said in response to another question about NATO’s readiness for what may lie ahead. “Russia, more openly, is contesting core values for our security, including the right of every nation to choose their own path, or NATO’s right to protect and defend our allies.”

He argued that the concerns stretch beyond Ukraine, noting Russia’s threat of military consequences should Sweden or Finland apply for NATO membership.

China has also become part of the equation, he added.

“Russia and China are now operating more closely together, exercising more closely together, interacting militarily and politically more closely together,” said Stoltenberg, who underlined Beijing’s reluctance to condemn Russia’s attacks on Ukraine while, for the first time, criticizing NATO’s expansion.

Russia’s naked war of aggression against nearby Ukraine and its constant threats and bullying of its neighbors explain why all eyes in the trans-Atlantic alliance are now fixed not only on Ukraine, but also on NATO’s vulnerable Baltic members, where Blinken was met with a warning on his arrival in Estonia.

“Frankly, deterrence is no longer enough and we need forward defense here in place because otherwise it will be too late, Mr. Secretary,” Estonian President Gitanas Nauseda told Blinken bluntly. “Putin will not stop in Ukraine if he will not be stopped.”

In fact Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is just the latest and boldest move by President Vladimir Putin to forcibly impose a privileged sphere of influence on his democratic neighbors. As far back as 2007 he launched one of the largest state-sponsored cyberattacks ever against Estonia, paralyzing the country’s internet for the crime of daring to move a statue of a Soviet soldier from the center of the capital.

In 2008 Russian forces invaded Georgia and occupied two “breakaway” republics because that country expressed an intent to join NATO. When Ukraine tilted West in 2014, Russia forcibly annexed Crimea and launched the separatist conflict in Donbas. More recently Moscow has helped quell democratic uprisings and prop up dictators in Belarus in 2020, and Kazakhstan earlier this year.

As Russian military forces continue trying to bomb Ukraine into submission, it is certainly not lost on US military leaders that Putin’s recently stated demands that NATO halt its expansion and remove military forces and infrastructure from its eastern flank countries suggest where his ire and ambition may be focused next. In the harsh light of the new cold war that is descending over Europe, it’s also increasingly clear that NATO leaders for years wrote checks and IOU’s with the alliance’s expansion eastward that its steadily dwindling defense capabilities couldn’t cover. And Vladimir Putin noticed.

“If Putin was willing to launch a full-scale invasion of another country on the doorstep of NATO, we have to be candid with ourselves that he perceived some signal from the United States and NATO that made him think he could get away with it, and we need to understand those signals that are eroding the alliance’s deterrence,” Martin Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Breaking Defense.

Those signals likely include a steady reduction of US forces in Europe and declining military readiness and capability among European allies; a 20-year US preoccupation with counterterrorism and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan; a publicly announced US “pivot” to Asia to cope with the challenge of a rising China; an overreliance on the threat of economic sanctions as an adequate deterrence; years of former President Donald Trump browbeating NATO over inadequate burden sharing and threats to abandon the alliance; and the Biden administration’s chaotic military retreat from Afghanistan last year.

“Intuitively I think it’s unlikely that Putin would have ordered the invasion of Ukraine if he hadn’t perceived that the NATO alliance was more vulnerable than in the past, and that that vulnerability was growing over time. So lesson number one to me is that we need a reinforced US military presence in Europe, and the right kind of political statements about the value of the alliance to strengthen its deterrent value,” said Dempsey. Putin has also made clear that he considers himself a historic figure in the mold of Peter the Great, noted Dempsey, and he’s intent on reestablishing Russia’s sphere of influence, including in the Baltics.

“In Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014 and today in Ukraine, he has showed us the lengths he is willing to go to achieve a new Russian empire,” Dempsey said. “So as Maya Angelou once said, ‘When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.’ Putin has repeatedly showed us who he is, and shame on us if we fail to believe him.”

A Vulnerable Alliance

At the height of the Cold War the United Sates maintained roughly 400,000 troops in Europe, spread out primarily in Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy. By 2021 that number had plummeted to below 60,000. The Pentagon withdrew the two corps headquarters it once based in Europe, and in 2013 the US Army brought home its last armored units with M-1 Abrams battle tanks Bradley Fighting Vehicles from the continent. Even as it expanded eastward, the alliance also kept an agreement made in 1997 not to permanently station forces in member states bordering Russia.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and capture of Crimea in 2014 served as an initial wake-up call for the alliance. In response NATO formed four multinational battlegroups of roughly a battalion size (800-1,000 troops) led by the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and the United States, and deployed them forward on a rotational basis to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. At NATO’s Wales Summit in 2014, the allies also agreed to devote 2 percent of gross domestic product to defense by 2024, a target that only three allied countries met at the time.

Yet in the years hence it became increasingly obvious that the threat from Russia was growing at a much faster pace than the alliance was evolving militarily, despite the addition of Montenegro in 2017 and North Macedonia in 2019. Moscow has been engaged in a decade-long military modernization of both conventional and strategic nuclear forces, for instance, and Russian forces gained valuable combat experience in Ukraine and Syria.

Meanwhile, European pillars of the NATO alliance like Germany and Great Britain saw a steady decline in military capability during that time. A 2018 report on the German Bundeswehr by the Parliamentary Armed Forces Commissioner detailed that decline, including transport planes and fighter aircraft that couldn’t fly, submarines that couldn’t sail, and tanks that couldn’t maneuver because of poor maintenance and repair and a lack of spare parts. A severe manpower shortage had also created a gaping 21,000 vacancies in the German officer corps.

The situation for the once globe-spanning British military was not much better. Due to defense budget cuts, London announced in 2021 that it was reducing the size of the British Army to 72,500 troops and just seven combat brigades, the smallest the British army has been in centuries. The number of British tanks under the plan will fall from 227 to 148, the Royal Air Force will lose 24 Typhoon jets, and the Royal Navy will drop from just 19 frigates and destroyers to 17. When the new HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier launched on its maiden voyage last year, it required a squadron of US Marine Corps F-35 fighters to fill out its air wing.

In 2021, 10 of NATO’s 30 member states reached or exceeded the 2% of GDP target for defense spending, with the average for European members and Canada at 1.7% of GDP, and the United States spending 3.5% of GDP on defense to meet its global commitments [PDF].

Beyond increasing defense budgets, US military experts believe what’s most needed is a change of mindset in the alliance that recaptures some of the muscle memory from the Cold War, when military forces were maintained in a heightened state of readiness and prepared to fight on strict timelines based on the Soviet Red Army’s order of battle.

“We need to recalculate the entire readiness posture of our military forces, because collectively NATO forces are not ready,” said Ben Hodges, former commander of US Army Europe and currently the Pershing Chair in Strategic Studies at the Center for European Policy Analysis. “Germany has three divisions, but they are not ready to fight. The British Army today is way too small. NATO exercises are far too scripted in advance, and they put too much emphasis on ‘Distinguished Visitor Day’ rather than adopting the necessary rigor where you train to failure, and then learn from the experience. The European Union also still has a ton of work to do in terms of prioritizing the movement of military forces on rail lines and roadways so you can efficiently move them across Europe. All of that is hard and expensive, but if you don’t practice those skills and demonstrate those capabilities our adversary is not going to be very impressed.”

Joseph Ralston, who served as Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces from 2000-2003, remembers participating in annual “Reforger” exercises during the Cold War as a fighter squadron commander based in the United States.

“Every squadron commander and every maintenance shop focused on that deployment to Germany all year long, and we would have to plan on where to sleep, eat and requisition spare parts when we landed in Europe. We also developed good relationships and trust with the local host nation forces,” Ralston said in an interview. “We now need to reclaim that kind of readiness and warfighting mindset in NATO, because we’re in this confrontation with Russia for the long haul.”

A Watershed Moment

Certainly the spectacle of a Russian tyrant invading and attempting to subjugate a major European democracy for the first time since World War II has shocked the world, and transformed the counsels of the trans-Atlantic alliance. Since the crisis began NATO for the first time has activated its Rapid Response Force and is preparing to deploy it to the alliance’s eastern front. The 1st armored brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division in Georgia has for the first time deployed to Germany and collected prepositioned tanks and armored fighting vehicles stored there for an expected move to the east. A brigade combat team from the 82nd Airborne Division has deployed to Poland. In all, the United States has deployed 14,500 troops to Europe during the crisis, with thousands more on heightened alert.

In other historic firsts, the European Union and traditionally pacifist Germany are both funding and sending lethal weaponry to Ukraine, along with many other NATO allies. Berlin has halted the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline with Russia and pledged an immediate down payment of roughly $113 billion of defense spending, while promising to exceed NATO’s 2% of GDP target next year. Poland has announced the planned purchase of roughly a division’s worth (250) of Abrams M-1 tanks. Switzerland has broken with its tradition of neutrality to join punishing European Union sanctions on Russia. Reliably neutral Finland and Sweden are now openly debating seeking membership in the NATO military alliance.

Yet against the roughly 190,000 Russian troops assembled for the dismemberment of Ukraine, the allied troops arrayed on NATO’s eastern flank are still insufficient deterrence. The threat is real that Putin will respond to the faltering of his Ukraine offensive and crippling Western sanctions by lashing out in frustration. In an act of desperation, he could move on a weak NATO member state to show alliance weakness and then threaten to employ tactical nuclear weapons against any response, a move actually anticipated in Russia’s “escalate to deescalate” nuclear doctrine. Putin “is unlikely to be deterred,” Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. “And instead may escalate – essentially doubling down.”

“I still worry that we are not building up military forces quick enough on NATO’s new eastern front, because we need significantly more military capability deployed in key strategic areas along a front that runs from the Baltics to the Black Sea,” said Ivo Daalder, former US ambassador to NATO and currently president of the Chicago Counsel on Global Affairs, speaking recently at an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations. “Because this is a very serious long-term confrontation that we’re going to have with Russia, and we need to start thinking in terms of a return to a containment strategy, and all that entails.”

Curtis Scaparrotti was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces from 2016-2019. He believes such a containment strategy would necessarily entail the return of significant US command-and-control and armor capabilities to Europe.

“Putin has surprised us at every turn with his territorial aggressions, and while I don’t think it’s likely that he would move on a NATO nation, the potential is there if he decides to escalate once again. The best way to stop that is to strengthen NATO’s defensive deterrence on its eastern flank,” Scaparrotti said in an interview. That would require NATO scuttling its 1997 agreement with Russia not to permanently station military forces on its eastern flank — an agreement that is hard to honor in light of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

“In the past we relied on good warning time to mobilize US-based forces, but with the massing of Russian forces in Belarus and Ukraine it’s now clear we would have less time,” said Scaparrotti.

At the heart of that defense in the east, both Scaparrotti and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dempsey would like to see a US armored division and a US corps headquarters for command-and-control once again based in Europe, backed by multi-domain capabilities and forces to provide air and missile defenses, artillery and rocket forces, logistics, engineering, and other enablers, with the armored division stationed on the alliance’s eastern flank.

“Our European allies will also have to step up and take more responsibility for their own defense, but I believe they have awoken to the threat,” said Scaparrotti. “The irony is that Vladimir Putin’s stated goal was to halt NATO enlargement and move NATO forces out of Eastern Europe, and his reckless actions have achieved exactly the opposite effect. He has prompted NATO to strengthen its force posture in Eastern Europe, and convinced countries like Sweden and Finland to reconsider their neutrality and possibly join NATO. Even Switzerland has made the remarkable decision to abandon its traditional neutrality.

It was symbolic of the Biden Administration’s deliberately calibrated policy—going up to the border, but not beyond—to avoid any move that the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, could perceive as provocative. “For everything we’re doing for Ukraine, the President also has a responsibility to not get us into a direct conflict, a direct war, with Russia, a nuclear power, and risk a war that expands even beyond Ukraine to Europe,” Blinken told “Meet the Press” the next day, from Moldova. Yet, just two weeks into the war, the U.S. increasingly fears being drawn into a war with Russia. The undercurrent to frantic diplomacy and waves of U.S. military deployments—thousands more troops dispatched to Europe, Patriot-missile batteries to Poland, and B-52 bombers flying over Central Europe—is the palpable fear that the unthinkable is now thinkable.

On Tuesday, a new U.S. intelligence assessment concluded that Russia will pursue its interests in “competitive and sometimes confrontational and provocative ways, including pressing to dominate Ukraine and other countries in its ‘near-abroad.’ ” In testimony on the Hill, William Burns, the C.I.A. director and a former Ambassador to Russia, was pressed about Vladimir Putin’s intent. “He’s not going to stop at Ukraine, correct?” asked Representative Jackie Speier, of California. Burns replied, “That’s what makes it more important than ever to demonstrate that he’s not going to succeed in Ukraine.” The stakes, Burns acknowledged, are bigger. “This is one of those pivotal points where we and all of our allies and partners need to act.”

Since Russia’s invasion, the besieged Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has repeatedly warned the West about the danger that Putin would target other European nations. “Everyone thinks that we are far away from America or Canada. No, we are in this zone of freedom,” Zelensky said in a television interview, on Monday. “And, when the limits of rights and freedoms are being violated and stepped on, then you have to protect us. Because we will come first. You will come second. Because, the more this beast will eat, he wants more, more, and more.”

The U.S., however, pushed back this week on key military requests from Ukraine, for fear of Russia’s reaction. Putin’s reckless offensive has forced the U.S. to adopt awkward policy positions. On March 5th, Zelensky made an impassioned appeal to members of the House and Senate for more military aid, notably help in obtaining Soviet-era warplanes that Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly and that could balance Russia’s air superiority. On Wednesday, the Pentagon rejected an offer from Poland to turn over twenty-eight MIG-29 fighter jets to U.S. custody—flying them to a base in Germany—for transfer to Ukraine. U.S. intelligence officials assessed that an American role in a transfer “may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,” the Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, told reporters. U.S. involvement was deemed to be “high risk.” The majority of Ukraine’s warplanes are still intact, a senior Defense Department official added, while acknowledging that Russia’s surface-to-air missiles now have an “umbrella” that covers virtually all of Ukraine.

The Administration cited the same fears about Zelensky’s request for help from NATO in establishing a no-fly zone over part of Ukraine to protect civilians. “We also have to see to it that this war does not expand,” Blinken said on Wednesday, at a joint press conference with his British counterpart. “Our goal is to end the war, not to expand it, including potentially expand it to NATO territory.” Otherwise, he warned, “it’s going to turn even deadlier, involve more people, and I think potentially even make things harder to resolve in Ukraine itself.”

On Thursday, Avril Haines, the director of National Intelligence, acknowledged that the U.S. is now in a uniquely challenging position. “We are obviously providing enormous amounts of support to the Ukrainians, as we should and need to do,” she told the Senate Intelligence Committee. “But at the same time trying not to escalate the conflict into a full-on NATO or U.S. war with Russia. And that’s a challenging space to manage.”

Yet, at each of his four stops in NATO countries near Russia, Blinken heard dire predictions about the broader Russian threat beyond Ukraine—and the need for the U.S. to do more. In Riga, on Monday, the Latvian Foreign Minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs, lamented to Blinken, “We have no illusions about Putin’s Russia anymore.” In Vilnius, the Lithuanian President, Gitanas Nauseda, turned to Blinken and said, “Deterrence is no longer enough. We need more defense here, because otherwise it will be too late here, Mr. Secretary. Putin will not stop in Ukraine; he will not stop.” And in Tallinn, on Tuesday, the Estonian Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, said that NATO countries “need to adapt to the new reality” of a “very aggressive Russia” and permanently strengthen their defenses in the air, on land, and at sea. Pressed on what specifically countries on Russia’s borders needed, she replied, “Everything.”

Eastern European countries—notably those once allied with, or part of, the former Soviet Union’s empire—have long warned of the potential for Russian aggression. “We, the Poles, are already tired of reminding everyone: ‘We told ya so,’ ” Marek Magierowski, Poland’s Ambassador to the U.S., told me in an interview this week. He cited the forewarning by the late Polish President Lech Kaczynski during the Russian invasion of Georgia, in 2008. “Today Georgia, tomorrow Ukraine, the day after tomorrow—the Baltic states and later, perhaps, time will come for my country, Poland,” Kaczynski had said.

Magierowski added, “We have never had any doubts whatsoever about Vladimir Putin’s neo-imperial ambitions.” Putin has been waiting for this “window of opportunity” for years, he said. “He convinced himself that the West is weak, divided, wallowing in a decadent mood. He thought the free world wouldn’t care about Ukraine’s fate, as it didn’t care about Czechoslovakia’s in 1938,” when Europe tolerated Nazi Germany’s annexation of the Sudetenland. Putin, he told me, is similarly “emboldened” because the West was “tragically lenient” and “outrageously complacent” after Russia murdered the defector Alexander Litvinenko, in 2006; invaded and annexed Crimea, in 2014; helped destroy the Syrian city of Aleppo, in 2016; reportedly used chemical weapons to poison the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, in 2018; and poisoned the opposition leader Alexey Navalny, in 2020. Over the past three decades, Eastern Europeans have often encountered skepticism of their view of Putin as the U.S. and Western Europeans, notably the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, advocated dealing pragmatically with Russia.

During his European trip, Blinken repeatedly promised that NATO, this time, would prevent further Russian expansion. “We will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power,” he vowed, in Estonia. But U.S. experts worry, too, about an unintended incident triggering a wider war, like the spark that ignited the First World War, a conflict that dragged on for four years and killed tens of millions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “could easily escalate into a larger conflict stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea and further west into Europe,” Thomas E. Graham, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, warned in a new report issued on Tuesday. It might not matter what the U.S. does, he wrote. Crippling sanctions “could provoke Putin to lash out with greater violence,” Graham cautioned. But, if NATO appeared restrained, Moscow could be “tempted to press militarily even further into Europe” to enlarge its sphere of influence. The rippling impact of broader Russian aggression would stress “the geopolitical, economic, and institutional foundations” of the international order created after the Second World War, Graham wrote.

Given the Russian leader’s history, Angela Stent, a former National Intelligence officer and the author of “Putin’s World: Russia Against the West and with the Rest,” is worried about a miscalculation. “The concern we have to have immediately is that the war in Ukraine doesn’t inadvertently spread to Poland or Romania by some unforeseen clash, which would then have to involve NATO in a war with Russia,” she told me. Stent also worries about Putin’s intentions short of war. “You can use nonmilitary means to disrupt societies. And he’s already been doing that for the past couple of decades.” As the Russian leader grows increasingly cornered, she added, he will seek to exploit popular sentiment in countries like Serbia, where a pro-Russia march to support the war was held last week. The new U.S. intelligence assessment warns that Russia will employ “an array of tools” to undermine the interests of the U.S. and its NATO allies. “We expect Moscow to insert itself into crises” whenever it sees an opportunity, it concludes.

On Wednesday, the Biden Administration issued a forceful denial after Russia’s bizarre claim that the U.S. and Ukraine were developing chemical and biological weapons. The State Department spokesperson, Ned Price, said that Moscow has a long track record of accusing the U.S. of the very crimes that Russia is perpetrating. These tactics are “an obvious ploy” by Russia to try to justify “further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attacks,” he said.

Russia, as the aggressor, still has the upper hand. But, for the U.S. and its allies, the one positive sign is that the performance of the Ukrainian military has exceeded expectations. Russian forces have fallen far short of Putin’s goal of a swift seizure of Kyiv and the ouster of Zelensky’s government. The first two weeks have, instead, been grinding for Moscow. U.S. intelligence estimates that between two thousand and four thousand troops fighting for Russia—not all of them Russian—have died in the first two weeks. The bravery of Ukrainians, so far, has prevented the worst-case scenario.",https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-growing-fear-of-a-wider-war-between-russia-and-the-west
