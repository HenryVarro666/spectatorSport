Less than 20% of Russian forces that are stationed around Kyiv are being repositioned, according to the Pentagon. But they are unlikely to head home and are instead expected to be resupplied and redeployed, Reuters is reporting. Some of them may have already moved into Belarus, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, and Russian contractor Wagner Group has also deployed about 1,000 contractors into Ukraine’s Donbas region.





30 Mar 2022 15.57 Russian forces are starting to withdraw from the Chernobyl nuclear site, reports AFP citing the US Pentagon. A senior US official said that Russian troops are “walking away” from the facility and going into Belarus.

30 Mar 2022 15.47 The US is looking at options to expand sanctions imposed on Russia and will provide further updates in the coming days, reports Reuters. Speaking at the daily White House briefing, [White House spokesperson Kate Bedingfield] said President Joe Biden is continuing to look at options to expand sanctions and will have more information in coming days. Biden has imposed a wide variety of economic penalties aimed at punishing Russia.



30 Mar 2022 15.25 Russian hackers attempted to penetrate the network of Nato and militaries in some eastern European countries, reports Reuters. Russian hackers have recently attempted to penetrate the networks of NATO and the militaries of some eastern European countries, Google’s Threat Analysis Group said in a report published on Wednesday.

The report did not say which militaries had been targeted in what Google described as “credential phishing campaigns” launched by a Russian-based group called Coldriver, or Callisto. “These campaigns were sent using newly created Gmail accounts to non-Google accounts, so the success rate of these campaigns is unknown,” the report said. NATO was not immediately available for comment on the report. Russia, which is now under heavy Western economic sanctions following its decision to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24, regularly denies accusations of mounting cyber attacks on Western targets. In 2019, Finnish cybersecurity firm F-Secure Labs described Callisto as an unidentified and advanced threat actor “interested in intelligence gathering related to foreign and security policy” in Europe. The group also targeted a NATO Centre of Excellence, Wednesday’s Google report said, without elaborating. In a statement, the centre did not directly address Google’s report but said: “We see malicious cyber activity on a daily basis.”

30 Mar 2022 15.15 Putin misled over Russian military performance – US and EU David Smith Putin is being misled about the Russian military’s performance in Ukraine, said several US and EU officials today. Kate Bedingfield, director of communications at the White House, told reporters on Wednesday: “We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership.”



“We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions because his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth.”



She added: “So, it is increasingly clear that Putin’s war has been a strategic blunder that has left Russia weaker over the long term and increasingly isolated on the world stage.” A senior EU diplomat seconded Bedingfield’s point, saying that the US assessment was in line with Europe’s thinking, reported Reuters. “Putin thought things were going better than they were. That’s the problem with surrounding yourself with ‘yes men’ or only sitting with them at the end of a very long table,” the diplomat said. Russian troops were being told that they were taking part in a military exercise prior to the Ukraine invasion, but had to sign a document that extended their duties, said two European diplomats to Reuters. “They were misled, badly trained and then arrived to find old Ukrainian women who looked like their grandmothers yelling at them to go home,” added one of the diplomats. There are no signs at the moment that the situation could foster a revolt within the Russian military, but the situation is “unpredictable” and Western powers “would hope that unhappy people would speak up,” said the senior European diplomat to Reuters.

30 Mar 2022 15.04 The majority of Americans support sending more troops to Nato allies in Europe amid the Ukraine invasion, reports Reuters. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed yesterday, 55% of bipartisan Americans agree with sending additional forces to Nato allies in the region. Additional polls have found that about 61% of Democrats support additional troop deployment compared to 41% of Republicans. Yesterday, the US Pentagon announced that more troops and military equipment will be sent to Nato allies in Europe, with 200 additional personnel heading to eastern Europe, including Lithuania. No troops will be sent into Ukraine, consistent with earlier remarks Biden made about no US forces being into the country. There are currently more than 100,000 troops in Europe versus 80,000 prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

But so far it’s just words. Nothing concrete,” he said in a video message published on Thursday night. Russia is not withdrawing voluntarily from the areas around Kyiv and Chernihiv, but is being ousted there by the Ukrainian army. At the same time, Kyiv is noticing a deployment of Russian troops for new attacks in the Donbass, Zelensky said. “And we’re preparing for that.”

The Ukrainian leadership does not trust nice words. The situation on the battlefield shows how it really is. “And that’s the most important thing at the moment. We won’t give up anything. And we will fight for every meter of our land, for every one of our people.”

After the negotiations in Istanbul, Russian negotiators declared on Tuesday that the government in Moscow would “radically” scale back its attacks on Kyiv and Chernihiv in the north. However, the shelling continued throughout the night.

Negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are to continue online on Friday, according to Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamiya. For a personal talk between the two presidents, as the Ukrainian side again suggested in the most recent negotiations, Russia makes a coordinated draft contract a condition, according to Arakhamiya.

The negotiator also praised Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who was involved in recent talks. This plays a positive role, said Arachamija according to Ukrainian media reports. Abramovich offers an “unofficial channel of communication” that helps to discuss in normal and not in diplomatic language. The oligarch strives for neutrality, said Arachamija. “Although we don’t perceive him as a neutral party. But we can say that he is certainly more neutral than the official side of the negotiations.”







Zelenskyj asks for tanks and planes

In such a situation, the Ukrainian army does not need anyone to give it unsolicited advice from a chair, Zelensky said. “If anyone pretends to teach our armed forces how to fight, it is best that they go straight to the battlefield.”

Ukraine is fighting for freedom and protection of democracy and has the right to ask for help from partners – such as tanks, aircraft and artillery systems – at this difficult time, he stressed. “Freedom must not be worse armed than tyranny.” Zelenskyy said that the Ukrainian nation was fighting for its survival. “In this, without exaggeration, patriotic war against Russia.”







The US government earlier said Russia had withdrawn a small portion of its troops from the Kyiv area within 24 hours – “probably about 20 percent of the troops,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. Some of these soldiers have been transferred to Belarus. According to the US government, President Putin does not get an honest description of the situation in the Ukraine war. Putin’s senior advisers are “too afraid to tell him the truth,” said White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield.







According to Ukrainian sources, a rocket filled with fuel in the city of Dnipro destroyed an oil depot. Debris also damaged two tankers, said the head of the regional council, Mykola Lukaschuk. There weren’t any victims. According to Ukrainian sources, a rocket hit a factory in Novomoskovsk, northeast of Dnipro. There were no deaths here either.

Pavlo Kyrylenko from the Donetsk Region Coordination Center accused Russia of using phosphorus shells. According to the Air Force in Kyiv, Russia fires missiles at targets in Ukraine even from the Caspian Sea. The information provided by the warring parties cannot be independently verified. For the city of Mariupol, which has been fought over for weeks, Russia offered a ceasefire for Thursday to give civilians the opportunity to flee.

Ceasefire for Mariupol?

For the city of Mariupol, which has been fought over for weeks, Russia offered a ceasefire for Thursday to give civilians the opportunity to flee. “Russia’s armed forces declare a cease-fire on March 31 from 10:00 a.m. (9:00 a.m. CEST) for humanitarian purposes only,” Major General Mikhail Mizintsev said, according to the Interfax agency. At the same time, he demanded that Ukraine, for its part, should declare a ceasefire by 5:00 a.m. German time.

The deadline passed on Thursday morning, initially without a public statement from the Ukrainian leadership. Baerbock appealed to Moscow to allow escape and help. “The attacks must be stopped immediately. Humanitarian international law must be observed,” said the Greens politician in Berlin.

Confusion about the gas

Will Russia continue to accept German and European gas payments in euros? Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to talk about this this Thursday with representatives of the energy giant Gazprom and the Russian central bank. Economics Minister Robert Habeck (Greens) had put the first of three crisis levels of the so-called gas emergency plan into force out of concern about possible restrictions. The background to this is Russia’s announcement that it will only deliver gas against payment in rubles. Germany and other Western countries insist on continuing to pay in euros and dollars.

After a phone call between Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Putin, German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said on Wednesday evening that Western payments could continue to go to Gazprom Bank in euros after April 1, as usual. The bank then converts the money into rubles. Scholz did not agree to this, but asked for written information.",https://pledgetimes.com/the-most-important-thing-from-the-night-russian-missiles-destroy-the-oil-depot-in-dnipro/

“The bottom line is if we want lower gas prices we need to have more oil supply right now,” Biden said. “This is a moment of consequence and peril for the world, and pain at the pump for American families.”

He also invoked the Defense Production Act to encourage the mining of critical minerals for batteries in electric vehicles as part of a broader push to shift toward cleaner energy sources.

The US president warned the oil industry not “to sit on record profits” during the current price surge, adding that he wanted “to lay a new foundation for true and lasting American energy independence.”

A Russian victory in Ukraine will put other countries in peril: Polish official

Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski has told Al Jazeera that allowing Russia to make gains in Ukraine will encourage Moscow to adopt an aggressive stance towards Eastern European countries.

“Putin is not attacking other countries today because he doesn’t have adequate resources. He certainly would be willing to attack if he knew he would succeed,” Jablonski said in an interview at the Doha Forum.

The official added that in recent days members of the Russian parliament discussed the “de-Nazification” of six more countries, including Poland.

“If we allow Russia to win this war, they will regroup, they will resupply and they will be attacking more countries and starting more wars,” Jablonski said.

Russia’s Gazprombank is the intermediary for rouble gas payments, Putin order says

President Vladimir Putin’s decree says that foreign buyers of Russian gas will have to use special accounts at the country’s Gazprombank to pay for the import of the energy source, the Reuters news agency reports.

A foreign buyer is now obliged to transfer foreign currency to one special, so-called “K”, account, Reuters reported, citing the order. Gazprombank would then buy roubles on behalf of the gas buyer to transfer roubles to another special “K” account.

Gazprombank would then transfer the rouble funds of the foreign gas buyer to Gazprom’s rouble accounts. The bank can open such accounts without the presence of a foreign buyer’s representative, according to Reuters.

Kremlin decree indicates foreign currency can still be used to buy gas

A Kremlin decree, published by state media, says “unfriendly countries” can continue to pay for natural gas in foreign currency through a Russian bank that will convert the money into roubles.

It sets out that a designated bank will open two accounts for each buyer, one in foreign currency and one in roubles.

The buyers will be able to pay in foreign currency and authorise the bank to sell that currency for roubles, which are placed in the second account, where the gas is formally bought.

Germany, France reject Russia’s roubles for gas demand

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said Western countries will continue paying for Russian gas in euros or dollars despite the Kremlin’s threat to cut off supplies not paid for in roubles.

“We looked at the contracts for the gas deliveries,” Scholz told reporters in Berlin.

“They say that payments are made in euros, sometimes in dollars … and I made clear in my conversation with the Russian president that that will remain the case,” he added, citing his talks by phone with Putin on Wednesday.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said separately said Paris also rejected Russia’s demand.

Putin says Russian gas must be paid for in roubles from Friday

Putin says he has signed a decree saying foreign buyers must pay in roubles for Russian gas from Friday, and contracts would be halted if these payments were not made.

“In order to purchase Russian natural gas, they must open rouble accounts in Russian banks. It is from these accounts that payments will be made for gas delivered starting from tomorrow,” the Russian leader said in televised remarks.

“If such payments are not made, we will consider this a default on the part of buyers, with all the ensuing consequences. Nobody sells us anything for free, and we are not going to do charity either – that is, existing contracts will be stopped.”

Russian forces ‘regrouping’ before new Donbas offensive, Ukraine says

Russia is “regrouping” its forces in Ukraine to intensify its offensive in the country’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukraine’s General Staff of Armed Forces has said.

The eastern territories are already partly controlled by Russian-backed separatists who seized swaths of territory in the Donbas in early 2014.

“The main efforts of the enemy are focused on maintaining the occupied borders, preparing for the resumption of offensive operations in certain areas and establishing full control over the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions,” the department said on Facebook.

OPEC sticks to modest boost in oil despite war jitters

OPEC and allied oil producers, including Russia, have decided to stick to a modest increase in the amount of crude they pump to the world despite Western pressure to step up production as a result of the war in Ukraine.

The group, known as OPEC+, said it would add 432,000 barrels per day in May, as it works to gradually restore production cuts made during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic. That’s slightly up from 400,000 barrels in previous months.

The alliance has been unmoved by pleas from oil-consuming countries to pump more oil as energy prices soar, fueling inflation worldwide. High prices have helped Russia – the world’s largest exporter – offset some of the impacts of Western sanctions.

“At the same time, Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering,” he added.

UK unveils new sanctions on ‘shameless’ Putin ‘propagandists’

The United Kingdom has announced a new wave of sanctions against “Russian propagandists and state media”.

The measures are aimed at 14 individuals and entities – including TV presenter Sergey Brilev and Kremlin-funded TV-Novosti, which owns the Russia Today news channel – and follow several previous rounds of sanctions over Moscow’s incursion into Ukraine.

“Britain has helped lead the world in exposing Kremlin disinformation, and this latest batch of sanctions hits the shameless propagandists who push out Putin’s fake news and narratives,” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement.

“We will keep on going with more sanctions to ramp up the pressure on Russia and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine. Nothing and no one is off the table.”

Putin likely ‘not fully informed’ on Ukraine, former UK ambassador says

Tony Brenton, the United Kingdom’s former ambassador to Russia, says it is “likely” that Putin has not been “fully informed” on the state of Russia’s offensive by his aides.

“Putin has been in withdrawal from the details of day-to-day government in Russia for the last two years, while he’s been worrying about COVID,” Brenton told Al Jazeera.

“So I think the likelihood is that he’s not been fully informed on the Russian military situation,” he added.

“And the subordinates around him – he has a rather limited number of people who have access to him – are almost certainly quite cautious about giving him the full details about how bad Russians are doing militarily, although he obviously knows enough that he has substantially altered Russia’s war aims.”

‘Hundreds’ of South Ossetians fighting in Ukraine: ex-separatist leader

The former leader of South Ossetia, a breakaway province in ex-Soviet Georgia, said “hundreds of fighters” have joined Russian forces in Ukraine, complaining they were treated as “cannon fodder”.

“I don’t doubt that the boys who already returned home could go back to the special operation zone and help complete the liberation of Donbas IF THEY FIND IT NECESSARY,” Eduard Kokoity wrote on Telegram on Wednesday.

South Ossetia broke away from Georgia in the 1990s. Its leaders said Georgia’s post-Soviet nationalist government violated the rights of Ossetians to use their language that is distantly related to Farsi.

Russia fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 and recognised the “independence” of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It now has large military bases there.

Ukraine says convoy of buses on its way to Mariupol

A convoy of Ukrainian buses has set out for the besieged, southeastern port city of Mariupol to try to deliver humanitarian supplies and bring out trapped civilians, the country’s deputy prime minister has said.

Iryna Vereshchuk said 45 buses were on their way to Mariupol after the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed Russia had agreed to open a safe corridor. Seventeen buses had already left for Mariupol from Zaporizhzhia, about 220km (136 miles) to the northwest, she added.

Another 28 were waiting for authorisation to pass the Russian checkpoint in Vasylivka, near Zaporizhzhia.

Mariupol’s mayor said this week that up to 170,000 residents were trapped there with no power and dwindling supplies. Previous attempts to organise safe corridors for civilians to evacuate from the city have failed.

UK intelligence chief says some Russian soldiers disobeying orders in Ukraine

The head of one of the UK’s intelligence agencies has said that some Russian soldiers in Ukraine have refused to carry out orders, adding Putin had “misjudged” the invasion.

Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) chief Jeremy Fleming said there was evidence that Moscow’s troops had low morale and were poorly equipped.

“We’ve seen Russian soldiers – short of weapons and morale – refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,” he said during a speech in the Australian capital Canberra.

“It’s clear he [Putin] misjudged the resistance of the Ukrainian people. He underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanize. He underplayed the economic consequences of the sanctions regime, and he overestimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory,” Fleming added.

Although Putin’s advisers were believed to be too afraid to tell the truth, the “extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime,” he said.

Shear', 'Rick Gladstone', 'Daniel Berehulak']",2022-03-31 00:00:00,"KRAKOW, Poland — Facing deeper isolation by the day over the Ukraine war, Russia seemed to slightly recalibrate its stance Thursday, allowing greater humanitarian access to the devastated port city of Mariupol and apparently retreating from a payment confrontation with European gas customers.

But Western officials said they saw little evidence to support Russia’s claims that it was greatly reducing its military presence around Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and fighting continued unabated in areas around the city on Thursday. In Dnipro, the central city that has become a hub for humanitarian aid to other parts of Ukraine, a Russian attack overnight destroyed an oil terminal, a local official said.

“Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities, so we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering,” the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said at a news conference.

Whatever Moscow’s real intentions on the battlefield, Russian officials scoffed Thursday at American claims a day earlier that subordinates of President Vladimir V. Putin, fearing his wrath, were misleading him about how the war was going.

“They do not understand President Putin,” said the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov. “They do not understand the decision-making mechanism and they do not understand the efforts of our work.”

In Mariupol, where the population has, for weeks, been cut off from the outside world by heavy Russian bombardment and intense fighting, a respite appeared possible amid reports that a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross was preparing to try to enter the city. The group hoped to deliver emergency humanitarian aid and begin evacuating residents on Friday.

“There seems to be a glimmer of hope we might be able to go, so we need to be close,” said Crystal Wells, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Geneva.

Thousands of civilians are believed to have died, and survivors have been trapped in basements without heat or electricity, and desperately short of food, water and other essentials.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said Thursday that a convoy of 45 buses had departed for Mariupol to reach trapped civilians, and that an agreement had been reached on a passageway for evacuating people from the city of Melitopol, farther west.

People from both cities were expected to make their way to Zaporizhzhia, a city farther north that remains under Ukrainian control, although evacuations in previous days have been sporadic and have often been scrapped at the last minute because of fighting.

The Russians also appeared to show some leeway on Mr. Putin’s demand that European customers of his country’s natural gas now pay in rubles, or risk a cutoff. European governments, which rely heavily on Russian gas imports, had rejected this new condition, arguing that it violated purchase contracts.

After speaking with the Russian leader, the prime minister of Italy, Mario Draghi, said he did not believe that Europe was “in danger” of having its gas supply halted. He said that he understood that the Russian president would grant a “concession” to European countries, and that the conversion of payments from dollars or euros into rubles was “an internal matter of the Russian Federation.”

Russia also said Thursday that its forces were leaving the defunct Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, according to a statement from Ukraine’s state-run energy company. Chernobyl, site of the worst nuclear accident in history, had been occupied by Russian forces since the war’s early days.

Asked about unconfirmed reports that some Russian soldiers had suffered radiation sickness, the Pentagon press secretary, John F. Kirby, said the troop movement appeared to be part of a broader repositioning and not from “health hazards or some sort of emergency or a crisis at Chernobyl.”

Both Ukrainian and Russian officials signaled a willingness to keep negotiating over how to end the war, now in its sixth week. A member of Ukraine’s negotiating team said that discussions would resume via video link on Friday, and the foreign minister of Turkey, which hosted talks this week, said that his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts could meet within weeks.

And on Thursday, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, offered cautious backing to a proposal circulating in European corridors of power that might help bring about a peace agreement. In principle, Mr. Erdogan said, Turkey could help guarantee Ukraine’s security.

During peace talks earlier this week in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials said their country was ready to concede a key demand from Moscow and declare itself permanently neutral, forsaking hopes of joining NATO. Ukrainian negotiators also said they were willing to discuss Russian territorial claims.

But the Ukrainians said they would make the concessions only in return for security guarantees from a group of other nations.

Ukrainian officials envision an arrangement in which a group of countries — potentially including NATO members like the United States, Britain, Turkey, France and Germany — would commit to defending Ukraine.

On Thursday, a Ukrainian negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, suggested to a Turkish broadcaster that the so-called guarantor countries would have legal obligations to provide weapons, military personnel or financial help if conflict involving Ukraine erupted again.

“This is the meaning of this pact: A country that considers an attack will know that Ukraine is not alone,” he said.

The big question was whether Moscow, which has repeatedly objected to what it calls NATO encroachment, finds this palatable.

Despite Russian claims that the war was proceeding according to plan, the Kremlin is said to be struggling with problems in its military, which has made far less headway in Ukraine than Western experts had once expected.

On Thursday, the director of Britain’s electronic surveillance agency, Jeremy Fleming, said the Russian forces, hampered by low morale and weapons shortages, had accidentally shot down their own aircraft and had refused to carry out orders.

But in Russia itself, Mr. Putin’s approval ratings have reached levels unseen in years, according to a Russian poll released on Thursday, as many Russians rally around the flag in the face of sanctions and other international pressure.

Although the credibility of the poll might be questionable — especially since Mr. Putin has severely limited free expression since the war — it was conducted by the Levada Center, one of the few independent pollster groups left in Russia.

“The confrontation with the West has consolidated people,” said Denis Volkov, the center’s director.

While they generally did not support Mr. Putin, some respondents said that now was the time to do so.

People believe that “everyone is against us” and that “Putin defends us; otherwise, we would be eaten alive,” Mr. Volkov said.

The war’s destructive ripple effects have spilled over into marketplaces around the world.

Both Ukraine and Russia are major providers of the world’s wheat, corn and barley, but Ukrainian agricultural officials said Thursday that more than 16 million tons of grain had been stranded in the country, and that Ukraine had missed out on at least $1.5 billion in exports. Earlier in the week, the U.S. State Department’s No. 2 official warned at a U.N. Security Council meeting that the war posed “immediate and dangerous implications for global food security.”

With fuel costs soaring over sanctions on Russian oil, the U.S. government announced a plan to release up to 180 million barrels from strategic reserves over the next six months to enlarge the supply and ease prices.

Still, the Biden administration made clear that it would expand the sanctions on Russia as part of the American-led effort to cripple the Russian economy as punishment for the Ukraine invasion.

In Washington, the Treasury Department on Thursday leveled new sanctions on Russian technology companies and what it called illicit procurement networks that Russia is using to evade existing sanctions.

“We will continue to target Putin’s war machine with sanctions from every angle until this senseless war of choice is over,” the Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, said in a statement.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

The shelling — and intensified Russian attacks on other parts of the country — tempered optimism about any progress in the talks aimed at ending the punishing war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he stressed to U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday that the war is at a ""turning point."" He thanked the United States for an additional $500 million in aid announced Wednesday, but he also said Ukraine needs more help to resist the Russian invasion.

""If we really are fighting for freedom and in defence of democracy together, then we have a right to demand help in this difficult turning point. Tanks, aircraft, artillery systems. Freedom should be armed no worse than tyranny,"" Zelensky said in his nightly video address to the nation, which he delivered standing in the dark outside the dimly lit presidential offices in Kyiv.

Talks between Ukraine and Russia were set to resume on Friday by video, according to the head of the Ukrainian delegation, David Arakhamia. But there seemed to be little faith that a resolution would emerge any time soon.

The Russian military reneged on its pledge made on Tuesday to de-escalate near Kyiv, the capital, and Chernihiv to ""increase mutual trust and create conditions for further negotiations.""

The announcement was met with deep suspicion from Zelensky and the West. And soon after, Ukrainian officials reported that Russian shelling hit homes, stores, libraries and other civilian sites in and around Chernihiv and on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Russian troops also stepped up their attacks around the eastern city of Izyum and in the eastern Donetsk region after redeploying some units from other areas, the Ukrainian side said.

Olexander Lomako, secretary of the Chernihiv city council, said the Russian announcement turned out to be ""a complete lie.""

""At night, they didn't decrease but vice versa increased the intensity of military action,"" Lomako said.

""Civilian infrastructure facilities, libraries, shopping centres, many houses were destroyed in Chernihiv,"" said Chernihiv governor Viacheslav Chaus, adding there were also strikes in Nizhyn, about 100 kilometres to the south.

Of Russia's statement that it would cut back its military activity, he said: ""Do we believe that? Of course not.""

Zelensky said negotiations with Russia were continuing, but for now they were only ""words without specifics.""

""We know that this is not a withdrawal but the consequences of being driven out,"" he said of Russia's pledge. ""But we also are seeing that Russia is now concentrating its forces for new strikes on Donbas, and we are preparing for this.""

Zelensky also said he had recalled Ukraine's ambassadors to Georgia and Morocco, suggesting they had not done enough to persuade those countries to support Ukraine and punish Russia for the invasion.

""With all due respect, if there won't be weapons, won't be sanctions, won't be restrictions for Russian business, then please look for other work,"" he said.

Zelensky has rarely gone a day without addressing the lawmakers of another country and speaking to a number of world leaders.

Russia targeting residential, government buildings

Oleksandr Pavliuk, head of the capital region military administration, said on Wednesday that there were 30 Russian shellings of the residential areas and civilian infrastructure in the Bucha, Brovary and Vyshhorod regions around Kyiv over the previous 24 hours.

Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj.-Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the military also targeted fuel depots in two towns in central Ukraine with air-launched long-range cruise missiles. Russian forces also hit a Ukrainian special forces headquarters in the southern Mykolaiv region, he said, and two ammunition depots in the Donetsk region, which is part of the Donbas.

In southern Ukraine, a Russian missile destroyed a fuel depot in Dnipro, the country's fourth-largest city, regional officials said.

The U.S. said that over the last 24 hours, Russia had begun to reposition less than 20 per cent of its troops that had been arrayed around Kyiv.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that troops from there and some other zones have begun moving largely to the north, and some have gone into Belarus. Kirby said it appears Russia intends to resupply them and send them back into Ukraine, but it is not clear where.

Children among the wounded

In Kyiv, staff at a children's hospital are dealing with an influx of seriously wounded children, on top of young patients being treated for other illnesses and disease.

Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital press secretary Anastasia Magerramova told CBC News that she and the doctors have moved into the hospital, working under the threat of bombings every day.

""Rockets fly over the children's hospital. People die every day. And we see it every day,"" she told Heather Hiscox. ""We see wounded children, wounded people, our doctors see terrible things every day. Bullets in children's bodies, shrapnels in children's legs, heads and ribs.""

Magerramova said she is documenting what is happening because she wants people around the world to know what is happening in 21st-century Ukraine.

Economic repercussions

Five weeks into the invasion, with death tolls estimated to be in the thousands on both sides, the number of Ukrainians fleeing the country topped a staggering four million, or about a 10th of the population, according to the United Nations. Half of those who have fled are children, the UN said.

""I do not know if we can still believe the Russians,"" said Nikolay Nazarov, a refugee from the northeastern city of Khakriv, which has seen heavy shelling since the start of the Feb. 24 invasion, as he pushed his father's wheelchair at a border crossing into Poland.

""I think more escalation will occur in Eastern Ukraine. That is why we cannot go back to Kharkiv.""

Meanwhile, the economic repercussions from the war and the West's sanctions against Moscow widened.

Russia typically provides Europe with about 40 per cent of its gas, but the possibility of supply disruption since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has increased over the past week, with G7 nations rejecting a demand for payment in rubles.

Germany and Austria activated early warning plans on Wednesday amid concerns that Moscow could cut natural gas deliveries, while Poland announced steps to end all Russian oil imports by year's end.

The German government said it was establishing a crisis team to step up monitoring of the gas supply, and it called on companies and households to conserve energy.

But hours later, German officials said Chancellor Olaf Scholz had received assurances from Russian President Vladimir Putin that European companies won't have to pay for Russian gas supplies in rubles but could continue to pay in euros, as stipulated by existing contracts.

At a round of talks held Tuesday in Istanbul, the faint outlines of a possible peace agreement seemed to emerge when the Ukrainian delegation offered a framework under which the country would declare itself neutral. It would drop its bid to join NATO, as Moscow has long demanded, in return for security guarantees from a group of other nations.

Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Russian delegation, said Ukraine's readiness to consider neutral status would meet a key Russian demand.

Ukraine's delegation on Tuesday offered neutrality in exchange for security guarantees by a group of third countries, including the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Turkey, China and Poland, in an arrangement similar to NATO's ""an attack on one is an attack on all"" principle.

Ukraine said it would also be willing to hold talks over a 15-year period on the future of the Crimean Peninsula, seized by Russia in 2014.

Medinsky said in televised comments that the proposals signalled Ukraine's readiness to reach agreement ""for the first time in years."" If Ukraine makes good on its offer, he said, ""the threat of creating a NATO bridgehead on the Ukrainian territory will be removed.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov sounded a positive note as well but included a caveat: ""We can't say there has been something promising or any breakthroughs.""

Medinsky, head of the Russian delegation, said negotiators would take Ukraine's proposals to Putin, and then Moscow would provide a response, but he did not say when.

The talks had been expected to resume on Wednesday, but with what Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called ""meaningful"" progress made, the two sides decided to return home for consultations.

Top Russian military officials have said in recent days that their main goal now is the ""liberation"" of Donbas, the predominantly Russian-speaking industrial heartland where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014. Western officials say Moscow is reinforcing its troops in the Donbas.

Some analysts have suggested that the focus on the Donbas and the pledge to de-escalate may merely be an effort to put a positive spin on reality: Moscow's ground forces have been thwarted — and have taken heavy losses — in their bid to seize the capital and other cities.

U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about the poor performance of his military in Ukraine because they are too afraid to tell him the truth.

Meanwhile, a missile destroyed part of an apartment block in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk early Wednesday, and two people were reported killed. Separatists blamed Ukrainian forces for the attack.

""I was just sitting on the couch and — bang! — the window glass popped, the frames came off. I didn't even understand what happened,"" resident Anna Gorda said.

Refugee count surpasses 4 million

Meanwhile, the UN refugee agency on Wednesday said more than four million people have now fled Ukraine following Russia's invasion, a new milestone in the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees posted on a website that tracks refugee flows around the world that 4.01 million people have now fled Ukraine. Of those, 2.3 million have entered Poland.

Aid workers say the flow has eased in recent days as many people await developments in the war. An estimated 6.5 million people have also been displaced from their homes within Ukraine.

The UN food aid agency said it is providing emergency assistance to one million people in Ukraine. It said the food includes 330,000 loaves of bread for families in Kharkiv.
