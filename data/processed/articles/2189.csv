This comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine and sent missile strikes to some of the country’s largest cities.

As videos of the deafening sounds flood social media, people in the US are wondering whether their streets have sirens too.

What is an air raid siren?

An air raid siren, also known as a civil defense siren, warning siren or bomb siren, is a loud noise used to warn people of danger.

The electronic sirens appear on streets and were first installed during World War II to warn people of air raids and make them aware that they need to take cover.

Since then, they have been used to make people aware of nuclear attacks and extreme weather like tornadoes.

America’s air raid sirens in 2022

In 2022, there are bomb sirens in America but they vary across states.

Many World War II air raid sirens were used again during the Cold War when there was nuclear threat from Russia and still exist today.

For example, The Mercury News reported in 2017 that San Jose still has “at least 38 air raid sirens” around the city which would sound in an attack.

However, while some cities like Chicago and Dallas have upkept their siren infrastructure, others have not.

The number of bomb sirens in your area will heavily vary. However, the country did put more money into restoring sirens after 9/11.

Ultimately, individual states have made their own choices about whether to upkeep the sirens.

In many areas, The Emergency Alert System (EAS) is used instead. This is a national warning system in the US that sends warning messages via radio and TV.

Various sounds mean different things

In 1980, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) outlined a set of guidelines for the country’s warning signals and sirens called the Outdoor Warning Systems Guide.

The guidelines, which are still in place in 2022, outline what each different sound means.

Attack warning: 3 to 5 minute wavering tone

An attack warning signal means that an attack or missile launch has been detected and people should take protective action immediately.

Attention of alert warning: 3 to 5 minute steady signal

This sound will usually be used for weather emergencies like tornadoes, flash floods and tsunamis and means you should turn on your TV and listen for essential information.

No sound

When the sound turns off this means that the danger has passed and you can resume usual duties.

A crazy move. An invasion of a European nation after years of posturing.

But here we are.

It started before dawn, but I didn't hear the first distant explosion, I was fast asleep. The rest of my team most certainly did though.

We made our way outside as Ukrainians started waking to massive explosions around the capital Kyiv - it was the same across the country.

Russia-Ukraine crisis: 'Full-scale invasion' - what do we know so far?

As we walked up the hill towards a beautiful church and viewpoint that was to be our live location for the next few hours, we saw people coming out of their homes, gazing in disbelief at what was happening.

It's fair to say explicit warnings that this invasion would happen had probably been taken with a pinch of salt by the local population.

Over the past few weeks many had told us that nothing would happen, that it was all a bluff by Russia - a bluff that Russia had played many times since this conflict first began in 2014 with a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine.

Analysis: Inside the mind of Vladimir Putin - why is he invading and what does he want?

Despite the explosions and flashes in the sky, we could see commuters making their way into the capital as normal, across bridges and on motorways.

It was surreal. But it wasn't normal, and within hours that traffic had stopped.

People were suddenly aware of the magnitude of what was happening as air raid sirens blared out across the city.

Officials here said they were just testing the sirens, but nobody believed them.

Above the clouds a fighter jet soared over our heads - we couldn't see, so Russian or Ukrainian we don't know which. But the engines were deafeningly loud and unnerving.

How will the UK help in Ukraine's fight against Vladimir Putin?

Streets usually busy with people became suddenly thinned out and quiet, not deserted but fundamentally different to just 24 hours earlier when breakfast cafes, bars and restaurants were open and teeming with people.

You would not have known the war was about to start.

Within hours of the explosions that rocked the city at dawn, it started to become clear a mass exodus was underway.

One man and family told us they tried to get onto a train heading west but that he was giving up and going home. ""Without a car you're stuck,"" he told me.

The main roads heading out of Kyiv towards the west were jammed with traffic.

Miles and miles of queues.

Image: Cars drive towards the exit of the city after Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised military action

People were getting out of their cars, trying to work out just how long the queue was. Others got out of buses for a break before carrying on.

We met two women who said they and everyone on the buses were heading to the west of the country and maybe then on to Poland hoping to find safety.

Nobody knows what the next few hours, let alone days, will bring here.

In a trendy district of Kyiv young men carrying flags, one with a huge flag attached to his bicycle, took the streets in an effort to support the nation and bolster morale.

5,24a2c23d-0d79-4474-b19b-0b029f1ae299,['Jack Holmes'],2022-02-24 01:16:00,"Shortly after sunrise, the air raid sirens were blaring in Kyiv. The shelling had long since begun. Russia invaded Ukraine early Thursday in a full-scale assault on the sovereign nation next door. Soon after, there were reports that Russian military vehicles were streaming into Ukraine from Belarus, which had apparently joined in a Russian assault on Ukrainian border agents. Smoke billowed above the skylines of cities across Ukraine: Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, Mariupol, Odessa, Kyiv. As CNN reporter Matthew Chance stood on a roof in the capital in a flak jacket and helmet he'd donned on-air, a gorgeous structure clambered up above his right shoulder, all blue domes and spindly golden spires. A cathedral, a work of art, a testament to humanity's capacity to build great and beautiful things on a canvas landscape. In the moment, it was also part of the backdrop for a showcase of our capacity for destruction.

The United States played its part in all this, escalating tensions by pushing NATO's reach into Russia's sphere of influence. Latvia and Lithuania chose to join the alliance of their own accord, however, and there is no excusing what has happened since. The Russian dictator, Vladimir Putin, has invaded neighboring countries by habit. This invasion of Ukraine is almost a misnomer—the Russians invaded long ago. The salon debates over what share of the blame the Americans ought to take will be of little comfort to the Ukrainian people, who seem to be pawns in the game—not just for Putin, but for the bizarre coalition of talking heads who run interference for him in the West. It did not seem to be a complicated situation for the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.N., who turned directly to address his Russian counterpart during a meeting of the Security Council on Wednesday. ""There is no purgatory for war criminals,"" Sergiy Kyslytsya said. ""They go straight to hell, ambassador.""

The sirens were a reminder that there are parents cowering in their kitchens, arms around their children, explaining to them, calmly as they can, that there will be no school today. As my colleague, Charles P. Pierce, put it Wednesday, it ought to matter that the Ukrainians don't want to be part of Russia. This is self-determination, a core principle of the liberal democratic ethos. Putin did not just invade the regions of eastern Ukraine that he has attempted to lop off—for now, at least—as ""independent states"" that he is the only one to diplomatically recognize. He is everywhere. That rhetoric was never worth much next to Putin's wild ranting about Ukraine's natural place as a part of a renewed and re-glorified Russian imperial state, and his talk of de-Nazifying a country led by a Jewish comedian. Poor Volodymyr Zelensky has had one hell of a few years. Putin was reportedly joined in the assault by Belarus and its bloated stooge of a leader, Alexander Lukashenko, who survived mass protests after an irregular election in 2020 with the help of his friend Vlad, himself no stranger to convenient election irregularities.

Ukraine, one fears, is now a sandbox for those who fancy themselves great men of history, the titans who grind up mere mortals along their march into the textbooks. Maybe some of the same could be said of Americans who have wreaked their own havoc in Iraq and El Salvador and many places besides. The moral relativism won't do much for the Ukrainians, though, who may now be playing host to a massive historical event that, yet again, none of us are much interested in living through. As the blitzkrieg ground into motion, the vibrations could be felt even here, in the inner confines of the American empire, where few of us have ever held our children as the air sirens wailed.

Clive Myrie and Lyse Doucet - wearing a black overcoat and red puffa jacket respectively - were detailing the latest developments from the Ukrainian capital, when the unmistakable droning could be heard in the background reverberating around the city.

Moments later, after the broadcast cut to the BBC studio in London's Broadcasting House, the pair reappeared on screen wearing blue flak jackets, worn as protection against bullets and shrapnel.

Myrie said: 'We heard the air raid sirens, we have put on our flak jackets. One wonders what the people of this city and indeed right across this country are now thinking.

'They prayed for peace and with all the diplomacy over the last few weeks and months, they hoped that would be the case. Now we are in a major conflict.'

Doucet, the BBC's chief international correspondent, replied: 'The siren has spoken.

'The siren spoke live in our broadcast and that siren, not only did it strike fear in the hearts of all the Ukrainians being told to stay at home today and some still bravely went to work.

'A siren telling them: 'Be careful, something even more dangerous could come'. But that siren was also heard across the UK and around the world.'

It was the second time a siren was heard live on the BBC today, after fellow reporter Nick Beake also had his broadcast interrupted by whirring alarms warning of more Russian missiles tearing towards Kiev.

Further evidence of the dramas of live reporting in Ukraine was provided overnight, when a CNN journalist was filmed in the early hours ducking for cover and strapping on protective gear of his own.

As weapons rained from the sky and tanks rolled across the border, 'hundreds' of Ukrainian troops were killed in early clashes, officials said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky, in an address to the nation on Thursday morning, said the history of Ukraine has now changed forever and that Russia has 'embarked on a path of evil' - comparing the Russian attack to Hitler's forces in World War Two.

But he vowed to fight back, saying the military has already inflicted 'serious losses' on Russia.

He called on all Ukrainian citizens willing to defend their homeland to step forward, saying guns will be issued to everyone who wants one. He also asked for civilians to give blood to help wounded troops.

But thousands of terrified locals in the capital were pictured scrambling to flee Kiev and move west as a series of attacks were launched by Russian troops.

In his report, Mr Beake said: The sirens have just started here in the capital, Kiev. Like so many people we were woken up by the sounds of explosions and people across the country are reporting the same thing.

'Russia claims it is targeting military installations but certainly many people in this country are extremely fearful because the invasion, the attack that Russia promised would never happen, has now started.

'The Ukrainian government is urging people to stay calm and is appealing to the international community to stop President Putin now.'

In the US, the main television channels broke away from their regularly scheduled broadcasts to deliver breaking news of Russian forces crossing the border into Ukraine.

On the east coast, ABC viewers were watching the sitcom The Connors when suddenly viewers were treated to World News Tonight's David Muir to deliver an ABC News Special Report.

'We're hearing a series of explosions in Ukraine now,' said Muir as he showed video shot in Kiev during which several loud blasts could be heard at 5:33am, local time.

Muir explained how US intelligence officials knew that the operations would begin under cover of darkness and before sunrise before Ukrainian people were able to realize what was going on in their own country.

Muis also explained that explosions had also been heard in the eastern city of Kharkiv.

Over on CBS, Season 33 of reality game show The Amazing Race was well underway when the network was forced to break away to deliver news of the invasion.

'I don't know if that's what's occurring now but it's a remarkable coincidence that the explosions come just minutes after Putin gave his speech,' Chance explained.

'This is the first time we've heard anything. It has been absolutely silent. This is the first time. It has to be more than just a coincidence.

'I think it's safe where I am. I have a flak jacket,' Chance remarked before ducking down to put on his protective gear.

The blasts came within minutes of Putin saying Russia would conduct a military operation in eastern Ukraine.

CNN: A WAR REPORTING VETERAN War reporting has been at the heart of CNN's coverage over the last 30 years. The first Gulf War, codenamed Operation Desert Storm which ran for six weeks during January and February 1991 was significant for many reasons including CNN's live reporting from a Baghdad hotel. At the time, new technologies, such as satellite technology, allowed for a new type of war coverage. For the first time, people all over the world were able to watch live pictures of missiles hitting their targets and fighters taking off from aircraft carriers. The use of night vision equipment also gave the reporting a futuristic spin which was said to resemble video game imagery and encourage the 'war drama'. The war was covered live since its beginnings by the three main American networks, as well as CNN which was only ten years old. CNN gained the most popularity for their coverage, and indeed its wartime coverage is often cited as one of the landmark events in the development of the network. CNN's Wolf Blitzer was safe at the Pentagon when the network's reporting of Operation Desert Storm began on January 16th 1991 CNN was the only 24‑hour coverage news network at the time. When war broke out the network was able to follow the events in Baghdad on a 24‑hour basis. Even when other American journalists were told their safety might be at risk, CNN reporters stayed behind after their producers had built up good relationships with government officials in Baghdad. During the first days of the bombing the CNN team was also able to report live via radio from their hotel suite in the Rashid Hotel, something no other network was able to do. Advertisement

About 300 miles away to the east, in Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, a steady stream of explosions were also heard where another CNN reporter, Clarissa Ward, CNNs Chief International Correspondent was located.

In a televised address early on Thursday morning, Putin said the action came in response to threats coming from Ukraine.

He added that Russia does not have a goal to occupy Ukraine, but said the responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian 'regime'.

Putin also warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to 'consequences they have never seen'.

He accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia's demand to prevent Ukraine from joining Nato and offer Moscow security guarantees.

He said the Russian military operation aims to ensure a 'demilitarization' of Ukraine, adding that all Ukrainian servicemen who lay down arms will be able to safely leave the zone of combat.

The announcement came just after airspace over all of Ukraine was shut down to civilian air traffic, and at the same time as an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council was taking place.

On Wednesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made an emotional televised address in Russian following the approval of a 30-day state-of-emergency order handed the government sweeping powers in the interest of national security.

'The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace. But if we come under attack that threatens our freedom and lives of our people we will fight back,' he said, as he rejected Moscow's claim Ukraine is a threat to Russia.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10546689/Chilling-moment-air-raid-sirens-ring-Kiev.html

“Everyone! Immediately! Now!” the soldier screamed as he dashed in his heavy boots across a road scattered with the exploded remains of grenades and shells.

Behind him stood the charred skeleton of a Ukrainian military truck that was hit while ferrying ordnance to a flashpoint district of northern Kyiv.

Before him were elderly women with handbags and middle-aged men chatting about the war while blowing out cigarette smoke.

And above them — somewhere in the ominous distance — was the swooshing sound of either mortars or Grad missiles being fired in a barrage on Ukraine’s capital.

The passers-by all ran around the corner of a building and down a dark flight of stairs leading into a concrete basement.

Already waiting for them was a sheltering group of exhausted people who had come desperately close to getting out of Kyiv on the third day of Russia’s invasion of their country.

“We were trying to evacuate, but half-way down the road, they started shelling,” IT engineer Helga Tarasova said.

She had taken a bus to Kyiv train station with her young son and several friends. Their next stops were supposed to be the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and then — possibly — Poland.

“We only had 800 meters [half a mile] to go until the station,” the 36-year-old recalled, while bouncing her son on her knee. “But the national guard would not let us through. We were running with our bags and I think the bags scared them.”

The Ukrainian capital is under siege. It entered a weekend curfew on Saturday evening that is being enforced with shoot-on-sight orders.

Residents have started taping over exposed window panes and covering up street names, building numbers and other identifiable city markings to try to confuse the invading Russian force.

Long lines that run dozens of cars deep snake around the few functioning petrol stations. Grocery stores are either closed or packed with people staring at grimly bare shelves that are often out of bread and simple meats and cheese.

One soldier was digging a trench on the side of a highway that the Russian tanks are expected to use to push toward Kyiv’s Maidan Square and the government district.

“We were hoping that our generation would be the one that lives without war,” pensioner Tetyana Filonemko lamented, in the basement. “All the people can do in a war is hold on, be as one, support each other. That’s all we can do.”

Filonemko’s basement is split into three rooms connected by a narrow corridor and lit by incandescent bulbs hanging off black wires.

One man slept on a yoga mat arranged atop a few wooden planks. A bucket stood beside him on a wooden stool. Other men paced and some women whispered. The children seemed the least concerned in their play corner.

“All I can think about is the children,” said Nadezhda Tkachuk.

The 58-year-old had just walked up the stairs and popped her head out of the door for a quick breath of fresh air — and to try to hear how close the fighting had come. “Let them open a corridor, so that they don’t shoot at people, so that we can send the little kids out,” she said.

But Yulia Snitka has even more immediate concerns.

The 32-year-old’s belly bulged through her clothes on the eighth month of pregnancy and she is worried about being worried.

“I’m trying to stay as calm as possible to not cause a premature birth,” she said. “At night, for more than an hour, there were huge explosions. I hope this all ends in a few days.”",https://www.timesofisrael.com/immediately-now-terrified-citizens-rush-for-kyiv-basements-amid-air-raid-sirens/

Ukraine’s capital was rocked by explosions and the sound of air-raid sirens early Friday, on the second day of a Russian advance that left residents and leaders bracing for the city to be overrun.

Ukraine said that hundreds of Russian troops were killed and injured as they bore down on Kyiv — with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy calling on Western governments to take stronger action against Russia and anyone with military experience in Europe to help defend the country's independence.

Russia is meeting ""greater resistance"" from the Ukrainians than they might have expected, a senior U.S. defense official told NBC News on Friday. ""They are fighting for their country,"" the official said, referring to Ukrainian troops and freedom fighters.

Zelenskyy said that at least 137 people had been killed and 316 injured after Russia launched its invasion Thursday, attacking key cities and taking control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
