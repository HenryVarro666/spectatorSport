https://twitter.com/BA_Friedman/status/1498097876970450946 Obviously, we can only make tentative conclusions so far, but the Russian military is committing some very basic mistakes from the strategic to tactical levels. Putin also put his military into a very bad situation with unrealistic goals and without giving them much warning.

It is clear many soldiers don't know what the goal of this war is, so they don't know how to respond to civilians or what sort of security posture they should take. They have been assigned tasks but don't understand the purpose, which is how you set up a military for failure. 2/",https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1497462090524774403.html
4,841af21f-c12a-4c78-a7ff-bfc4fa505d78,[],,"KYIV, Ukraine — A US official confirmed Ukraine President Volodymyr rejected an offer from the American government to evacuate Kyiv.

A senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation quoted the president as saying that “the fight is here” and that he needed anti-tank ammunition, “not a ride.”

Zelensky’s whereabouts were being kept secret after told European leaders in a call Thursday that he was Russia’s No. 1 target — and that they might not see him again alive. His office later released a video of him standing with senior aides outside the presidential office and saying that he and other government officials would stay in the capital.

Kyiv officials were warning residents early Saturday that street fighting was underway against Russian forces, and urged people to seek shelter.

The warning issued Saturday advised residents to remain in shelters, to avoid going near windows or on balconies, and to take precautions against being hit by debris or bullets

Hundreds of casualties were reported in the fighting, which included shelling that sliced through a Kyiv apartment building and pummeled bridges and schools. There also were growing signs that Russia may be seeking to overthrow Ukraine’s government, which US officials have described as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ultimate objective.

The assault represented Putin’s boldest effort yet to redraw the world map and revive Moscow’s Cold War-era influence. It triggered new international efforts to end the invasion, including direct sanctions on Putin.

As his country confronted explosions and gunfire, and as the fate of Kyiv hung in the balance, Zelensky appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a bleak statement that multiple cities were under attack.

“This night we have to stand firm,” he said. “The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”

Zelensky was urged to evacuate Kyiv at the behest of the US government but turned down the offer, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation.

For their part, US defense officials believe the Russian offensive has encountered considerable resistance and is proceeding slower than Moscow had envisioned, though that could change quickly.

The Kremlin accepted Kyiv’s offer to hold talks, but it appeared to be an effort to squeeze concessions out of the embattled Zelensky instead of a gesture toward a diplomatic solution.

The Russian military continued its advance, laying claim Friday to the southern Ukraine city of Melitopol. Still, it was unclear in the fog of war how much of Ukraine is still under Ukrainian control and how much or little Russian forces have seized.

As fighting persisted, Ukraine’s military reported shooting down an II-76 Russian transport plane carrying paratroopers near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Kyiv, an account confirmed by a senior American intelligence official. It was unclear how many were on board. Transport planes can carry up to 125 paratroopers.

A second Russian military transport plane was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles (85 kilometers) south of Kyiv, according to two American officials with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine.

The Russian military has not commented on either plane.

The US and other global powers slapped ever-tougher sanctions on Russia as the invasion reverberated through the world’s economy and energy supplies, threatening to further hit ordinary households. UN officials said millions could flee Ukraine. Sports leagues moved to punish Russia and even the popular Eurovision song contest banned it from the May finals in Italy.

Through it all, Russia remained unbowed, vetoing a UN Security Council resolution demanding that it stop attacking Ukraine and withdraw troops immediately. The veto was expected, but the US and its supporters argued that the effort would highlight Moscow’s international isolation. The 11-1 vote, with China, India, and the United Arab Emirates abstaining, showed significant but not total opposition to Russia’s invasion of its smaller, militarily weaker neighbor.

NATO, meanwhile, decided to send parts of the alliance’s response force to help protect its member nations in the east for the first time. NATO did not say how many troops would be deployed, but added that it would involve land, sea, and air power.

Day Two of Russia’s invasion, the largest ground war in Europe since World War II, focused on the Ukrainian capital, where Associated Press reporters heard explosions starting before dawn. Gunfire was reported in several areas.

A large boom was heard in the evening near Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the square in central Kyiv that was the heart of protests which led to the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president. The cause was not immediately known.

Five explosions struck near a major power plant on Kyiv’s eastern outskirts, said Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. There was no information on what caused them, and no electrical outages were immediately reported.

It was unclear how many people overall had died. Ukrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on their side from the first full day of fighting and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures.

UN officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes. They estimate that up to 4 million could flee if the fighting escalates.

Zelensky tweeted that he and US President Joe Biden spoke by phone and discussed “strengthening sanctions, concrete defense assistance and an antiwar coalition.”

Late Friday, Biden signed a memo clearing the way for the US to expedite more than $500 million in emergency military assistance to the Ukrainian government, though it was not immediately clear how quickly the aid would flow.

Zelensky earlier offered to negotiate on a key Putin demand: that Ukraine declare itself neutral and abandon its ambition of joining NATO. The Kremlin said Kyiv initially agreed to have talks in Minsk, then said it would prefer Warsaw and later halted communications. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said later that Kyiv would discuss prospects for talks on Saturday.

The assault was anticipated for weeks by the US and Western allies and denied to be in the works just as long by Putin. He argued the West left him with no other choice by refusing to negotiate Russia’s security demands.

In a window into how the increasingly isolated Putin views Ukraine and its leadership, he urged Ukraine’s military to surrender, saying: “We would find it easier to agree with you than with that gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have holed up in Kyiv and have taken the entire Ukrainian people hostage.”

Playing on Russian nostalgia for World War II heroism, the Kremlin equates members of Ukrainian right-wing groups with neo-Nazis. Zelensky, who is Jewish, angrily dismisses those claims.

Putin has not disclosed his ultimate plans for Ukraine. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov gave a hint, saying, “We want to allow the Ukrainian people to determine its own fate.” Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia recognizes Zelensky as the president, but would not say how long the Russian military operation could last.

Ukrainians abruptly adjusted to life under fire, after Russian forces invaded the country from three sides as they massed an estimated 150,000 troops nearby.

Residents of a Kyiv apartment building woke to screaming, smoke and flying dust. What the mayor identified as Russian shelling tore off part of the building and ignited a fire.

“What are you doing? What is this?” resident Yurii Zhyhanov asked Russian forces. Like countless other Ukrainians, he grabbed what belongings he could, took his mother, and fled, car alarms wailing behind him.

Elsewhere in Kyiv, the body of a dead soldier lay near an underpass. Fragments of a downed aircraft smoked amid the brick homes of a residential area. Black plastic was draped over body parts found beside them. People climbed out of bomb shelters, basements and subways to face another day of upheaval.

“We’re all scared and worried. We don’t know what to do then, what’s going to happen in a few days,” said Lucy Vashaka, 20, a worker at a small Kyiv hotel.

At the Pentagon, press secretary John Kirby said the US believes the offensive, including its advance on Kyiv, has gone more slowly than Moscow had planned, noting that Ukraine forces have been fighting back. But he also said the military campaign is in an early stage and circumstances can change rapidly.

The Biden administration said Friday that it would move to freeze the assets of Putin and Lavrov, following the European Union and Britain in directly sanctioning top Russian leadership.

Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, called the sanctions against Putin and Lavrov “an example and a demonstration of a total helplessness” of the West.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/zelensky-rejects-us-evacuation-offer-from-ukraine-i-need-ammunition-not-a-ride/

Ukraine’s outgunned military desperately sought to fend off an advance by invading Russian forces on Kyiv’s northern outskirts. Overnight, the skies lighted up after two explosions were reported about 20 miles south of Kyiv near Vasylkiv — a city with several fuel tanks and an air base — as nervous residents wondered how close Russians might be getting.

Skirmishes were reported in other parts of the beleaguered city. Shops were closed, nervous reservists clutched battered AK-47s in the streets, and improvised checkpoints made of piled-up tires sprang up to slow anticipated Russian infiltration.

Huddled in their makeshift bomb shelters, Kyiv residents filled old wine bottles with flammable liquid to prepare Molotov cocktails.

Some signs suggested Ukrainian fighters were succeeding beyond the expectations of Russia, which U.S. officials said has sent in the majority of the estimated 190,000 troops it had amassed near Ukraine’s borders.

Russians “have been frustrated by what they have seen is a very determined resistance,” a senior U.S. Defense Department official said on Saturday.

The official added that, while Ukraine’s air- and missile-defense systems had been targeted, they remained viable, and that there was no indication Russia had taken control of any Ukrainian cities in what is Europe’s biggest ground war since World War II.

President Volodymyr Zelensky, who defiantly remained in Kyiv despite a reported American offer to be evacuated, called on Ukrainians within the country’s borders and beyond to defend Ukraine against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion on Ukraine’s eastern border Thursday after months of building up troops on its edges while denying there were plans to attack.

“We aren’t going to lay down weapons. We will protect the country,” Zelensky said in one of several video appearances. “It’s our land, our country, our children. And we will defend all of that.”

In a tweet Saturday, the Ukrainian Embassy in the U.K. said Zelensky had refused a U.S. offer to be evacuated. “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,” read the post, quoting Zelensky. The U.S. government did not confirm the exchange.

The U.S., which has dispatched several thousand troops to neighboring Poland, a fellow NATO member state, and announced multiple sanctions against Russia and Putin personally, on Saturday said it would join with Canada and major European powers to cut off certain Russian banks from SWIFT.

The international messaging system, which stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is used by 11,000 banks globally to complete transactions and will effectively isolate major parts of the Russian financial system.

Just days ago, President Biden said targeting Russian participation in SWIFT was “always an option” but not yet being pursued.

Also on Saturday, the U.S. authorized an additional $350 million in military assistance to Ukraine. Some of it is earmarked for anti-armor and other munitions and equipment.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the extra aid was “a sign of our unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

The move coincided with those by other nations to isolate Russia politically and economically as well as arm Ukraine’s military. Japan and Australia are among those that have imposed sanctions.

On Saturday, Germany — widely mocked for an earlier offer to donate 5,000 helmets to Ukraine defenses — said it would send 1,000 anti-tank weapons, 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles and 10,000 tons of fuel.

Germany, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said they would close their airspace to Russian airliners. In a tweet, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said, “there is no place for planes of the aggressor state in democratic skies.”

But the threat of a Russian takeover of Ukraine remained strong as Putin, who has long sought to expand Russia’s border and influence over former Soviet Union territories, has refused to relent.

The ongoing assault has led many Ukrainians to flee, with 120,000 refugees making it to Poland in the last days, according to the United Nations. Tens of thousands more have crossed into Hungary, Moldova and Romania.

“This may go up, it’s changing every minute,” said Shabia Mantoo, the spokeswoman of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. “It’s very fluid and changing by the hour.”

The agency estimated that up to 4 million people could eventually flee Ukraine to neighboring nations.

In Kyiv, a capital of nearly 3 million people in the country of 44 million people that’s nearly the size of Texas, sirens continued to blare overnight as residents awaited another day of war.

Saturday began as a beautiful, sunny day, the sort that would normally bring out crowds in force to enjoy the city’s many sights.

But gatherings in front of gas stations, pharmacies and supermarkets became more sparse as the day wore on, and nighttime brought a deeper-hued darkness.

The occasional car still zoomed past traffic lights; but now those lights flashed only yellow, an acknowledgment by the Kyiv municipality that no one had time to wait on red.

The ominous rise-and-fall of siren calls began around 8 p.m. in a city which only a few days ago simmered with pedestrians and cars until the late hours.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko imposed a strict citywide curfew that would extend until 8 a.m. Monday. Klitschko said he was taking the step to counter the efforts of Russian infiltrators suspected to already lurk in the city.

“We remind you that all civilians who will be on the street during the curfew will be considered as members of the enemy’s sabotage and reconnaissance groups,” the order stated.

Between Friday and Saturday, Ukrainian forces deliberately destroyed some of Kyiv’s many bridges as a defensive tactic aimed at slowing down the incoming forces. Those that remain standing were carefully guarded, like the Pechersky Bridge, where nervous but dour-faced soldiers popped trunks open and questioned motorists.

On Lobanovsky Avenue, the war’s impact was starkly evident where a shell had slammed into an apartment block on Saturday morning, obliterating a chunk of the building between the 16th and 21st floors and wounding six people, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian Rescuers agency said. Glass, hunks of concrete and personal belongings from the mangled units carpeted the boulevard below.

About 80 people were evacuated from the tower, which also houses a travel agency, a sushi restaurant and a gym. The exploded round turned a 16th-floor apartment into a smoke-filled maw of distressed masonry and rebar; on the 18th floor, a wall dangled and swung gently in the wind like a concrete curtain.

It was the latest in the tally of civilian targets hit by Russian forces, despite Moscow’s insistence that its troops have aimed their massive firepower only at military installations.

“I don’t sleep these days, so I was awake beside my wife — she’s nine months pregnant — and reading the news when I heard this huge bang and the building shook,” said Eugene Limar, a 31-year-old programmer who lived on the 22nd floor. He was rushing down the stairs with two suitcases in hand, barely pausing a moment to speak to a reporter.

“I just dumped everything in these bags and we’re leaving,” he said.

Moments after he spoke, a fusillade of shots rang out in the distance, causing passersby to scurry for cover. A black column of smoke rose a small distance away to the north.

Days into their large-scale assault by air, land and sea, Russian forces were apparently trying to encircle Kyiv in a campaign to depose Zelensky’s democratically elected government and install a pliant regime.

Besides the capital, other major Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv in the northeast, have come under attack from a military of vastly superior numbers and weaponry. On Sunday morning, street fighting was reported as Russian troops entered the city.

Russian forces have also mounted deadly air and missile strikes from the north, east and south.

Nearly 200 people have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded since the offensive began, Ukraine’s health minister said Saturday.

A senior American defense official told reporters Saturday that Russia has launched more than 250 missile attacks. Most have been short-range ballistic missiles.

Russia has not issued any casualty figures.

In major European cities and around the globe, protesters — including many Ukrainian immigrants — gathered at Russian diplomatic buildings and city squares to criticize Russia and call for an end to war.

News reports said up to 20,000 gathered in Bern, the Swiss capital, with yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flags, while hundreds rallied in Sydney, some holding “Ukraine will prevail” posters.

A couple of dozen people joined in front of the Russian Embassy in Mexico City early Saturday afternoon, holding signs that said “Resist Putin.”

Among them was Irina Kusdel, a 34-year-old Ukrainian who is married to a Mexican. Kusdel, who left Ukraine 10 years ago, is in regular contact with her parents who live about an hour from Kyiv.

“The people believe in their own efforts, in this resistance,” she said. “People are saying this is our land, why should we leave?”

“They don’t sleep because in the night they expect the worse,” she said of her family.

Many protests called on foreign governments to do more to help the Ukrainian people.

Meanwhile, it was clear to Ukrainians that the actual fight — and the blood to be shed defending their homeland — is theirs alone.

“America isn’t here. The European Union isn’t here,” said Alexander, a 24-year-old hotel employee in Kharkiv who declined to give his last name. “So we’re fighting on our own.”
