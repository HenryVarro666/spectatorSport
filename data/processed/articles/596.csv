Nickolas Roth, senior director for NTI’s Nuclear Materials Security program, explains what happened at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that terrifying night, what could have happened, and what the long-term implications are for nuclear security and nonproliferation efforts around the world.

This post was updated on March 8, 2022

What happened at Zaporizhzhia?

On March 3, Russian forces attacked the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Enerhoder, a small city in southern Ukraine. The plant was shelled by Russian troops throughout the night damaging the site and injuring two people. According to the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory body, it was initially unclear how safety systems were impacted and “additional assessments based on the results of the comprehensive inspections” were needed. Reportedly, as a result of the attack, “the reactor compartment building” of reactor Unit 1 was damaged, two artillery shells hit the facility for dry storage of nuclear fuel, and a fire that was eventually extinguished “severely damaged the training center building.” Fortunately, at the moment, the regulator has also said “changes in the radiation situation in Zaporizhzhia region have not been registered, [and] gamma radiation background is within the standard limits.” Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, with six reactors, and multiple dry cask storage and spent fuel sites.

What’s so dangerous about a nuclear plant being attacked?

This is the first time there has been a full-scale war in a country with a significant nuclear power infrastructure. There are 15 commercial nuclear reactors spread across four sites in Ukraine, making up more than 50% of the country’s energy supply. There have been attacks on nuclear facilities throughout the country. Nuclear power plants are equipped with safety systems and the reactor structures are extremely resilient, but if the cooling at a reactor or spent fuel pool is removed, the stakes are high. A meltdown at a reactor or a fire within a tightly-packed spent fuel pool could result in widespread radiological contamination, putting people’s health and the environment around the reactor at risk.

Another cause for concern is whether personnel can operate the reactors safely during this crisis. According to reports, the situation at occupied power plants is bad and getting worse. Plant managers need to get approval for any actions, including those related to reactor operations. Ukraine’s nuclear regulator has said it is now having problems communicating with staff at Zaporizhzhya as phone lines, emails, and fax machines are no longer operating. Similar problems occurred in the aftermath of the 2011 nuclear catastrophe in Fukushima when Japan demonstrated that responding to plant emergencies during a broader crisis is incredibly difficult. The tsunami and earthquake there destroyed buildings and safety and security systems; disrupted communications within the plant and to outsiders; injured personnel; and impeded outside responders from providing support. Like Fukushima, it likely also would be very difficult to respond to a plant emergency during a firefight or a war. If operators are “working at gunpoint,” as some reports suggest, they are operating under extreme duress, which could further impact safety and security at the site. This situation is not sustainable.

It’s worth noting that, while an accident at a nuclear power plant could spread radiation across hundreds of square miles, the impact would be different from the blast, fire, initial radiation, and long-term radioactive fallout caused by a nuclear weapon.

What has the response been?

The current crisis highlights the critical leadership and information-sharing role that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays around the world. The IAEA is serving as a key conduit for information about safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine through its periodic updates, and Director General Rafael Grossi is playing an important political leadership role. He has called for a “halt to the use of force” at Enerhodar and for military forces to refrain from violence near the plant. The Director General has also said he was prepared to travel to the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant to negotiate a commitment from all parties ensuring the safety and security of all Ukrainian nuclear power plants, stating, “It is high time to stop an armed conflict from putting nuclear facilities at severe risk, potentially endangering the safety of people and the environment in Ukraine and beyond. Words must mean something—it is time for action.”

What are the broader implications for nuclear security and nonproliferation?

The crisis is still unfolding in Ukraine, and the outcome for nuclear power plants in the region is extremely uncertain. One thing already clear is that Russia’s illegal, immoral, and profoundly dangerous attacks on Ukrainian nuclear sites raise new questions about global nuclear security efforts. This will likely have widespread implications on the institutions and agreements that support stronger nuclear security around the world, and it may make future nuclear security and nonproliferation efforts more difficult.

Later this month, officials from around the world are scheduled to gather for the first-ever review of the Amended Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the only treaty requiring countries to protect nuclear materials and nuclear facilities. This will be a pivotal moment for the future of nuclear security and the international legal and institutional architecture that supports it. During the review, states will discuss the treaty’s implementation, adequacy and the broader nuclear security environment referred to as the “prevailing situation.” Russia’s attacks on nuclear facilities are likely to have an enormous impact on this dialogue.

A side effect of this crisis has been it has reawakened public awareness around the importance of safety and security of nuclear facilities and President Putin’s threats are a reminder about the profound danger nuclear weapons pose to all.",https://www.nti.org/atomic-pulse/what-happened-at-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-and-what-are-the-implications/

1. Mariupol - Portivske - Manhush - Rozivka - Polohy - Orikhiv - Zaporizhzhia.

2. Volnovakha - Valeryanivka - Novoandriivka - Kyrylivka - Vuhledar - Pokrovsk.

In the Kharkiv region: Izyum - Mala Komyshuvakha - Barvinkove - Lozova.

In the Kyiv region: from the cities of Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel, Borodyanka on the route Stoyanka - Bilohorodka - Kyiv.

Where necessary, mandatory demining will be held along the route, said Iryna Vereshchuk.

In addition, she reminded that a special power line was damaged at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant captured by the Russian armed forces, as a result of which the power units remained without electricity.

""We demand immediate access for the repair crew to eliminate the damage and we ask the world community to focus its attention on this issue,"" said the Deputy Prime Minister.

Also, as Iryna Vereshchuk noted, the Donetsk-Mariupol gas pipeline was damaged. As a result, more than a million people in the cities of Mariupol, Berdyansk and others were left without heating.

""We demand access for special vehicles and repair crews so that we can repair the gas pipeline and ensure heating,"" she urged.

Iryna Vereshchuk added that she would inform about other details of the evacuation routes.",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vidkrilisya-gumanitarni-koridori-dlya-evakuaciyi-lyudej-u-su-73473

Clashes have continued in multiple parts of Ukraine as of March 10 as the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia failed to agree to a 24-hour ceasefire or on humanitarian relief for Mariupol during their meeting in Antalya, Turkey, earlier in the day.

Ukraine has attempted to establish humanitarian corridors to allow for the evacuation of cities affected by conflict March 10, notably including from Trostianets, Krasnopillia, and Sumy to Poltava, from Volnovakha to Pokrovsk, and from Izium to Lozova. Authorities have also indicated plans to open corridors from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia. There has been no official confirmation as to whether these corridors had been agreed upon with Russia or international humanitarian agencies. Authorities have also announced the opening of humanitarian corridors to evacuate individuals from towns west of Kyiv, including Bucha, Borodianka, Irpen, and Hostomel, to the capital despite occasional shelling. Evacuation efforts were previously interrupted in Mariupol, with Ukrainian officials blaming Russian troops for shelling targets near convoys.

Heavy clashes and Russian bombardments have continued in multiple parts of the country. The most intense fighting has taken place in areas to the west and northwest of Kyiv, including Irpen and Dymer; Russian troops have also reportedly reached the northeastern outskirts of Kyiv near Brovary. Heavy fighting has continued on the outskirts of Chernihiv city as well as elsewhere in Chernihiv Oblast, particularly near Hlukiv. An airstrike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol reportedly killed three people and wounded at least 17 others March 9.

Russian troops have encircled or partially encircled the cities of Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Mariupol, and Sumy. Kherson, Melitopol, and Berdyansk are under Russian occupation.

According to figures released by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights March 9, at least 516 civilians have been killed and 908 others wounded since Russia's offensive against Ukraine began Feb. 24.

Martial Law, Curfews, Disruptions

Martial law and a nationwide general military mobilization are in effect. Males ages 18-60 are prohibited from leaving the country. Curfews are in effect 22:00-06:00 in multiple regions, including Cherkasy, Lviv, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Volyn, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr. Curfew hours are 18:00-06:00 in Chernihiv and Kharkiv, 19:00-06:00 in Odesa and Mykolaiv, 20:00-06:00 in Dnipro and Kherson, 20:00-07:00 in Kyiv, and 22:00-07:00 in Ivano-Frankivsk. Depending on the ground situation, authorities may extend or amend curfew hours on short notice. Civilians must stay indoors during curfew hours; exemptions are in place for persons seeking urgent medical care and workers in critical infrastructure. Public transport is unavailable during curfew hours.

Reports indicate a shortage of basic supplies, including groceries and pharmaceutical products, in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Polohy, and Mariupol; similar situations are likely in other cities facing Russian ground offensives. Other conflict-impacted cities will likely continue to see queues at ATMs, supermarkets, and petrol stations, as well as significant traffic congestion on major westward roads.

Ukrainian authorities have closed the country's borders with Belarus, Russia, and the Transnistria region of Moldova to foreign nationals; only Ukrainian citizens can enter from these areas. Reports also indicate significant road travel disruptions at Ukraine's western borders as thousands of civilians flee the conflict, though congestion has reportedly eased. Ukraine's borders with Hungary, Moldova, Poland, and Slovakia remain open; these states have increased security at their respective borders with Ukraine to aid in the reception of refugees. Significant delays at border crossings into neighboring states will likely persist and may worsen depending on conflict developments elsewhere in the country.

Critical Infrastructure

Metro services in Kyiv are intermittent; trains do not operate during curfew hours and will likely cease during air raids as many stations function as bomb shelters. Rail and road routes to the south and west of Kyiv remain largely operational, though the railway connection between Kyiv and Irpen was destroyed March 5. Civilian aviation remains suspended in Ukraine, and the nation's seaports are closed. Russia has temporarily stopped commercial shipping in the Sea of Azov.

Slovakia has resumed international rail services with Ukraine. Ukrainian Railways (UZ) is currently operating evacuation trains from multiple regions, including Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvyi Rih, Zakarpattia, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa regions. UZ continues to operate intermittent services throughout much of the country, though reports indicate severe delays and congestion. Rail services are subject to disruptions with little warning. Reports indicate large crowds at several operational stations, particularly in Lviv, from where evacuation services to international destinations are coordinated.

Intermittent telecommunications and internet disruptions continue across much of the country. Power, water, gas, and other utilities or amenities have been disrupted throughout Sumy Oblast, as well as in Okhtyrka, Mariupol, and Kharkiv. Similar utility disruptions are highly likely in other urban centers facing artillery and rocket bombardment.

The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) only allows the withdrawal of up to UAH 30,000 (USD 1,000) in cash from foreign currency accounts. It has limited the permitted cash withdrawal from domestic currency accounts to UAH 100,000 (USD 3,340) per day. The bank has also suspended cross-border currency payments and the replenishment of electronic wallets.

Context

Russian forces continue in their apparent attempt to encircle Kyiv, with fierce clashes taking place on the city's eastern and western outskirts while additional Russian forces reportedly move into the area from the north and northeast.

Russian advances in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions have effectively cut Ukraine off from the Sea of Azov. Further advances to the west of Kherson toward Mykolaiv and Odesa threaten to cut Ukraine off from supplies via the Black Sea. Despite failing to capture Mykolaiv thus far, Russian troops are attempting to advance westward along the Black Sea coast. Additional advances in these regions will likely aid Russian forces in a potential future assault on the southwestern city of Odesa.

Despite recent bilateral negotiations, Russia and Ukraine's positions are almost certain to remain irreconcilable. Ukraine demands a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces, while Russia demands Ukraine surrender, disarm, and declare itself to be a neutral country remaining outside NATO and the EU. Nonetheless, Russia and Ukraine did agree during talks March 7 to establish humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians and deliver essential goods to areas impacted by the heaviest fighting.

Advice

Avoid travel to Ukraine until the situation stabilizes; consider exiting the country if safe to do so. Where fighting or airstrikes are occurring, shelter in place until the situation becomes clear. If officials report incoming fire, stay away from windows and exterior walls. Strictly heed the instructions of local security personnel, particularly when ordered to air-raid shelters. Stockpile food, fuel, and water when possible and safe to do so. Maintain contact with your diplomatic representation. Confirm that a thorough communication plan exists to ensure rapid accountability for all personnel operating in Ukraine. Reconfirm the status of public transport services, road routes, and borders before departure.
