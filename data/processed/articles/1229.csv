Explosions have rocked Ukraine's capital Kyiv overnight amid widespread uncertainty over whether Russia will launch a full assault on the capital in the coming hours and days. Massive blasts were heard and filmed in the city last night, with one video on social media showing a huge fireball rising in the city's sky. It's unknown what the targets of the explosions were, or whether there have been casualties caused by the blasts. NBC News is working to verify camera footage posted online purporting to show explosions hitting the city. More than 1 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the start of the Russian invasion a week ago, but many have stayed and taken up arms to fight Russian forces. Many of Kyiv's residents, including children, also remain in the city, living or seeking shelter in subway stations, basements and underground bunkers when air raid sirens warn of incoming strikes.

Russia has said Kyiv's residents will be allowed to evacuate the city in the direction of Vasylkiv, to the southwest of the city. ""There will not be any obstacles from Russian military personnel for the exit of the civilian population,"" Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, a spokesperson for the Defense Ministry, said on Wednesday, according to Russian state news agency TASS. This is the second time that Russia has warned Kyiv's residents to leave the city, with Konashenkov insisting on Monday that the route toward Vasylkiv was ""open and safe,"" despite reports of Russian missile strikes on the town.

The convoy

As many residents of Kyiv take shelter in underground stations and bunkers, the decision of whether to stay or go — and to risk possible harm and death in the process of leaving — has become acute this week, particularly as concerns grow that Russia could be poised to launch an all-out assault on the city. Fears have grown after satellite images emerged at the start of the week showing a huge convoy of Russian military vehicles, estimated to be around 40 miles long, slowly snaking its way toward the capital. The following satellite image was taken by U.S firm Maxar Technologies on Monday. It appears to show a convoy of Russian armored tanks and trucks that stretched from Pybirsk, further north of Kyiv, to the Antonov airport (also known as the Hostomel airport — the site of fighting last week between Russian and Ukrainian forces) on the northwestern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital.

The convoy has reportedly been held up on its way to Kyiv, however, amid unconfirmed reports of food and fuel shortages. When asked about the convoy's progress and position at a press briefing on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Department Spokesman John Kirby said ""we still assess that that convoy, but more broadly speaking the northern push by the Russians down towards the south, towards Kyiv, remains stalled."" ""From our best estimates have not made any appreciable progress geographically speaking in the last 24 to 36 hours,"" he added. The U.S. defense official believed there were several reasons for the delay: ""One, we believe the Russians are deliberately, actually, regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up for lost time. Two, we do believe that they have experienced logistics and sustainment challenges, challenges that we don't believe they fully anticipated."" Lastly, he said, Russian forces have experienced ""resistance from the Ukrainians,"" with indications — although the U.S. could not completely independently verify them — that ""Ukrainians have in fact tried to slow down that convoy."" Britain's Ministry of Defense confirmed the United States' assessment of the convoy on Thursday, issuing an intelligence update in which it said ""the main body of the large Russian column … remains over 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) from the centre of the city, having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion."" The ministry also believed that ""the column has made little discernible progress in over three days."" Jack Watling, a research fellow for land warfare and military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, said there were a number of logistical challenges that the convoy faces. ""When you have that many vehicles on a very small number of roads you need to move fuel and food and large quantities of it along that road so you're continually having to move the vehicles aside and then at the other end you're having to work who's going to go where and what they're going to do,"" he said. ""So I think the Russians are trying to sort themselves out, as it were, and shake out at the other end and prepare for what they want to do to Kyiv,"" he told the BBC's ""Today"" program on Thursday.

Dire situation

Kyiv is only one of the a number of key cities that Russian forces are hoping to seize following their invasion of Ukraine. Other key strategic cities including Kharkiv and Mariupol have been the scenes of fierce fighting. There are reports that Russian forces have taken control of Kherson in the south, with the city's mayor announcing on Facebook Wednesday evening that Russians had imposed a curfew and other rules on residents. The mayor, Igor Kolykhayev, warned residents not to provoke the Russian military.

Footage captured in the city showed a massive, orange blast lighting up the night sky followed by a loud boom.

Local journalists reported that air raid alerts had been triggered throughout the night with residents urged to seek shelter.

One of the blasts, caught on camera by a CBS crew, cast a bright flash of orange light across the capital.

The presenter, who was forced to duck for cover after a second huge explosion followed within seconds, described it as “a big flash” and “almost like lightning”.

Another clip shared on social media showed what appeared to be an orange fireball erupt on the horizon.

Following heavy overnight shelling of the city, Russia's Defence Ministry said it had disabled a reserve broadcasting centre in the Lysa Hora district, in the south of the city.

It said unspecified precision weapons were used, and claimed there were no casualties or damage to residential buildings.

A statement from the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces didn't address the strikes, saying only that Russian forces were ""regrouping"" and ""trying to reach the northern outskirts"" of the city.

An explosion also rocked Kyiv’s railway station, where thousands of refugees are desperately trying to escape the city.

A Ukrainian interior ministry adviser said that blast was caused by wreckage from a downed Russian cruise missile, and there were no immediate reports of casualties. It was not immediately clear whether that was the same blast that caused the orange fireball to erupt.

However, despite another night of heavy bombing, the huge armoured column of Russian tanks and soldiers which is approaching Kyiv appeared to remain stalled outside the capital, having apparently run short on fuel, food and other supplies.

""The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30 km from the centre of the city having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion,"" the UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update.

A senior US defence official confirmed the column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles appeared to be stalled and had made no real progress in the last couple of days.

""The advance on Kyiv has been rather not very organised and now they're more or less stuck,"" military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer told the Associated Press news agency from Moscow.

""There's no real money to run to fight this war,"" he said, adding that if Vladimir Putin and the military ""are unable to wrap up this campaign very swiftly and victoriously, they're in a pickle.""",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-airstrikes-kyiv-explosion-b2027501.html

Russian President Vladimir Putin said he discussed Belarus’ interest in having access to the Baltic Sea in a phone call with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko.

“Just today we talked with the President of Belarus on this matter. Our Belarusian friends are interested in being present in the Baltic, interested in developing their own port facilities. You know that I also support it,” Putin said during a ceremony for a new Russian ferry, which he attended virtually.

Belarus is a landlocked country, so it is unclear what practical steps Putin and Russia could take to provide access to the Baltic Sea. However, Russia has customs union with Belarus and shares a long common border.

NATO’s Baltic members — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — are among those most concerned about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

This week, a Ukrainian government official told CNN that Ukrainian intelligence indicates Belarusian ""readiness to maybe participate directly"" in the invasion.

So far, however, US officials have not seen Belarusian troops ""being readied to move into Ukraine"" or ""that they are moving or are in Ukraine,"" a senior US defense official said Monday, adding that the forces inside Ukraine are Russian.

The White House on Wednesday detailed a new slate of economic measures levied against Russia and Belarus, condemning Belarus for ""enabling Putin's invasion of Ukraine.""

“I’ve asked you to provide all possible assistance. This applies to various places, points, structures where our Belarusian friends could fulfill these options. I won't go into details now, you know about them,” Putin also said during his remarks. “They are important not only for Belarus, but also for us because this is the development of our infrastructure, an increase in cargo transportation on our coast, for our country. Accordingly, the benefits of Belarus will extend to the Russian economy. We are also interested in this, so I ask you to support all these initiatives.”

KYIV, Ukraine — By midmorning, there was little left outside the shopping mall beyond rubble, blood stains and broken glass. On one side, the building had been reduced to a pile of debris. On the other lay remnants left by several victims — including their clothes. Used surgical gloves were scattered on the ground nearby.

The missile that struck the Retroville shopping complex late Sunday night killed at least eight people, officials here said, the latest violent attack on the capital in the past week that have left residents fearing what might come next. The devastation at the mall on Monday was some of the worst seen in Kyiv since the war began, and concern is mounting that Russia’s frustration over its failure to seize key territory could prompt its forces to escalate its attacks.

Civilians milled about outside the next morning to survey the damage, well aware that the unpredictable nature of the assault meant those who died here just hours before could just as easily have been them.

“The whole city is dangerous,” said Vitaliya Dubovetska, who lives on the 16th floor of an apartment building nearby and saw the strike from her window. “Any place could be safe or unsafe. It’s like a lottery.” Photos on her phone showed an orange fireball erupting in the distance. She moved closer to the strike site on Monday to repair the windows at a relative’s apartment across the street and then visited what remained of the mall.

Dubovetska and others said the attack occurred around 11 p.m. on Sunday, causing an enormous boom that rippled through the area. Due to a citywide curfew from 8 p.m. each night, journalists could not reach the scene until morning. It was not immediately clear who was killed in the attack, which took place at a time when most civilians would not be allowed outside their homes or shelters.

Just inside the damaged mall sat a grocery store that one former employee said was now being used for storage. Shards of glass and a large puddle of water sat in the hall. The ceiling was also damaged.

Troops guarding the door initially allowed a group of journalists to enter but then forced the press corps to leave. Vladyslov Kosiak, 21, stood across the street with two friends. They, too, had heard the strike the night before from a fourth-floor balcony nearby, then came to see the damage after the curfew lifted Monday morning.

“There was a very loud bang and the building started to shake like an earthquake,” Kosiak said. Throughout the morning, the heavy report of outgoing artillery could be heard.

A territorial defense volunteer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the strike was the result of a hypersonic missile — but did not offer any evidence. “Maybe it was to show the Ukrainian military what they can do, that they can damage anything,” he said.

Booms echoed continuously throughout the area Monday morning. When asked if one loud blast was incoming or outgoing, the territorial defense member shrugged. “I don’t know, but it’s not here,” he said, and laughed as he gestured to his immediate surroundings. “So it’s okay.”

The attack Sunday came as Russia insisted Ukraine surrender the besieged city of Mariupol. Weeks of attacks on the port have created a deadly humanitarian disaster. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky refused. Civilians in Kyiv said Monday that his defiance left them feeling proud despite their horror over the events unfolding within their borders.

Most communication to Mariupol has been cut off since the beginning of March, but some civilians have managed to flee. They have brought with them stories of hellish conditions, including mass graves and bodies left in the streets. Two Associated Press journalists stayed in the city for weeks, documenting the horrors firsthand and helping the world understand the gravity of Russia’s attack, which has allegedly included strikes on a theater, an art school and a maternity hospital.

“If he would agree to give them Mariupol, tomorrow it would be Kharkiv. It’s better not to negotiate,” said Natalia, 44, who worked at the grocery store inside the mall before the war started. She spoke on the condition that only her first name be used due to security concerns. She, too, visited the site Monday to assess the damage.

“From the beginning,” she said, “Russian soldiers thought we in Kyiv would meet them with a flower in our hands. But if they come, we will each give them two,” a reference to the tradition of leaving flowers by a grave.

Her friend Oksana works in a food store next to where the strike occurred. She said the attacks on civilian infrastructure have only bolstered the civilians’ resolve to stand their ground. “We will never let the Russian army come to Kyiv,” she said. She had decided to stay in the capital out of a sense of patriotic duty. “It’s better to die in an apartment here than to try to live somewhere else.”

Still, residents worry the growing assault could make living here unbearable. Already, they are fearful and anxious — but keep pressing forward in hopes the situation will resolve.

“Every day I wake up to have breakfast and don’t know if I will be alive for dinner,” Natalia said.

CBC has been using a transliteration based on the Ukrainian spelling of the name: ""Kyiv"" (pronounced ""KEE-ef""). The Russian version is ""Kiev"" (pronounced ""kee-EV"").

Kyiv or Kiev?

Kiev was the internationally accepted English-language spelling through the Soviet period and into the first years of this century.

Watch a video on how to pronounce Kyiv

But, according to Natalia Khanenko-Friesen, director of the Canadian Institute for Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta, the name ""Kiev"" is now associated with the Russification of Ukraine. In recent years, more and more publications, governments, airports and geographical dictionaries have switched the spelling to the Ukrainian variant, she said.

""The fact that we have been using the word 'Kiev' for so long has something to do with the history of the region ... the history of the relationship between the Russian Federation and Ukraine,"" said Khanenko-Friesen.

WATCH | On the ground in Ukraine on Day 8:

What's happening in Ukraine on Day 8 of Russian invasion Duration 0:52 A dash camera captured images of an explosion in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv as people continued to flee the country eight days into the Russian invasion. In the northeastern city of Kharkiv a chaotic scene unfolded as crowds of people desperate to leave flooded into a train station. Warning: audio includes profanities. 0:52

Khanenko-Friesen noted that the region formally became part of the Russian Empire in the 17th century and only declared itself an independent country in August 1991, shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Many people still speak both Russian and Ukrainian, and in 2001, the last time a census was taken, about 17 per cent of the population was Russian although some have pointed out that that 20-year-old data doesn't capture the changes of recent years.

The transliteration ""Kyiv"" was legally mandated by the Ukrainian government in 1995, but the new name only started gaining traction a few years ago when the Ukrainian government mounted a campaign to secure international approval for the name of its capital city.

""Ukrainian diaspora ... have been very vocal in this transition, and we've seen important changes,"" said Khanenko-Friesen.

""We've seen media changing the spelling, transliteration and now pronunciation. We now see the use of the Ukrainian word 'Kyiv' in the IT domain. People can now book tickets to Kyiv online by operating with the new spelling rather than the old one.""

Why is CBC using 'Kyiv'?

On Tuesday, CBC's chief pronunciation counsellor, Laura Carlin, said in a note that CBC would be using the Kyiv transliteration based on the Ukrainian spelling.

""While language does evolve, we generally change place-name pronunciations only to reflect a true shift in how people in English-speaking Canada refer to a country or to match widespread shifts in transliterations ... or to eliminate pronunciations that are truly problematic,"" she said.

She said ""Kyiv"" falls into all three categories.

CBC reporters may often use an anglicized pronunciation of ""Kyiv,"" but this is already common practice when, for example, using English pronunciation for ""Paris"" or ""Mexico.""

""For a foreign-language speaker, Ukrainian is not an easy language to master, and the pronunciation 'KEE-ef' is really a great approximation of how the word Kyiv sounds in the native Ukrainian language,"" said Khanenko-Friesen.

Pronunciation is political

Khanenko-Friesen says the spelling and pronunciation of ""Kyiv"" is significant during this ""time of aggravated assault on the sovereignty and integrity of the Ukrainian state.""

""Using, right now, the Ukrainian pronunciation of ... the capital is a very small choice one can do in recognition that Ukraine does have the right to exist as an independent nation, contrary to what Vladimir Putin has been stating in his recent statements and addresses to his nation.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/cbc-pronunciation-kyiv-ukraine-crisis-explainer-1.6371766

Reuters witnesses in the centre of the city of 3.4 million people could not immediately confirm the cause of the blasts, but they were more frequent than in recent days and some were louder. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

While no major assault has been launched on Kyiv yet, the capital has been shelled and Russian forces unleashed fierce firepower to try to break resistance in the nearby town of Borodyanka.

Drone footage from the town to the northwest of Kyiv on Thursday showed flattened houses and a badly damaged apartment block, with some homes charred and still on fire. Burned out military vehicles littered a main road.

In Kyiv's Borshchahivka neighbourhood, some 18 km west of the centre, the twisted metal remnants of a missile, which Ukrainian air defences apparently downed overnight, lay in the middle of a street a few metres from a bus station.

Tens of thousands of residents have fled the capital to the relative safety of the west of Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Many remain, and on Friday some people's message for the Russian military was one of defiance.

Liliya, a woman wearing a black coat and pointing at the missile debris, said Moscow was guilty of ""genocide"" against Ukraine.

""These bloodthirsty creatures came to kill us,"" she said.

Nearby, Igor Leonidovich, a bespectacled man of 62, described himself as an ethnic Russian and said he moved to Ukraine as a boy over 50 years ago.

""They all (Russian invaders) should go to hell,"" he said. ""I cannot believe what I am seeing with my own eyes. The situation is deteriorating for everyone, but especially for occupying forces.""

Russia says its actions in Ukraine are a ""special operation"" not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists.

Ukraine and its Western allies dismiss that description and call it an unjustified invasion. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two and more than a million people have fled abroad.

In downtown Kyiv, the streets were a far cry from their pre-war vibrancy. But people went about their daily business and soldiers at a checkpoint of concrete blocks and metal spikes laughed as they shared breakfast.

As air raid sirens went off, some residents remained in queues outside pharmacies and food stores, while others took a stroll in a park.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.
