""It appears so far ... the idea he is pulling all his troops out from around Kyiv and moving south, there's no evidence that he's done that,"" Biden said following an announcement that he was authorizing the United States to release 1 million barrels of oil per day, for six months, from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to alleviate rising gas prices.

Biden's comment echoed that of Defense Department spokesman John Kirby, who said Tuesday that Russian troop movements represented ""a repositioning, not a real withdrawal."" Biden said he remained highly skeptical of Putin's intentions.

""The question of whether he's pulling back his forces depends on how you read exactly what's going on. Thus far, there is no clear evidence that he's pulling all of his forces out of Kyiv,"" he said. ""There is also evidence that he is beefing up his troops down in the Donbas area.""

The president added, ""I'm a skeptic, but I don't have proof that he's taking a pause.""

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg offered a similar view of Russian troop positioning.

""According to our intelligence, Russian units are not withdrawing but repositioning,"" Stoltenberg told reporters on Thursday. ""Russia is trying to regroup, resupply and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas region.""

Meanwhile, Biden appeared to slightly back away from reports Wednesday about declassified U.S. intelligence that concluded that Putin had been misled by his military advisers who feared reprisals for their critical views about how well the Russian military was performing in Ukraine.

Asked by a reporter the extent to which he believed Putin had been misinformed, Biden sounded much less certain than other members of his administration.

""That's an open question. There's a lot of speculation, but he seems to be — I'm not saying this with a certainty — he seems to be self-isolating, and there's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers. But I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time, because we don't have that much hard evidence.""

On Wednesday, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield offered a clearer assessment.

""We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions, because his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth,"" Bedingfield told reporters.

While NATO and U.S. officials have noted the shift of Russian troops to the eastern portion of the country, Ukraine's state nuclear company said Thursday that Russian forces were reportedly leaving positions at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which they seized at the beginning of the conflict. Those troops were seen marching toward the border into Belarus, according to Ukrainian officials.",https://news.yahoo.com/biden-no-evidence-putin-is-pulling-troops-from-around-kyiv-193543120.html

PRESIDENT BIDEN: The question, is he pulling back his forces. Whoever asked that question. - I asked that, yes. PRESIDENT BIDEN: The question of whether he's pulling back his forces, depends on how you read exactly what's going on. Thus far, there is no clear evidence that he's pulling all of his forces out of Kyiv. There is also evidence that he is beefing up his troops down in a Donbas area. Depending on your view of Putin, I'm a little skeptical. It's an open question, whether he's actually pulling back and going to say, I'm just going to focus on the Donbas. And I'm not worried about the rest of the country. I'm a skeptic, but I don't have proof. That in fact he is not going-- he's taking a pause, doing all he can, to use all the troops he has in the Donbas. And continue to keep an eye on and try to move beyond the rest of the country. I don't know the answer, but it appears so far that he has not pulled all of-- the idea he's pulling all those troops out from around Kyiv, and moving South. There's no evidence that he's done that.",https://news.yahoo.com/biden-little-skeptical-reports-putin-184557992.html

Zelenskyy strips 2 generals of rank for violating 'oath of allegiance' LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he has stripped two generals of their military rank. Zelenskyy said “something prevented them from determining where their homeland was” and they “violated their military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people.” According to Zelenskyy, one of the generals had headed internal security at the SBU, the main intelligence agency. He said the other general had been the SBU head in the Kherson region, the first major city to fall to the Russians. Zelenskyy didn’t say anything about the fates of the two generals other than them being stripped of their rank. Share this -







UK: Russia redeploying troops from Georgia to reinforce Ukraine The British defense ministry says that Russia is redeploying elements of its forces from Georgia in order to reinforce its attack and invasion of Ukraine. In an intelligence update Thursday, the U.K. put the number between 1,200 and 2,000. ""It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner, and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion,"" the British defense ministry said in the update. Georgia, once a Soviet republic, is an independent nation but two regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, are breakaway territories that are not recognized as independent states by most of the world. The British defense ministry did not specify a region in Georgia in its update about redeployment. Share this -







IAEA seeking more information about claims of Russian radiation exposure The International Atomic Energy Agency said it is seeking more information about claims that Russian forces were exposed to radiation while occupying the Chernobyl nuclear site. Ukraine's national operator of nuclear power plants said Thursday that Russian forces were withdrawing from Chernobyl and the satellite city of Slavutych, which they captured early in the invasion. Ukraine Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian troops who dug trenches in the forest were exposed to radiation, The Associated Press reported. ""The IAEA has not been able to confirm reports of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation while being in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone,"" the international agency said. ""The IAEA is seeking further information in order to provide an independent assessment of the situation."" Chernobyl, north of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and near the border with Belarus, is the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster. The damaged reactor is surrounded by a large exclusion zone.

Red Cross moving to facilitate evacuation from besieged Mariupol The International Committee of the Red Cross was traveling to help facilitate the evacuation of residents out of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the aid organization said Thursday. Russia's defense ministry said Thursday that it would open a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia for the evacuation of residents and foreigners. The situation in Mariupol has been described as dire, with around 150,000 residents remaining in shelters from bombardment with little food or water. Russian forces have blockaded the city for weeks. An evacuation convoy of 17 buses was able to leave Mariupol on Thursday, the City Council said. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of shelling and attacking humanitarian corridors to Mariupol in the past. Control of the city is contested, with Ukrainian forces fighting inside the city, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday. The Red Cross said it is also bringing badly needed supplies, including medicine. ""It's desperately important that this operation takes place. The lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it,"" it said. Russian forces stole 14 tons of food and medicine intended for Ukrainian civilians Thursday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Share this -







U.S. official: Russia has fired more than 1,400 missiles at Ukraine More than 1,400 missiles have been fired against Ukraine since Russia attacked last month, and the number of Russian airstrikes has increased despite talk of de-escalation, a U.S. defense official said Thursday. ""Despite the rhetoric of de-escalations, we're still observing artillery fire and airstrikes in and around Kyiv,"" the senior Defense Department official said at a briefing. Some Russian forces have been seen moving from Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, but there has not been a ""wholesale movement, at least not at this point,"" the U.S. official said. The official estimated that the number 20 percent of the Russian forces arrayed just against Kyiv. Russia's deputy defense minister said this week that a decision was made to reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas. U.S. officials have expressed skepticism about the claim. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby has said those troops have not been sent home and that the assessment is they will be resupplied and used elsewhere in Ukraine. Share this -







Russia seizes 14 tons of food and medicine, Ukrainian deputy prime minister says Russian forces continue to stymie humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. In a message posted Thursday on Telegram, Vereshchuk said Russian troops took 14 tons of food and medicine intended for Ukrainian civilians. The Russian military also blocked 45 buses Ukrainian officials sent into Berdyansk. About 600 people must wait until Friday morning to leave for Zaporizhzhia, Vereshchuk said. More than 30 buses remain at the entrance to Berdyansk until then. Nearly 1,460 people were able to reach Zaporizhzhia on Thursday using three humanitarian corridors, she added.

Ukrainians seeking refuge at U.S.-Mexico border stuck in legal limbo Armed with a backpack and a smartphone, Ihor Solomko paced outside the San Ysidro Port of Entry at the U.S.-Mexico border Tuesday, anxiously waiting for news from his eldest daughter, whom officials stopped as she tried to cross into the U.S. that morning after having fled war-torn Ukraine. The family has been separated since 2016, when Solomko and his wife secured green cards and moved permanently to Wisconsin with their youngest daughter. Their older daughter stayed in Ukraine with her husband and hadn’t seen her parents in two years. “I’m so stressed. I can’t think straight,” Solomko said. “I just want to hug my daughter.” Solomko is one of hundreds of Ukrainians living in the U.S. who rushed to pick up loved ones at the U.S.-Mexico border, which became a flashpoint in recent weeks for Eastern Europeans expecting to be immediately welcomed into the U.S. But confusion and frustration are overshadowing humanitarian efforts as conflicting information from the Biden administration leaves thousands of people stuck in legal limbo, without a direct way to seek asylum and making it difficult for loved ones in the U.S. to contact relatives who are being detained or processed by immigration officials.

Zelenskyy says country gradually being freed from 'occupiers' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday the country is gradually being freed from Russian “occupiers.” Zelenskyy said on his official Telegram account that Russian forces, who he said never expected to be fighting after more than a month, are weakening. “We endured tenfold what the enemy thought we would. They said — three or five days. They thought that this would be enough for them to capture our whole country. And it is already 36 days. And we are standing. And we will continue to fight,” he said. “Our Armed Forces, the National Guard, the National Police, intelligence community, they are doing a great job. Absolute gratitude towards them. North of Kyiv, in Chernihiv direction, in Sumy oblast, the expulsion of the occupiers is continuing. They realize it themselves that they are not able to cope with the intensity of the combat operations that they were able to secure in the first half of March. … They are leaving those directions where we are defeating them, so they could focus on other ones.” While most of Zelenskyy’s tone was optimistic, he said Russia is wreaking havoc in southern Ukraine and the Donbas, where the situation remained “very difficult.” Share this -







Pentagon: Weapons shipments arrive in Ukraine WASHINGTON — The Pentagon says an initial half-dozen shipments of weapons and other security assistance have reached Ukraine as part of the $800 million package of aid that President Joe Biden approved on March 16. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Thursday that the shipments included Javelin anti-tank weapons, Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems, body armor, medical supplies and other material.

It also includes Mi-17 helicopters, small arms, ammunition, vehicles, secure communications systems, and satellite imagery and analysis capability. Separately, Kirby said U.S. troops are not training Ukrainian troops in Poland but are acting as liaisons with Ukrainian personnel who cross the border into Poland to take possession of U.S. security assistance. He noted that the standard U.S. military training mission that had existed in Ukraine for years was suspended shortly before Russia invaded. Share this -

U.N. struggling to aid cities in south Ukraine The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine says the United Nations and its partners have delivered supplies for thousands of people in the country's northeast but have been unable to reach some encircled cities in the south. Osnat Lubrani said Thursday that food rations from the humanitarian organization People in Need and the U.N. World Food Program will benefit nearly 6,000 people in Sumy and areas including Trostianets and Okhtyrka. In addition, she said, basic household items including blankets and kettles from the U.N. refugee agency will support 1,500 people and sanitation kits will help 6,000 people with hygiene and drinking water. Lubrani said medical supplies and trauma kits from the U.N. World Health Organization will treat 150 patients needing intensive care for serious injuries while other medical supplies will support 10,000 people for three months. Shei said the U.N.-facilitated humanitarian notification system with Ukraine and Russia enabled safe passage for the convoy to Sumy on Thursday “but this is clearly not enough.” Efforts over the past month to reach Mauripol, Kherson and other encircled cities in the south have been unsuccessful because of safety concerns.

Nuclear operator says Russian forces withdrawing from Chernobyl Russian forces are withdrawing from Chernobyl and the satellite city of Slavutych, according to Energoatom, the national operator of Ukraine's nuclear power plants. Russia captured Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, over a month ago. Since then, a limited number of Ukrainian personnel have remained at the plant to ensure it continues to function. Energoatom said Thursday that the Russian decision to reallocate forces was influenced in part by soldiers' contact with radiation from the site and the resulting symptoms, which sparked concerns. The organization said soldiers from both the plant and the city are headed toward Ukraine's shared border with Belarus. Share this -

Kremlin decree allows foreign currency for gas ROME — A Kremlin decree says “unfriendly countries” can continue to pay for natural gas in foreign currency through a Russian bank that will convert the money into rubles. The decree published Thursday by state media came a day after the leaders of Italy and Germany said they received assurances from President Vladimir Putin. Putin talked tougher, saying Russia will start accepting ruble payments starting Friday for Western countries that imposed sanctions over its conflict with Ukraine. He said contracts will be stopped if buyers don’t sign up to the new conditions, including opening ruble accounts in Russian banks. European leaders had rejected paying for deliveries in rubles, saying it would undermine sanctions imposed because of the war in Ukraine. The decree Putin signed and published by state news agency RIA Novosti says a designated bank will open two accounts for each buyer, one in foreign currency and one in rubles. The buyers will pay in foreign currency and authorize the bank to sell that currency for rubles, which are placed in the second account, where the gas is formally purchased. Share this -

Biden administration weighs releasing 1M barrels of oil a day from reserves President Joe Biden is weighing the release of about 1 million barrels of oil a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for about six months, a source familiar with the matter said. The president could announce the plan, which could free up as much as 180 million barrels of oil, when he delivers remarks from the White House at 1:30 p.m. Thursday. Biden plans to outline his administration's actions to lessen the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on domestic energy and gas prices. The news comes several weeks after he announced the U.S. was banning the import of Russian energy products, including oil, liquified natural gas and coal, as part of an effort to increase pressure on Russia's economy through a range of sanctions. The president and other administration officials made clear that they anticipated the move would lead to a rise in already-high gas prices. Read the full story here. Share this -

Russian attacks on Ukraine cast shadow over NATO allies that were Soviet countries TALLINN, Estonia — Each new bomb and missile that strikes Ukraine casts a long shadow across this country and the other Baltic states that share a border with Russia. Unlike Ukraine, however, these states — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — are members of NATO and are close allies of the United States. For years, they have raised the alarm that Russia is their most existential threat. Yet, they feel they received little response prior to the invasion of Ukraine. Now, unless they get further support from their allies, they fear they could be the next target of the Kremlin and the very bombs and missiles that it has used to level Ukrainian cities.

Ukraine's economy could shrink by a fifth this year, European bank says The Ukrainian economy is expected to shrink by one-fifth this year, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said Thursday. The bank said it expected Ukraine’s gross domestic product to fall by 20 percent this year and Russia’s by 10 percent, in its biannual Regional Economic Update published Thursday. The bank said the war was taking place in territories that produce about 60 percent of Ukraine's GDP. It said that the National Bank of Ukraine estimates that 30 percent of businesses have stopped production, while electricity consumption was estimated at about 60 percent of the prewar level. ""Projections are subject to an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty, including major downside risks should hostilities escalate or should exports of gas or other commodities from Russia become restricted,"" it noted. Still, the bank further said that the war would have a ""severe effect"" on economies beyond the immediate area of the conflict. ""The war on Ukraine has been having a profound impact on the economies in the EBRD regions, as well as globally,"" Beata Javorcik, chief economist of the bank, said. ""Inflationary pressures were already exceptionally high and it seems certain they will now be worse, which will have a disproportionate affect on many of the lower income countries where we work.” Share this -

""As we can see, the actions of the Russian occupiers are difficult to predict, they are completely chaotic,"" he continued, saying the Ukrainian armed forces were holding their positions to fend off Russian forces. Russia and Ukraine earlier this month had agreed on the opening of humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to escape the worst of the fighting. The city suffered dozens of artillery, mortar and tank attacks on Wednesday evening, Synegubov said, as well as missile strikes. A gas pipeline was also damaged, causing a strong fire.

Australia to impose tariff increases on imports from Russia, Belarus The Australian government is imposing an additional 35% increase in imports from Russia and Belarus, its foreign and trade ministry announced Thursday. Foreign Affairs minister Marise Payne said in a statement that the government will draft a “formal notification withdrawing entitlement to the Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) tariff treatment” to apply the additional fee on imports from Russia and Belarus. Payne said this move attempts to further condemn Russia’s actions and is aligned “with other like-minded members of the World Trade Organization.” The ministry’s statement came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered a virtual address to the Australian parliament Thursday.

Russian shelling sets fire to a school and an oil depot in Luhansk, officials say Russian shelling over the past two days set fire to a school, an oil depot, and dozens of houses in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region, the regional state administration has said. The shelling killed at least two people and injured two children, it said. NBC News was not able to verify the death toll. ""Several injured and dead residents could not be taken from the streets for hours,"" Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk region, said in a statement shared on the administration's Telegram page.

Evacuation corridor from Mariupol agreed, Ukraine says Russia has agreed to open a humanitarian corridor for evacuation from the besieged cities Mariupol and Melitopol to Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said, citing confirmation from the Red Cross. Vereshchuk said officials had ""received a message from the International Committee of the Red Cross about Russia's confirmation of its readiness to open a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol with transit through Berdyansk"" in a televised statement. NBC News was not able to independently confirm the agreement. Along with the planned evacuation routes, humanitarian aid will also be delivered to those in Melitopol, Vereshchuk said. Corridors have further been approved for evacuees fleeing the city of Enerhodar, home to the largest nuclear power plant in Europe that caught fire earlier in March, Vereshchuk added. At least 45 buses have already been sent for the planned evacuation from Mariupol, while the approved link from Enerhodar to Zaporizhzhia will have to be undertaken by one’s own transportation, the deputy prime minister said.

Biden told reporters that “there's some indication” that Putin has taken those steps against some of his advisers. He added, “But I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don't have that much hard evidence.”

The White House on Wednesday released unclassified intelligence findings that Putin is being misinformed by his advisors about how badly the Russian military is performing.

The president made the comments after formally announcing that the U.S. would release 1 million barrels of oil per day from the nation's strategic petroleum reserve in hopes of easing surging gasoline prices.

Biden also reiterated that his administration remains sceptical that Russia will scale back operations around Kyiv as Moscow announced earlier this week.

Russian forces continued to shell Kyiv suburbs Thursday, two days after the Kremlin announced it would significantly scale back operations near both the capital and the northern city of Chernihiv.

“There’s no evidence he’s done that,” said Biden. However, he pointed out that there is evidence Putin is “beefing up” his troops in the Donbas region.

“Depending on your view of Putin, I’m a little skeptical,” Biden mentioned. “It’s an open question whether he’s actually pulling back.”

“But I’m a skeptic. I don’t have proof,” he continued.

On the other hand, the Kremlin rejected Washington’s claims that Putin is being misled by his advisers about Russia’s failures on the battlefield.

1 Apr 2022 22.26 Russian troops have reportedly taken an unspecified number of captive Ukrainian servicemen hostage after leaving Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear power plant, according to officials. State nuclear agency Energoatom released a statement on Telegram, citing plant workers: As they ran away from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the Russian occupiers took members of the National Guard, whom they had held hostage since Feb 24, with them.” The Guardian is unable to verify these claims and it remains unclear how many, if any, Ukrainian servicemen were taken away.



1 Apr 2022 22.02 The Biden administration has approved the drawdown and sale of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) citing a severe energy supply interruption. In a recently published memorandum, Biden said Russia’s invasion on Ukraine “has had a profound impact on global oil markets” prompting the International Energy Agency Governing Board to agree to a collective release of petroleum reserves. He said the United States committed to a drawdown and sale of 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The Secretary is authorised and directed to draw down and sell petroleum from the SPR at public sale to the highest qualified bidder at a rate the Secretary may determine, in accordance with section 161 of EPCA and the SPR competitive sales procedures in 10 CFR Part 625,” the statement read.



1 Apr 2022 21.40 Russia will respond to European Union sanctions and says the 27-nation bloc might realise that a confrontation with Moscow is not in its interests, Russian state media agency RIA Novosti cited a senior foreign ministry official as saying on Friday. Nikolai Kobrinets said in an interview with the news agency: The actions of the EU will not remain unanswered ... the irresponsible sanctions by Brussels are already negatively affecting the daily lives of ordinary Europeans. Are they ready from their own pocket to pay for further killings of civilians in Ukraine, the transformation of Europe from a region of cooperation and stability into a zone of conflict? I don’t think so.”

It always gets worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas.” ""President Putin is not the force he used to be"".

1 Apr 2022 21.00 Russian troops leave Chernobyl after radiation exposure - Ukraine reports Russian troops began leaving the Chernobyl nuclear plant after soldiers contracted “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site, Ukraine’s state power company has alleged. Ukraine’s state agency in charge of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, Energoatom, published an update late on Thursday confirming Russian troops had left the site. According to the staff of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, there are currently no outsiders at the NPP site. It will be recalled that today the Russian occupation forces left the territory of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the satellite city of Slavutych.” Energoatom said Russian troops had dug in the forest inside the exclusion zone around the now-closed plant. “It should be noted that the information about fortifications and trenches that the [Russians] built right in the Red Forest, the most polluted in the entire Exclusion Zone, was also confirmed,” Energoatom said in a Telegram post. So it is not surprising that the occupiers received significant doses of radiation and panicked at the first sign of illness. And it manifested itself very quickly.” The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had not been able to confirm reports of Russian troops receiving high doses and was seeking more information in a statement on Thursday. The IAEA has not been able to confirm reports of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation while being in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and is seeking further information in order to provide an independent assessment of the situation.” Energoatom said Russian troops had dug in the forest inside the exclusion zone around the now-closed plant. Photograph: EyePress News/REX/Shutterstock Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, told the Associated Press it “seems unlikely” a large number of troops would develop severe radiation illness, but it was impossible to know for sure without more details.

He said contaminated material was probably buried or covered with new topsoil during the cleanup of Chernobyl, and some soldiers may have been exposed to a “hot spot” of radiation while digging. Others may have assumed they were at risk too, he said. Russian troops on Tuesday left Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear power plant after weeks of occupation, officials said on Thursday. Energoatom said Russian troops began leaving the station and other exclusion zones, which they had occupied since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February. The IAEA also released a statement, saying: “Ukraine informed IAEA today that Russian forces that had been in control of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant since 24 February have, in writing, transferred control of the nuclear power plant to Ukrainian personnel and moved convoys of troops.” #Ukraine informed IAEA today that Russian forces that had been in control of #Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant since 24 Feb have, in writing, transferred control of the NPP to Ukrainian personnel and moved convoys of troops. https://t.co/DkBXEJpDu8 pic.twitter.com/guITblxwXP — IAEA - International Atomic Energy Agency (@iaeaorg) March 31, 2022

EU officials close to the preparations of the summit said any help given to Russia would damage China’s international reputation and jeopardise relations with its biggest trade partners - Europe and the United States. The presidents of the European Commission and European Council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, will hold virtual talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and later President Xi Jinping. An EU official said China’s stance towards Russia would be the “million-dollar question” on Friday, as reported by Reuters. Another pointed out that over a quarter of China’s global trade was with the bloc and the United States last year, against just 2.4% with Russia. “Do we prolong this war or do we work together to end this war? That is the essential question for the summit,” the official said. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated China’s call for peace talks this week, adding the legitimate concerns of all sides should be accommodated.

In a discussion with President of the European Council, Charles Michel, Zelenskiy said the pair discussed additional sanctions on Russia, economic support for Ukraine and financing of priority projects. “The dynamics of our movement towards full membership in the EU,” he added. Zelenskiy said he was grateful for the new package of sanctions against Russia imposed by the United States. “We are grateful. It will not allow the current sanctions to be circumvented - we have already noticed such attempts. It will also limit the work of sensitive sectors of the Russian economy - its defence sector.” Finally, Zelenskiy said he also held talks with President of Turkey Erdoğan. “We spoke very specifically. In particular, about the prospects of negotiations in Turkey with the Russian Federation. And also about the creation of an effective system of guarantees for our state. About the security we have always needed and to the real provision of which we have come closer. “I am grateful for Turkey’s readiness to become a guarantor of security for Ukraine.”



31 Mar 2022 19.03 Zelenskiy also provided an update on Ukraine’s military defence, confirming Russian troops continue to leave the country’s north but describing the move as a tactical withdrawal. To the north of Kyiv, in the Chernihiv direction, in the Sumy region, the expulsion of the occupiers continues. They themselves are aware that they can no longer withstand the intensity of hostilities they could have maintained in the first half of March ... But we must also realise that for the Russian military, this is part of their tactics. All this is not occasional. We know their plans. We know what they are planning and what they are doing. We know that they are moving away from the areas where we are beating them to focus on others that are very important. On those where it can be difficult for us. Describing the “extremely difficult” situation in Ukraine’s south and in Donbas, Zelenskiy claimed Russian forces are accumulating in the temporarily occupied areas of region of Kherson. They are trying to organise some of their incomprehensible structures there, they are trying to figure out how to consolidate their presence there,” he said. Also in Donbas, in Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes. Powerful strikes.”



31 Mar 2022 18.57 Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as we continue to deliver all the latest from Ukraine. As expected, Zelenskiy has delivered another late-night address. They [Russia] said - three or five days. They thought that this would be enough for them to seize our entire state. And it’s already 36. And we are standing. And we will continue to fight. Until the end.”

""Thus far there is no clear evidence that he's pulling all of his forces out of Kyiv,"" Biden told reporters at the White House.

Biden said, ""There's also evidence that he is beefing up his troops down in the Donbas area"" -- a region of Ukraine where Putin has recognized two separatist territories as independent states. ""Depending on your view of Putin. I'm a little skeptical,"" he added.

The Russian Ministry of Defense had said Tuesday that it has decided to ""drastically reduce hostilities"" in the Kyiv and Chernigov directions, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said, according to state media RIA.

However, earlier Thursday, a US defense official told reporters that Russian forces have continued to focus their strikes on Ukraine in four areas, including the capital city.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Thursday that a ""small number"" of Russian troops are ""beginning to reposition"" and, while ""it's not exactly clear"" where the troops are going, the US does not ""see any indication that they're going to be sent home.""

The best assessment that the US has is that the Russian troops will probably reposition into Belarus to be refit and resupplied in order to be used ""elsewhere in Ukraine,"" Kirby added.

The US has seen some Russian troops departing from the Chernobyl plant facility in Ukraine, Kirby added. Those troops are ""leaving to the north to go back again towards Belarus,"" Kirby said.

Amid the repositioning, the White House is maintaining that there are no plans for Biden and Putin to speak. Any conversation between the two men, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said on Thursday, would require serious de-escalation by Russians in Ukraine -- setting a high bar for re-engagement.

US intel says Putin was misled by his military advisers

The US government on Wednesday revealed declassified intelligence indicating Putin was led astray by military advisers about how poorly the Russian military has been performing in Ukraine and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions. Bedingfield said at the time that the US intelligence community also has information indicating that the Russian leader has become aware of the misinformation, leading to a rift between him and his top defense officials.

US government officials have expressed confidence in the intelligence, with Bedingfield saying that Putin is being misled ""because his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth.""

Responding to the US intelligence claims, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov suggested the US is failing to understand what's going on in Moscow, according to Russian state news agency TASS.

""To our regret, and even concern, neither the Department of State nor the Pentagon have authentic information about what is happening in the Kremlin. They just do not understand what is happening in the Kremlin. They do not understand Russian President Vladimir Putin. They do not understand the mechanism of decision-making, and they do not understand the style of our work,"" Peskov said on Thursday.

Biden later Thursday said there's some indication that Putin is isolating himself and punishing some of his advisers, but added that the US doesn't have much hard evidence to say that with certainty.

When CNN's MJ Lee asked the President how badly Putin is being misinformed by his advisers, Biden responded: ""That's an open question. There's a lot of speculation, but he seems to be -- I'm not saying this with a certainty -- he seems to be self-isolating and there's some indication that he has ... fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers.""

""But I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time, because we don't have that much hard evidence,"" he added.

Biden's comments came after he announced a two-part plan to provide relief for Americans at the pump that began when Russian oil was sidelined and increase American energy independence. As part of the plan, he announced the unprecedented release of oil from US reserves and steps to spur the domestic production of critical minerals needed to manufacture batteries for electric vehicles and long-term energy storage.

The Strategic Petroleum Reserve release would amount to 180 million barrels of oil, roughly 1 million barrels per day, according to Biden.

US President Joe Biden said Thursday that Russian leader Vladimir Putin may be ""isolated"" and could have placed some of his advisors under ""house arrest.""

In his first public remarks on Western assessments about Kremlin tensions over the war in Ukraine, Biden also said he was ""skeptical"" about Moscow's claim to be scaling back its onslaught in parts of the country.

""He seems to be self-isolated and there's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,"" Biden told reporters when asked about British and US intelligence statements that Putin is not getting proper information from staff about difficulties in Ukraine.

Biden tempered his remarks, saying ""there's a lot of speculation"" and he did not want to ""put too much stock in that.""

He also said he was not certain what the Russian army was doing in Ukraine after Moscow announced a pullback -- seen as offering a potential opening to broader de-escalation -- from the capital Kyiv and another city.

Biden said that it was possible that any pullback from the cities -- if happening -- was only ordered to allow increased attacks on another area of Ukraine, the eastern Donbas region.

""Thus far, there's no clear evidence that he's pulling all those forces out of Kyiv. There's also evidence that he's beefing up his troops down in the Donbas,"" Biden said.

""I'm a little skeptical. It's an open question whether he's actually pulling back.""

8,14b60143-af6f-4a6f-aae4-f168703c9e22,[],,"Near Kherson, Ukraine — Russian forces were still shelling areas near Ukraine's capital Thursday, two days after Moscow said it would scale back its attack there to facilitate peace talks. Ukraine's president told his people Wednesday night that the fight to repel Russia's invasion had reached a ""turning point,"" and he asked the U.S. for more weapons and other assistance to turn the tide.

In a late-night video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cast doubt on Russia's stated decision to ""drastically reduce"" attacks around Kyiv and the northeast city of Chernihiv. He said Russian forces were building up in his country's eastern Donbas regions in preparation for a major offensive there. Russia has made it clear that it will shift the focus of its ""special military operation"" to Donbas.

U.S. officials believe units that Russia is pulling back from Kyiv will be refitted for use elsewhere in Ukraine, but given the damage sustained by Russian forces during the first month of Putin's war, making the equipment battle-ready again could take weeks.

A British intelligence chief said Thursday that Russian forces were suffering from shortages of both ""weapons and morale,"" leading some to sabotage their own equipment and refuse to follow orders. He said the seemingly poorly trained and equipped troops had even accidentally shot down their own aircraft.

The assessment by Sir Jeremy Fleming, head of Britain's GCHQ intelligence agency, that Putin had ""massively misjudged the situation"" in Ukraine, came a day after U.S. officials said intelligence showed Putin had been misled by his own military commanders about the difficulties Russia was encountering.

Ukrainian forces have held Vladimir Putin's ground forces to a stalemate. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams reported from near the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, next to a burned-out Russian military vehicle, there's evidence even in Ukraine's artillery-battered south of Putin's stalled invasion.

Williams and her team traveled Wednesday with a convoy of Ukrainian soldiers — volunteers from all walks of life — as they headed to reinforce the front line near Kherson.

Andriy Rogalski was a crane operator until he signed up earlier this month. He had just two weeks of basic training and told CBS News that he was frightened he could be killed, but that he and the others heading into battle had quashed their fears, because they know what they're fighting for.

""It's pure evil what they did,"" he said of Russia's relentless artillery and missile strikes. The attacks have hit hospitals, apartment buildings, schools and civilians just walking down the road. The U.S. says it's seen clear evidence that Putin's forces are committing war crimes.

The United Nations has said thousands of civilians may have been killed in the besieged port city of Mariupol alone. There was hope that more of the estimated 160,000 civilians trapped in that city would be evacuated on Thursday, with Russia agreeing to allow a humanitarian corridor and Ukraine sending about 40 buses in to take people out. But previous corridors have collapsed, with both sides blaming the other for violating ceasefires.

Russia is taking heavy losses in the face of a much tougher Ukrainian resistance than many expected. A NATO official estimated that between 7,0000 and 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in just over a month, but Moscow dismisses the tally as an attempt to demoralize Russian forces. Russian officials say the country has lost fewer than 1,400 troops in Ukraine.

Crane-operator-turned soldier Andriy Rogalski said he believed Putin's war was a tragedy for both Ukrainians and Russians, and that the Russian president was behaving more like a mafia boss than a world leader.

Second Lieutenant Tatiana Chornovol has front-line experience of Russia's military capabilities. A former politician and a mother of two, Chonovol is now tasked with taking out Russian tanks.

""The Russians are fighting stupidly,"" she told CBS News. ""They don't have a strategy or tactics, they're falling into the same traps, and their commanders are just pushing them to advance.""

More than 4 million people have fled from Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion on February 24, according to the United Nations. U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet says 1,189 civilian deaths have been confirmed, including 98 children, but her agency says the true toll is much higher.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-us-uk-say-putin-misjudged-invasion-regrouping-donbas/
