Amid India's intensifying its outreach to the US Capitol, the Co-Chair of the Senate Caucus, Senator John Cornyn, who has so far been critical of abstaining itself from the UN Security Council votes on the issue of Russia, welcomed India's remarks on the issue.

Welcome response by our friends: condemns killings in Ukraine's Bucha in apparent hardening of stance, Cornyn said in a tweet as he tagged a story of India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations T S Trimurti in which he condemned the Russian killings in the Ukrainian city of Bucha.

Recent reports of civilian killings in Bucha are deeply disturbing. We unequivocally condemn these killings and support the call for an independent investigation, Trimurti told the UN Security Council on Tuesday.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in his remarks in Lok Sabha also condemned the killings in Bucha.

I want to say that we are deeply disturbed by the reports. We strongly condemn the killings that have taken place there. This is an extremely serious matter and we support the call for an independent investigation, he said.

Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick said he met with the ambassador to urge the Indian government to stand with the US in supporting its friend and ally and to oppose Putin's murder machine.

We discussed ways we can bring India closer to the US via a comprehensive bilateral agreement to include defensive weapons, energy security and food security so that India can permanently sever any and all ties with Russia, the Congressman said.
