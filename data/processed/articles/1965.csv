Air raid sirens were raised across the country late last night as Russian Kalibr cruise missile explosions were reported at strategic positions in the northwestern city of Lutsk, as well as Kharkiv, Zhytomyr, Rivne and Kyiv.

Two missile strikes were reported within 15 minutes of each other in Lutsk, Volyn oblast, around 10:30pm last night, before local authorities confirmed a major oil depot had been set ablaze.

Videos and images circulating on social media appear to show a huge fire raging at the site of the depot, as the Volyn oblast's military chief Yuriy Pohulyayko warned citizens to remain in their shelters.

Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko said the missile strikes were part of a new Russian strategy to take out Ukrainian oil and petrol reserves as the invasion entered its fifth week.

It is not yet clear whether anyone was killed in the strikes.

Mayor of Lutsk Ihor Polishchuk echoed the sentiments of military chief Pohulyayko and implored residents to stay indoors and refrain from filming the incident.

'Dear citizens of Luhansk and residents of the community! Stay in the shelters. Please do not publish photos and videos of the explosions and other information!' the mayor said in a Facebook post last night.

Videos circulating on social media showed an enormous fireball erupting from the oil depot in the wake of the missile strike, and the blaze could be seen on the horizon from miles away.

Lutsk lies roughly 75 miles north of Lviv, one of Ukraine's foremost western cities which was hit in a similar rocket attack just one day prior.

That attack saw several missiles rain down on oil and fuel tankers, and was confirmed yesterday by Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov.

A chemical smell lingered in Lyiv on Sunday as firefighters trained hoses on flames and black smoke poured from oil storage tanks hit in the attack.

Five people were injured in the explosions, though no one was killed.

'The third strike threw me to the ground, which was moving as if an earthquake was in progress,' said security guard Yaroslav Prokopiv.

Lviv, a Unesco world heritage city, has been somewhat of a safe haven for tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees fleeing fighting in the east of the country.

It had been mostly untouched by the war, but the 720,000 residents were urged to stay indoors or seek shelter after Saturday's depot attack.

Two hours after the warning was issued, three more missiles rained down on a factory used for repairing tanks, anti-aircraft systems and radar stations.

The plant stands behind a high-security roadblock in a densely populated district in the south-east of the city, but miraculously there were no deaths.

The new Russian tactic comes as the Kremlin's troops remain stalled outside Kyiv, though fighting has raged in the suburbs in recent days and fresh missile strikes have rattled the St Sophia Cathedral close to the city centre.

The 1,000-year-old UNESCO world heritage site that is the heart of Ukrainian spiritual and national identity, and has stirred fresh anger in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In his daily video address yesterday, Zelensky angrily warned Moscow that it was sowing a deep hatred for Russia among Ukrainians.

Lutsk is located about 120 kilometers north of Lviv, one of the first cities in western Ukraine to be hit by a similar rocket attack just a day earlier.

As a consequence of this attack, several rockets fell on oil tankers and tankers, which was confirmed yesterday by Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov.

Zelenskyy hints at openness to compromise on eastern Ukraine

Ukraine is prepared to consider a compromise on contested areas in the country’s east, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said, ahead of another round of talks set for Tuesday.

“I realise that it’s impossible to force Russia to fully leave the territory. It could lead to World War III. I understand completely. I’m fully aware of it,” he said. “That is why I’m saying, yes, this is a compromise: Go back to where it all started and then we’ll try to resolve the issue of Donbas, the complex issue of Donbas.”

Zelenskyy added the only way to end the war was a face-to-face meeting with Russia’s leader, a possibility Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed earlier.

Russia to study video of alleged mistreatment of prisoners

The Kremlin has said Russian investigators will look into a video circulated on social media that purported to show Ukrainian forces mistreating captured Russian soldiers.

The footage shared on Sunday shows five of the prisoners tied up and lying on the ground being beaten by soldiers who are likely Ukrainian. Three other captives are shot in their legs without provocation.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the video contained “monstrous images” and needed to be legally assessed, and that those who took part in what he described as torture needed to be held responsible.

Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said the video could not be taken at face value. Military spokesperson Oleksander Motuzyanyk said the veracity of the footage could not be verified.

Biden says ‘I make no apologies’ for Putin remarks

United States President Joe Biden has said he is “not walking anything back” after his weekend comment that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”.

He dismissed claims that he was calling for regime change in Moscow. “I wasn’t articulating a policy change,” he said. “I was expressing the moral outrage that I felt toward this man.”

The remark about Putin, which came at the end of a speech in Warsaw, stirred controversy in the United States and among some allies in Western Europe.

“This is just stating a simple fact, that this kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable,” Biden said.

Workers say Russian soldiers disturbed radioactive dust in Chernobyl

Russian soldiers who seized the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster have driven their armoured vehicles without radiation protection through a highly toxic zone called the “Red Forest”, kicking up clouds of radioactive dust, workers at the site said.

Two sources told Reuters soldiers in the convoy did not use any anti-radiation gear. One employee said that was “suicidal” for the soldiers because the radioactive dust they inhaled was likely to cause internal radiation in their bodies.

The Red Forest is the most radioactively contaminated part of the zone around Chernobyl, about 100 kilometres north of Kyiv.

Ukraine says it has ‘proof’ of use of banned weapons

Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova has said Ukraine has proof Russian forces used banned cluster bombs in two southern regions of the country.

“We have proof of the [use] of cluster bombes in the Odesa region and in the Kherson area,” Venediktova told journalists. “I can only mention instances where I have very concrete proof, for example … when I have (bomb) fragments or soil samples and analyses.”

Cluster bombs spread dozens of tiny explosive charges across an area, some of which may not immediately explode and in effect become anti-personnel mines that pose a threat to civilians long after a conflict ends.

Pressure groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also said they collected proof of the use of cluster bombs in areas where civilians were present.

US intelligence suggests ‘environmental’ factor sickened Abramovich: Reuters

A US official who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity has said that intelligence suggests the sickening of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators was due to an environmental factor, not poisoning.

“The intelligence highly suggests this was environmental,” the source said, adding: “not poisoning”. They declined to elaborate further.

The account contradicts an earlier report by the Wall Street Journal and investigative outlet Bellingcat saying Abramovich and the negotiators had suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv.

EU countries look to share effort of hosting Ukrainian refugees

Germany has called for a more even distribution of Ukrainian refugees in the European Union, after some 3.8 million people fled war on their country and crossed into the 27-nation bloc.

“We need to more actively distribute refugees within the EU and show solidarity by taking in refugees,” German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told reporters in Brussels, where interior ministers of all EU countries met to discuss the situation.

The country, the biggest in the bloc with more than 80 million people, says it has registered more than 270,000 Ukrainian refugees, compared with some 30,000 who have entered France, the second-biggest member.

The ministers discussed sharing information and synchronising databases, as well as transporting refugees further west in the EU.

Ukrainian negotiators, Russian oligarch suffered suspected poisoning: WSJ

Ukrainian peace negotiators and Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Symptoms included red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands, the sources said, adding that they blamed the suspected attack on hard-liners in Moscow who want to sabotage talks to end the war in Ukraine.

Abramovich and the Ukrainian negotiators, who include Crimean Tatar lawmaker Rustem Umerov, have since improved and their lives aren’t in danger, WSJ reported.

The Russian oligarch became involved in attempts to end the war despite longstanding links to President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from the American newspaper.

UN chief appeals for humanitarian ceasefire

Guterres says he has directed the world body’s aid chief, Martin Griffiths, “to explore with the parties involved” the possibility of a humanitarian ceasefire in Ukraine.

“Since the beginning of the Russian invasion one month ago, the war has led to the senseless loss of thousands of lives, the displacement of 10 million people, mainly women and children, the systematic destruction of essential infrastructure and skyrocketing food and energy prices worldwide – this must stop,” he said at the UN’s headquarters in New York.

“But let’s be clear, the solution to this humanitarian tragedy is not humanitarian, it is political,” Guterres added.

“I am therefore appealing for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to allow for progress in serious political negotiations aimed at reaching a peace agreement based on the principles of the United Nations charter.”

Guterres said a cessation of hostilities would also allow for “essential humanitarian aid to be delivered and enable civilians to move around safely”.

“It will save lives, prevent suffering and protect civilians,” he added.

EU seeks end to golden passport schemes, halt in sales of visas to Russians

The European Union’s executive arm has called on the bloc’s member states to end national programmes to sell citizenship to investors, also known as golden passport schemes, and urged them to suspend the sale of visas to Russians and Belarusians.

The move by the European Commission follows a new push from the European Parliament to shrink and regulate the multi-billion-euro citizenship and visa industry, which the EU has long considered a security risk.

It urged an immediate end to existing national programmes for the sale of passports. Currently, only Malta, Cyprus and Bulgaria have such schemes and they have all committed to ending them.

Brussels also said governments should check whether sanctioned individuals were holding a golden passport or visa they had issued.

Several EU countries run golden visa schemes, including Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy.

European values are not for sale. We consider that the sale of citizenship through 'golden passports' is illegal under EU law and poses serious risks to our security. All EU countries concerned should end their investor citizenship schemes immediately.#StandWithUkraine pic.twitter.com/oxITL8u5an — European Commission 🇪🇺 (@EU_Commission) March 28, 2022

Ukraine’s prosecutor general accuses Russia of ‘genocide’ in Mariupol

Ukraine’s prosecutor general has said Russian forces’ alleged indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Mariupol and the reported forced deportation of thousands of Ukrainians from the city to Russia amount to “genocide”.

“What is happening in Mariupol is not just war crimes,” Iryna Venedyktova said during a news briefing.

“War has rules, and this is beyond rules. I look at it from the viewpoint of considering it genocide when an entire city is taken hostage,” she added.

Venedyktova also alleged that under the disguise of “evacuation”, thousands of Mariupol residents – including 2,000 children – had been forcibly deported to Russia in buses and had their passports confiscated.

“More than 2,000 children have been deported from Mariupol alone,” she said. “This is more than a war crime.”

Russian shares slump as all trading resumes

Russian shares have slumped as its stock market resumed trading of all companies after a monthlong halt.

The benchmark MOEX index slid by 2.2 percent after the Moscow Exchange reopened for all of its several hundred listed companies, but with restrictions still in place to limit volatility.

The last full trading session in Moscow was on February 25, a day after the index tumbled by a third after Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine.

Prices whipsawed last week when the exchange tentatively reopened for two days of limited trading, with investors allowed to trade only 33 of the MOEX index’s 50 companies.

Some restrictions have remained in place to prevent another big selloff. The daily session is shortened to four hours and there is a ban on short-selling, which essentially involves betting on stock prices to go down. Foreigners also are unable to sell shares until Friday.

Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper suspends activities

Russia’s top independent newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, says it is suspending its online and print activities until the end of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.

Novaya Gazeta, which has already removed material from its website on Russia’s military action in Ukraine to comply with a new media law, said it had received a second warning from state communications regulator Roskomnadzor on Monday about its reporting, prompting it to pause operations.

The newspaper’s editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov was a co-winner of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize. Muratov announced last week that he was planning to donate his Nobel award to be auctioned to raise funds for Ukrainian refugees.

The Kremlin strictly limits how media outlets can describe events in Ukraine. Several other Russian media outlets have already opted to suspend operations rather than face heavy restrictions on what they can report, and Moscow has also blocked multiple foreign news outlets.

Russia, Ukraine likely hold differing views on concept of neutrality: Analyst

Zachary Paikin, a researcher at the Center for European Policy Studies, says Moscow and Kyiv likely hold differing views on what it means for Ukraine to be a neutral state.

“There’s the question of whether or not neutrality means being able to join NATO or not, versus being able to join the EU or not,” he told Al Jazeera.

“The central theme in the lead up to this invasion was Ukraine’s status in NATO, and that’s how Russia more or less explicitly chose to frame neutrality during those talks over previous months. But membership in the EU is just as much of a sticking point,” he said.

“Ukraine joining the EU poses certain problems for Russia, because the EU is more of a Western political construct and Russia insists that Ukraine forms part of the Russian world, and EU nominally has a common foreign and security policy as well. This would very much run up against the concept of neutrality from Moscow’s perspective.”

31 fires reported near Chernobyl nuclear plant

Authorities in Ukraine have reported 31 fires covering 10,111 hectares (24,985 acres) near the Russian-occupied Chernobyl nuclear plant.

Lyudmyla Denisova, a Ukrainian official, said the fires were “causing increased levels of radioactive particle pollution in the air” and said it was not possible to extinguish the blazes due to the presence of Russian troops.

Hollywood stars show support for Ukraine on the Oscars carpet

Several celebrities have walked the Oscars’ red carpet wearing blue ribbons to show support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s invasion.

Oscar-nominated songwriter Diane Warren, last year’s Oscar winner for best supporting actress Youn Yuh-jung and “Halloween” star Jamie Lee Curtis were among those sporting the ribbons.

Benedict Cumberbatch and Jason Momoa wore a button and pocket square in the colours of the Ukrainian flag, respectively.

“It’s really, really strange to be here in tuxedos, knowing what’s going on in Ukraine,” said Emile Sherman, producer of the film “Power of the Dog”.

“It’s not an easy time trying to absorb what’s happening in that part of the world, while still celebrating the achievements of everyone who made this movie and all the movies here tonight.”

‘It would be ridiculous if it wasn’t so funny’: Zelenskyy slams Russian censorship

Ukraine’s president has criticised Russia’s media watchdog after it tried to stop the publication of an interview in which he said Kyiv was prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Moscow.

The interview was conducted by Russian journalists from the Meduza news website, the Dozhd television station, and the liberal business paper Kommersant.

Roskomnadzor, the Russian media watchdog, has urged Russian media not to publish the interview and has launched an investigation into the circumstances under which it had been organised.

“Imagine, they were frightened there in Moscow because of my interview to Russian journalists, to those who can afford to tell the truth,” Zelenskyy said.

“It would be ridiculous if it wasn’t so funny. They destroyed the freedom of speech in their state and they are trying to destroy it in the neighbouring state. They portray themselves as global players and they themselves are afraid of a relatively short conversation with several journalists.”

Ukraine calls for measures to ‘demilitarise’ Chernobyl nuclear plant

A senior Ukrainian official has accused Russia of “irresponsible” acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe, and urged the United Nations to dispatch a mission to assess the risks.

Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian forces were “militarising” the exclusion zone around the station, the site of the world’s worst civil nuclear accident in 1986.

Russian forces, she said, were transporting large amounts of old and poorly maintained weapons, creating a risk of damaging the containment vessel constructed around the station’s wrecked fourth reactor.

Russian forces were also preventing firefighters from bringing large numbers of fires in the zone under control, she said.

“In the context of nuclear safety, the irresponsible and unprofessional actions of Russian servicemen present a very serious threat not just to Ukraine but to hundreds of millions of Europeans,” Vereshchuk said on her Telegram account.

“We therefore demand that the UN Security Council adopt immediate measures to demilitarise the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl station as well as dispatching a special mission to eliminate the risks of any repeat of the Chernobyl accident resulting from the actions of Russian occupying forces,” she said.

Biden says he was not calling for ‘regime change’ in Russia

US President Biden has said he was not calling for “regime change” in Russia when he said President Putin “cannot remain in power”.

When asked by a reporter in Washington, DC, whether he was calling for “regime change” in Moscow, Biden said: “No”.

Biden made the initial remarks last week during a speech in Poland, in which he also called Putin a “butcher” and said the world must prepare for a “long fight ahead”. Several US officials have since stressed that Biden was not calling for “regime change” in Moscow.

NATO not seeking ‘regime change’ in Russia: Scholz

The NATO military alliance is not aiming to remove Putin from power, German Chancellor Scholz has said, a day after President Biden branded Putin a “butcher” and said he “cannot remain in power”.

It “is not the objective of NATO, nor that of the US president”, Scholz told German public broadcaster ARD.

“I’ve had the chance to talk at length with him at the White House and we have also discussed these questions,” he added.

Germany eyes buying missile defence system

Germany is considering purchasing a missile defence system to shield against a potential attack from Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said.

“This is certainly one of the issues we are discussing, and for good reason,” he told public broadcaster ARD when asked whether Germany might buy a defence system.

“We need to be aware that we have a neighbour who is prepared to use violence to enforce their interests,” he added.

In the same interview, the chancellor also addressed Germany’s decision to become more energy independent and said it would have to accept higher energy costs.

Scholz said it would not help to keep Germany’s nuclear power plants running longer, but he noted that the timing of the country’s plan to exit from coal was dependent on how quickly it made progress in expanding renewable energy.

Russia blockading Ukraine’s Black Sea coast: UK

Russia is maintaining a distant blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast which is effectively isolating Ukraine from international maritime trade, the British Ministry of Defence has said.

Russian naval forces are also continuing to conduct sporadic missile raids against targets throughout Ukraine, the ministry added.

Zelenskyy considers Russian neutrality demand

Ukraine’s president says his government is “carefully” considering a Russian demand of Ukrainian neutrality, a key point of contention as negotiators for both sides prepare for a fresh round of talks aimed at ending the brutal month-long war.

“This point of the negotiations is understandable to me and it is being discussed, it is being carefully studied,” Zelenskyy said during an interview with several independent Russian news organisations.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country’s forces had defeated Russian troops and recaptured Irpin, a town on the northwestern edge of Kyiv that has seen fierce street battles. But he warned that the struggle for the capital was not over.

“Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, regaining control over Ukrainian territory,” Zelensky said Monday night. “Irpin was liberated. Well done! ... However, it is too early to talk about security in this part of our region.”

Russian troops continued to control the region north of Kyiv and had significant resources and manpower, Zelensky said, even if Ukraine’s forces had destroyed or forced them to abandon a large amount of equipment.

“The situation everywhere remains tense,” Zelensky said. “This is a ruthless war against our nation, against our people, against our children.”

Ukraine’s deputy defense minister, Hanna Maliar, warned that Russia was still trying to build a corridor around Kyiv to block supply routes that bring in arms, ammunition and food.

“We must speak honestly: The enemy is not letting up attempts to seize Kyiv after all,” Maliar said on Ukrainian television. “Taking Kyiv essentially means taking Ukraine. So that is their goal.”

As Russian and Ukrainian officials assembled in Turkey for a fresh round of negotiations set to begin Tuesday, Zelensky said his nation was ready to declare its neutrality, one of Russia’s core demands.

But even as Zelensky signaled he was willing to let go of aspirations to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization — a key concession considering pursuit of membership is enshrined in the country’s constitution — he stressed that any deal must be voted on by Ukrainians in a national referendum held without Russian troops in Ukraine.

In a separate video address ahead of negotiations, to be held in person in Istanbul, Zelensky said his nation was seeking peace and “the restoration of normal life.”

After four prior rounds of negotiations — the last one via video — the path to peace or even a cease-fire was unclear in a war that has killed more than 1,150 civilians, displaced millions of Ukrainians and made Russia an international pariah.

Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak, who has been part of negotiations and spoken optimistically about them, struck a more somber tone Monday.

“Again, total missile strikes at Ukraine. Lutsk, Kharkiv, Zhytomyr, Rivne. Every day, more and more rockets. Mariupol under carpet bombing,” he tweeted. “Russia no longer has a language, humanism, civilization. Only rockets, bombs and attempts to wipe Ukraine off the face of the earth. Does Europe really like it?”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that, from Moscow’s point of view at least, “no significant progress” had been made in peace talks thus far. He said in-person talks would allow the two sides to move forward “in a more concentrated way.”

President Biden, questioned at the White House about his comment over the weekend that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” said he was speaking in a personal capacity, not articulating any official change in U.S. policy.

“I’m not walking anything back,” he said. “I was expressing the moral outrage that I felt toward this man. I wasn’t then, nor am I now, articulating a policy change.”

In a news briefing, Peskov said that Biden’s statement “makes us worry” and that Russian officials would continue to closely monitor the U.S. president’s statements.

Biden, who criticized President Trump’s careless rhetoric during the 2020 campaign and argued that the words of a president matter, bristled at the “ridiculous” suggestion that his own comment in Warsaw could be seen as a statement of policy given how careful his administration has been to avoid a direct confrontation with Putin.

“Nobody believes I was talking about taking down [Putin],” he said. “The last thing I want to do is engage in a land war, a nuclear war with Russia.”

In the last week, U.S. and British intelligence have said that Russia has scaled back its forces on the outskirts of Kyiv in the face of fierce fighting from Ukrainian defenses.

“Russian forces have not only ceased to make any advances toward the city, but ... are making really no efforts on the ground to advance on the city,” a senior U.S. Defense official said Monday.

The British Ministry of Defense said in a daily report Monday that logistical shortages have been compounded by a continued lack of momentum and low morale among the Russian military.

Still, the Kyiv regional military administration said Monday that the western suburbs of Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel and Makariv had been pounded by constant attacks from Russian forces, with multiple shellings of housing estates and social infrastructure over the last 24 hours.

The mayor of Irpin said Monday that Ukrainians had defeated Russian troops. “Our Irpin has been liberated from Moscow’s evil!!!” Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn posted on Telegram. “Glory to Ukraine! Glory to her defenders!”

He also urged residents not to return, noting that the situation was still dangerous with shelling and mines.

“We understand that there will be more attacks on our town and we will defend it courageously,” he said.

Analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War assessed in a report Monday that the Kremlin had not redeployed Russian combat power away from Kyiv to support operations in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Russian conscription efforts, which Ukrainian intelligence expects to begin Friday, are unlikely to provide enough combat power to relaunch major offensive operations any time soon.

“Russia’s pool of available well-trained replacements remains low and new conscripts will require months to reach even a minimum standard of readiness,” the report said.

In the south and east, British intelligence said Russia had gained ground as it continued its all-out assault and attempt to capture the strategic southern port of Mariupol. Conquering the city would help Russian forces establish a corridor across Ukraine’s south to the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014 but which has no land connection to Russia.

In an interview with independent Russian journalists Sunday, Zelensky singled out the city as the site of some of the most horrific consequences of Russia’s invasion. Still under Ukrainian control, it has seen the majority of its 430,000 residents flee while those who remain struggle to find food and water in neighborhoods of rubble. How much longer the city can continue to hold out against relentless shelling and lack of humanitarian relief is increasingly open to question.

Mariupol is “littered with corpses — no one is removing them — Russian soldiers and Ukrainian citizens,” Zelensky said in the interview. It was conducted in Russian with three journalists based outside Russia and one in Moscow.

He also held out the possibility of neutrality for Ukraine, a concession he has previously broached but addressed more emphatically this time.

“Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state — we are ready to go for it. This is the most important point,” Zelensky said, adding that the neutrality move would require a national referendum. He said negotiators would refuse Russian demands for the demilitarization and “de-Nazification” of Ukraine, ideas Zelensky called “incomprehensible.”

The Kremlin, which has banned media in Russia from describing its invasion as a “war,” warned news outlets not to publish Zelensky’s remarks.

Putin’s stranglehold of Russian news outlets tightened Monday as the nation’s last major independent newspaper critical of the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine announced it was suspending publication after receiving a second warning from government censors.

The Novaya Gazeta, whose editor in chief, Dmitry Muratov, was awarded the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for his “efforts to safeguard freedom of expression,” said that it would cease publishing in print and online until the end of the “special operation in Ukraine.”

Amid the ongoing stalemate, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Monday that there would be no safe passage via negotiated humanitarian corridors for civilians seeking to flee battered cities.

Vereshchuk, who typically announces evacuation routes daily, blamed Russian “provocations” for the closing of safe corridors. Ukraine has accused Russia of blocking routes and abducting humanitarian volunteers, including members of the Red Cross.

In total, the war has created 3.8 million Ukrainian refugees and displaced millions more internally since Russia launched its invasion Feb. 24.

Russian forces have since been stuck outside Kyiv, without a single breakthrough in penetrating the heart of the capital. But they have kept up a steady assault by air, with more explosions reported on the city’s outskirts Monday morning and air-raid sirens sounding in the afternoon. It was unknown if missiles hit targets or if they were intercepted by Ukrainian forces.

In a sign of the city’s struggle to prevail, schools in Kyiv reopened Monday for online instruction but with what municipal official Valentyn Mondryivsky said was a new goal of providing kids with “psychological support” amid the war. Mondryivsky said homework was being limited in order to avoid putting additional stress upon students.

In the northeast, local officials said Ukraine had regained control of the towns of Trostyanets and Boromlya. The towns are about 35 miles south of the city of Sumy, which has been surrounded and shelled by Russian troops.

In hard-hit Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Monday that 1,410 structures, the vast majority of them residential buildings, had been destroyed in the war.

Loud booms were heard overnight. Attacks appeared to target Kharkiv’s outskirts.

Terekhov said one-third of Kharkiv’s prewar population of 1.5 million had left. Many more remain huddled in subway stations that have become bomb shelters.

Most evacuees around the country make their way to western Ukraine, which has suffered less violence than the south and east. Many eventually land here in Lviv before crossing the western border into Poland.

The Lviv area has been largely free from Russian assault, despite near-daily air-raid alarms, frequent funerals for soldiers and military checkpoints on roads leading to and from the city.

But it hasn’t been fully out of the crosshairs. Russian missiles have targeted western Ukraine four times since March 13, hitting military or fuel depots, including a strike on fuel tanks Saturday that was the closest attack to Lviv since the war began. Fires raged at the site for more than 14 hours before being extinguished. Authorities reported no fatalities and a handful of minor injuries.

World & Nation Full coverage of the war in Ukraine Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced that the United Nations had asked Martin Griffiths, its undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, to immediately explore with Ukrainian and Russian authorities “possible agreements and arrangements for a humanitarian cease-fire.”

“A cessation of hostilities will allow essential humanitarian aid to be delivered and enable civilians to move around safely,” Guterres said at a news conference outside the Security Council in New York. “It will save lives, prevent suffering and protect civilians.”
