Terrifying footage taken from high-rise apartments shows the moment of the explosion, which is believed to have struck an airfield and ammo dump in Chuguev.

12 It is believed the explosion may have been caused by a vacuum bomb

Reports suggest the Russians' target was a weapons depot in the city.

The blast wave from the explosion causes those filming to jump back.

Several clips have been shared online, some with the sound of aircraft, suggesting the airfield may have been bombed from the air.

There was speculation the blast may have been caused by the deadly vacuum bombs being deployed by the Russians.

Another blast was heard in the Sumy region in the northeast yesterday while Ukrainians claimed to have found parts of a vacuum bomb at Okhtyrka.

The killer weapon uses the oxygen of the surrounding air to produce a high-temperature explosion.

Western officials fear Putin will turn to total war and his attacks will also include other weapons such as the horrifying ""hail"" launchers, the BM-21 Grads.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said if Russia was using vacuum bombs against Ukrainian civilians it would ""potentially be a war crime"".

The explosion comes after at least ten people were killed and dozens injured in a Russian missile strike on the besieged city.

Kharkiv is the second-largest city in Ukraine and has seen some of the most vicious fighting of the invasion.

The bombs fell against after dozens of people were killed and wounded yesterday in seemingly indiscriminate shelling of civilians.

Footage showed the strike which turned the city's Freedom Square to rubble and devastated the nearby administration office.

Pictures show the aftermath as firefighters were left pulling bodies from inside the bombed-out building.

Zelenskyy accused Russia of war crimes after the blitz and said the attack on Kharkiv was ""state terrorism"".

Kharkiv has been a target for Russian forces since Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine last Thursday.

""Kharkiv and Kyiv are now Russia's most important objectives. The terror aims to break us and break our resistance,"" said Zelensky.

""They advance on the capital in the same way as on Kharkiv. This is why the defence of the capital today is the key priority for the state,"" he added in the video.

Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said: ""Barbaric Russian missile strikes on the central Freedom Square and residential districts of Kharkiv. Putin is unable to break Ukraine down.

""He commits more war crimes out of fury, murders innocent civilians. The world can and must do more.

It came after horrific videos emerged from Ukraine's second city showing apparently indiscriminate bombing of civilians.

It comes as...

Footage showed a barrage of rockets or cluster bombs falling over residential areas in the city which has a large Russia-friendly population.

The midday raid left at least 11 dead, including three children - and other shelling also destroyed a school.

Kharkiv has been holding out staunchly against the Russian invaders even though it is just 25 miles from the border.

But this resistance appears to have led to Vladimir Putin unleashing a devastating blitz on the city's 1.5million people.

Regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said: ""Russian occupiers continue to use heavy weaponry against the civilian population.""

It came amid chilling warnings that Russian generals have been ordered to take the city at all costs.

Zelenskyy also spoke in a late-night address as he again accused Russia of war crimes.

The hero leader said: ""Today, Russian forces brutally fired on Kharkiv from jet artillery. It was clearly a war crime.

Speaking on GMB, General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, former NATO deputy supreme commander, also accused Russia of using devastating vacuum bombs.

He said: ""They're now into a bitter fight for the cities. This now turns to a very bitter different phase of the war.

""It must be exposed to the Russians. They're just getting propaganda, they need to be told the truth so that they understand what's being done in their name.

""They're using thermobaric weapons - it creates a fuel-air mixture, it sucks the oxygen out of the air around it, it creates a shockwave, it's highly destructive, affects anyone sheltering in cellars, its incredibly disruptive, that's why it's banned.

""Kharkiv is a peaceful city, there are peaceful residential areas, no military facilities.

""Dozens of eyewitness accounts prove that this is not a single false volley, but deliberate destruction of people: the Russians knew where they were shooting.

""There will definitely be an international tribunal for this crime ‚Äî it's a violation of all conventions. No one in the world will forgive you for killing peaceful Ukrainian people.""

""In terms of humane ways of fighting the war, they're out on a different scale""

Ukraine's army says it fought off several attempts by Russian forces to storm the outskirts of Kyiv overnight with the capital also hit by three missile strikes.

Despite the Ukrainian's success in repelling all the attacks on Kyiv so far, US officials fear Putin's forces could still prevail, after re-thinking their tactics.

""They have been slowed and they have been frustrated by their lack of progress on Kyiv,"" said one unnamed official, CNN reports.

""And one of the things that could result is a re-evaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt in both the size and the scale of their targeting of Kyiv.""

The Russians unleashed a devastating missile and rocket bombardment ‚Äì as two-faced Kremlin officials met with a Ukrainian delegation to talk about peace.

With such an indiscriminate assault, it raises new fears amid the escalating violence in Ukraine - which has killed scores of civilians and a number of children.

""The Russian occupiers fired en masse on residential areas of Kharkiv. Dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded Ukrainian citizens,"" said the general staff of Ukraine.

Ukraine's former president Petro Poroshenko said: ""We will never forget and forgive this crime against humanity - the showy executions of our Kharkiv by the Russians.

Russian forces seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe after a building at the complex was set ablaze during intense fighting with Ukrainian defenders, Ukrainian authorities said on Friday (4 March).

Fears of a potential nuclear disaster at the Zaporizhzhia plant had spread alarm across world capitals, before authorities said the fire in a building identified as a training centre, had been extinguished.

A fire had broken out in a training building at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe during intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces, Ukraine‚Äôs state emergency service had said earlier on Friday.

US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said there was no indication of elevated radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which provides more than a fifth of total electricity generated in Ukraine.

A video feed from the plant verified by Reuters showed shelling and smoke rising near a building at the plant compound.

The footage shot at night showed one building aflame, and a volley of incoming shells, before a large candescent ball lit up the sky, exploding beside a car park and sending smoke billowing across the compound.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi blamed Russia for having shelled the nuclear power plant.

‚ÄúFor the first time in history, a country has committed nuclear terrorism‚Äù, he said in a video.

He reminded that Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors and the Russian army action could force ‚Äúthe evacuation of Europe‚Äù.

The mayor of the nearby town of Energodar about 550 km (342 miles) southeast of Kyiv said fierce fighting and ‚Äúcontinuous enemy shelling‚Äù had caused casualties in the area, without providing details.

Thousands of people are believed to have been killed or wounded and more than 1 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin last Thursday launched the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

Early reports of the incident at the power plant sent financial markets in Asia spiralling, with stocks tumbling and oil prices surging further.

‚ÄúMarkets are worried about nuclear fallout. The risk is that there is a miscalculation or over-reaction and the war prolongs,‚Äù said Vasu Menon, executive director of investment strategy at OCBC Bank.

Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, about 100 km north of Kyiv, which spewed radioactive waste over much of Europe when it melted down in 1986. The Zaporizhzhia plant is a different and safer type, some analysts said.

US President Joe Biden spoke with Zelenskiy to get an update on the situation at the plant.

‚ÄúPresident Biden joined President Zelenskiy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,‚Äù the White House said.

Energy Secretary Granholm said on Twitter the reactors at Zaporizhzhia were ‚Äúprotected by robust containment structures‚Äù and were being ‚Äúsafely shut down‚Äù.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a tweet that it was ‚Äúaware of reports of shelling‚Äù at the power plant and was in contact with Ukrainian authorities.

Fighting rages, sanctions mount

On Thursday, Russia and Ukraine negotiators agreed to the need for humanitarian corridors to help civilians escape and to deliver medicines and food to the areas where fighting was the fiercest.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said a temporary halt to fighting in select locations was also possible.

The negotiators will meet again next week, the Belarusian state news agency Belta quoted Podolyak as saying.

Only one Ukrainian city, the southern port of Kherson, has fallen to Russian forces since the invasion was launched on 24 February, but Russian forces continue to surround and attack other cities. Mariupol, the main port on the Sea of Azov, was surrounded and under heavy bombardment. Water and power was cut off, and officials say they cannot evacuate the wounded.

Video posted on Twitter from Mariupol, and verified by Reuters, showed parked vehicles burning while non-stop firing reverberated around surrounding apartment blocks.

The northeastern city of Kharkiv has been under attack since the start of the invasion, but defenders are holding out in the heavily shelled city.

While no major assault has been launched on Kyiv, the capital has been shelled, and Russian forces unleashed devastating firepower to break resistance in the outlying town of Borodyanka.

In Washington, a US defense official said Russian troops were still 25 km from Kyiv city centre. Earlier on Thursday, the British Ministry of Defence said a huge Russia convoy rumbling southwards toward Kyiv, was advancing slowly, partly due to resistance, but also due to logisitical issues.

The United States and Britain announced sanctions on more Russian oligarchs on Thursday, following on from EU measures, as they ratcheted up the pressure on the Kremlin.

More companies including Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Google, footwear giant Nike and Swedish home furnishing firm IKEA shut down or reduced operations in Russia as trade restrictions and supply constraints added to political pressure.

Sanctions have ‚Äúhad a profound impact already,‚Äù Biden said.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ‚Äúspecial operation‚Äù that is not designed to occupy territory but to topple the democratically elected government, destroy its neighbour‚Äôs military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. It denies targeting civilians.

Russian human rights activist and former world chess champion Garry Kasparov called on Western countries to eject Russia from the global police agency Interpol, and impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

‚ÄúRussia should be thrown back into the Stone Age to make sure that the oil and gas industry and any other sensitive industries that are vital for survival of the regime cannot function without Western technological support,‚Äù Kasparov said.

What is shelling in war as fire erupts at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant

The Russian shelling of Ukraine has continued in cities with news last night that a nuclear power plant was targeted by invading troops.

A fire broke out at the site of Zaporizhzhia power plant in Energodar, southern Ukraine.

The plant is the largest of its kind in Europe and any potential explosion there has been described as being worse than ""ten times worse than Chernobyl"".

However, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service later reported the fire was in a building outside the plant and has since been extinguished.

When war broke out, Russian forces were expected to sweep through Ukraine far quicker than they have done.

Instead, their advance of the capital of Kyiv is 'slowing' - according to recent reports - and they have also failed to take Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, only around 20 miles from the Russian border.

With this occurring, there appears to have been a trend in which Russian forces are attempting to break resistance by increasing their shelling on key parts of Ukraine, leading to civilians being indiscriminately attacked.

The tactic has been widely used by Russian forces, so what is shelling?

What is shelling in war?

Shelling is a tactic in warfare that involves firing large ‚Äòshells‚Äô full of explosives at your enemies.

The definitions surrounding the words point to exactly that. Shelling is defined by the Oxford Learners‚Äô Dictionary as ‚Äúthe firing of shells from large guns‚Äù, while a shell is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as ‚Äúa container, usually with a pointed end, that is filled with explosives and shot from a large gun‚Äù.

In other words, shelling is also often known as artillery fire, big guns launching huge projectiles at enemy positions from far away.

Reports of the continued shelling on Ukrainian cities suggest that Russia is launching bombs indiscriminately, rather than just targeting military positions.

As a result, Ukraine's State Emergency Service has said more than 2,000 civilians have died since war broke out. This has not been verified and the UN human rights office said it had recorded 227 deaths, with 525 injured.

The tactic can be particularly brutal and indiscriminate because, with the shot fired often from a large distance and packed with high explosives, they can easily hit people and things they weren‚Äôt intended for.

Where in Ukraine has been shelled?

Kyiv and Kharkiv have seen particularly intense shelling, as have the cities of Mariupol and Chernihiv.

Despite ensuring casualties would be avoided, Vladimir Putin's armed forces have resorted to the devastating shelling of Ukrainian cities, driving an estimated one million people across the border in neighbouring Poland, Romania, Hungary and Moldova.

The shelling of Kharkiv has led to much of the cities landmarks being targeted, including the opera house, Freedom Square, university and city hall.

The International Criminal Court has launched an investigation into Putin's shelling of Ukraine, including the alleged use of banned cluster bombs.

Why was the Zaporizhzhia power plant shelled?

Image: via REUTERS) via REUTERS)

A video verified by Reuters showed that the surroundings of the Zaporizhzhia power plant were also bombed by a 'volley of shells' as the mayor of nearby town Energodar saw ""continuous enemy shelling"".

Zaporizhzhia is key to the energy supply of surrounding towns, and while there are no indications that the plant's functions have been affected - no reports of an increase in radiation have emerged - Russian control of the plant is ideal for the invaders.

Outrage and condemnation of the attack were seen across the globe, as people feared another nuclear disaster should the plant be heavily damaged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the assault on the plant, which is now under Russian control, as 'reckless'.

The University of Sydney's School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, David Fletcher, said in a statement: ""The real concern is not a catastrophic explosion as happened at Chernobyl but damage to the cooling system which is required even when the reactor is shut down.""

Kharkiv, a largely Russian-speaking city near the Russian border, has a population of around 1.4 million.

It has been a target for Russian forces since President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine last Thursday.

In Kherson on the Black Sea, where officials had on Tuesday reported Russian checkpoints encircling the city, Russian forces took control of the railway station and the port overnight, city mayor Igor Kolykhayev was quoted by local media.

In Mariupol, a port on the Sea of Azov, more than a hundred people were injured on Tuesday in a Russian fire, the mayor of the city, Vadym Boychenko was quoted as saying by Ukrainian media.

In Borodyanka, 50 kilometres from Kyiv, Russian airstrikes destroyed two residential buildings on Tuesday, according to Ukraine‚Äôs deputy minister of foreign affairs Emine Dzhaparova, who shared a video of the grey buildings partially in ruins, with apartments in flames.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence also said overnight that it feared an attack from Belarus.

‚ÄúBelarusian troops have been put on high alert and are concentrated in areas closest to the border with Ukraine,‚Äù the ministry said in a statement on Facebook.

During the day on Tuesday, Ukrainian intelligence noted ‚Äúsignificant activity‚Äù of aircraft in the border area, and convoys of vehicles carrying food and ammunition were observed there, the statement said.

In view of these movements, Belarus ‚Äúcould probably support the Russian invaders in the Russian-Ukrainian war in the future‚Äù, warned the ministry.

‚ÄúMissile attacks against military and civilian targets‚Äù in Ukraine have been ‚Äúsystematically‚Äù launched from Belarusian territory since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24, the ministry added.

Kharkiv, a largely Russian-speaking city near the Russian border, has a population of around 1.4 million.

Russian forces attack Kyiv

As a street battle with invading Russian forces raged overhead, Kyiv resident Yulia Snitko spent the night cowering in the basement of her apartment block praying for her unborn baby.

Eight months pregnant and with her bulging belly showing through her clothes, she was terrified that each blast or volley of gunfire from an attack on a nearby military facility could send her into labour.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to stay as calm as possible to not cause a premature birth,‚Äù the 32-year-old told AFP on Saturday morning in the Soviet-era bomb shelter.

‚ÄúAt night it was more than one hour of huge explosions, it was very stressful. When I realised what was happening, I was trembling, totally shaking for five minutes.‚Äù

Around her, families huddled together on the cardboard boxes and camping mats they were using as makeshift beds.

On the streets above it was a bright sunny day, but only a handful of civilians were brave enough to queue for emergency food supplies, as Kyiv has been transformed within days into a war zone.

Tanks manoeuvred along the streets as the city, home to three million people, braced for an all-out assault by Russian forces pushing towards it.

The burnt-out wreckage of a Ukrainian military truck still smouldered in the middle of the grand Soviet-era Victory Avenue and soldiers cleared away debris.

Nearby, a Ukrainian soldier commanded an elderly volunteer as he hastily dug a trench in preparation for fresh attacks.

Several servicemen said Russian forces a few kilometres away had been firing barrages of rockets indiscriminately from their feared Grad systems.

The sounds of explosions rumbled in the distance.

‚Äì ‚ÄòWe are not afraid!‚Äô ‚Äì

Suddenly the wail of an air raid siren sounded and the civilians on the street sprinted for the nearest shelter.

City authorities blamed Russian ‚Äúsabotage groups‚Äù for the attacks in the city overnight and said Moscow‚Äôs regular forces were fighting to break in.

Missiles pounded multiple locations around the capital.

One rocket blasted a gaping hole across several floors of an apartment block not far from the city centre sending rubble spewing onto the street below.

Teacher Irina Butyak, 38, has spent two days in the basement of her apartment block sheltering together with some 20 people.

As air raid sirens blared directly overhead, some tried to sleep on mattresses on the ground, some sat on stools chatting.

‚ÄúWe have train tickets for western Ukraine for tomorrow. I don‚Äôt think we will take the train,‚Äù she told AFP.

Buses have stopped running and Kyiv‚Äôs metro has been turned into a giant bomb shelter.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll sit here until we can get to the train station,‚Äù she said.

She was still struggling to digest the nightmare unfolding around her as the city plunged into violence.

‚ÄúWe thought something like this might happen but we were hoping until the end that it wouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe were hoping that common sense and common decency would prevail. Well, it didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Pensioner Anatoly Shayduk could not control his rage at the man ‚Äî Russian President Vladimir Putin ‚Äî who has unleashed this horror.

‚ÄúThis Hitler is trying to seize power,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe are not afraid! If you knew how many young people have already stood up and taken their machine guns! I am 68 years old, but I will take any gun tomorrow and will shoot.‚Äù",https://dailytimes.com.pk/894402/russian-airborne-troops-land-in-ukraines-second-city-kharkiv/
