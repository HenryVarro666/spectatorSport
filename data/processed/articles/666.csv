""In this area, Ukraine is now part of Europe,"" EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said in a statement, adding that Moldova - which also has a Russia-backed breakaway region - was also connected to the grid.

""The EU will continue to support Ukraine in the energy sector, by ensuring the reverse flows of gas to the country and the delivery of energy supplies that are badly needed,"" she said.

EU energy ministers on Feb 28 announced they would hook up the grid of their 27-nation bloc with Ukraine after it disconnected from the Russian electricity network and suffered missile strikes and shelling to its infrastructure.

While the link-up risks blackouts and brownouts happening in parts of the EU, Brussels has presented the move as part of its solidarity with Ukraine, even as it rebuffs Kyiv's pleas for rapid EU membership.

Ukraine’s military says it hit Kherson airport LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian military forces have dealt a punishing blow to the airport in Kherson, which Russian troops had seized early in the war, the General Staff said late Wednesday. It said the Russians were trying to remove any surviving military equipment. Ukraine’s military said it hit the airport on Tuesday. Satellite photos taken afterward by Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by The Associated Press show helicopters and vehicles on fire at the air base. Russia seized the southern port city without a fight in the first days of the war. Control over Kherson allows Russia to restore fresh water supplies to Crimea; Ukraine cut off the water after Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014. The General Staff said Russia’s ground offensive on major Ukrainian cities has largely stalled. Share this -

UNICEF: 55 children flee Ukraine every minute Every minute, an average of 55 children flee Ukraine, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said Wednesday in Geneva. Put another way, a Ukrainian child has become a refugee almost every second since Russian forces invaded on Feb. 24. ""Like all children driven from their homes by war and conflict, Ukrainian children arriving in neighboring countries are at significant risk of family separation, violence, sexual exploitation and trafficking,"" Elder said. ""They are in desperate need of safety, stability and child protection services, especially those who are unaccompanied or have been separated from their families."" 1.5 million children flee war in Ukraine as refugees arrive in more of Europe March 15, 2022 01:43 More than 1.5 million children have evacuated Ukraine in the three weeks since the war began, roughly half of all refugees scattered through the region.

U.S. seeing increased Russian naval activity near Odesa, defense official says The U.S. is seeing increased Russian naval activity in the area around the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, a senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday. The naval force in the northern Black Sea around Odesa includes Russian LSTs — landing ships and surface combatant ships, the official said, adding that Russian ships have been shelling some cities outside Odesa. It’s not clear if the movements are a precursor to a larger amphibious assault, the official continued, characterizing the activity as ""a change to maritime environment."" Citizens in the city, one of the largest in Ukraine, have been girding for an assault by Russian forces, including by filling and moving over 400,000 sandbags, sometimes while breaking out in song. Odesa is home to the country's National Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, and despite the threat of a Russian attack, its orchestra performed an open-air concert on Saturday to support Zelenskyy's call for a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Kremlin calls Biden's comments 'unacceptable and unforgivable' President Joe Biden's characterization of Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""war criminal"" was ""unacceptable and unforgivable,"" a spokesman for the Kremlin said Wednesday. ""We consider unacceptable and unforgivable such rhetoric of the head of the state, whose bombs killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. In a brief exchange with reporters earlier Wednesday, Biden was asked whether he believes Putin is a war criminal. He answered no and then asked the reporter to repeat the question.

Biden on Putin: 'I think he is a war criminal' President Joe Biden on Wednesday called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" for the first time. In a brief exchange with reporters, Biden was asked whether he believes Putin is a war criminal amid the crisis in Ukraine. Biden initially said no and then asked the reporter to repeat the question. ""I think he is a war criminal,"" Biden said in response.

New Zelenskyy video suggests kidnapped Melitopol mayor has been rescued In a video uploaded to Telegram on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appears to speak with Ivan Fyodorov, the Melitopol mayor who was kidnapped by Russian soldiers nearly a week ago — suggesting the mayor has been released. In the video, Zelenskyy appears to congratulate Fyodorov on his rescue and reassures him that Ukraine does not leave its people behind. In what seemed to be a tongue-in-cheek exchange, the mayor then says he needs a day or two before he returns to work. In response, Zelenskyy says he cannot promise two days but encourages the mayor to rest. The video was posted by the deputy head of Zelenskyy's office. The deputy head of the president's office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said in a separate post that the rescue was a special operation. Share this -







Biden announces $800M in new defense assistance for Ukraine, including anti-aircraft systems President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that he is authorizing $800 million in U.S. assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total of announced new security aid for the country to $1 billion just this week. ""These are direct transfers of equipment from our Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military, to help them as they fight against this invasion,"" Biden said in remarks from the White House, flanked by top officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley. Biden said the new package includes: 800 anti-aircraft systems

Additional longer-range anti-aircraft systems and their munitions

9,000 anti-armor systems, which he said are ""portable high-accuracy shoulder mounted missiles""

7,000 small arms, including machine guns, shotguns and grenade launchers

20 million rounds of ammunition, artillery and mortars for small arms

Drones ""The United States and our allies and partners are fully committed to surge the weapons of assistance to the Ukrainians, and more will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment,"" Biden said, adding bluntly: ""Now, I want to be honest. This could be a long and difficult battle. But the American people will be steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine in the face of Putin's immoral, unethical attacks on civilian populations."" Biden said the U.S. has provided $300 million in humanitarian assistance in the last few weeks to people in Ukraine and in neighboring countries where Ukrainians are finding refuge. This assistance has included food, medicine and basic supplies, he said. When the invasion began in late February, Biden said, the U.S. rushed $350 million in additional aid, including anti-tank weapons, transport helicopters, armed patrol boats, unmanned drones, secure communications equipment, tactical gear, other high-mobility vehicles and radar systems that help track incoming artillery. He also said the administration started sending assistance to Ukraine a year ago. ""We took the threat of Putin invading very seriously. We acted on it. We sent Ukraine more security systems last year — $650 million in weapons, including anti-air and anti-armor equipment — before the invasion, more than we had ever provided before.""

Ukrainians fleeing Russian invasion mourn what was left behind MEDYKA, Poland — Parents, spouses, children, grandchildren, sweethearts, friends, careers and homes: That’s just a short list of all that was left behind by so many fleeing war in their homeland. The immensity of what remains in Ukraine contrasts starkly with the meager possessions these sudden refugees were able to bring with them. All that they own now is crammed into shopping bags and wheeled suitcases that squeak and rattle as they cross into this small red-brick village surrounded by fields. With shock, grief and relief hanging in the bright, cold air, Alexander Federov greets the new arrivals in Poland with a broad smile and some hearty Ukrainian warmth: “Vse bude dobre” — “Everything will be fine.” About 3 million Ukrainians have fled since Russia invaded their country — the majority to neighboring Poland — in the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. Thousands of them have crossed through Medyka. Read the full story here. Share this -







Ukraine news website hacked, used to post Zelenskyy deepfake The website of a Ukrainian news outlet was hacked Wednesday and used to push a fake video in which someone who appears to be Zelenskyy tells citizens to surrender to Russia, one of the most high-profile uses of ""deepfake"" technology to date. The live TV broadcast from the media outlet, Ukraine 24, also showed a chyron that repeated what the fake Zelenskyy video said. Disinformation experts have long warned that deepfakes, computer-generated videos of a real person saying or doing things they didn't actually say or do, could be used for malicious political purposes, and Ukrainian government officials have warned for weeks that Russia may try to convince people of false news of surrender. The simulation was of low quality, with the fake Zelenskyy's mouth moving unnaturally, his head appearing somewhat detached from his body. Last week, Ukraine provincial government websites were hacked to make similar claims, leading national government officials to rush to debunk it. Channel 24's website was down as of midday Wednesday, but its Telegram channel warned about the hack and said that the message of surrender was fake. Share this -







Putin claims, without evidence, Ukraine has nuclear weapons and biological weapons programs Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed without evidence Wednesday that Ukraine has its own nuclear weapons and biological weapons programs. ""Kyiv government announced their own nuclear weapons and the means to transport it. It was a real threat.

""And Russia would, of course, be the target."" Putin also claimed that Ukraine has laboratories where it conducts experiments with ""coronavirus, anthrax, cholera, African swine fever and other lethal diseases,"" adding: ""They are trying to cover the traces of these programs. In essence, they were creating biological weapons in close proximity to Russian borders."" He also accused Ukraine of planning to attack Donbas and Crimea in an ""ethnic cleansing."" Putin suggested he was forced to authorize the invasion because Russia was ""left with no choice for peaceful resolution of problems that we are not to blame for."" U.S. officials have been warning that Russia could implement a false flag operation in which its military would launch a chemical or biological weapons attack in Ukraine. Share this -

Biden to commit new military aid to Ukraine following Zelenskyy speech Biden is expected to detail an additional $800 million in military support Wednesday after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with Congress to do more to help Ukraine defend itself against the military onslaught from Russia. Biden is expected to outline in more detail the types of security assistance the U.S. is providing, including anti-armor and air defense systems, a White House official said ahead of the remarks. The added assistance brings the total authorized by Biden to $2 billion since the start of his presidency. But Biden wasn't expected to announce any of the actions that Zelenskyy asked for in his remarks to Congress earlier Wednesday, including a no-fly zone over Ukraine to deter Russian bombers that have hit hospitals, schools and residential buildings, as well as fighter jets — two measures the U.S. has repeatedly rejected.

Spam campaigns look to capitalize on Ukraine donations Online scammers are trying to capitalize on the Ukraine crisis by sending a massive amount of email spam, researchers say. Many appear to try to take advantage of the fact that the Ukrainian government has taken the novel and successful step of soliciting cryptocurrency donations from the public. That's led to scammers flooding email addresses with their own crypto addresses, falsely claiming to be the Ukrainian government or working for Ukrainian refugees, according to Andrew Brandt, principal researcher at the cybersecurity company Sophos. Despite the dramatic spike in such emails, they may not be working. None of the scammers' cryptocurrency addresses that Sophos has monitored have received any funds, Brandt said. Share this -

War could contribute to biggest oil supply crisis in decades, International Energy Agency warns The International Energy Agency has cut its 2022 forecast for global oil demand amid the disruption to Russian oil production which threatens a “global oil supply shock.” “The implications of a potential loss of Russian oil exports to global markets cannot be understated,” it said in a monthly report released Wednesday. “Faced with what could turn into the biggest supply crisis in decades, global energy markets are at a crossroads,” it said. As the world’s largest oil exporter, Russia continues to send oil due to deals made before the invasion, but new business has “all but dried up,” it said.

Ukrainian presidential adviser rejects Russia's 'compromise' of NATO neutrality An adviser to Ukraine's president has rejected the idea of taking a neutral stance similar to Sweden or Austria — after Russia said this was a possible compromise that could lead to an end to hostilities. ""The Russian Federation believes that the Swedish version of a neutral state in Ukraine can be seen as a compromise,"" Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said during a regular press briefing Wednesday. Both Austria and Sweden are outside the NATO alliance but act as partner nations. The adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Telegram on Wednesday he understood why the neutrality point was being raised, but added: ""Ukraine is now in a state of direct war with the Russian Federation. Therefore, the model can only be Ukrainian and only about legally verified security guarantees. And no other models or options."" He said Ukraine needed a security deal that would ensure foreign support in the event of an attack, without the need for any ""bureaucratic procedures"" to enforce a no-fly zone. Share this -







9 in 10 Ukrainians could face poverty as a result of war, U.N. agency says Almost 90 percent of Ukraine’s population could face poverty and extreme economic vulnerability if the war drags on for a year, wiping out two decades of development, according to a projection from the United Nations Development Program. “An alarming economic decline, and the suffering and hardship it will bring to an already traumatized population must now come into sharper focus,” UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said Wednesday. Half of Ukraine's businesses are shut completely while the remaining operate below capacity, he said. The UNDP estimates that emergency cash of approximately $250 million per month would cover “partial income losses” for the 2.6 million people expected to fall below poverty. Share this -

Ukraine's military launching counteroffensives, Zelenskyy adviser says Ukraine's military has launched counteroffensives against Russian forces in a number of areas, a move that ""radically changes the parties’ dispositions,"" according to a senior official in Kyiv.

Russia's military struggles have raised hopes of progress in peace talks, where Podolyak is a top Ukrainian negotiator. What's going on right now. 1. Counteroffensive of the AFU in several operational areas. This radically changes the parties’ dispositions. 2. Russian journalists start quitting TV channels. 3.

Since Wednesday, March 16, the country has been connected to the European network and in the event of a failure of its means of production, it is therefore the European power stations that will send it electricity. It was an old request from kyiv, but obviously, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, everything accelerated.

Ukraine applied for connection to the European electricity grid in 2017, already at the time to avoid dependence on Russia. The work was in progress but three weeks ago, everything got carried away. The bombardment and takeover by the Russians of the Zaporijia nuclear power plant showed that the Ukrainian network was indeed threatened. The country was isolated: already more connected to Russia, and not yet to Europe

Connection work to the rhythm of the bombardments

The managers of the European network called Entso-E (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity) therefore got down to work, day and night, in contact with their Ukrainian colleagues, to the rhythm of the bombardment when these had to be interrupted. to go down to the shelters.

No question of asking the Ukrainian network to adapt to Union standards. We had to make do with what exists, while ensuring the security of the European network: it must not fail in the event of a problem in Ukraine. So there is an immediate disconnect option. For example, lines that had been abandoned since the end of the Soviet era had to be brought back into service. But now, six high voltage lines connect Europe to Ukraine. Moldova was also added to the European network on Wednesday and the area covered by Entso-E goes beyond the borders of the EU: it includes some 35 countries from Iceland to Cyprus.

“Ukraine has become a member of the European energy union”, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky in a tweet. “From now on, Ukrainian electricity circulates in the European Union and vice versa”, he pointed out.

has become a member of Energy Union. The unification of & energy systems has been completed. Now electricity flows in & vice versa. Thankful to members, personally to @vonderleyen, @KadriSimson & everyone, thanks to whom we now have a single energy system! — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) March 16, 2022

The power grid situation in Ukraine remains precarious. At present, it is self-sufficient: despite the war, Ukraine manages to produce its own electricity with seven to eight nuclear reactors connected, i.e. half of the fleet, and coal-fired power stations which even manage to increase their fuel stock. All managed in a secret bunker.

On the ground, Ukrainian electricians are heroes doing their best to repair battle-damaged lines. The situation is especially tense in Mariupol and kyiv. Thus, on Sunday, on the outskirts of the capital, the teams went out to repair a line that lasted 20 minutes. They went back there on Monday. It lasted 2 hours. They returned there on Tuesday.

""Nobody knows whether it may have already started. And what is the possibility of this war if Ukraine will fall, in case Ukraine will?

Zelenskyy has called for a no fly-zone over Ukraine, invoking Martin Luther King Jr. to make the case during his address to Congress.
