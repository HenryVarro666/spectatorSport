A fire at the Zaporitzhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine, which broke out in a training building outside the plant's perimeter following an attack by Russian troops, has been put out, Ukraine's state emergency service said Friday.

Earlier, an official in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's office said the reactors had not been damaged and radiation levels were normal. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to not being authorized to speak publicly.

The plant's director also told Ukraine 24 television that radiation safety had been secured at the site.

The fire at the plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, prompted telephone calls between Zelensky and the leaders of the United States, Britain, European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the possibility of a nuclear disaster.

""If there is an explosion — that's the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe,"" he said in an emotional speech in the middle of the night.

Leading nuclear authorities were concerned — but not panicked — about the damage to the power station. The U.S. Department of Energy activated its nuclear incident response team as a precaution.

Zelensky also spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland about the nuclear plant.

These unacceptable attacks by Russia must cease immediately. —@JustinTrudeau

The IAEA reported it had been informed by Ukraine's regulator that there was no change in radiation levels at the plant. It later said in a tweet that the fire had not affected ""essential"" equipment, but said its Incident and Emergency Centre had been put into what it called a 24/7 response mode.

Earlier, Russian forces shelled the plant in the battle for control of the crucial energy-producing city of Enerhodar, and the power station was on fire.

Plant spokesperson Andriy Tuz told Ukrainian television that shells were falling directly on the Zaporizhzhia plant and had set fire to one of the facility's six reactors. That reactor is under renovation and not operating, but there is nuclear fuel inside, he said.

Firefighters could not get near the fire because they were being shot at, Tuz said.

Ukraine's foreign minister warned that if the plant explodes, it will be 10 times worse than the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, when a reactor went into meltdown and sent nearly 10 tonnes of radioactive material into the atmosphere and surrounding regions about 100 kilometres north of Kyiv. Two workers were killed immediately and another 30 died within weeks from radiation exposure.

A live-streamed security camera linked from the homepage of the nuclear power plant showed what appeared to be armoured vehicles rolling into the facility's parking lot and shining spotlights on the building where the camera was mounted. There are then what appear to be bright muzzle flashes from vehicles and then nearly simultaneous explosions in the surrounding buildings.

Enerhodar is a city on the Dnieper River.

2nd round of talks

The fighting at Enerhodar came as another round of talks between the two sides yielded a tentative agreement to set up safe corridors to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid.

While the huge Russian armoured column threatening Kyiv appeared bogged down outside the capital, Putin's forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites around the country and making significant gains in the south.

The mayor of Enerhodar said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city's outskirts. Video showed flames and black smoke rising above the city of more than 50,000, with people streaming past wrecked cars, just a day after the UN atomic watchdog agency expressed grave concern that the fighting could cause accidental damage to Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors.

Mayor Dmytro Orlov and the Ukrainian state atomic energy company had earlier reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late Thursday.

The Pentagon set up a direct communication link to Russia's Ministry of Defence earlier this week to avoid the possibility of a miscalculation sparking conflict between Moscow and Washington, according to a U.S. defence official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the link had not been announced.

Ukrainian leaders called on the people to defend their homeland by cutting down trees, erecting barricades in the cities and attacking enemy columns from the rear. In recent days, authorities have issued weapons to civilians and taught them how to make Molotov cocktails.

""Total resistance. … This is our Ukrainian trump card, and this is what we can do best in the world,"" Oleksiy Arestovich, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said in a video message, recalling guerrilla actions in Nazi-occupied Ukraine during the Second World War.

Civilians flee fighting

The two sides said that they tentatively agreed to allow cease-fires in areas designated as safe corridors, and that they would seek to work out the necessary details quickly. A Zelensky adviser also said a third round of talks will be held early next week.

More than one million people have fled Ukraine following Russia's invasion, the swiftest refugee exodus this century, the United Nations refugee agency said, as Russian forces continued their push for control of key cities.

""Hour by hour, minute by minute, more people are fleeing the terrifying reality of violence,"" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement. ""Countless have been displaced inside the country.""

The UN also said the number of refugees could top four million.

""While the scale and scope of displacement is not yet clear, we do expect that more than 10 million people may flee their homes if violence continues, including four million people who may cross borders to neighbouring countries,"" according to spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.

""It's been so fast and so shocking,"" Danny Glenwright, head of charitable organization Save the Children Canada, said of the mass movement of Ukrainians out of the country.

""Imagine, one day you've got your kids in school, and there's structure in their lives,"" he said. ""The next day, they wake up, and they have to flee with really very little, over long distances in freezing conditions.""

UNICEF, the United Nations children's agency, has said that within Ukraine, 7.5 million children are at ""heightened risk"" as the conflict escalates.

In a statement earlier this week, UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell said that access issues on the ground and ""rapidly changing front lines"" have made it difficult to deliver critical supplies and services.

The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, a city of about 1.5 million people where residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the city's train station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed.

Families with children fled via muddy and snowy roads in the eastern region of Donetsk, while military strikes on the village of Yakovlivka near the eastern city of Kharkiv destroyed 30 homes, leaving three people dead and seven wounded, according to emergency authorities.

Halyna Yanchenko, a Ukrainian member of parliament, told CBC News Network Thursday that a Russian missile recently hit a couple of blocks from her home on the outskirts of Kyiv.

Yanchenko, who is still in the capital region, sent her children away to the western part of the country — and even still, she says, she doesn't know if they will be safe.

She called the fight against Russia a ""matter of survival"" and said civilians are being killed in the Russian attacks. The UN human rights office said on Thursday that it had confirmed 249 civilians have been killed and 553 injured in the first week of the conflict, with the toll having risen overnight from 227 deaths and 525 injured reported a day ago.

The situation in Ukraine's capital Kyiv is ""difficult but under control,"" Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Thursday. Klitschko said there were no casualties overnight and that nighttime explosions were Ukrainian air defences striking down incoming Russian missiles. He said a heating system site damaged by Russian shelling on Wednesday would be fixed during the day.

On the far edges of Kyiv, volunteers well into their 60s manned a checkpoint to try to block the Russian advance. ""In my old age, I had to take up arms,"" said Andrey Goncharuk, 68. He said the fighters needed more weapons, but ""we'll kill the enemy and take their weapons.""

In the north, more shelling was reported in Chernihiv , where emergency officials said at least 33 civilians had been killed and 18 wounded in a Russian bombardment of a residential area. The search for more victims in the rubble was suspended because of renewed shelling.

In the south, Mariupol city council said Russia was constantly and deliberately shelling critical civilian infrastructure in the southern port, leaving it without water, heating or power and preventing the provision of supplies and the evacuation of residents.



Cutting Ukraine's access to the coastline would deal a crippling blow to its economy and allow Russia to build a land corridor stretching from its border, across Crimea, which has been occupied by Russia since 2014, and potentially all the way west to Romania.

In Kherson, the Russians announced the capture of the southern city of Kherson, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed that forces have taken over local government headquarters in the vital Black Sea port of 280,000. But the U.S. believes that Russian forces have not yet taken over the city.



A senior U.S. defence official said Thursday the city could be used as part of a strategy for potentially moving to Mykolaiv and then onto Odesa.



Britain's defence secretary said it was possible the Russians had taken over, though that was not yet verified. If Kherson were to be captured, it would be the first significant urban centre to fall into the hands of Russian troops.

From Kherson, Russian troops appeared to roll toward Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding centre to the west along the coast. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said that big convoys of Russian troops are advancing on the city but said that they will likely need to regroup before trying to take it over.

Lavrov acknowledges civilian deaths

In a statement, the UN human rights office said most of the civilian casualties so far were caused by ""the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems.""

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov voiced regret for civilian casualties, insisting that the military is only using precision weapons against military targets, despite abundant evidence of shelling of homes, schools and hospitals. However, he tacitly acknowledged that some Russian strikes could have killed civilians, saying that ""any military action is fraught with casualties, and not just among the military but also civilians.""

Russia reported its military casualties Wednesday for the first time in the war, saying nearly 500 of its troops had been killed and almost 1,600 wounded.

Ukraine did not disclose its own military losses. A Facebook post from Ukrainian military officials said that Russia's forces had suffered some 9,000 casualties in the fighting. It did not clarify if that figure included both killed and wounded soldiers.

Putin himself said in remarks Thursday that the Russians were using ""only precision weapons to exclusively destroy military infrastructure"" and blamed reports that say otherwise on an ""anti-Russian disinformation campaign.""

ICC team heads to region

An advance team left the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague for ""the Ukraine region"" on Thursday to start investigating possible war crimes, its top prosecutor told Reuters in an interview. Their departure came hours after prosecutor Karim Khan said he would start collecting evidence as part of a formal investigation launched after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of the ICC, and Moscow does not recognize the court, which was established in 1997 by the Rome Statute and opened in The Hague in 2002.

The flight, which will reach Moldova via Romania, will also transport a 40-strong team of medical personnel who will join a group of volunteers the organization sent earlier this week to work at three field hospitals the rescue organization is setting up at Moldova’s Ukraine border for people fleeing Russia’s invasion.

The team is made up of EMTs, paramedics and doctors, as well as members of the organization’s Psychotrauma and Crisis Response Unit, which provides aid in the field for people who are undergoing trauma. Many of medics expect to be deployed for around two weeks, but the fast-moving crisis means that many could be away from home for longer.

Much of the aid on the plane is medical equipment for the field hospitals, but there is also food, warm clothing, blankets, heat pads, diapers, formula and feminine hygiene products – many of the supplies have been donated by a number of Israeli companies.

In a move that distinguishes the team from other aid organizations, they are also transporting two Torah scrolls for religious members of their teams on the ground.

The plane will return to Israel later in the day carrying some 150 refugees with Israeli citizenship back to Israel.

“The complexity of this operation is immense. It involves travel permits, diplomatic relations, and travel between three countries by land and by air,” says Eli Beer, president of United Hatzalah.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the international body’s refugee agency, said Wednesday that over 1 million people are now refugees as a result of the fighting in Ukraine, with concerns that figure will keep climbing. There were 44 million Ukrainians on the eve of the invasion.

The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Friday in response to Russia’s attack and capture of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which caused worldwide alarm about the potential for a nuclear accident if the conflict in Ukraine is not contained.

The United States and its allies denounced Russia for the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, calling it a threat to civilians and a reckless escalation. They condemned the seizure of the plant and called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Zaporizhzhia and from the former Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine.

“By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Mr. Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now. Cooler heads must prevail.”

Early on Friday, as fighting reached the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant, a fire started at a training building. The fire was extinguished, and the plant appeared to be safe on Friday. Ukrainian officials and the International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had been contained without damage to the reactors or other equipment, and that radiation levels had not increased.

“This is the first time that a state has attacked a fueled and functioning nuclear power plant,” said Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward, who had called for the Security Council meeting. “It must not happen again.”

Russia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, told the council that the allegations that Russia had attacked the nuclear site were “lies” and part of an anti-Russian campaign. He said the emergency meeting had been called to “kindle artificial hysteria about what is taking place in Ukraine.”

Mr. Nebenzya offered a different account of the incident, saying that Russian troops patrolling the area of the nuclear facility had come under fire from Ukrainian forces inside the training building and had returned fire. He accused Ukrainians of setting the blaze.

“Our servicemen are not interfering with the work of the operators of the power plants and only working to ensure stability,” Mr. Nebenzya said, adding that Russia had experienced the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and did not want to see another nuclear accident.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, briefed the council from an airplane en route to Iran. Mr. Grossi said he had proposed to the Ukrainian and Russian authorities that he travel to Ukraine as soon as possible and visit both nuclear sites, Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia, to establish a framework to protect them.

Mr. Grossi said his mission would not be political and would be restricted to ensuring “the safety and security of nuclear establishments of Ukraine, which, as facts have shown, are in constant danger of accidents.” He added that the Zaporizhzhia facility was operating normally, but said he had informed the I.A.E.A. board of governors that “there is no normalcy to the situation when there are military forces in charge of the site.”

Beyond the statements of diplomats, the Security Council cannot take significant action against Russia because the country has veto power over legally binding resolutions. Russia vetoed a resolution last week that condemned its invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its troops.

The U.N. General Assembly, a 193-member body, passed a resolution on Wednesday that condemned the invasion and called for humanitarian access and a diplomatic solution. That resolution, which was politically symbolic but not legally binding, passed with 141 countries voting in favor, demonstrating Russia’s isolation on the world stage, diplomats said.

Countries around the world swiftly condemned the episode, with the United States embassy in Ukraine warning an attack on a nuclear plant was a ""war crime"" and the United Nations Security Council convening an emergency meeting.

In a statement Friday morning local time, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate (SNRI) confirmed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine was occupied by Russian military forces, but said officials remained in contact with plant management.

The power plant's six reactors remained intact, though the compartment auxiliary buildings for reactor unit 1 had been damaged, the SNRI said in its statement. Four of the remaining units were being cooled down while one unit is providing power, the statement said.

Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine's nuclear power operator Energoatom, later reported that management were operating at ""gunpoint."" He said on Telegram that Russian forces ""entered the territory of the nuclear power plant, took control of the personnel and management of the nuclear power plant.""

""Today there is no connection, the station management works at invaders' gunpoint,"" Kotin continued.

""As for the staff, they were admitted in the morning to perform their duties. We do not currently have a direct connection to the station. We get information from the sources at the station.""

Kotin warned that although the reactors are safe, further attacks could lead to ""disaster.""

Ukraine's State Emergency Services (SES) had earlier confirmed several dozen firefighters had extinguished a blaze that had started in a training building outside the main reactor complex, following shelling from Russian military forces.

Reports of the fire raised concern from world leaders and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- who called for a stop to fighting around the facility -- though the IAEA said Ukrainian authorities had reported background radiation levels were normal and the fire had not affected ""essential"" equipment.

However the ongoing military operation around the site meant the situation was ""very fragile,"" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned.

Speaking at a press conference in Vienna on Friday, the IAEA's Rossi said the safety of the reactors had not been affected.

""We are fortunate there has not been a release of radioactive material and the integrity of the reactors has not been compromised,"" he said. However, the operator and regulator have relayed to the IAEA that the situation on the ground is ""extremely tense and challenging,"" he warned.

He explained that a Russian projectile had hit a building within the site, causing a localized fire, but none of the reactors were affected and radiation monitoring systems are fully functional.

Ukrainian staff are still at the helm of operations at the plant, but ""effective control"" of the site was in the hands of Russian forces, Grossi said, adding: ""I hope the distinction is clear."" He said that what happens next at Zaporizhzhia is ""a situation that is very difficult to sustain, very fragile"" while there is an active military operation and Russian forces in control. ""This is unprecedented,"" he said. ""Completely uncharted waters.""

Grossi later told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that although radioactive material was not released, it was a ""close call.""

He told Amanpour that he had warned both sides that ""the utmost restraint is to be exercised in and around this type of facility. Because wittingly or unwittingly, you can very quickly go into a disaster, and this is why we're so concerned.""

The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the meeting that the world ""narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night.""

She called Russia's reactions ""reckless"" and ""dangerous,"" saying it put Europe's largest nuclear power plant at grave risk and threatened the safety of civilians in Russia, in the UK and across the European continent. Russian forces were also 20 miles away from Ukraine's second largest nuclear facility, she noted.

""Nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""Mr Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now.""

Zelensky pushes for no-fly zone

On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of committing a ""terror attack"" by intentionally firing at the power plant -- potentially risking the lives of millions.

He later condemned NATO's decision to rule out the implementation of a no-fly zone over the country.

NATO's chief said Friday that a no-fly zone over Ukraine is not an option being considered by the alliance. ""We've agreed that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory,"" Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a press conference earlier in Brussels.

In a Facebook post, Zelensky questioned what the alliance's members were thinking, saying, ""All the people who will die from this day will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your disunity."" However, he also expressed his gratitude to NATO countries that have shown support for Ukraine.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the establishment of a no-fly zone in Ukraine by the US and it's NATO allies could lead to a ""full-fledged war in Europe,"" but said Washington would continue to work with it's allies to provide Ukrainians with the means to defend themselves from Russian aggression.

Nuclear plant under attack

Reports of the attack on the facility emerged early Friday morning, with video of the scene showing bursts of gunfire apparently directed at the Zaporizhzhia facility before dawn.

Flames could also be seen on video footage, though for some time it was unclear where the fire was or the scale of the threat posed to the facility.

Ukrainian authorities released video later on Friday from inside the facility's control room, with an announcement ringing out on a PA system aimed at the Russian forces outside.

""Stop shooting at a nuclear dangerous facility. Stop shooting immediately! You threaten the security of the whole world!"" the announcement says.

The Russian government has claimed Ukrainian ""provocation"" led to a firefight around the nuclear power plant.

In a video briefing, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces took the city of Enerhodar, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the territory adjacent to it on February 28. Konashenkov claimed the plant's technical staff continued regular work on the facilities, but that Ukrainian forces attempted a ""monstrous provocation"" in the early hours of Friday. Konashenkov also claimed the Ukrainians had set fire to the training building themselves.

Smoke rises from tire barricades set on fire in Enerhoda, Ukraine, on March 3.

CNN could not immediately verify any details of the firefight on the territory of the plant.

The Russian government has routinely and without evidence claimed the Ukrainian government is staging ""provocations"" to provoke a military response by Western governments.

It's the not first nuclear plant to come under threat from the Russian invasion. On the first day of the assault, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, according to Ukrainian officials.

The Chernobyl nuclear power plant reactor exploded in 1986, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union -- sparking a disaster that affected, directly or indirectly, nine million people, due to radioactive materials released into the atmosphere.

The IAEA said in a statement that Ukraine had informed it staff held at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant since Russian military forces took control of the site a week ago were facing ""psychological pressure and moral exhaustion.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-fire-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.
