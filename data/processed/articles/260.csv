0,95f60d4f-aee0-4d54-a916-ec41fee4e958,[],2022-03-09 00:00:00,"On Tuesday, Poland announced plans to send 28 Russian-made MiG jets to a U.S. and NATO base in Germany, aircraft that then could be transferred to Ukraine. That announcement from the Polish government followed a week of back-and-forth negotiation between Warsaw and Washington, though Tuesday’s announcement came as a surprise to U.S. officials.

But the U.S. Department of Defense opposed the transfer of Polish planes to Ukraine, a senior administration official told POLITICO, and Kirby cited both logistical and military complications of such a hand-off.

Kirby noted that the most effective weapons at this stage in the war for Ukraine are anti-armor and ground-based air defense, and that adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory was “not likely to significantly change” the Ukrainian air force’s ability to counter Russian attacks.

Any action by the U.S. or its NATO allies to provide jets to Ukraine, Kirby noted, could be seen by President Vladimir Putin of Russia as an act of aggression and lead to an escalation of his country’s attack.

Kirby’s comments differed from those of Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier in the day, who expressed opposition to Poland’s proposition but implied that providing fighter jets “in the right way” might still be on the table.

“Poland’s proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security assistance,” Blinken said in a news conference at the State Department. “We have to make sure that we’re doing it in the right way.”

In particular, Blinken expressed concern about the prospect of U.S. pilots departing from a NATO-controlled base in Germany into Russian-contested airspace over Ukraine. Such an arrangement might drag the U.S. and NATO into open conflict with Russia.

“It’s not simply clear to us that there’s a substantive rationale for doing it in the way that was put forward yesterday,” Blinken said. “So what we’re doing right now is continuing to consult very closely with Poland with other NATO allies on this and the logistical challenges that it presents.”

Blinken on Wednesday also dismissed calls for a NATO-enforced partial no-fly zone over Ukraine, an idea that has gained steam among foreign policy elites in the U.S. Blinken stated that such enforcement — which would include introducing American pilots into Ukrainian airspace — “would almost certainly lead to direct conflict” between U.S. forces and Russia.

“That would expand the conflict. It would prolong it. It would make it much more deadly than it already is,” Blinken said. “And that would be neither in the interest of our countries, nor in the interest of Ukraine.”

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has repeatedly asked NATO member countries to implement a no-fly zone and to provide fighter jets, including in a Zoom call with U.S. lawmakers on Saturday.

On Wednesday, Zelenskyy called for a resolution to be reached “immediately” between Poland and the U.S., noting that Ukrainians “do not have time” for indecision.

“This is not ping pong! This is about human lives!” Zelenskyy said in a speech. “We ask once again: solve it faster. Do not shift the responsibility, send us planes.”

Vice President Kamala Harris departed on Wednesday morning for a previously planned trip to Warsaw, where she will meet with Polish leaders and discuss the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

“If I were in President Zelenskyy’s position,” Blinken said, “I’m sure I would be asking for everything possible, in his mind, to help the Ukrainian people.”",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/09/blinken-ukraine-poland-fighter-jets-00015747

Washington CNN —

The Pentagon said Wednesday that it is bluntly opposed to a Polish plan to provide fighter jets to Ukraine.

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told the Polish minister of defense that the US does not support the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets to the Ukrainian air force “at this time,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said, either by Poland transferring them to Ukraine with the US backfilling Poland’s fleet or by Poland transferring the MiG-29s to the US to then give to Ukraine.

Austin “stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time, and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody either,” Kirby said.

His comments come a day after the US rejected a proposal from Poland to send Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine by way of a US-NATO air base in Germany.

The US and NATO want to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian troops invading the country, but also avoid being drawn into an outright conflict with Russia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been asking the West for MiG-29 fighter jets, which were used during the Cold War and that Ukrainian pilots were trained to use, to maintain control of the skies in his country as it remains under attack by Russia.

Zelensky’s other request for help establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine has been rejected by the US and the alliance, who view it as a move that would pit them directly against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also warned that he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone “as participants in a military conflict.”

With a no-fly zone off the table, the US has weighed the option of providing support to the Ukrainian military by helping facilitate the delivery of Polish fighter jets to Ukraine. But it has proven to be a thorny political issue and logistically complicated objective.

Over the weekend, the US said it was in discussions with Poland about a potential deal in which Poland would supply Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets that Ukraine has requested, and the US would then provide Poland with American F-16s.

Poland, however, on Tuesday took the US by surprise and offered to deploy all its MiG-29 fighter jets to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia – but by first sending the jets to US Ramstein Air Base in Germany, also a NATO nation.

The US Defense Department rejected the proposal as not “tenable” and deemed it too risky.

“The prospect of fighter jets ‘at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America’ departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,” Kirby had said in a statement Tuesday.

US officials described the issue to CNN as twofold: a logistics problem of getting the jets to Ukraine, and a political problem of avoiding escalation with Russia. US officials described the Polish plan as failing to adequately address both.

NATO members have expressed concerns that providing fighter jets to Ukraine – even if done bilaterally – could be perceived by Russia as the alliance becoming directly involved in the war, NATO diplomats told CNN.

Poland, a NATO member and neighbor of Ukraine, has also been worried about the risks of sharing the fighter jets with Ukraine, as they don’t want to become a party to the conflict and escalate the situation along their border, Polish officials told CNN.

Polish Ambassador to the US Marek Magierowski said Wednesday evening that Poland was “acutely aware” of the consequences involved with its proposal.

“We were under immense pressure on the part of our allies, and public opinion also here in the United States. And we were acutely aware of all technical, legal and diplomatic consequences of such a move, which was risky, of course,” Magierowski told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.”

“That is why we came up with a logical, conscionable solution. Our American partners rejected this proposal, because they have come to the conclusion that it was too escalatory. Well, we understand this, and I believe that we can continue coordinating our joint efforts with our American partners and with other NATO members in order to help the Ukrainians defend themselves as effectively as possible.”

If a Russian attack extends into one of the bordering NATO countries, it could trigger Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty, which is the principle that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all members.

If Article 5 is invoked, the US and other NATO members would then be obligated to provide resources to protect a fellow NATO member and could find themselves directly involved in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

Discussions continuing

Prior to Kirby stating the Pentagon is strongly opposed to Poland’s proposal on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials told CNN the US is continuing to consult with Poland and other NATO allies about the possibility of providing fighter jets to Ukraine.

American and Polish officials have held a “number of conversations” since the White House was caught off guard by Warsaw’s statement, a US administration official told CNN, adding that the relationship between the two countries remains strong despite the disagreement.

US Vice President Kamala Harris is also traveling to Poland this week and is expected to discuss the issue.

US officials also told CNN that they do not believe the episode precludes reaching some type of agreement that would allow the jets to get to Ukraine.

As of now, though, there are no immediate apparent solutions for the US to facilitate the delivery of jets to Ukraine since rejecting Poland’s offer.

“I think what we’re seeing is that Poland’s proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security systems. We have to make sure that we’re doing it the right way,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Wednesday at the State Department headquarters.

Logistical challenges

The US has made clear that sending jets to Ukraine is a “sovereign decision” for Poland to make, but has been willing to help sort through the challenges.

Besides the political quagmire, there are logistical challenges with sending fighter jets to Ukraine for the US and NATO allies to still work out.

“Secretary Austin, Chairman Milley and members of our Defense Department are in touch with Ukrainian counterparts, NATO counterparts, discussing what are clearly logistical challenges here,” White House press secretary Psaki said on Wednesday.

Psaki cited some of the logistical and operational challenges: getting planes into Ukraine in a way that is not escalatory, potentially having to take the planes apart and putting them back together, and ensuring the planes’ safe movement amid a war.

She later called it a “serious logistical bottleneck,” saying that discussions on the matter are ongoing.

Open-ended questions include how the aircraft would actually be moved from Poland to Ukraine and the number of Ukrainian pilots available, US Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour on Monday.

One idea floated initially was that Ukrainians would travel to Poland to retrieve the fighter jets and fly them back into Ukraine’s dangerous air space, which US officials say remains contested.

Ukraine late last month made a request for MiG-29s to Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria, and Zelensky on Saturday in a call with US lawmakers pleaded for US help in getting the fighter aircraft to his country.

Some of the countries appeared to have a willingness to consider this move before Poland offered to send their MiG-19s. As of Wednesday, US officials are not ruling out talks with those three other European nations as they seek a way to get the fighter jets to Ukraine.

CNN —

The Pentagon on Tuesday evening dismissed Poland’s proposal floated hours earlier to transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to the United States for delivery to Ukraine.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland’s proposal was “tenable,” just hours after Polish officials released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force’s Ramstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

“It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,” Kirby said. “We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one.”

Kirby said that the decision about transferring Polish-owned planes to Ukraine was “ultimately one for the Polish government,” adding that the proposal shows the complexities that the issue presents as Russia has made threatening statements over arms being provided to Ukrainians for use against Russian forces.

The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia.

“The prospect of fighter jets ‘at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America’ departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,” Kirby said.

Biden administration caught off guard

The Defense Department statement was released Tuesday evening after the Polish proposal caught the Biden administration completely off guard, multiple sources told CNN.

While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for more aircraft amid the Russian invasion, the offer had not been discussed with the US before making it public and Polish officials did not bring it up with Secretary of State Antony Blinken when he was recently in Poland either.

US officials have privately weighed sending aircraft to Ukraine but have repeatedly noted the difficult logistical challenges of doing so.

Poland’s surprise announcement complicates what had already been a high-stakes visit by Vice President Kamala Harris, who is due to land in Warsaw late Wednesday.

Harris had been expected to discuss the fighter jet issue while in Poland, according to officials. The White House had previously said it was in discussions with the Polish government about a plan for Poland to supply Ukraine with its Soviet-era fighter jets and the US to backfill the planes with F-16s.

Harris is still scheduled to depart Wednesday morning for Poland, but now there are intensive conversations within the administration about how to work with Poland to come to some sort of agreement that allows the jets to reach Ukraine.

A top State Department official said Tuesday that Poland did not consult with the United States prior to issuing its statement.

“I saw that announcement by the government of Poland as I was literally driving here today,” Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.

Nuland noted that the US and Poland have been in consultations for a couple of days on the possibility, but added she had come to the hearing directly from a meeting “where (she) ought to have heard about.”

“So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,” Nuland told lawmakers.

‘Ready to deploy’

The Polish government said in a statement Tuesday that it is “ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America.”

“At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,” the statement said.

Speaking to US lawmakers virtually on Saturday, Zelensky asked for American support to facilitate the transfer of Soviet-era fighter jets from Eastern European nations to Ukraine, where pilots have been trained to fly them and could use them to attempt to control the skies as Russia conducts its war against the country.

By Saturday evening, US and Polish officials were in discussions about a potential agreement to supply the country with American F-16 fighter jets in exchange for Poland sending its Russian-made jets to Ukraine.

“We are working with Poland as we speak to see if we can backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians,” Blinken said on CBS on Sunday. “But we also want to see if we can be helpful in making sure that, whatever they provide to Ukrainians, something goes to them to make up for any gap in the security for Poland that might result.”

On Monday, a Pentagon spokesman said the Department of Defense was in “interagency” discussions to “examine” the possibility of the US sending fighter jets to other European countries if those countries choose to send fighter jets of their own to Ukraine.

Prior to the apparent dismissal of Warsaw’s proposal by the Biden administration, members of Congress appeared supportive of the move. During Tuesday’s Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin asked Nuland to ensure the Biden administration notifies Congress if there are going to be any delays getting F-16s to Poland.

Two European diplomats told CNN on Tuesday, prior to the Pentagon statement, that the complicated logistics behind the idea of Poland giving the jets to Ukraine had not yet been finalized.

The Polish announcement came after some Polish officials expressed frustration about how forward leaning the US was on this subject over the weekend, the sources said.

“In fact, we’re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they’re handing over to the Ukrainians? We’re in very active discussions with them about that,” Blinken said Sunday.

A Polish official told CNN they believed Harris’ trip would be a good time for the US to announce more details about aircraft transfers, but the Pentagon statement suggests such a possibility is unlikely.

Other countries that are in talks with the US about taking part in similar transfers are conducting the conversations quietly, without raising expectations, said a central European diplomat.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/politics/poland-jets-ukraine-russia/index.html

But the offer came with a hitch: Poland refused to give the MIGs directly to Ukraine. The deal would only go forward if the United States, and NATO, did the transferring, and then replaced Poland’s fleet with American-made fighter jets. The United States, blindsided by the demand, began to pick apart what was going on. Polish leaders, fearful of incurring Russia’s wrath, and perhaps an attack on the air base where the MIGs launched from, was handing the problem of becoming a “co-combatant” in the war off to Washington and its other NATO allies.

The Pentagon all but rejected the idea on Tuesday night and said the United States had not been consulted. By late Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd J.

Effects of the bombing in the center of Kharkiv, Ukraine on March 9, 2022 as Russian attacks continue.

By Jeremy Herb, Jeremy Diamond, Kevin Liptak, Natasha Bertrand and Lauren Fox, CNN

(CNN) -- The swift US rejection of a Polish plan to get MiG-29 fighter jets into Ukraine is the clearest example yet of the complications that the US and its NATO allies face trying to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's brutal assault while ensuring they don't get dragged into a wider war.

The negotiations fell apart almost as quickly as they came together.

Poland's announcement on Tuesday that it was ready to provide MiG fighter jets to Ukraine via a US Air Force base in Germany caught the US off-guard. By Wednesday morning, US and Polish officials were still discussing the prospect of providing fighter jets to Ukraine, an administration official told CNN.

But on Wednesday afternoon, the Pentagon bluntly announced it was opposed to the idea, which Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin conveyed in a call to his Polish counterpart.

""Secretary Austin thanked the minister for Poland's willingness to continue to look for ways to assist Ukraine, but he stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time, and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody either,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said at a briefing.

The episode underscores how the US and its allies may be reaching the limits of what they can do to help Ukraine -- while staying out of the conflict -- and points to possible cracks in an alliance that has remained strongly unified in the early part of the war as members enacted stiff sanctions and provided security aid.

It also demonstrates that the Biden administration is still working to get on the same page.

The Pentagon's rejection of the plan to provide jets came after Secretary of State Antony Blinken endorsed the idea earlier in the week, and one senior GOP lawmaker said there were divisions inside the administration about what to do on the issue. Officials tell CNN that all of the public discussion about the plan make it less likely to happen, because it only increases Moscow's ability to call any moves escalatory and adds to the jitters of countries like Poland nervous about being in the crosshairs of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

US officials were deeply frustrated that Poland made the offer public, saying that it appeared to be a play for a domestic audience to try to show they are doing everything they can to help Ukraine, well aware the logistics had not yet been worked out.

In Warsaw on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris sought to underscore the strength of the Polish-American alliance despite the flap that has played out this week.

""I want to be very clear. The United States and Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop,"" Harris said alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda during a joint news conference.

Harris skirted directly addressing the issue during the news conference and instead underscored the military support the United States is already providing Ukraine short of air power, including antitank missiles, saying, ""We're making deliveries every day in terms of what we can do.""

Asked what more Ukraine could expect, Harris said, ""That is an ongoing process and that is not going to stop to the extent there is a need.""

Concerns about escalation

Kirby's comments made clear there are concerns that more direct measures could escalate tensions with Russia even further and risk dragging NATO directly into the war.

One administration official said the US was concerned Russia could interpret jets flying into Ukraine from a NATO base as an attack.

""The intelligence community has assessed that the transfer of MiG-29's to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,"" Kirby said. ""Therefore, we also assess that the transfer of the MiG-29's to Ukraine to be high-risk.""

The US and its allies have taken a number of steps to help Ukraine, including providing weapons and enacting sanctions like the US import ban on Russian oil that President Joe Biden announced this week -- another step that Zelensky pushed for publicly. A senior defense official told reporters that most of the $350 million in security assistance approved for Ukraine last month has been sent.

The US and other NATO members have so far provided Ukraine 17,000 anti-tank missiles and 2,000 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, according to a senior US official.

However, they have stopped short of implementing a no-fly zone and providing Ukraine with MiG-29 fighters despite numerous requests from Zelensky due to concerns about pulling the alliance into the conflict.

A number of lawmakers in Washington have also called for a no-fly zone, as Republicans and Democrats alike have publicly pushed the Biden administration to do more.

""Open the skies, give them the planes. These issues trump anything else we're concerned about,"" Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat and co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Congress, told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Wednesday.

""I can't stomach quibbling and drawing lines when Putin has already said the sanctions are war. We're delivering lethal aid,"" he added. ""Do we honestly think Putin is going to draw a distinction between the Javelins and Stingers that are coming across killing Russians very effectively from jets protecting the skies above?""

Air defense instead

On Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that the UK would supply air defense systems to Ukraine -- while also saying it was not seeking to set-up a no-fly zone.

""The best way to help protect the skies is through anti-air weaponry, which the UK is now going to be supplying to Ukraine,"" Truss said at a news conference at the State Department with Blinken.

Kirby said the Pentagon believed that the best way to support Ukraine was to provide them anti-armor and air-defense systems, such as surface-to-air missiles and ground-based air defense systems. Adding aircraft to the Ukrainian fleet was ""not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force relative to Russian capabilities,"" Kirby said.

""Therefore we believe that the gain from transferring those MiG-29's is low,"" the Pentagon spokesman said.

Earlier on Wednesday, Blinken -- who had said on Sunday that the US was working with Polish officials to transfer the planes to Ukraine and ""backfill"" with US jets -- said that the US was continuing to consult with Poland and other NATO allies on how to provide fighter jets to Ukraine.

""I think what we're seeing is that Poland's proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security systems. We have to make sure that we're doing it the right way,"" Blinken said.

There are also a handful of other countries with the jets, including Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria, and officials are not ruling out talks with those nations as they seek a way forward. One official said that Ukraine's initial request was directed at Poland, plus those three countries, but that Poland was the only country initially willing to entertain a possible jet transfer.

Officials describe the issue as two-fold: a logistics problem of getting the jets to Ukraine, and a political problem of avoiding escalation with Russia. US officials described the Polish plan as failing to adequately address both.

Frustrations among Poland and US officials

Polish officials, for their part, have said they feel unfairly blamed for the delay in sending over fighter jets to Ukraine, sources told CNN.

After Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Polish officials told their American counterparts that they would be willing to give Ukraine their supply of MiG-29 jets. But given the possibility of ramped up aggression from Russia, the Poles told the US they would need replacement jets. The US said none would be available until 2024, given a number of nations, including Taiwan, were ahead of Poland in line for the American-made fighter planes. So Poland felt it had to put the idea on hold.

But public pressure on the Biden administration to send the jets ratcheted up considerably after Zelensky pleaded with US lawmakers to facilitate a transfer during a Zoom call on Saturday morning.

Prior to the call, US officials had downplayed the prospects of helping with a transfer of the MiG planes, which Ukrainian pilots have been trained to fly. Officials said they were focused mainly on other areas of security assistance, including sending anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. The logistical challenges of getting the aircraft to Ukraine appeared to some officials an unworkable challenge who questioned how effective the planes would be.

But Zelensky's request on the call, which lawmakers described as impassioned, seemed to change the calculus. Immediately after the session ended, both Republicans and Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, came out in support.

A Senate aide, however, argued that the Biden administration was ahead of Congress in considering the idea of transferring the jets. While Zelensky's presentation was compelling and there was broad interest about exploring what was possible, the aide said, there was not a concerted push to get the Biden administration to back the transfer.

But US officials said the public backing left the administration with little choice but to publicly get behind the idea, even if some officials were skeptical. The US then began publicly messaging that the decision was Poland's alone to make. Blinken told CBS on Sunday that the US had given the ""green light"" to Poland to send the jets, despite Poland emphasizing to the US that they would be unable to do so without proper replacements.

The comments deeply frustrated Polish officials, and -- after days of feeling unfairly blamed for the delay -- Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday night made a surprise announcement that they would be willing to transfer the jets to the US, via Ramstein Air Base in Germany, for the US to then send directly to Ukraine. The US promptly rejected the idea.

Divisions inside the administration

Texas Rep. Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN Wednesday following a classified briefing on Ukraine there appeared to be internal division in the Biden administration between officials at the Pentagon and State over how to handle Poland's proposal.

""(The) secretary of defense had reservations about it about it and triggering... Article 5,"" McCaul said. Asked if it was Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who were divided, McCaul said, ""Yes.""

""I encouraged the secretary to do it when we were in Poland, and he agreed,"" McCaul said.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday there was a ""serious logistical bottleneck,"" while noting that discussions are ongoing between the defense officials and their Ukrainian counterparts.

An administration official said the bilateral relationship between the two countries remains strong and that the additional US security assistance has continued to flow into Ukraine via Poland, including in the last day.

The senior defense official said Wednesday that the ""majority"" of the Ukrainian air fleet is still ""intact and operable."" The Ukrainians have fixed-wing aircraft available to them, the official said, while noting the airspace above Ukraine remains ""contested.""

""The airspace is contested,"" the official said. ""And as I said yesterday, the Russians have surface-to-air missile umbrellas that virtually cover the whole country.""

The United States has sought to speed weapons deliveries to Ukraine. But the prospect of flying combat aircraft from NATO territory into the war zone “raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,” the Pentagon said.

NATO has said it does not want direct conflict with Russia, a fellow nuclear-armed power, and President Joe Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops into Ukraine to fight, something the Pentagon has said would apply to troops on the ground or in the air, flying missions.

“It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said of Poland’s proposal.

“We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one.”

Poland’s Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday that it was ready to deploy its MiG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States. It urged other members of the alliance that had other such aircraft to do the same.

Ukraine’s air force fleet consists of aging Soviet-era MiG-29 and Sukhoi-27 jets, and heavier Sukhoi-25 jets — and these are the only planes Ukrainian pilots could fly immediately without additional training.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a visit to Moldova on Sunday that Washington was “actively” looking at a deal with Poland to provide Ukraine with the MiG-29s.

The U.S. State Department’s No. 3 diplomat said the Polish proposal caught the United States by surprise.

“To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,” State Department Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.

“So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,” she said.

The impasse raises questions about the viability of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s plea for European countries to provide Russian-made planes, an issue he underscored during a video call Saturday with U.S. lawmakers.

U.S. lawmakers are eager to speed military aid to Ukraine and are pushing the Biden administration to facilitate the aircraft transfer.

But Poland’s announcement could also reflect its own sensitivities.

Poland is supporting Ukraine with defensive weapons, but has said it would not send jets as it is not a direct party to the conflict between Ukraine — which is not a NATO ally — and Russia.

Russia’s Defense Ministry warned this week that countries offering air fields to Ukraine for attacks on Russia may be considered as having entered the conflict.

Nuland said the main issue was to assess what Poland’s immediate needs would be given it is adjacent to the conflict.

“Poland — they benefit from full air security from the NATO alliance. … The main issue is to evaluate what Poland’s immediate needs are in the context of being a neighbor of this conflict,” she said.

Separately, the U.S. military announced it would reposition two Patriot missile batteries to Poland to proactively “counter any potential threat to U.S. and Allied forces and NATO territory.”",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/03/09/world/us-poland-fighter-jets-ukraine/

Vice President Kamala Harris’ trip to Warsaw to thank Poland for taking in hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion took an unexpected turn before she even left Washington. She’ll be parachuting into the middle of unexpected diplomatic turbulence over fighter jets.The Polish government on Tuesday came out with a plan to transfer its Russian-made fighter planes to a U.S. military base in Germany, with the expectation that the planes would then be handed over to Ukrainian pilots trying to fend off Russian forces. In turn, the U.S. would supply Poland with U.S.-made jets with “corresponding capabilities.”But the Poles didn’t run that idea past the Biden administration before going public with it, and the Pentagon quickly dismissed the idea as not tenable.It was a rare moment of disharmony in what has been a largely united effort by NATO allies to assist Ukraine without getting embroiled in a wider war with Russia.And it meant Harris was flying into fractious terrain Wednesday as she opens a two-day visit to Poland and Romania and tries to patch things up.“This fighter jet situation is a messy deal, and Harris will have to go there and smooth things out,” said Daniel Fried, who served as U.S. ambassador to Poland for President Bill Clinton and was a senior adviser in the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. “There’s plenty of discussion on the way ahead that needs to be had with the Poles that is better to have in an in-person conversation.”Harris is expected to continue talks with the Poles about getting fighter jets to the Ukrainians during her visit to Warsaw, according to a senior administration official who previewed the trip on the condition of anonymity. The matter remains a priority to the Biden administration, the official added.Harris is slated to meet on Thursday with Polish President Andrzej Sebastian Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki as well as with Ukrainians who have fled to Poland. She’ll also meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau while in Warsaw. Trudeau has been in Europe this week meeting with Ukraine allies.Harris will travel on Friday to Bucharest, where she’s to meet Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.The vice president also is expected to use the meetings in Poland and Romania to underscore the U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance and the need for continued humanitarian and military assistance for Ukraine. She’ll also highlight the need for allies to continue their close coordination moving forward.Biden has applauded Poland and other eastern European countries for stepping up in the midst of what’s become an enormous humanitarian crisis that is only growing. Some 2 million people have fled Ukraine, and more than half of the refugees have arrived in Poland.Biden on Tuesday said he was committed to helping Ukraine’s neighbors bear some of the financial pain of assisting refugees. He previously deployed 4,700 additional U.S. troops to Poland to bolster the defense of the eastern flank NATO ally.“I’ve made it clear that the United States will share in the responsibility of caring for the refugees so the costs do not fall entirely on the European countries bordering Ukraine,” Biden said. He had been looking to Congress to pass a $14 billion aid package to assist Ukraine and its eastern European allies.Hours after Biden spoke, Poland blindsided the White House with its proposal.Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of state for political affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that she saw the Polish government’s announcement as she was driving to Capitol Hill to testify.Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. called it “curious” for Poland to announce its plan “without alerting us first.”Secretary of State Antony Blinken did say on Sunday that the U.S. was working with Poland on plans to supply Ukraine with fighter jets and to “backfill” Poland’s needs. The Polish government, however, made clear that it would not send its fighter jets directly to Ukraine or allow its airports to be used.And Poland’s idea of transferring its MiGs to the U.S. did not come up during the talks with Blinken, according to a U.S. official familiar with the talks.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the delicate matter, said White House officials did not think the proposal would easily solve logistical challenges of providing aircraft to Ukraine and questioned the logic of transferring the planes to a major NATO base in Germany only to move them back to eastern Europe.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been pleading for NATO to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine or provide Ukraine with fighter jets. NATO has nixed the no-fly zone idea, saying such a move would lead to the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II and spread further.Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said late Tuesday he hoped the administration could work out a better agreement with Poland. “I hope they can go back to Poland, renegotiate this and give them assurances that we will deliver” fighter jets, he said.McCaul also said that more lethal drones could be another option to help provide air power to the Ukrainians.Despite the disconnect over Poland’s proposal, the White House remained intent on dispatching Harris to Poland and Romania, as it looks to spotlight efforts to build a unified front with European neighbors and western allies.Harris traveled to the Munich Security Conference last month to rally European allies in the days ahead of the invasion. She also met with Zelenskyy and other European officials.“The vice president’s trip to Poland and to Europe is part of our effort to show our strong support for our NATO allies and partners, the security assistance they’ve been providing, their role in accepting and welcoming refugees from Ukraine,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.",https://www.kcra.com/article/vice-president-kamala-harris-heads-to-poland-amid-turbulence-jets-ukraine/39381685
