The pictures of soldiers were released by the Ukrainian military. ""Soldiers of the 93rd Mechanized Brigade captured two Russian occupiers, they were from 423rd Yampol Motorized Rifle Regiment, military unit 91701,"" Ukraine's defence ministry wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, warfare is also actively being pushed by the Ukrainian defence ministry. Notably, hundreds of thousands of civilians have deserted war-torn Ukraine as a result of Moscow's military attacks on several Ukrainian cities.

Meanwhile, reports have emerged that the Ukrainian government has encouraged its citizens to join the military line in order to support and assist the country at this time of crisis. ""Anyone who is ready and able to hold a weapon can join the ranks of the Territorial Defence Forces,"" Ukraine's Defence Minister, Oleksii Reznikov, stated, ANI reported.

Ukraine seeks help from foreign leaders

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has requested foreign leaders to help secure the country's airspace against Russian attacks. Igor Polikha, the Ukrainian ambassador to India, has also urged India to speak to Russia about the current situation. He expressed confidence in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ability to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin.

NATO to strengthen its defence capabilities on its eastern flank

It is pertinent to mention here that North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has agreed to bolster its land, sea, and air capabilities on its eastern flank, which is close to Ukraine. NATO ambassadors said in a statement, released after emergency discussions on Thursday, that their forces had boosted their readiness to respond to all scenarios. ""We have decided, in line with our defensive planning to protect all allies, to take additional steps to further strengthen deterrence and defence across the Alliance,"" NATO ambassadors said in a statement, as per Sputnik news agency.

Harrowing images from the Ukrainian capital show burning vehicles, buildings blasted by missiles and flames lighting up the night sky.

Meanwhile, air raid sirens tonight rang out over the capital, warning civilians to head to safety ahead of another night of Russian shelling.

At least 198 Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed and 1,115 people wounded so far, the Ukrainian government has said.

Speaking to Sky News before he went to the front, Mr Yurash said Russian forces were about 1.8 to 2.5 miles from where he was.

""Russians don't have a good time here, to say the least,"" he said.

""We have hundreds of POWs, we are issuing videos, showing Russians coming to Ukraine.""

He said Ukrainians ""don't have a choice"" when it comes to fighting Russia as Putin has ""time and again tried to denounce the very idea of Ukraine"".

""Everything is at stake, I'm no soldier, I don't have much experience with the gun.

""When you are fighting for your life you learn very quick. The reality is Ukraine doesn’t have a choice.

""Russia wants to destroy us and we will not let that happen. I was born in independent Ukraine and I will die in independent Ukraine.""

Latest in Ukraine...

Mr Yurash was echoing the defiance of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who refused a US offer of evacuation reportedly saying: ""I need ammo not a ride.""

""The fight is here,"" he told US officials amid as Russian forces stormed the capital, encountering fierce Ukrainian resistance.

In video messages, he also quashed rumours he has called for a surrender.

""We will not put down weapons, we will defend our state. Glory to our defenders, both male and female. Glory to Ukraine!""

Ahead of the fighting, Zelenskyy said he was top of tyrant Vladimir Putin's hitlist as he warned that Ukraine's outgunned warriors faced a long and hard night.

But he warned bully Putin that Friday night would prove to be ""very difficult"" as Russia looks to use all available forces to break Ukraine's resistance.

He told his nation in a stirring battle address: ""We have to persevere tonight.""

Ukrainian Interior Ministry said there was ""active fighting on the streets of our city"" as the conflict intensified and later air raid sirens were heard in Kyiv, sending soldiers and civilians scrambling for cover.

As Russia forces tried to fight their way through the streets of the capital, during the night, dramatic video showed a blazing vehicle on Kyiv's Peremohy (Victory) Avenue .

With dawn breaking over the city, the extent of the damage inflicted on Kyiv became clear with images showing smouldering blocks of flats.

Fighting appeared to be raging close to Igor Sikorsky Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany) in Kyiv with video residential tower blocks hit by missiles and residents pulled from the rubble.

Soldiers were seen next to the charred remains on vehicles in the city's roads.

Ukraine's government claim Russian troops fought against their forces near Beresteiska metro station, just five miles from Maidan (Independence) Square, the central point of Kyiv.

Russian troops also attacked an army base in the city but were successfully repelled, Ukraine's military claimed in a Facebook post early on Saturday.

Ukraine's Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said: ""We are stopping the horde as best as we can, the situation in Kyiv is under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our citizens.""

Separately, the Interfax Ukraine agency said Russian soldiers were trying to capture one of Kyiv's electricity generating stations.

Loud artillery blasts were heard coming from close to the city centre, while a reporter for the Kyiv Independent claimed ""extremely hard combat"" was underway near Kyiv Zoo.

Google Maps is showing a number of major roads in and out of the city have been closed, including around Maidan Square, and major thoroughfares leading to and from the city's airports.

Residents have been urged to stay inside shelters, including underground stations and hotel basements.

Outside of Kyiv, air raid sirens were heard in multiple Ukrainian cities, including Lviv, Lutsk, Rivne, Uman, and Vinnytsia.

It follows a similar warning from Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko that Friday night would be ""very difficult"" for the city of almost 3 million people.

""The situation now - without exaggeration - is threatening for Kyiv,"" he said. ""The night, close to the morning, will be very difficult.""

STREET FIGHTING

Ukraine's Defence Ministry has urged people in Kyiv to make their own petrol bombs to repel the Russian invaders.

More than 10,000 assault rifles have been handed out to ordinary citizens in the city as part of a last-ditch defence of the capital.

Ukrainians have pledged to fight to the death to defend their country, after President Zelenskyy urged his country's military to ""take power in your own hands"".

A number of Ukrainians have also reportedly made Molotov cocktails to fight off the onrushing Russian forces.

Kira Rudik, 36, a Ukrainian MP, shared a picture of herself holding a Kalashnikov, after vowing to stay and fight.

She tweeted: ""I learn to use Kalashnikov and prepare to bear arms. It sounds surreal as just a few days ago it would never come to my mind. Our women will protect our soil the same way as our men!""

If verified, the attack could be the biggest single loss of life yet suffered by Russian invaders.

Ukraine armed forces general staff made the claim as Putin’s fighters struggled to find a foothold in Kyiv on the second day of the campaign.

Illia Ponomarenko, defence reporter with The Kyiv Independent newspaper, reported just before 4am Ukrainian time (2am GMT) that a second Russian Ilyushin Il-76 had been downed.

Quoting Ukraine's State Agency for Special Communications, he said the fighter jet was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 48 miles southwest of Kyiv city centre.

On Thursday night, 13 Ukrainian soldiers told a Russian warship to ""go f*** themselves"" as they made a heroic last stand.

Tasked with defending Snake Island in the Black Sea, the defiant border guards were ordered to surrender by a Russian warship.

A brave Ukrainian woman was also filmed confronting two Russian soldiers in the port city of Henichesk, less than 18 miles from the annexed territory of Crimea.

Russia has ramped up its efforts to seize control of Ukraine after making slower-than-expected progress on Wednesday and Thursday, allegedly killing civilians in the process.

Ukraine claims it has killed or captured 2,800 troops, destroyed 80 tanks, and shot down seven warplanes as their troops launched a bloody resistance against the Russians.

Meanwhile, the PM has also promised to crack down on Russian oligarchs funneling dirty money through the UK.

And Russia’s central bank was frozen, and banned from the German SWIFT system.

Ursula von der Leyen said the measures would “cripple Putin’s ability to finance his war machine.

It follows a day of fighting which saw Russian forces reportedly fail to gain as much ground as expected.

Earlier on Friday, Russia was accused of bombing a nursery after pictures emerged showing the school in the eastern Ukrainian city of Okhtyrka ""surrounded by bodies"".

Bodies of at least two adults were seen lying outside the ""Sunshine"" nursery in pools of blood as people crouched alongside them.

The front of the building - which has a sandpit, play area, and slide - appears blown out with its shutters scattered on the ground.

Kyiv's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia of war crimes and said his government was putting together a report which it would send to the Hague.

In another disturbing video, a Russian tank was filmed driving over a moving car in Kyiv, completely crushing it.

It reversed off the vehicle before ordinary people were able to prise the driver out of the flattened car using axes and other tools.

Miraculously, the elderly man behind the wheel survived the shocking incident.

Elsewhere, a soldier blew himself up on a bridge to stop Russians storming in from Crimea.

And a viral video clip showed a fearless man walking up to armoured cars.

Fierce exchanges erupted through the day five miles north of Kyiv city centre as fighters engaged Russians arriving in attack helicopters.

Putin’s elite Spetsnaz troops backed by undercover assassins and armoured vehicles were reported to be locked in gun battles in Kyiv’s suburbs while the main Russian force lay in wait 30 miles north.

The UK’s Chief of Defence Intelligence Lt Gen Sir Jim Hockenhull warned Russia would continue its bombardment and encirclement today.

He said: ""Russian forces continue to advance on two axes towards Kyiv. Their objective is to encircle the capital to secure control of the population and change the regime.""

A crazed Putin doubled-down on his verbal attacks on Friday, calling on the Ukrainians to turn on their ""drug-addicted neo-Nazi"" leaders or lay down their arms and go home.

Western intelligence sources confirmed that Russians were trying to encircle Kyiv but were being beaten back.

A security source said: ""The Ukrainians have done excellent work taking down bridges to slow them.

""Russia has largely not met its Day One objectives and its battleplan ­timings are slipping. The conflict is the choice of Putin, this is now not a war of choice, but one of necessity, so he has to win.

""He would resort to any means necessary. If we do end up with significant urban fighting I have a concern for the way Russia would use indiscriminate force.""

In Russia, there has been backlash to the invasion, both from ordinary Russians and public figures.

More than 1,500 have been detained in protests across the country, while the daughter of Chelsea's owner Roman Abramovich was among those who appeared to criticise Putin's actions.

An anonymous NATO official said between 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops have died.

A pro-Kremlin tabloid this week ran a report that nearly 10,000 Russian troops have been killed.

NATO released a new estimate that up to 40,000 Russian troops have been injured, captured, or killed in the first month of Russia's war on Ukraine.

An anonymous NATO official spoke to media outlets including NBC and the AP, confirming the number. The official said that per NATO's most recent intelligence assessment, between 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops have died in the conflict.

The NATO estimate aligns with an estimate released by US intelligence, which pegged the Russian death toll at around 7,000 people.

A senior US official told reporters on a conference call attended by NBC that it is difficult to give casualty counts because the US does not have boots on the ground in Ukrainian territory.

""I'm not going to characterize what the ranges are that we're looking at because they're just very broad and we continue to have low confidence in those estimates because we're not on the ground and can't see, you know, what's really going on on a day to day basis,"" said the official, who declined to be named.

However, the same official told reporters that Russian forces have faced many logistical issues, and are suffering from low morale.

The NATO estimate comes the same week that the pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda reported almost 10,000 Russian troops had been killed in the conflict. It cited numbers from the Russian Ministry of Defense saying 9,861 Russian troops had died, and 16,153 soldiers were injured. The story was later taken down.

Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, in an unprovoked assault that was the biggest military offensive in Europe since World War II. However, the last month has seen strong resistance from Ukraine, with reports of Russian tanks being destroyed and Russian troops suffering from frostbite because of inadequate gear. Ukraine also says it has killed at least five Russian generals.

The group is reportedly preparing a complaint for the Chief Military Prosecutor’s Office alleging that their sons only recently joined the military as conscripts and were told they were going to the border with Ukraine for drills. But their statuses were then abruptly changed to contract soldiers— a role for those with more combat and training experience—and they were suddenly thrust into war.

“They are switching entire regiments to contract [soldiers,] although the guys did not submit any formal requests for this, and took no such initiative. There are instances of physical violence, and beatings of those who refuse to become contract soldiers. And after that it’s completely unknown [what happens to them], because they take away their phones,” Andrei Kurochkin, the deputy chairman of the group, told Takie Dela.

“We've had a flurry of calls from scared mothers all over Russia. They are crying, they don’t know if their children are alive or healthy,” he was quoted saying, adding that it’s a “complete catastrophe” when military service is performed “under duress.”

“If there is a war, then professionals should deal with it, and not untrained ‘green’ guys,” Kurochkin said.

After hours of battles in multiple cities on Thursday, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said Russian troops had suffered losses, though they stopped short of providing specific figures. As of Thursday evening, the Russian soldiers were taking “an operational pause and regrouping,” the ministry said.

Ukrainian authorities said two Russian soldiers were also captured.

The claims that some Russian soldiers were literally forced into the war with Ukraine come after Britain’s Defense Ministry released footage it said showed Russia was using mobile crematoriums to conceal its own soldiers’ deaths from the world.

Defense Minister Ben Wallace told The Telegraph the vehicle-mounted crematoriums “evaporate” each body placed inside them.

He described the crematoriums as a “very chilling side effect of how the Russians view their forces.”

“If I was a soldier and knew that my generals had so little faith in me that they followed me around the battlefield with a mobile crematorium, or I was the mother or father of a son, potentially deployed into a combat zone, and my government thought that the way to cover up loss was mobile crematorium, I'd be deeply, deeply worried,” Wallace was quoted saying.

Amid a worldwide outcry over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin has been quick to stifle dissent at home. Numerous protests were staged in cities across the country on Thursday, but they were quickly dispersed by riot police who bundled protesters into police vans. OVD-Info, a media resource that tracks arrests during mass protests, reported more than 1,500 arrests in multiple cities.",https://www.thedailybeast.com/russia-used-beatings-and-tricks-to-forcibly-send-soldiers-to-ukraine-human-rights-group-says
