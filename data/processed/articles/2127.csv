Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed Friday that Russian forces staged a ""successful landing operation"" to capture Hostomel airfield on the outskirts of Kyiv.

""More than 200 Russian helicopters were involved in the operation,"" according to the statement. ""The success of the landing was ensured by the suppression of the entire air defense system in the landing area, the complete isolation of the combat area from the air and the active conduct of electronic warfare.""

Konashenkov claimed that Russian forces killed more than 200 of the opposing forces and that there were no casualties among in the Russian Armed Forces.

CNN could not immediately corroborate those claims, but a CNN team on the ground witnessed Russian airborne troops taking positions at the airfield Thursday.

The Russian statement claimed ‚Äî without evidence ‚Äî that US military and intelligence advisers have instructed Ukrainian military leaders to place rocket artillery systems in residential areas to provoke return fire on local residents, echoing propaganda claims that the Russian military has made in Syria to counter allegations of civilian casualties caused by Russian strikes.

""I appeal to Ukrainian citizens,"" Konashenkov said. ""Your nationalist leadership uses the same methods as the terrorists. They want to use you as a human shield. The Russian Armed Forces will not inflict any strikes on residential areas of the Ukrainian capital.""

More context: Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what appears to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.

The press service of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine announced this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.

""The city of Hostomel is under the control of Ukrainian troops‚Ä¶ At least 50 invaders from the 31st Separate Guards Air Assault Brigade (Ulyanovsk) were killed in the battles for Hostomel. From the Ukrainian side, fighters of the special forces of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, the 3rd Separate Special Forces Regiment named after Prince Svyatoslav the Brave and the group of local resistance took part in the battles. The Ukrainian military seized numerous trophies. Among them are weapons, military equipment, staff and personal documents,"" the statement reads.

According to the report, the usable weapons seized from the enemy were handed over to local resistance groups.

According to the report, the destroyed invaders did not have military badges and any identity documents, except for vaccination certificates and blank medical books.

The press service also recalled that Hostomel is one of the strategic suburbs of Kyiv. Fighting for control of the city has been going on since the beginning of Russian aggression. Here is the airfield, over which the invaders seek to take control in order to land paratroopers and cargo.

While several major airports around Ukraine have reported shelling, a CNN reporter found Russian troops inside Hostomel Airport Thursday morning, Feb. 24. Hostomel is a small cargo field to the northwest of Kyiv that is also known as Antonov Airport, for the Antonov aircraft company based there.

A wide range of social media videos appeared to capture the attack in real time, with Russian Ka-52 and Ka-50 attack helicopters and Mi-17 troop transports seen swarming over Ukrainian heads. Several pass over identifiable landmarks in Kyiv.

One video emerged of what appears to be the crash of a Ka-52 or Ka-50 in a body of water said to be Vyshhorod, an estuary area just north of Kyiv, and about 10 miles from the Hostomel Airport. The video catches debris impacting into a wide body of water as a large hulk burns, and a parachutist descends behind it under an ejection-style parachute.

The simple, non-steerable parachute that lands near the crash appears to have survival equipment hung below it but no obvious weapons or combat gear, indicative of an ejection. The Russian Ka-52 and 50 models are both equipped with ejection seats, a rarity among helicopters. In the event of an ejection, the rotors above the pilot are blown off with explosive charges to clear a path.

Another video shows a large flight of what look like Mi-17s (or the similar Mi-8s) taking direct ground fire and deploying flares. The Mi-17 ‚Äî the design of which dates to the 1970s ‚Äî can carry about two dozen troops, roughly on par with the United States‚Äô CV-22 Osprey.

The Mi-17s appear to be passing over the curved breakwater of the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant, flying east. That path is on a direct line with Hostomel Airport.

Another widely shared video appears to show the remains of another Ka-52 after a forced landing with extensive battle damage and spent rocket tubes. The helicopter appears to be carrying laser-guided Vikhr air-to-ground missiles. An attached note claiming to have captured the pilot could not be confirmed.

Not only that the VKS paid a hefty price just to bring the airborne troops to their target (it lost 6-7 helicopters, including two confirmed Ka-52s), but then the expected para-jump didn‚Äôt take place.

Well, it seems the Russian heliborne assault on Antonov/Gostomel/Hostomel Airport, 15km NW of Kiev, ended in a complete catastrophe.

Not only that the VKS paid a hefty price just to bring the airborne troops to their target (it lost 6-7 helicopters, including two confirmed Ka-52s; several of these to Ukrainian MiG-29s), but then the expected para-jump didn‚Äôt take place. Obviously, the Ukrainian air defences are still up, and the Russians couldn‚Äôt fly in the expected 18-20 Il-76s.

The Russian VDV held out as long as supported by their air force, this afternoon. But, later on, the 4th Rapid Response Brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard counterattacked with support from the Ukrainian Air Force (the photo in this post shows an Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-24M bombing the Russians there).

What was left of the VDV was then finished by the 45th (Ukrainian) Spetsnaz Brigade: few survivors scattered and run away into the nearby forests.

As we have previously explained, in the framework of the invasion carried out by Vladimir Putin‚Äôs government a confrontation between Russian and Ukrainian troops took place at Hostomel airport in the vicinity of Kiev.

Hostomel is known as Antonov Airport as it was built by the aircraft manufacturer and is used as a test site.

As reported by Aviacionline.com, Hostomel is also home of the world‚Äôs largest and heaviest aircraft ever built, the Antonov AN-225 Mriya. Various media outlets and social media accounts have reported that the massive cargo aircraft was destroyed when the hangar housing it caught fire.

But in the afternoon of Feb. 24, 2022, Dmitry Antonov, chief pilot of Antonov Airlines, owner of the AN-225, assured that the Mriya is intact with a post on his Facebook account.

The Strategic AirLift International Solution (SALIS) is based at Hostomel too. SALIS is a programme created to provide unique air transport capability (outsized cargo) for its participating nations. Currently, a group of nine NATO Allies (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) are benefiting from the programme.

Russian airborne troops seized control of the Gostomel airfield, but Ukraine's leader President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed that they would be encircled and crushed.

""The enemy paratroopers in Gostomel have been blocked, and troops have received an order to destroy them,"" Zelensky said, in a video address.

Earlier AFP reporters had seen helicopters flying low over the city from the north and Ukraine's commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhny, had confirmed: ""Fighting is underway for Gostomel airfield.""

The Gostomel airfield, which is alongside the Antonov airport, is immediately on the northern edge of Kiev, and the fighting there is the closest that Russian forces had got to the Ukrainian capital on the first day of their invasion.

Lyudmila Klimova, a 58-year-old who lives nearby, said: ""The base is smoking over there, it was bombed, our houses are nearby. We don't know where to run, my parents are here, my sister.

""Russian troops are there, a friend of mine lives there, and the Russians have already approached his mother with a machine gun.""

Alexander Kovtonenko, a 30-year-old civilian also living nearby, said that two fighter jets had fired missiles at Ukrainian ground units as the assault got underway.

""Then there was shooting, it lasted three hours,"" he told AFP. ""Then three more jets flew in and they started shooting again.""

Smoke was rising from the scene and social media images appeared to show an assault by helicopter-borne troops. CNN showed footage of Russian troops at the airport and a reporter said he had spoken to them.

Earlier, Ukrainian border guards had confirmed that Russian ground forces equipped with tanks had also crossed south over the Belarus-Ukraine border into the Kyiv administrative region, headed towards the capital.

The main Russian advance on the first day of the operation also came from the occupied region of Crimea, from where armoured columns pressed quickly towards the southern city of Kherson.

The Kherson regional government said 13 civilians had been killed, including two children, and nine Ukrainian soldiers have died during the fighting in the area.
