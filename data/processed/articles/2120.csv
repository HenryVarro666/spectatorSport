Russia launches a massive attack against Ukraine

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine early on Thursday, starting a war with the European nation. Vladimir Putin announced the military operation into Ukraine at 5:55 am Moscow time ‚Äì and minutes later the first shelling and missiles were launched into Ukraine.

A 19-year-old Greek woman living in Kyiv, Ukraine described scenes of chaos following Russia‚Äôs attack.

The woman who only gave her first name of Nikki, appealed for help through Greek Reporter, saying that ‚Äúis really scared.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to live, I want peace,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThey tell us not to panic and be calm but it‚Äôs very difficult. We do not know what will happen from one minute to the next,‚Äù Nikki says.

Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine Thursday ranked among the ‚Äúdarkest hours for Europe‚Äù in nearly 80 years, according to the European Union‚Äôs foreign policy chief.

‚ÄúThese are among the darkest hours for Europe since the end of World War II,‚Äù EU High Representative Josep Borrell told reporters.

Borrell promised ‚Äúurgent assistance to Ukraine,‚Äù as well as supporting evacuation efforts, including of EU staff.

EU sanctions are in the pipeline as well. Speaking alongside EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Borrell said punitive measures from the 27-member bloc against Russia would be ‚Äúthe harshest packet of sanctions that has ever been implemented.‚Äù

Von der Leyen said she will present ‚Äúmassive and strategic‚Äù sanctions against Russia for approval later today.",https://greekreporter.com/2022/02/24/dramatic-footage-russia-air-assault-kyiv-ukraine/

Riding point for the formation was lethal-looking two-seater Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopters with distinctive double-rotors, side-mounted 30-millimeter cannons, and a dozen Ataka anti-tank guided missiles on stub wings.

But the Alligators were but the escort for the real strike force: Mi-8 ‚ÄòHip‚Äô assault transports carrying a more lethal cargo: up to 300 elite Russian airborne soldiers. Reportedly the paratroopers may have come from the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade.

The paratroopers, or desantniki, weren‚Äôt heading for Kyiv itself, but rather Antonov Airport ten miles northwest on the outskirts of the metropolis. Also known as Hostomel or Gostomel after the nearby town, Antonov Airport was operated by the former chief manufacturer of Soviet transport aircraft, and its 2.17 mile-long runway was used principally for cargo flights and aircraft testing.

The airport‚Äôs most famous resident was the world‚Äôs heaviest and widest cargo aircraft (in terms of wingspan) ever made: the only ever built Antonov An-225 Mriya (‚ÄúDream‚Äù), which has remained in demand to deliver oversized cargoes across the world on short notice, most recently shipment of Covid-treating medicines.

If the Russian assault went as planned, Antonov could be used to land thousands of additional airborne soldiers and their light armored vehicles by cargo plane, allowing Russian troops to begin tightening the noose around the Ukrainian capital even before Russian mechanized armies fought their way in.

Cell phone cameras recorded the helicopters‚Äô approach which evoked the famous aerial assault scene in the Vietnam war film Apocalypse Now.

Kyiv soon admitted the desantniki had seized control of an airport right on its doorstep.

But Russia‚Äôs ambitious airborne assault was a high-risk affair. It meant flying a bunch of helicopters in proximity to numerous short-range air defense systems‚Äîoften using heat-seeking missiles instead of radar guidance, and thus not disabled by Russian air defense suppression strikes targeting Ukrainian radars.

The other problem was that openly inserting a small infantry unit deep behind enemy lines‚Äîsay right next to the capital‚Äîis very risky, a move predicated on hopes that Ukrainian forces would be in such disarray they would be unable to mount a counter-attack.

So despite the overwhelming scale of Russia‚Äôs assault on Ukraine, the gambit for Antonov Airport did not go as planned.

Alligators in the Dnieper River

As Russian helicopters skimmed south along the Dnieper River dividing Kiev toward and Hostomel, they came under fire from small arms and man-portable surface-to-air missiles‚Äîlikely Soviet Strela or Iglas-S missiles and/or possibly Piorun and U.S.-built Stinger missiles recently transferred from Poland and Lithuania respectively. Short-range air defense vehicles with autocannons and their own short-range missiles may also have engaged.

Aware of their peril, helicopters pumped out scores of brilliant flares in the hopes of decoying heat-seeking missiles. But it did not prove enough. One of the Alligators was struck and fell into the Dnieper, smoke pouring upwards into the sky even after its immersion.

Both the helicopter‚Äôs crew members ejected‚Äîan unique capability of the Ka-52 found in a few other helicopters‚Äîlofted down into the water as well.

Another Alligator appears to have sustained so much damage it was forced to crash land. Footage of the empty cockpit implies both crew members escaped.

Ukrainian sources claim a third helicopter downed, though confirmation is unavailable, with some alleging a Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter made the kill.

Counterattack

Contrary to Russian hopes, Kyiv‚Äôs defenders were not so disorganized as to fail to assess both the small size of the paratrooper force and the danger an enemy airheadt next to the capital posed if let uncontested. Indeed, after 10 AM a Ukrainian told a journalist their intelligence reported eighteen Il-76MD troop transports bound towards Kyiv had taken off from Pskov, base of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division.

First, the 4th Rapid Response Brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard surrounded the airport. This was a new model unit organized according to NATO standards combining light infantry, a battalion of T-64BV main battle tanks, an artillery battery and supporting surveillance drones.

Lacking armored vehicles, the Russian airborne at Hostomel depended on air support to stave off Ukrainian attack. Russian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack jets were recorded flying in for strikes.

But Ukrainian warplanes‚Äîhaving remarkably escaped Russia‚Äôs first strike‚Äîpounded the airfield in return, with an image showing two of Ukraine‚Äôs swing-wing Su-24M ‚ÄòFencer‚Äô bombers swooping over the airfield and releasing a brace of bombs, as well as flares for self-defense.

Another video recorded from a civilian home near Hostomel shows a Ukrainian MiG-29 skimming over rooftops and launching what appear to be unguided S-8 rockets terrifyingly close to the recorder‚Äîreportedly targeting either withdrawing Russian airborne infantry, or a Russian helicopter per various sources.

Eventually, Ukrainian minister Oleksiy Arestovych claimed the airport had been secured by Ukrainian forces. But twenty minutes later he issued a partial retraction‚Äîa mopping up operation was still ongoing. When CNN‚Äôs Matthew Chance arrived at the airport gate he encountered Russian, not Ukrainian soldiers he was expecting.

Later that evening, the Russian airborne were allegedly driven from the airport, though the remaining elements continued skirmishing in the woods outside of it.

Some accounts claim Ukraine‚Äôs ‚Äò45th Spetsnaz Brigade‚Äô was responsible for the final assault, but this appears to refer only to a Russian, not Ukrainian, unit. Instead, at 10 PM local time, the 4th Brigade‚Äôs Facebook page posted an image of soldiers holding a seemingly bullet-riddled battle flag celebrating the victory.

On the same site, Antonov Airline‚Äôs chief pilot assured that the legendary An-225 remained undamaged, contrary to earlier reports claiming its hangar had caught fire.

Russia strikes back

Kyiv‚Äôs forces may have sought to render Hostomel inoperable by demolishing or obstructing its runway after the battle. That‚Äôs because Russian forces crossing the Ukraine-Belarus border had reportedly penetrated through the Exclusion Zone around Chernobyl and were rolling towards northwestern Kyiv.

Furthermore, a contingent of Spetsnaz special forces infiltrated into Kyiv wearing Ukrainian military uniforms‚Äîincidentally, a violation of Article 39 of the Geneva Convention‚Äîsprang into action, causing small arms fire to echo throughout the capital.

Videos recorded from high-rise apartments in the northern Obolon suburb show a Spetsnaz- gun truck riddled by fire from Ukrainian troops, while a hijacked Strela-10 (SA-8) tracked air defense vehicles races away‚Äîonly to run over a civilian car driving from the opposite direction. Remarkably the elderly man inside survived and was hospitalized for treatment.

Fighting meanwhile continued around Hostomel with remnants of the Russian airborne, who may have been reinforced by Spetsnaz or by Russian mechanized elements. Finally around 2 PM local time on February 25, Russia‚Äôs ministry of defense claimed it had recaptured Antonov Airport supposedly in an operation involving 200 helicopters, a number unlikely to be accurate.

Nonetheless, video footage does appear to show Russian paratroopers manning a checkpoint at Hostomel.

While Ukraine‚Äôs victory at Hostomel may have proved ephemeral, it indicated that Ukraine‚Äôs military is neither paralyzed nor evaporating in the face of Russia‚Äôs assault like Georgia‚Äôs did in the 2008 Russo-Georgia war.

However, Ukraine‚Äôs capacity to defeat an arguably ill-advised Russian operational gambit does not assure future success. Russia is attacking Ukraine on so many fronts it can afford to be stalled in some areas, such as around Kharkiv and Mariupol, as long as breakthrough are achieved elsewhere, as has occurred in southern Ukraine at Kherson and Melitopol.

As Russia has yet to commit all its forces, it will likely use Soviet ‚Äòechelon‚Äô style tactic wherein troops withheld from the first wave are channeled down the most promising avenues of attack, or into as yet untested sectors deemed vulnerable.

Still, the battle at Hostomel suggests Putin‚Äôs unprovoked invasion will meet stiffer resistance than he apparently expected.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine posted a video on Twitter, telling the public not to believe false reports.

He was alive. Kyiv had not fallen. Any reports of Ukraine laying down its arms was a lie, Mr. Zelensky said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are not putting down any arms. We will protect our country, because our weapons are our truth. The truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will protect them all.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is it. That‚Äôs what I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.‚Äù

His comments, released before 9 a.m., came as fighting intensified in Kyiv. What until three days ago had been a thriving European metropolis has been transformed into a battle zone. Russian troops pressed in from all directions.

There was intense street fighting, and bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard across the city, including its heart, Maidan square, where in 2014 Ukrainian protests led to the toppling of a pro-Moscow government.

The Russian military has a decisive edge in cyberwarfare, tanks, heavy weaponry, missiles, fighter planes and warships. In sheer numbers, its military dwarfs that of Ukraine.

Russia has established attack lines into three cities ‚Äî Kyiv in the north, Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south ‚Äî and Ukrainian troops are fighting to hold all three. The Pentagon reported late Friday that the Russians did not appear to be in control of a single major population center. Significantly, a senior U.S. defense official said, Ukrainian command and control remains intact.

The Ukrainian government reported that hundreds of Russian soldiers had been killed in the war, along with scores of their own soldiers, while the Russian defense ministry issued a statement on Saturday morning that made no mention of any casualties or anything about the fight for Kyiv.

The Russian invasion started with targeted airstrikes before dawn on Thursday, but on the third day of the war, bloody battles were often being waged in close quarters. Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news site, citing witnesses, reported combat 400 yards from Maidan Square in central Kyiv.

All Ukrainian men of fighting are being drafted into service, and tens of thousands are signing up. Ukrainians were asked to make Molotov cocktails. And there were tearful scenes at airports in western Ukraine as wives kissed their husbands goodbye before they headed to front.

The nation has rallied around its president, Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian.

To him and other officials, the objective of the Russian invasion of a neighboring country that possessed no military threat is to topple the government.

Mr. Zelensky has said that he is ‚Äútarget no. 1.‚Äù

As battles were waged around the city on Saturday morning, there were reports of clashes near the city‚Äôs train station and along a central thoroughfare, Bohdan Khmelnitsky Street, leading from Victory Square toward the city center, according to the witness accounts. Along that street, closer to the city center, bursts of gunfire could be heard through the night.

‚ÄúWe are stopping the horde, so far as we can,‚Äù the secretary of the Ukrainian Security and Defense Council, Oleksy Danilov, said around 7 a.m. ‚ÄúThe situation is under control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and citizens of Kyiv.‚Äù

In dozens of interviews in the tense hours before the invasion and in the days after, Ukrainians struggled to understand how a country at peace so suddenly found itself at war. For many Ukrainians, the answer was found in Russia‚Äôs president, Vladimir V. Putin.

This is Mr. Putin‚Äôs war. But what frightened people perhaps as much as the threat of missiles and bombs was that they did not know what he wanted.

The fear was evident in the drive from Kyiv to a small village outside the city. Military convoys had replaced families going on vacation or visiting friends. Where once Kyiv was known as a city where the music played a touch too loud in its cafes, the incessant wail of air raid sirens drowned out all joy.

The fear was evident in the faces of the people seeking safety in Western Ukraine, after they emerged from 20-hour train rides in packed carriages that were kept pitch-black to avoid being targeting by Russian rockets.

From Lviv in the west to Odessa in the south and Kharkiv and nearly all points in between, people huddled in air raid shelters and lined up and bank machines and stocked up on essentials.

The An-225 is based at Hostomel Airport, sometimes referred to as Antonov Airport, which is used primarily as a commercial cargo hub. The airport is owned by the maker of the An-225, the Antonov aircraft manufacturing company, and is currently operated by its subsidiary, Antonov Airlines. According to FlightAware.com, the An-225 is confirmed to be at the airport after flying there from Billund, Denmark nearly three weeks ago.

Dmytro Antonov, a Captain for Antonov Airlines, reportedly posted a message to social media today stating that despite the airport falling to Russian forces, Mriya remains ‚Äúwhole.‚Äù

It's not clear if this means entirely undamaged or if it means the aircraft remains more or less intact.

The Mriya took its first flight in 1988, boasting a maximum take-off weight of 1.4 million pounds. For comparison, the U.S. Air Force‚Äôs largest cargo plane, the Lockheed Martin C-5 Galaxy, has a maximum take-off weight of around 840,000 pounds.

The Mriya is powered by six Progress D-18 turbofans and has a wingspan of 290 feet, the largest in the world aside from Stratolaunch's experimental Roc launcher aircraft. The plane carries as much fuel as fourteen 737-800s.

One of the primary roles the An-225 was designed for was to airlift the Energia rocket boosters and Buran orbiters for the Soviet space program, similar to NASA's highly-modified Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the cancellation of the Buran program, the Mriya sat dormant between 1993 and 2000. In 2001, the aircraft was refurbished for charter operations.

More recently, the truly massive aircraft was used to transport medical supplies around the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Footage published to social media today reportedly taken close to Hostomel Airport where Mriya is based shows clouds of black smoke rising as Russian Mi-8 helicopters fly overhead. BuzzFeed‚Äôs Christopher Miller reported earlier today that Ukrainian authorities confirmed that Russia has seized control of the airport.

CNN‚Äôs Matthew Chance, on location at the airport, said that the commander of the Russian airborne unit confirmed to him that they have taken control of the airport.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also confirmed that Ukraine has lost control of the airport that Mriya calls home.

Reuters reported earlier that Ukrainian officials said they had downed three Russian helicopters as they attacked the airport. There are also claims that the runway at the airport has been damaged, but these remain unconfirmed as of now.

The An-225 at Hostomel airport is the only one in existence, although a partially-completed fuselage of another has sat for decades at an Antonov plant outside Kyiv.

Now that Hostomel Airport has fallen to Russian forces, it's unclear what will become of Ukraine's ""Dream,"" the An-225 Mriya. It's possible Ukrainian forces will take it back, but any more fighting only invites a greater risk of damaging or even destroying the famous flying giant. We will be continuing our rolling coverage of the conflict in Ukraine as it develops and will update this story as more information about Mriya's fate surfaces.

UPDATE: 4:25 PM EST -

The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine now says that fighting continues at Hostomel airport, and that Ukrainian forces have prevented additional Russian troops from landing. It isn't clear what the current situation is, but it appears the airport is once again contested.

Satellite imagery from Planet Labs confirms that as of 10:02 AM local time yesterday, the An-225 was at Hostomel airport.

UPDATE:

The airfield is now back in control of Ukrainian forces. By every available indication, the battle that occurred there was a ferocious one. Details are very limited, but apparently, a contingent of Russian special forces flew to the airfield as reinforcements aboard a number of helicopters. Some claim as many as six of these helicopters were shot down with the loss of all those onboard. This happened in broad daylight, which put the helicopters at great risk. Once again, these details could change drastically at any time, but it seems Ukrainian forces scored a major victory today and Russia took a major loss. This airport was clearly seen as of extremely high value to Russian war planners.

As for the An-225, we have no idea if it survived all this.

UPDATE:

Antonov has given an update on its AN-225. It sounds like the plane is still intact, at least as of yesterday, although fighting is still going on around it. This also offers a final confirmation that it is indeed at the airport.
