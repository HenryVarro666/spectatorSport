Even though they had existed since 1799, when the air-raid siren was invented by the Scottish natural philosopher and physicist John Robison, these sirens were not used during World War I. However, during World War II, air raids were already being announced, and people were urged to escape to shelters or London Underground stations. Thus, as the aviation industry further developed, so did warning mechanisms, and a system of anti-aircraft sirens was developed in Britain between 1938 and 1939.

Air-raid sirens first sounded the warning in London in September 1939. They were electric and emitted two signals: a waxing and waning warning signal and a steady tone which meant that people could come out of their hiding place. They were later installed almost everywhere in response to Cold War tensions, both in the Eastern and Western Blocs (just for the record, sirens have only been used to warn of tornadoes in the US since the 1970s).

Air raid sirens were also sounded in the NATO bombings in Bosnia in 1995 and in what is now Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo in 1999, which, together with the Russian army’s bombing of the Chechen city of Grozny in the 1990s, were, fortunately, the last large-scale military air raids in Europe.

An occasional test of the public warning system in Slovakia may seem unpleasant for many; nevertheless, in a certain sense, it is a reminder of a terrible history when military air raids were a living memory and potentially a real threat. It is impossible to quantify precisely how many people have been saved by the early warning of air raid sirens, but to this day, their sound remains a symbol of moments that no one wishes to return.",http://www.electronic-sirens.com/a-brief-history-of-military-air-raids-and-warning-sirens/

With the ongoing situation in Russia and fears over its nuclear arsenal, many people are wondering what exactly would happen in the event of an attack on the UK.

There has never been a nuclear attack on the UK but there are plans in place if one was to be launched against the British Isles.

It is believed that if a nuclear weapon was launched at London from Moscow or central Asia, it would take around 20 minutes to arrive.

So what is the procedure and how will you know if Britain is about to be attacked?

Does Britain have air raid sirens?

Air raid sirens will be known to most in the UK as a staple during World War Two.

Images of civilian attacks such as the Blitz will stick in people’s minds, alongside the unmistakable high-pitched rising and falling of the siren.

A single note rang out to indicate that the threat was over.

Air raid sirens were used to warn those in the cities of an impending German air attack and allow them to either move to shelter or prepare their home.

While they were still commonplace in the UK during the Cold War, many have now disappeared from the streets.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former British Army chemical and nuclear weapons expert, told The Telegraph: “In the depths of the Cold War, we were very prepared and there was a realisation an attack was a reality.”

He added that there were “hundreds of bunkers around the country” but that much of this nuclear attack infrastructure “has gone into abeyance and crumbled”.

But fear not, as there is a plan in place from 2022.

How will UK citizens be alerted to a nuclear attack?

While the traditional air raid sirens may not be on our streets any more, a much more modern alert has been created by the government.

From early 2022, the UK Government is set to launch a new ‘Emergency Alerts’ system which will be used for a range of events.

This includes severe weather such as severe flooding and fires, and is likely to include large scale attacks such as a nuclear attack.

The plans are for a notification to be sent to every phone or tablet to those in the affected area with a warning and advice on how to stay safe.

Your phone or tablet may make a loud air raid-siren like noise, read the alert out and vibrate, even if the volume is turned or the device is on silent.

Will there be an emergency broadcast in the event of a nuclear attack?

In an event of an attack on the UK, TV stations are likely to play an air raid-style siren instead of usual programming to alert citizens to an imminent attack.

This would also likely be broadcast over radio too.

This would be similar to the ‘four-minute warning’ system, which was created during the Cold War.

Essentially this gave citizens a short term warning to seek shelter as an attack is imminent.

It also included a recording by Peter Donaldson of BBC Radio 4 which would have played in the immediate aftermath of the attack.

This message gave advice to those who had found shelter - including telling them not to leave, to ration food and water and providing a warning about radioactive fallout.

How likely is a nuclear attack on the UK?

The UK Government has said despite fears, the likelihood of an attack remains “remote”.

Speaking about the UK’s nuclear deterrence, the government did however warn: “The risk of nuclear conflict remains remote, but the threats the UK faces are increasing in scale, diversity and complexity. That is why we must be able to deter the most extreme acts of aggression against us and our NATO allies.”

Posters condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin were also spotted across central Kyiv.

Ukraine's armed forces in a statement on Monday said, ""All Russian efforts to occupy it have failed.""

However, Russia has urged civilians to evacuate Kyiv.

The United Nations (UN) estimates that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has already claimed the lives of 102 civilians, including at least seven children. At the same time, the crisis has reportedly displaced an estimated 100,000 Ukrainians who have fled to neighbouring countries.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday sought immediate membership of the European Union (EU) for his country.

Peace talks begin

Russian state media reported that peace talks between high-level delegations from Russia and Ukraine have begun at the Belarusian border. The peace talks are aimed at ending hostilities between the two countries.

On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert. The decision is being seen as retaliation for sanctions imposed by the West against Russia and its top leaders, including President Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

The European Union (EU), meanwhile, has closed off its airspace to Russian airlines. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen also pledged that the 27-nation bloc will bear the cost of procurement of arms for Ukraine.",https://www.indiatoday.in/world/russia-ukraine-war/story/air-raid-sirens-sounded-in-kyiv-russia-urges-ukrainians-to-evacuate-1918890-2022-02-28

Ukrainian media reported explosions and a gunfight in a nearby town.

According to Ukrainian news website Segodnya.ua, a bridge has been blown up near the town of Bucha west of Kyiv. It was unclear whether it had been bombed by Russian troops or destroyed by the Ukrainian side.

Anton Herashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's interior minister, said fighting was under way in Bucha with Russian forces that were trying to advance towards Kyiv.
