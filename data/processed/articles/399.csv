“[On Friday], after the Kyiv regime declared its readiness for negotiations, active hostilities in the main directions of the operation were suspended,” Ministry of Defence spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement on Saturday. “After the Ukrainian side abandoned the negotiation process, today all units were ordered to continue their offensive in all directions in accordance with the operation plan.”

A Ukrainian presidential adviser denied in the early hours Saturday that Ukraine had refused to negotiate.

Konashenkov’s remarks, also echoed by the Kremlin, were made after Western officials said the Russian invasion was not progressing as fast as Moscow would have expected.

Sahuquillo', 'Luis De Vega', 'El País']",2022-02-25 00:00:00,"Russia is prepared to send a delegation to Belarus to start negotiations with Ukraine, according to statements made on Friday by Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for the Kremlin. Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin is open to talks, but on his own conditions.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has offered to negotiate on one of Putin’s key demands: that Ukraine declare itself neutral and abandon its ambition of joining NATO, according to the Associated Press. The Kremlin responded that Russia was ready to send a delegation to Belarus to discuss the matter.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops continued to fight with advancing Russian forces just three kilometers (1.8 miles) from the parliament in the capital, Kyiv. The special correspondent for EL PAÍS, Luis de Vega, reported having witnessed intense exchanges of fire in the area near Havana bridge, one of the access points into the city and located three kilometers from Maidan square.

The crashing sound of Russian air strikes and the wailing of sirens have become the terrifying new soundtrack to the lives of Ukrainians following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision early Thursday to launch a full-blown invasion of the neighboring country.

At least 137 people, military and civilian, were reported dead by Ukrainian authorities on the first day of the full-scale invasion by Moscow, which the United States and the European Union have responded to with a new round of political and economic sanctions.

Russian forces were on Friday intensifying their attacks on Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million people. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry on Friday said on Twitter that Russian forces had entered the Obolon district, a few miles north of the city center. Just hours later they were approaching the parliament in Constitution Square.

“They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. It is a lie,” said President Zelenskiy in an address in the early hours of Friday. Zelenskiy, who described himself as “target number one” of the military offensive, also lamented what he sees as lack of sufficient support from the international community. “We’ve been left alone,” he said.

Russian special forces and airborne troops have also been trying to surround the Ukrainian army in the Donbas region, where Ukrainian secret services believe Moscow may have infiltrated paramilitary groups to attack from within and take full control of the long-disputed area. This plan could be carried out in various other locations in Ukraine, according to the same sources. The Kremlin’s goal could be to overthrow the Ukrainian government.

Thousands of people have fled west to cities such as Lviv, near the border with Poland, which are deemed safer. But air raid sirens were heard in Lviv on Friday morning as well, signaling the threat of air strikes. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Ukrainians were attempting to enter Poland and Hungary, in what Europe is already expecting to become a serious refugee crisis. The United Nations Refugee Agency has estimated that there are already around 100,000 displaced persons.

In Kyiv, nobody knew where the next air attack might take place, multiplying the collective feeling of anxiety and chaos. Everyone was seeking reliable information on how far Russian troops might be from the capital.

Residential building hit

“It’s a miracle,” said Anatoli, 50, his voice cracking. He was standing in front of a 10-story residential building that was bombed before dawn on Friday around 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) outside the city center. Right in front of the heavily damaged façade there was a huge crater caused by the impact of a missile. Police sources at the scene told EL PAÍS that five people had been injured by the blast, which took place at around 4am, when “everything shook and all the windows shattered inwards,” according to Anatoli.

The great big gaping hole in front of the 10-story building has been attracting local residents curious to see first-hand the magnitude of the damage. Many were taking photographs and videos to upload to social media. A little after 7am on Friday, the air raid sirens began blaring once again. People started to run for the nearest shelter, with many going down into the subway. In a nearby building, around 30 people sheltered in silence inside the boiler room.

In his address to the 44 million citizens of Ukraine in the early hours of Friday, President Zelenskiy confirmed multiple missile attacks in several parts of the country, and said that the Kremlin was targeting both civilian and military infrastructure. “They are killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets,” he said.

Ukraine’s Defense Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on social media that the last time Kyiv had experienced anything similar was “in 1941, when it was attacked by Nazi Germany.”

Ukrainian officials said 198 civilians, including three children, had been killed since Russia invaded on Thursday, and warned Russian saboteurs were active in Kyiv where explosions forced residents to flee underground.

Moscow said it fired cruise missiles at military targets, continuing the offensive after accusing Ukraine of having ""rejected"" talks.

But on day three of Russia's invasion, defiant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed his country would never give in to the Kremlin as Washington said the invading force had a ""lack of momentum.""

Ukraine's army said it held back an assault on the capital — but was fighting Russian ""sabotage groups"" that had infiltrated the city.

""We will fight until we have liberated our country,"" Zelensky said in a video message.

He earlier said Ukraine had ""derailed"" Moscow's plan to overthrow him and urged Russians to pressure President Vladimir Putin into stopping the conflict.

In retaliation for the invasion, the West said it would remove some Russian banks from the SWIFT bank messaging system, and froze Central Bank assets — essentially crippling Russia's trade with most of the world.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon estimates that roughly half of the more than 150,000-strong invasion force built up by Moscow on Ukraine's borders in recent months is now inside the country.

But there had been a ""lack of momentum over the last 24 hours,"" and the Russian military had still not gained air superiority over the country, a U.S. official said.

'I was trembling'

Ignoring warnings from the West, Putin on Thursday unleashed a full-scale invasion that the UN refugee agency says has forced almost 150,000 people to flee to neighbouring countries.

Tens of thousands more are estimated to be displaced within Ukraine.

In neighboring Romania, Olga, 36, was among hundreds to have crossed the Danube river with her three young children to safety.

""My husband came with us as far as the border, before returning to Kyiv to fight,"" she said.

Thousands have made their way to Poland by train.

""Attacks were everywhere,"" said Diana, 37, who fled the Ukrainian capital.

The fighting took place in the Obolon district of Kyiv, also known as Obolonsky. In an amateur video filmed 8 kilometres northwest of Kyiv’s Independence Square and posted on Twitter, small-arms fire could be heard in the neighbourhood as a tracked vehicle manoeuvred in the street. It was impossible to determine whether the tracked vehicle belonged to the Russian or Ukrainian military.

By midmorning Friday, Ukraine’s defence ministry said that Russian forces had entered the Obolon district. A large formation of Russian helicopters had attacked the Antonov cargo airport at Hostomel on the outskirts of the city on Thursday, and the Russian defence ministry said Friday the troops who landed at the airport had hooked up with other Russian troops in the western part of the city.

“After the Ukrainian side rejected the negotiation process, today all units were given orders to develop the advance from all directions in accordance with the operation’s plans,” Russian army spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a statement.

The Kremlin said Friday that Putin was ready to send a delegation to Belarus for talks with Ukraine but Ukraine wanted talks in Warsaw instead.

Ukraine says it is being attacked from several sides, including from Belarus.

Konashenkov has claimed that Russian forces have not targeted civilian areas, despite widespread evidence of this.

Ukraine said Saturday that at least 198 civilians -- including three children -- had been killed since Moscow launched the attack.

Russia has not said how many of its soldiers have been killed in the invasion, which it calls a “special military operation.”

Moscow has said that its goal is to “de-Nazify” Ukraine.

Earlier on Saturday, Russian forces captured the southeastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol, Russia’s Interfax news agency reported, as Moscow launched coordinated cruise missile and artillery strikes on several cities, including the capital Kyiv.

Later on Saturday, Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia’s Chechnya region and an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said that Chechen fighters had been deployed to Ukraine and urged Ukrainians to overthrow their government.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops had invaded the Obolon district, which is a suburb of the capital city, according to the Times.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Ukrainians during a televised public address that the capital of nearly 3 million people would be Russia’s “target number one.”

The city was bombarded early Friday as missile strikes hit numerous targets and a rocket struck a residential building in Russia’s second day of movement toward Kyiv in its military offensive, the Times notes.

People were urged to stay indoors as Russian troops grew near and entered Kyiv’s outskirts and the Ukrainian defense ministry encouraged residents to make Molotov cocktails to defend against the invasion, the Times reports.

On Thursday, Zelensky declared martial law in Ukraine and pressed for any able-bodied Ukrainian to enlist in defending the country. All men aged 18-60 are prohibited from exiting Ukraine under martial law, the Times reports.

Many Ukrainian men, however, are attempting to flee the capital area to relatively safer areas in the nation’s west, the Times noted.

“The first days are the most difficult, because right now the enemy will feel it has the advantage, or will be broken physically and morally,” said Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Malyar Friday, according to the Times. “It is important that everyone is strong in spirit. This is our land. We will not hand it over.”",https://thehill.com/policy/international/europe/595798-russian-troops-enter-kyiv-outskirts-report/

Almost exactly 30 years after the devastating siege of Sarajevo, another major European capital came under heavy bombardment with shells hitting apartment blocks, driving up the civilian death toll. The onslaught of bombing intensified on Friday night, accompanied by artillery rounds and heavy gunfire on the city’s streets.

In a bleak statement, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned that several cities were under attack. “This night will be the hardest … We must withstand. The night will be very hard, but sunrise will come.”

In the hours after he spoke, multiple explosions were reported across the capital amid reports that Russian troops were advancing on the city centre.

After the second day of the invasion, it was clear that it was being fiercely resisted, but also that Russia had much more military might yet to be unleashed on its neighbour.

Ukrainians prepared a last-ditch defence of their capital, with barricades, and called for civilians to arm themselves with molotov cocktails.

According to US estimates, Russia has fired 200 ballistic and cruise missiles at Ukraine, mostly hitting military targets but some landing in residential areas.

As human rights groups accused Russia of war crimes, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court issued a reminder he has jurisdiction to investigate atrocities committed inside Ukraine.

US defence officials said that the Russian offensive was facing stiffer resistance than its commanders had anticipated. They had so far not established unchallenged air superiority, for example. But the US estimates that Moscow had only committed a third of the attacking force it had mustered around Ukraine’s borders in recent months.

According to the Pentagon, 10 amphibious landing ships unloaded thousands of naval infantry to the west of Mariupol, potentially cutting off the port city.

In a televised address marked by more of the extreme rhetoric that has accompanied the invasion, Vladimir Putin described the the government in Kyiv as as “terrorists” and “a gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”.

Earlier in the day, Zelenskiy posted a video of himself and his aides outside the presidential office to counter Russian media rumours that he had fled.

“We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.”

01:02 'We are defending our country alone,' Zelenskiy tells Ukrainians as Russia approaches Kyiv – video

Western intelligence agencies have predicted that Zelenskiy and his top officials could be targeted for assassination as Russia seeks to decapitate the country.

“It’s clear the kind of vitriol coming from Russia about the Ukrainian leadership, so I think we can expect that they would be targets for Russian forces coming into the city,” one western official said.

Russia was forced to vote alone at the UN security council on Friday night against a resolution deploring its actions. As Russia holds a veto, the resolution was not upheld, but the US and its allies score a small diplomatic victory by persuading China not to vote with Russia but abstain, by slightly watering down the language. They were unable to win over India and the United Arab Emirates, who also abstained.

Tremors from the invasion continued to spread around the world on Friday, demonstrating the potential for the already disastrous conflict to spill over Ukraine’s borders.

Nato activated its rapid response force which had been established as a contingency in the event of a serious threat on the alliance’s flank.

The Kremlin also issued a direct threat to Finland and Sweden, which have been openly contemplating Nato membership as a result of the invasion.

“Their accession to Nato can have detrimental consequences … and face military and political consequences,” the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said.

Earlier in the day, barricades went up around the city as its defenders set up positions on bridges prepared for an onslaught, more Russian troops converged on the city from three directions, and Putin urged Ukraine’s military to seize power from the elected government, and bow to his demands to disarm and rule out Nato membership.

Streams of people – mostly women and children, since Ukrainian men aged 18-60 are forbidden to leave – crossed into Hungary, Poland and Romania, with 15-hour queues reported at border points. Guards fired warning shots to prevent a stampede at Kyiv’s central station as thousands tried to force their way on to evacuation trains.

Ukrainian officials claimed nearly 3,000 Russian servicemen had been killed so far, but warned that advance enemy units had already entered the Obolonskyi district of northern Kyiv. The defence ministry advised residents to “prepare molotov cocktails”.

The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said the city had entered “a defensive phase”. He added: “Shots and explosions are ringing out … and saboteurs have already entered Kyiv. The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us.”

In video footage thought to be from south Ukraine, near Crimea, a Ukrainian civilian was shown standing in front of an advancing Russian military convoy, in scenes reminiscent of Tiananmen Square in 1989, in which a lone Chinese protestor stood in front of a tank, stopping its advance.

US officials estimated Russia had launched more than 200 missiles at Ukraine, including both ballistic and cruise weapons. They said most had been aimed at military targets but that some had landed in residential districts, and that it was unclear whether that was accidental or deliberate.

The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, issued a reminder that he had the authority to investigate war crimes inside Ukraine and Amnesty International accused the Russian military of “indiscriminate attacks” after investigating several incidents, including a missile strike on a hospital building in Vuhledar in eastern Ukraine, which killed four civilians and wounded 10 more.

In another sign of the war’s potential to spin out of control, two more merchant ships were hit by errant missile strikes in the Black Sea, a Japanese bulk carrier and a Moldovan chemical tanker.

Zelenskiy earlier on Friday accused Europe of not being hard or quick enough in sanctioning Russia earlier, urging citizens to compel their governments to do more to stop Putin’s invasion.

“Europe has enough strength to stop this aggression,” he said. “You have to act swiftly. We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation. Sanctions must be further strengthened.”

The Ukrainian government continued its appeals to the EU to step up its sanctions, expressing bitter disappointment that the measures taken so far had not included Russia’s exclusion from the Swift global electronic payments system.

The German finance ministry said on Friday that it was open to the proposal of including Swift sanctions, while the US, EU and the UK moved to freeze the foreign-held assets of Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The US also sanctioned Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov.

The initiative was largely symbolic, as the Russian president is not thought to have identifiable personal wealth abroad. However, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, told a Russian TV station Friday night that relations with the west “have reached the line after which the point of no return begins”.

In Kyiv, Zelenskiy said in a televised address that Putin was targeting civilian as well as military sites. “They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. It is a lie; they do not distinguish in which areas to operate,” he said, vowing to continue defending his country and criticising world leaders for “watching from afar”.

In Russia, thousands of people defied tough anti-protest legislation to stage anti-war rallies across the country on Thursday night. OVD-Info, which monitors arrests at opposition protests, said more than 1,800 people in 59 cities had been detained.

Lt Gen Jim Hockenhull, the UK’s head of defence intelligence, released a statement to reporters about the state of the fighting in Ukraine: “Russian forces continue to advance on two axes towards Kyiv. Their objective is to encircle the capital, to secure control of the population and change the regime..”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/kyiv-attack-latest-russia-invasion-ukraine
