1,8fd4877c-1b05-49dc-985d-484ef8e28941,['Dan Sabbagh'],2022-03-10 00:00:00,"Drone footage has emerged of a Ukrainian ambush on a Russian armoured column just outside Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv.

The specialist open source investigator Bellingcat said it had geolocated the video, to a lightly inhabited area on the E95 road about 22 miles (35km) from the centre of Kyiv, a direct route to the east of the capital where Russian forces have been trying to mass.

The edited 45-second video, which was released by Ukraine’s armed forces, is a montage of the fighting on the road and shows a company or more of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles coming under repeated attack. Its production quality means the fighting filmed may not have taken place on Thursday.

It is overlaid with an audio of what appears to be a Russian officer reporting an attack to his superiors. This is presented as an effective commentary on the fighting shown. It also said the regiment’s commander was killed, named by Ukrainian media as Col Andrei Zakharov, although this could not be independently confirmed.

“Sixth regiment lost,” the officer tells headquarters. “I cannot report about the 6th regiment. I’m collecting data. Lots of losses. They waited for us. Head of the convoy got into the ambush. Regiment commander killed in action.”

Several military experts described the video as credible and said it showed surprising tactics on the part of the Russian forces, with more than 20 tanks and other armoured vehicles on a main road fairly close to the capital.

Ben Barry, a former tank commander with the British army and a land warfare specialist with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a thinktank, said: “They either think they are going through a safe area, or they were not well trained or they are moving fast for some other requirement.”

Tanks moving through a built-up area should normally use close infantry support to prevent ambushes from the side of the road, Barry said. Having watched the footage, he said he thought the Russian armour was probably targeted with artillery or mortar fire because the nature of the blasts.

On the audio, the Russian apparently reporting the ambush speculates that they may been targeted by Turkish Bayraktar drones, but parts of the video show poor conditions and low cloud cover not considered ideal for drone attacks.

Parts of the footage also show a TOS-1 heavy flamethrower, clearly marked with a painted O symbol, towards the bottom of the screen. At one point during the fighting it unleashes an incendiary rocket at a target apparently off screen, a demonstration of Russian willingness to use thermobaric weapons during combat.

Another expert on the Russian military who reviewed the video, Rob Lee, a former US marine and PhD student at King’s College London, said he thought this displayed “very poor tactics” on the part of the Russians, with a force clearly positioned “on an obvious avenue of approach”.

Russia has taken heavier than expected losses during the invasion, which began just over two weeks ago. Ukraine has sought to make a public relations play of Ukrainian successes, releasing film of destroyed Russian tanks or enemy armour being towed by tractors.

So far, 164 Russian tanks have been destroyed, damaged or captured, according to the specialist monitor Oryx, which is tracking losses using photo or video evidence. Oryx says for Russian armoured fighting vehicles, the number is 102. Ukraine has lost 47 tanks and 39 fighting vehicles from its smaller force.

An assessment by the US earlier this week suggested 5,000 to 6,000 Russian troops had been killed and 2,000 to 4,000 Ukrainian troops, plus many more civilians. Another US assessment estimated that both sides had lost 8% to 10% of the military assets that they had committed to the fighting.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/drone-footage-russia-tanks-ambushed-ukraine-forces-kyiv-war

A huge Russian military convoy that had been stationed outside the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, since last week appears to have dispersed, according to a United States-based company, as the city braces for a possible ground assault.

Maxar Technologies said satellite images taken on Thursday showed that the 64km (40 miles) long line of vehicles, tanks and artillery has broken up and been redeployed.

The company said the images showed armoured units manoeuvring in and through the surrounding towns close to the Antonov airport, northwest of Kyiv.

Some of the vehicles have moved into forests, Maxar reported.

It added that images also show convoy elements further north have repositioned near the town of Lubyanka with towed artillery howitzers in firing positions nearby.

The convoy had massed outside the city early last week, but its advance appeared to have stalled amid reports of food and fuel shortages.

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Kyiv, said the vehicles in the convoy were changing positions but it was not clear whether they were being redeployed or securing supply lines.

“We don’t know [if] they are moving to other parts and are strengthening other offensives that might be going on or whether they are trying to secure supply lines for an entry into Kyiv in the coming days,” he said. “It is a significant change of tactic if they are redeploying them elsewhere but if they are resupplying them, that could suggest they are getting for an offensive into Kyiv.”

Some analysts have said this week Russia was gradually overcoming logistical issues and was preparing for a ground assault on the capital.

On Wednesday, the Institute for the Study of War said Russian forces “continued concentrating in the eastern, northwestern and western outskirts of Kyiv for an assault on the Ukrainian capital in the coming 24-96 hours”.

The convoy’s redeployment comes amid reports that Russian forces have reached the northeastern edge of Kyiv, where suburbs including Irpin and Bucha have endured days of heavy bombardment.

Ukrainian soldiers there described fierce fighting for control of the main highway leading into the capital, and the AFP news agency reported seeing missile attacks in Velyka Dymerka just outside Kyiv’s city limits.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the capital had now been “transformed into a fortress”.

“Every street, every house … is being fortified,” he told Ukrainian television. “Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.”

He added that about two million people – half the population of the metropolitan area – have left the capital. “From our information, one in two Kyiv residents has left the city,” he said.

Western officials said Russian forces have made little progress on the ground in recent days and are seeing heavier losses and stiffer Ukrainian resistance than Moscow apparently anticipated.

But Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces have used airpower and artillery to pummel Ukraine’s cities.

The 15-day conflict has killed and wounded thousands of people and displaced millions.

A Russian tank commander was killed in the attack in the town of Brovary, the Ukrainian military claimed.

The footage, taken from a Ukrainian drone, shows three Russian tanks in the village of Skybyn before they are joined from the north by at least 20 Russian vehicles, including tanks and a TOS-1A, the thermobaric missile launcher system Russia recently confirmed it had used in Ukraine.

The vehicles turn and stop on the north side of the village before artillery shells and rockets begin to explode around them.

The closely grouped tanks appear to be thrown into disarray by the attack, eventually turning to retreat from the town.

A military expert, Air Marshal Philip Osborn, said the grouping of the vehicles suggests they did not anticipate an attack.

""In regards to grouping, you would only group in that way if you felt relatively secure from attack,"" he told Sky News. ""This video proves that was a misjudgement.""

Intercepted radio communication in audio released alongside the video says they have been ""ambushed"" as multiple strikes hit the column.

The thermobaric missile launcher can be seen to fire, though it is unclear if that was on purpose.

Ukrainian forces claimed a Russian tank commander, Colonel Andrei Zakharov, was killed during the assault.

'Questionable tactics'

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said the Russian forces ""suffered significant losses in personnel and equipment"" and the tank column was forced to retreat and go on the defensive.

Footage taken in the aftermath of the ambush shows burning Russian vehicles on the road.

Rob Lee, a military expert and senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told Sky News: ""The Russian forces in the video demonstrated some questionable tactics.

""They are quite close to Kyiv and moving on a likely avenue of approach, where the Ukrainians would expect them to come from, and yet the column isn't dispersed at all, leaving them vulnerable to artillery fire.""

Reports say Russia has 12,400 tanks which is the largest in the world with Ukraine possessing 2,586 tanks. Ukraine has 74 T-64 tanks against Russia's 2,000.

Ukraine also has 3,666 T-72 tanks however Russia has nearly twice that number at 9,950. Clearly as far as size is concerned the tank strength of the two countries is greatly mismatched.

Russia has in fact developed the T-14 Armata and has already produced 2,300 even since it was unveiled in 2015. It was battle-tested in Syria. It has state of the art laser-guided missiles with Kord 12.7mm and PKTM 7.62mm machine gun.

The T-14 can reportedly withstand nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. Russia currently has 20 T-14s which could prove to be a big hurdle for Ukraine's forces.

A minute in one, a soldier can be seen with a Spanish C90-CR launcher on his back, another with a bulkier British-supplied NLAW missile. A 1:54, several soldiers can be seen with black Panzerfaust 3-T munitions.

Altogether, Ukraine is believed to have received around 20,000 anti-tank missiles from Western countries. It’s not that Ukraine’s military didn’t have such weapons before—it just needs them in huge quantities due to the scale of Russia’s invasion.

Most of these weapons are single-use, usually unguided, munitions which can be easily carried by individual soldiers. These are only effective in relatively close engagements common in ambushes or in urban warfare.

However, engaging faraway armor on open battlefields requires heavier and more sophisticated anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM). Ukraine is receiving two types of ATGMs—Javelins and Milans—in more limited numbers.

Not all anti-tank weapons are effective against main battle tanks. A minimum penetration of 450 to 550 millimeters Rolled Homogenous Armor (RHA) equivalent is needed to defeat the frontal armor of the oldest T-72A tanks deployed by Russia in Ukraine. But 750-1,200 RHA penetration is likely required against T-72B-series, T-80 and T-90A tanks deployed by Russia.

That said, most Russian armored vehicles in Ukraine are not tanks: heavily armed but lightly armored BMP, BMD and BTR-82 infantry fighting vehicles, MT-LB armored personnel carriers, self-propelled artillery, air defense vehicles and more. These are all vulnerable to even the lightest anti-tank weapons. Side, rear and especially top armor on tanks also tends to be weaker too.

Portable anti-tank weapons also are useful against infantry in buildings and fortified positions, or for destroying materiel targets.

FGM-148 Javelin

Likely over 1,000 Javelin missiles and over a hundred launch units from U.S., Estonia

K. is reportedly planning to send “a small contingent” of Javelins as well

The Javelin is one of the most capable (and expensive) portable tank-killing weapons out there. Russian tanks have been seen sporting upgrades seemingly aimed at defeating Javelins, though they appear unlikely to work. A U.S. military source claimed Ukrainian troops had fired 300 Javelins by March 2, destroying 280 armored vehicles.

Washington officially delivered at least 77 launch units and 840 missiles by the end of January, while a Ukrainian news source claimed the actual total was 1,200 missiles and 150 launch units. The U.S. and Estonia have delivered additional Javelins since, as recently as February 10.

The Javelin’s effectiveness and prominent place in military assistance to Ukraine has fostered the iconic meme of ‘St. Javelin the Protector’ widely disseminated across the internet.

However, very little footage of Javelins being used in combat by Ukraine has been published—save for the video below.

A Javelin system consists of a 14-pound reusable launch unit with a powerful infrared sensor, and 35-pound infrared-guided fire-and-forget missiles. The 127-millimeter missiles can penetrate 750mm RHA (or 600mm versus ERA)—but their big trick is a top-attack mode in which they plunge down to smash through the thin top armor of a tank.

The latest FGM-148F model Javelin missiles feature lighter launch unit, range extended to 2.5 miles and tweaked multipurpose warheads. However, Ukraine is likely receiving older Block 0 and Block 1 Javelins with a range of 1.55 miles.

Tiny sample, but lends credence to what I suspected. Javelin missiles sent to Ukraine are likely mostly drawn from older Block 0 stocks (FGM-148A/B/C/D), and would have been nearing the end of their shelf-life. https://t.co/ZHe8b2xlHG — Amael Kotlarski (@JakOSpades) March 11, 2022

Russia appears to have captured its first fully intact Javelin missile and launch unit this March—an inevitable development for any weapon used on the frontline.

Weighing 27 pounds, the single-shot NLAWs are undoubtedly the most capable short-range anti-tank weapon provided to Ukraine. Accurate out to 600-800 meters due to a predictive guidance system, the NLAW can furthermore be programmed to launch lethal top attacks against better-armored targets.

The imagery of NLAWs being delivered to units in their plastic containers is widespread, and the weapon have become iconic symbols of Western aid and Ukrainian resistance in a similar fashion to the U.S.-supplied Javelin.

Russian forces have been recorded capturing over a dozen NLAWs.

Like the NLAW, the German Panzerfaust 3 is a light anti-tank weapon that can threaten main battle tanks. Each munition, once mated with its reusable launch unit, weighs 34 pounds and can be safely fired from enclosed spaces.

The latest DM72A1 round has a second ‘tandem’ charge on a retractable probe to defeat explosive reactive armor (ERA) liberally bricked on Russian tanks. It can penetrate 1.2 meters of RHA equivalent or 900 millimeters of armor reinforced with ERA. Videos show launchers in Ukraine equipped with the IS2000 a computer-assisted laser sight, which increases effective range against moving targets from 300 to 600 meters.

1,500 M72A5 from Finland

2,700 M72A7 EC LAW from Denmark

2,000 M72A6 (or NM72F1) from Norway

The M72 was the U.S.’s ubiquitous single-shot disposable anti-tank weapon first issued in the 1960s. Ukraine is now receiving 11,000 M72s of various marks from five different countries.

The 5.5-pound A2 and 8-pound A5 models can pierce 300mm RHA equivalent, while EC or ECLAW model can penetrate 450mm. The A6 and A7 models are more effective against infantry but penetrate less armor (150mm). M72s are accurate out to 200-220 meters.

#Ukraine: Note that the 72nd Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Army has already put the Danish-delivered M72 EC launchers into use (EC means Enhanced Capacity, can penetrate up to 450 mm RHA), along with UK-supplied NLAW and Ukrainian RPV-16 thermobarics. pic.twitter.com/YmwAVbKrjK — Cᴀʟɪʙʀᴇ Oʙsᴄᴜʀᴀ (@CalibreObscura) March 7, 2022

AT4

5,000 AT4 and AT-4 CS (Pansarskott m/86 and m/86BU in Swedish service)

The Swedish-built AT4 single-shot recoilless weapon weighs 14.8-pounds and can penetrate the equivalent of 450 millimeters RHA on targets. Its 84-millimeter rounds are accurate out to 500 meters, or 300 against moving targets. Ukraine has received both the regular model, which produces a dangerous backblast and the CS model which has a lower velocity but can be safely used from inside buildings.

Carl Gustaf (84-millimeter)

2000 84-millimeter rounds and 100 launchers from Canada

The Carl Gustaf is a Cold War-era recoilless rifle. The reusable 31-pound launcher can theoretically surge up to six shots in a minute in an emergency. However, the author hasn’t yet seen imagery of Carl Gustafs in Ukraine.

Greece reportedly delivered disposable RPG-18 light anti-tank rockets it had acquired from East Germany, as well as AKM assault rifles and some 122-millimeter Grad rockets to Ukraine via two of its C-130 transports. The 64-millimeter rockets have the same performance (on paper) as an M72A2 and weigh only 5.7 pounds. Ukraine’s military already uses RPG-18s.

RPG-76 Komar

Unknown quantity from Poland

The RPG-76 “Mosquito” is a disposable single-shot rocket-propelled grenade system developed by Poland for paratroopers in the 1980s and used by Polish troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2018 Warsaw unsuccessfully sought to sell retired stocks of 24,589 RPG-76s; now Ukrainian soldiers have been recorded training to use them.

Weighing just 4.6 pounds, this compact aluminum weapon has a folding stock and can be safely fired from inside buildings or vehicles. It’s accurate out to 150-250 meters (sources differ) and can penetrate 260 millimeters RHA equivalent.

Milan ATGMs

A “few dozen” Milan anti-tank guided missile systems (likely the count of launchers, number of missiles is surely greater) were delivered by France from 2/25-2/28

Milan 2 deliveries by Italy announced Feb. 28

The Milan is Europe’s equivalent of the U.S. TOW-missile, a Cold War weapon guided by wire out to a range of 1-1.5 miles. The semi-automatic guidance system requires the operator to keep the target fixed in a sight and the missile adjusts course as needed. Italy is giving either Milan-2s or the tandem-charge Milan-2T model; these can penetrate 550 or 880-millimeters RHA equivalent respectively.

It’s unknown if France is sending over more advanced 125-millimeter infrared-guided Milan-3 weapons with longer range and more powerful tandem charges, or older Milan missiles. While the Milan isn’t cutting edge, Ukraine has received relatively few ATGMs and can use every system they can get.

More tanks, please

Ukraine also can use armored vehicles to replace losses—and is receiving hundreds of used ones from a particularly generous donor: the Russian army, which has abandoned so many in Ukraine, in fact, that photographic evidence counts more Russian fighting vehicles abandoned and/or captured than destroyed in combat.

#Ukraine: The Ukrainian Territorial Defence forces in #Sumy Oblast attacked another Russian column; as a result a Msta-S 152mm self-propelled howitzer and two T-72B tanks were captured, although another T-72B is claimed destroyed also. pic.twitter.com/HQq1qMJXJC — 🇺🇦 Ukraine Weapons Tracker (@UAWeapons) March 11, 2022

These vehicles are nearly all familiar to the Ukrainian military and use the same ammunition. Thus Kyiv may be able to regenerate losses to its armored units—at least if it retains enough control of battlegrounds to tow them away and quickly refurbish them for use against their former operators.
