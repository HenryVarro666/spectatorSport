Earlier, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia’s brutality in the Black Sea port city of Mariupol would be remembered for “centuries”.

Several thousand residents were forcefully deported to Russian territory over the last week, Mariupol city’s council said.

“The occupiers illegally took people from the Livoberezhniy district, and from the shelter in the sports club building where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from the constant bombing,” the council said.

Also, an art school where 400 people were sheltering was bombed on Saturday – the council said. No mention of casualties has been made, but the building was destroyed and people were buried under rubble.

Russian forces’ losses have prevented the troops from launching any significant attacks today, according to Ukraine.

Russian invaders have not launched any significant offensives over the past day, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in its daily update.

Czech Republic is concerned over whether it can “provide comfortable living conditions” to Ukrainian refugees.

Many other central European countries – such as Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary – are also reaching capacity to host some of the millions of refugees who have fled Ukraine during Russia’s invasion, a Czech official said.

Many of the refugees are staying in makeshift accommodation in sports halls and campsites.

Officials are trying to relocate new arrivals to cities outside Prague to ease pressure on the capital, he said.

During a television debate, Mr Rakusan said: “The Czech Republic is balancing on the edge of capacities where we are able to provide comfortable living conditions.

“Living in gyms, sleeping bags, or campsites is not good for life.”

Pope Francis has denounced Russia’s “repugnant war” against Ukraine as “cruel and sacrilegious inhumanity.”

His comments appear to be his strongest condemnation of Russia’s invasion since it was launched on 24 February – but, as typical of pontiffs, he stopped short of naming Russia as the aggressor.

The pope said: “I feel great pain for those who don't even have the chance to escape.”

He added, before leading a moment of silent prayer: “Above all, defenseless life should get respected and protected, not eliminated.”

11:40 , Lamiat Sabin

A Ukrainian former minister is calling for stricter sanctions against Russia, and cited a poll that suggests the vast majority of Russians support the idea of attacking European Union countries.

A huge 86.6 per cent of Russians polled have said they would support Vladimir Putin if he decided to invade Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and others – according to the survey results released earlier this week.

More than 75 per cent of Russians would approve of invading Poland, the results also suggest.

Volodymyr Ogrysko, former foreign affairs minister for Ukraine, said the West should impose harsher sanctions against Russian individuals and sanctions.

The Chinese official said, according to a report by China’s embassy in the UK: “China, Algeria and quite a number of countries abstained in the voting.

“Abstention is also an attitude. It is to give peace a chance and shows disapproval of using war and sanctions to address disputes, and it is a responsible attitude.

“At the same time, we are of the view that the Ukraine issue has not come to this point by accident. It is the result of the confluence of various factors and an eruption of the tensions that have built up over the years.

“What lies at the heart is the issue of European security, and Nato’s move of expanding eastward without limit merits reflection.”

In Kyiv, at least 20 babies born to surrogate mothers are stuck at a makeshift bomb shelter, waiting for their parents to travel to the besieged city and take them home.

Before Russia’s invasion began on 24 February, Ukraine was home to a thriving surrogacy industry, as one of the few countries where foreigners could get Ukrainian women to carry their pregnancies.

But now, the babies – some just a few days old – are sheltering underground along with the surrogacy centre’s nurses as the war rages on in the capital.

The parents of these babies live in Europe, Latin America, and China, according to the Associated Press, which visited the shelter.

“Now we are staying here to preserve our and the babies’ lives. We are hiding here from the bombing and this horrible misery,” said Lyudmilia Yashchenko, a 51-year-old nurse.

While the nurses say food and baby supplies are available at the shelter, they are left waiting for the infants to be picked up, and for the war to end.

Ukraine says thousands of its civilians fleeing the besieged city of Mariupol to the suburbs are dying of hunger.

“Right now, thousands of Mariupol residents who managed to escape from Russian bombs are starving to death in the occupied Mangushi and Melekin. This is a crime against humanity!” Donetsk military-civil administration head Pavlo Kyrylenko said.

The military-civil administration head reportedly said the Russian occupying forces do not agree on a “green corridor” for the fleeing civilians to provide food, water and safe passage.

“We demand from the occupation administration to follow the rules of warfare and provide civilians with water and food, as well as to enable them to leave the combat zone!” Mr Kyrylenko said.

Russian invasion has led to at least 2,246 civilian casualties, UN says

04:04 , Vishwam Sankaran

In its latest update of civilian casualties, the UN noted on Saturday that 847 people have been killed and 1,399 injured since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February.

There have been 968 casualties in the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, and 1,278 reported casualties in other regions under Ukrainian government control, the report noted.

⚡️UN: At least 847 civilians, including 64 children, killed in Ukraine since Russia's all-out war began on Feb. 24.

“Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,” the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said.

The actual figures could be considerably higher since officials have not been able to verify information in places witnessing intense battles, the UN agency noted.

Russia conscripting civilians in Ukraine's separatist regions

03:37 , Vishwam Sankaran

Ukraine says Russia is conscripting civilians living in the occupied separatist regions of Donbas to deploy on the front lines of the war.

“This is a gross violation of international law, including Geneva Convention. Russian officials’ list of war crimes continues to expand. They will be held accountable,” Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, tweeted.

The rebel-occupied regions in eastern Ukraine of Donetsk and Luhansk were declared “independent entities” by Russian president Vladimir Putin last month, before he ordered an invasion to — in his terms — protect them from Kyiv.

In the days leading up to the war, Russian-backed militants in the area reportedly escalated hostilities in Donbas as the west warned that Russia was preparing a pretext to invade.

West must never ‘renormalise’ ties with Putin, says Johnson

Western nations must never “renormalise” relations with Vladimir Putin, Boris Johnson has said, warning that Russia’s war in Ukraine has created a moment of choice for the world between freedom and oppression (Andrew Woodcock writes).

Victory for the Russian leader would usher in a “new age of intimidation” across eastern Europe and give a green light to autocrats around the globe, he said.

Addressing the Conservative spring conference in Blackpool on Saturday, Mr Johnson described the war as a “turning point for the world”.

Mariupol residents 'abducted and taken to Russia'

02:58 , Vishwam Sankaran

Thousands of residents of the besieged city of Mariupol in Ukraine are reportedly being taken against their will to Russia, the city council said on Saturday.

“It is known that the captured Mariupol residents were taken to filtration camps, where the occupiers checked people’s phones and documents. After the inspection, some Mariupol residents were redirected to remote cities in Russia, the fate of others remains unknown,” a statement from the Mariupol City Council noted.

Russian forces reportedly took people from the Livoberezhny district and from a shelter where more than a thousand people, “mostly women and children,” were hiding from the bombing.

“What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people,” Mariupol mayor Vadym Boychenko said.

“It is difficult to imagine that in the 21st century people will be forcibly deported to another country. Not only are Russian troops destroying our peaceful Mariupol, they have gone even further and started deporting Mariupol residents,” Mr Boychenko added.

Ukraine accuses Russia of halting Mariupol buses

US floats missile plan to Turkey

02:15 , Liam James

The United States has informally raised with Turkey the unlikely possibility of sending its Russian-made S-400 missile defense systems to Ukraine to help it fight invading Russian forces, according to three sources familiar with the matter.

US officials have floated the suggestion over the past month with their Turkish counterparts but no specific or formal request was made, the sources told Reuters. They said it also came up briefly during Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman’s visit to Turkey earlier this month.

The Biden administration has been asking allies who have been using Russian made equipment and systems including S-300s and S-400s to consider transferring them to Ukraine as it tries to fend off a Russian invasion that began on 24 February.

The idea, which analysts said was sure to be shot down by Turkey, was part of a wider discussion between Sherman and Turkish officials about how the United States and its allies can do more to support Ukraine and on how to improve bilateral ties.

The Turkish authorities have not commented on any US suggestion or proposal relating to the transfer to Ukraine of Ankara’s S-400 systems, which have been a point of long-standing contention between the two Nato allies.

Turkish foreign ministry officials were not immediately available for comment.

Ukraine has ‘defeated initial Russian campaign’, says ISW

Russia has failed in its initial invasion plan, according to independent observers.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russia’s first plan was to take several cities around the country including Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa to force a regime change in Ukraine.

It is now very unlikely to be successful in this aim though Moscow will continue to send reinforcements to troops around the major cities in order to support this strategy, the ISW said.

Boris Johnson urges China to condemn Putin

Saturday 19 March 2022 23:16 , Liam James

Boris Johnson has urged China to get off the fence and join in global condemnation of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

The prime minister said he believed some in Xi Jinping's administration were having ""second thoughts"" about the neutral stance adopted by Beijing following Russia's actions against its neighbour.

Despite Mr Johnson's suggestion of a possible shift in attitude, there was fresh criticism of Nato on Saturday from China as Russian forces continued their bombardment of Ukrainian towns and cities.

Mr Johnson used a Sunday Times interview to urge China and other neutral nations to line up against Russia.

He said: ""As time goes on, and as the number of Russian atrocities mounts up, I think it becomes steadily more difficult and politically embarrassing for people either actively or passively to condone Putin's invasion.

""There are considerable dilemmas now for people who thought they could sit this one out, who thought they could sit on the fence.

""And, yes, I think that in Beijing you are starting to see some second thoughts.""

Kyiv residents defiant amid destruction and death

Saturday 19 March 2022 22:57 , Liam James

Latest dispatch from Kim Sengupta in Ukraine:

The attack was one of the latest barrages Kyiv has suffered daily since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. And residential areas have been hit with increasing frequency, resulting in mounting civilian casualties.

Five apartment blocks suffered substantial damage in an attack in the district of Podil on Friday morning. Waves from the blast shattered windows in homes and shops three streets along. One body has been found so far, say the authorities, while several people were injured. Residents claim the death count is much higher and that some residents suffered such severe injuries that they were unlikely to survive.

“I saw four bodies being taken out with my own eyes,” said Viochoslav Shmerkechuk. “And a lot of people wounded. Every one of these buildings has been affected, so it should not come as a surprise that the casualties would be high.”

Mr Shmerkechuk said his apartment suffered some damage, pointing to broken windows and scorched walls. But the five members of his family were all safe. “That is the most important thing now, to stay alive until this is all over,” he said. “We have lived here for 33 years and intend to continue living here.”

Boris Johnson a ‘national embarrassment’ for comparing Brexit with Ukraine

Saturday 19 March 2022 22:38 , Liam James

Boris Johnson has sparked outrage by comparing the struggle of Ukrainians fighting the Russian invasion to British people voting for Brexit.

In his speech to the Conservative spring conference in Blackpool, Mr Johnson said it is the “instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom”, with the Brexit vote a “famous recent example”.

The comparison was criticised by Tory peer Lord Barwell, who pointed out Ukraine is seeking to join the European Union.

Former European Council president, Donald Tusk, said the prime minister’s words “offend Ukrainians, the British and common sense”.

Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian prime minister and EU Brexit negotiator, said the comparison was “insane”.

Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, said Mr Johnson “is a national embarrassment”, adding: “To compare a referendum to women and children fleeing Putin’s bombs is an insult to every Ukrainian.

“He is no Churchill. He is Basil Fawlty.”

Punk trio revise London Calling for Ukraine war

Saturday 19 March 2022 22:19 , Liam James

Ukrainian punk band Beton have reimagined The Clash's hit single London Calling as an “anthem” of “solidarity and hope” during the Russian invasion.

The trio – Bohdan Hrynko, Oleg Hula and Andriy Zholob – recorded the new version, titled Kyiv Calling, on Thursday and Friday this week in a music studio in the city of Lviv.

The song features the lines “come out of neutrality, you boys and girls” and “phony Putinmania has bitten the dust.”

The track was mixed and mastered by producer Danny Saber, one of the last people to work with Joe Strummer, lead singer of The Clash before his death in 2002.

Proceeds from the song will go to the Free Ukraine Resistance Movement (Furm) – a citizen-led network bringing together 30 non-governmental organisations from across the country.

Ostap Kryvdyk, international secretary of Furm, said: ""Furm calls on the world to listen to the call from Kyiv. For us the music of the Clash is the music of freedom. We must stop the new iron curtain falling.

""London Calling was the call sign of the resistance of Britain when it stood alone against the Nazis.

""We want Kyiv Calling to be the symbol of resistance to the new aggressor in Europe. No surrender. No compromise peace.”

The Vatican says the Bambino Gesu hospital is currently tending to 19 Ukrainian refugees, and that overall some 50 have passed through in recent weeks.

Some were suffering oncological, neurological and other problems before the war and fled in the early days. Others are being treated for wounds incurred as a result of the invasion.

Ukraine evacuated 6,623 from besieged cities today, official says

Saturday 19 March 2022 21:40 , Liam James

A total of 6,623 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors today, a senior Ukrainian official said, many fewer than managed to escape yesterday.

Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, said in an online post that 4,128 people had left the besieged city of Mariupol, after several earlier attempts that Ukraine claimed were hampered by Russia.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 190,000 civilians had been evacuated in total.

On Friday, Mr Tymoshenko said 9,145 people had managed to leave cities across the country during the day.

Russian troops have launched missile attacks on cities across Ukraine to try and win control of territory. Ukraine and Russia have negotiated humanitarian corridors to allow safe routes for residents to flee the cities and for aid to reach those who stay put.

Among them are families, graduates and students with many located at or near university premises of Kherson State University and Kherson State Maritime Academy.

The estimated number of Black people stuck in the city is up to 150 and predominantly nationals of Ukraine, Cameroon, Nigeria and Gabon, according to research by Korrine Sky, and Francklin Momo Nanfack who are both international students of universities in the eastern European country.

Students from Syria, Palestine, Algeria and Egypt are also stranded in Kherson, data has shown.

Zelensky: Talk peace now or Russia will suffer for generations

Saturday 19 March 2022 20:19 , Liam James

Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia would “several generations” to recover from its losses in the war if it does not end soon.

Russian forces have taken heavy losses and their advance has been stunted for much of the three week war.

The Ukrainian president today called for peace talks with Moscow as Kyiv claimed 14,000 Russian troops had been killed since the invasion began. Moscow gave a figure of 500 two weeks ago and has given no update since.

“Picture for yourself that in that stadium in Moscow there are 14,000 dead bodies and tens of thousands more injured and maimed,” the Ukrainian leader said, standing outside the presidential office in the capital, Kyiv.

“Those are the Russian costs throughout the invasion.”

Negotiations to end the war appeared to progress this week as Mr Zelensky suggested Ukraine should not expect to become part of Nato – a fear of Russia’s.

But peace still seems a distant prospect as Russia demands Ukrainian neutrality, a price Kyiv says it is only willing to pay in exchange for security guarantees that are as yet undefined.

It is also unclear what will come of Ukrainian territory under Russian occupation.

A private jet trying to take off from London has been grounded while suspected links to Russia are investigated.

The Cessna aircraft was blocked from taking off from London Biggin Hill Airport while it is investigated to see whether it falls foul of sanctions banning all Russian-linked aircraft.

It is a criminal offence for planes owned, operated or chartered by Russians, including private jets, to fly or land in the UK under a law change in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

What is a Kinzhal missile? The hypersonic weapon Russia says it used for the first time in Ukraine

Saturday 19 March 2022 19:16 , Liam James

Russia’s military has claimed to have fired a hypersonic ballistic missile to destroy a large weapons depot in Ukraine (Zaina Alibhai writes).

Hypersonic missiles are thought to be the next generation of arms as they can travel at exceptionally high speeds, more than five times the speed of sound.

Until recently, hypersonic missiles have remained a closely guarded secret however President Vladimir Putin has made no secret of Russia’s investment in the weapons which he insists were only created in response to the US deployment of a strategic missile defence system.

The Kinzhal missiles are part of an array of “invincible” weapons unveiled by Russia four years ago, alongside Zirkon and Avangrad, which has both higher speed and range.

Carried by MiG-31K fighter jets, it can fly at 10 times the speed of sound - 7,672 mph - and can hit a target some 1,250 miles away.

For comparison, the US Tomahawk cruise missile - a subsonic long range missile system - can travel at around 550 mph.

Russians blocked at US border, Ukrainians admitted

Saturday 19 March 2022 18:47 , Liam James

About three dozen would-be asylum seekers from Russia found themselves blocked from entering the US on Friday while a group of Ukrainians flashed passports and were escorted across the border.

The Russians – 34 as of Friday – had been camped several days at the busiest US border crossing with Mexico, two days after city of Tijuana officials gently urged them to leave.

Days earlier, some Russians were being admitted to the US at the San Ysidro crossing, while some Ukrainians were blocked. But by Friday, Russians were denied while Ukrainians were admitted after short waits.

Erika Pinheiro, litigation and policy director for advocacy group Al Otro Lado, said the US began admitting all Ukrainians on humanitarian parole for one year on around Tuesday, while at the same time blocking all Russians. There was no official announcement.

A Homeland Security Department memo dated 11 March but not publicly released until Thursday told border officials that Ukrainians may be exempt from sweeping asylum limits designed to prevent spread of Covid-19. It says decisions are to be made case-by-case for Ukrainians but makes no mention of Russians.

“The Department of Homeland Security recognises that the unjustified Russian war of aggression in Ukraine has created a humanitarian crisis,” the memo states.

US javelins to reach Ukraine in days, says Kyiv security chief

Saturday 19 March 2022 18:27 , Liam James

Ukraine will receive a new shipment of US weapons within days, including Javelin and Stinger missiles, Oleksiy Danilov, Ukraine’s national security council secretary, said today.

“The [weapons] will be on the territory of our country in the nearest future. We are talking about days,” Mr Danilov said.

Ukraine’s allies have delivered planeloads of weapons shipments to bolster its military against the Russian invasion. Russia has criticised such deliveries from Nato member states.

The UK also plans to send Javelin missiles to Ukraine. Defence secretary Ben Wallace this week announced Britain would supply a “small consignment” of the anti-tank missiles along with Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons – similar to the US Stinger missiles.

British NLAW short-range anti-tank weapons have already arrived in Ukraine and are reported to have been used in combat.

Swiss protesters calling for an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine condemned Nestle for refusing to stop doing business in Russia.

Anti-war protesters marched on the parliament in Bern with banners denouncing the Swiss food giant which said it would continue to sell “essentials” in Russia.

Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyal said on Thursday he spoke to Nestle CEO Mark Schneider about the effect of the company’s approach.

Mr Shmyal said: “Unfortunately, he shows no understanding. Paying taxes to the budget of a terrorist country means killing defenseless children and mothers.

“Hope that Nestle will change its mind soon.”

Many other large companies have ended operations in Russia in opposition to the war. Those that have continued business have faced fierce criticism.

Unexploded bombs will take years to clear, says Ukraine minister

Saturday 19 March 2022 17:07 , Liam James

It will take years to defuse the unexploded ordnance scattered across Ukraine after the Russian invasion ends, Ukrainian interior minister Denys Monastyrsky said.

“A huge number of shells and mines have been fired at Ukraine, and a large part haven’t exploded. They remain under the rubble and pose a real threat,” Mr Monastyrsky said in an interview with the Associated Press in Kyiv.

“It will take years, not months, to defuse them.”

As well as unexploded Russian ordnance, Ukrainian troops have planted land mines at bridges, airports and other key locations to block Russian access.“We won’t be able to remove the mines from all that territory, so I asked our international partners and colleagues from the European Union and the United States to prepare groups of experts to demine the areas of combat and facilities that came under shelling,” Mr Monastyrsky said.He noted that his ministry’s demining equipment was left in the isolated city of Mariupol.“We lost 200 pieces of equipment there,” he said.

Putin could use women refugees from Ukraine to launch terror attack on UK, Priti Patel warns

Saturday 19 March 2022 16:41 , Liam James

Russia could smuggle female agents into the UK among Ukrainian refugees to carry out biological or chemical terror attacks, home secretary Priti Patel has claimed (Andrew Woodcock writes).

Defending the UK’s decision – alone among European nations – to demand visas from Ukrainians fleeing war, Ms Patel said that a handful of individuals infiltrated by Vladimir Putin into the flood of innocent refugees could “wreak utter havoc” in the UK.

And with the majority of refugees made up of women and children as men stay in Ukraine to fight, she warned it would be “naïve and misguided” to think that only men were capable of unleashing terror attacks on British soil.

In a speech to the Conservative spring conference in Blackpool, Ms Patel said the security checks conducted as part of the refugee visa application process would help avoid a repeat of the Novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury, which killed British citizen Dawn Sturgess in 2018.

Ms Patel told activists that calls for the UK to follow the EU in offering visa-free access to Ukrainians seeking sanctuary had “grown louder in recent weeks”.

Saturday 19 March 2022 13:15 , Holly Bancroft

Russian cosmonauts arrived at the International Space Station wearing the colours of the Ukrainian flag, in what appears to be a statement against the invasion.

Their arrival was live-streamed by both Nasa, the American space agency, and the Russian agency Roscosmos.

When Mr Artemyev was asked about the suits, he replied: “It became our turn to pick a colour.”

He joked: “We had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it. That’s why we had to wear yellow.”

He added: “Putin is absolutely fit, he’s in better shape than ever... This is a completely sane, healthy person, physically healthy - he’s an athlete.

“As they say here - he’ll catch a cold at all our funerals.”

Mr Lukashenko also bemoaned the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, saying: “While the USSR existed, the world was multipolar and one pole balanced the other,” he said. “Now the reason for what’s happening in the world is unipolarity - the monopolisation of our planet by the United States of America.”

Boris Johnson: Putin is scared of a free press and free elections

Saturday 19 March 2022 12:45 , Holly Bancroft

UK prime minister Boris Johnson has said that Russian president Vladimir Putin has made a “catastrophic mistake” in invading Ukraine.

Mr Johnson added that he didn’t think “democratic freedoms are going to sprout any time soon in the Kremlin.”

He said: “With every day that Ukraine’s heroic resistance continues, it is clear that Putin has made a catastrophic mistake.

“You have to ask yourself why he did it - why did he decide to invade this totally innocent country?

“He didn’t really believe that Ukraine was going to join Nato any time soon, he knew perfectly well there was no plan to put missiles on Ukrainian soil.

“He didn’t really believe the semi-mystical guff he wrote about the origins of the Russian people.... Nostradamus meets Russian Wikipedia. That wasn’t what it was about.

“I think he was frightened of Ukraine for an entirely different reason.

“He was frightened of Ukraine because in Ukraine they have a free press and in Ukraine they have free elections.”

UK prime minister Boris Johnson is addressing the Conservative party conference. He told the party faithful that “we must take the bold steps necessary to end our dependence on Putin’s oil and gas.”

He added: “In the immortal phrase it is time to take back control of our energy supplies.

“We will make big bets on nuclear power; not just the big projects but the smaller nuclear reactors”.

Mr Johnson also said he would invest further in off-shore wind. He said that international investors were yearning to make “colossal” investments in England’s “green power”.

Cosmonauts say ‘no hidden signs’ in uniforms with Ukraine flag colours

Saturday 19 March 2022 23:16 , Liam James

The three Russian cosmonauts who were thought by some to be protesting against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine when they arrived at the International Space Station wearing the colours of the Ukraine flag denied they intended to make a political statement.

Cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev said each crew picks the colours about six months before launch because the suits need to be individually sewn. And since all three graduated from Bauman Moscow State Technical University, they chose the colours of their alma mater.“There is no need to look for any hidden signs or symbols in our uniform,” Artemyev said on the Telegram channel of Russian space agency Roscosmos.

“A colour is simply a colour. It is not in any way connected to Ukraine. Otherwise, we would have to recognise its rights to the yellow sun in the blue sky.“These days, even though we are in space, we are together with our president and our people!”Roscosmos’s press service said: “Sometimes yellow is just yellow.”
