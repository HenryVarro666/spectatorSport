0,605dea69-f889-4f53-97cc-e1a9cf47ba5f,[],,"European Council President Charles Michel, on Wednesday, announced that in addition to the fifth package of sanctions by the EU on Russia, which bans all imports of coal from Russia in the wake of its war on Ukraine, additional sanctions were incoming. Taking to Twitter, Michel said that the latest measure was taken to keep ‚Äúmaximum pressure on the Kremlin.‚Äù In recent times, the European bloc has stepped up its measure to completely phase out fuel imports from the Russian Federation. However, its leading economy Germany has shown opposition to a blanket ban emphasizing it would hurt the ‚ÄòEU more than Russia‚Äô.

Michel said, ‚ÄúWe are toughening our sanctions to keep maximum pressure on the Kremlin. The new package includes a ban on coal imports. And I think that measures on oil, and even gas, will also be needed sooner or later.

In addendum, he also revealed that the EU had agreed to develop a Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund to aid Ukraine. ‚ÄúIn the short-term, this Fund will help support the state of Ukraine and provide access to liquidity and financing. Longer term, it would provide massive investments to help rebuild the economy and infrastructure,‚Äù he said. ""Putin cannot, and will not, win this war because the values of Europe, of freedom and democracy, will win,"" he added.

Germany resists block on Russian fuel imports

Earlier this week, a top German lawmaker warned that barring Russian fuel imports would hurt the EU more than Russia. Addressing the media on Monday, Germany‚Äôs Finance Minister Christian Lindner stated, ""It is clear we must end as quickly as possible all economic ties to Russia. We must plan tough sanctions, but gas cannot be substituted in the short term. We would inflict more damage on ourselves than on them."" His remarks came as the Olaf Scholz-led administration rejected the proposal of a total EU embargo on Russian fuel imports.

Emphasizing that the bloc was dealing with a war criminal, Lindner suggested an alternative method to phase out Russian fuel imports. He noted that instead of a generic ban on all energy imports from Russia, the bloc could categorically ban oil, gas, and coal. He added that doing this would give them enough time to look for fossil fuel alternatives.

""In the short term, this fund will help support the state of Ukraine and provide liquidity and access to financing. In the long term, it will provide large investments to help rebuild the economy and infrastructure,"" Michel said.

Earlier, on April 5, the European Union announced a fifth package of sanctions against Russia in response to its war against Ukraine, which included an embargo on Russian coal imports and new sanctions on one of Russia's largest banks, VTB, among others. However, restrictive measures on oil imports, in particular, are still being worked on, European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said.

You are destroying EU with sanctions benefiting only USA and BRITAIN energy monopolies

You simply just make pressure to yourself....

You are pushing Europe into the middle ages you are EVIL

Charles MICHEL Typo: he meant sooner THAN later"". Apologies. His cabinetards still adjust, from EU-comfy-mode to full realisation we NOW choose: if the EU still exists at the end of this century or all Europeans became kow-towing serfs to the world's dictators.

What about sooner, rather than later, Monsieur Michel..? üôèüá∫üá¶

Thank you üôèüèª but pls hurry up with oil and gas. Coal is only a couple of percent of Russian export, while oil and gas give Russia hundreds of millions of profit daily.

I think you do well if you do the same thing on European territory. Especially if France no longer uses old nuclear factories

Russian soldiers opened fire on a cyclist in Bucha. you have to be schizophrenic like the Russians to qualify this genocide as a montage. where is the world going? What the fuck is the UN doing? the UN must be abolished.Putin is schizophrenic. he is crazy criminal. pic.twitter.com/9qGxfVWv0M

According real issue of the US, Africa and Palestine have no respect and their problem are ignored, but if an Israeli woman is injured, the US, UK ,UN and EU loudly call for the perpetrator to be arrested. But if Israel kills 3 million Palestinians, they remain their silent.

This is a typical PR campaign of responsible nothingdoer. The coal imports are not relevant and few, I guess from Poland the most. But that seems to be typical for these responsible useless Euronazis.

Right now a Russian oil tanker is off loading in the UK! This is unacceptable & frustrating.

O yes, you do just that! ü§£ You hang yourselves economically‚Ä¶ü§£ü§£ü§£

WOW, markets crashing, energie exploding, rubel rising. A total EU desaster. US would never sanction itself, neither china.

needed sooner or later?? It's needed NOW, what are we waiting for? More tortures? more bodies?

I know everyone is doing so much to help and that‚Äôs great, but so much is at stake here I have to say: define maximum.

The west must cancel visas and send the Russians home to spread the truth about what is happening in Ukraine.

When our grandchildren ask us about this war: ""You were all against this #Putin , in every way, with outrage, hate, even many willing to fight."" ""Yes"" ""How come you were giving billions every day to this evil #Russia for gas and oil?"" What will you answer? #Ukraine

Needs to be done, now!

Please. I know it's hard to ban Russian gas, but we can tax it and use this tax income to: - support Ukraine - infrastructure for alternative sources - make it cheaper for average citizens

What are you waiting for the measures on oil and gas? SHAME ON YOU! The blood of Ukrainian‚Äôs is on your shoulders!!

Putin orders his advisers to say they don't want Ukrainian territory. they do a ""special operation"" that is a massacre/genicidio. How can people like that exist in this world? I could die for myself, I didn't care at all, people like that don't deserve to be born, let alone live.

Sooner or later is not soon enough.

Measures on oil and gas were needed over a month ago you nincompoops

Peace and treaties no thermonuclear way OK ..

It looks like the markets are teaching the EU a lesson about sanctions. Sanctions are suppose to hit the other side...exploding energy prices help russia. #SelfSanctioningDesaster

The Russia of Putin has been in an existential war with The West since he came to Power. For those who know what the KGB got up to in the West before 1991, elements of the #Putin Putin Govt have been in such an information, influence and cold war for a lot longer 2/

EU chooses: exist at the end of this century or all Europeans become kow-towing serfs to the world's dictators. Ukrainians MUST WIN!

They were needed yesterday, but today is not too late.

Not sooner or later. Now !

please do more and do it faster. the longer you feed Putin, the more blood you've got on your hands

We have needed it since February 24.

Just let me know when if he gets out of the hospital üòÇ

Fight for freedom and fight for love. Russia doesn't love people. Russia hates them. We cannot allow to destroy freedom in Europe. We need to be united more than ever to face cruel regime of Wladimir Putin.

Ban the import of Russian oil üõ¢Ô∏èand natural gas now. Act now! @eucopresident

Sooner or later? Yesterday was fkin late. Pardon my French

Thank you! Sooner Thank you!

It‚Äôs not a war but an actual freedom denazification operation. The people of Luhansk /donbass /Eastern Ukraine had 8 years of war crimes committed by Kyiv and now the rest of Ukraine can‚Äôt speak up without ending up killed by the Kyiv regime like in bucha twitter.com/antiwar_soldie‚Ä¶

It will be interesting to see if the EU does ultimately ban Russian #oil and/or #gas Feels to me that arriving at a consensus on that decision will be hard, if not impossible.

You're paying Putin 800 million Euros a day, and rising, effectively funding his invasion of Ukraine. Stop.

Good to hear Russian #bloodcoal will no longer be consumed in the EU. I hope this will mean accelerating efforts for a Paris-compatible #endcoal date, and NOT keeping coal business as usual: depending on extraction of coal elsewhere which would be a collateral damage. #IPCCReport

Now, should've been yesterday, not ""sooner or later"". If your homes are engulfed in a raging fire and your family inside, you want the fire brigade pronto doing everything to put the fire out now, not sooner or later. #StandWithUkraine

You aren't keeping maximum pressure at all. Why make stuff up? The whole world knows the EU nations especially Germany continue to fund Russia against Ukraine. At least now more people around the world, can see what the EU truly is.

Unusual and noteworthy - both @vonderleyen and now @eucopresident pushing publically for much further sanctions on Russia, Michel even putting gas on the table. Puts pressure on the member states, but also creates the danger of overselling the EU's willingness to sanction further

Sooner, like now, rather than later or EU will go down as facilitating and funding genocide. German position is a disgrace. Zero learning from WW2.

European Council president Charles Michel on Wednesday expressed his ‚Äúoutrage at crimes against humanity, against innocent civilians in Bucha and in many other cities.‚Äù

Mr Michel referred to the town outside of Kyiv where graphic evidence of civilian massacres and torture has emerged following the withdrawal of Russian forces. He called on Russian soldiers to disobey orders and said the bloc's member countries should think of ways to offer asylum to those who do.

‚ÄúI have one message for the Russian soldiers on the battlefield,"" he said in a speech to the European Parliament.

""If you want no part in killing your Ukrainian brothers and sisters, if you don‚Äôt want to be a criminal, drop your weapons, stop fighting, leave the battlefield.""

Endorsing an idea previously circulated by some EU lawmakers, Mr Michel, who represents the bloc‚Äôs governments, added that granting asylum to Russian deserters is ‚Äúa valuable idea that should be pursued.‚Äù

A day after the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, proposed a ban on coal imports from Russia as part of a fifth round of sanctions, Mr Michel said the bloc should keep up the pressure on the Kremlin.

""I think that measures on oil, and even gas, will also be needed, sooner or later,"" he said.

The European Commission said the proposed ban on coal imports is worth four billion euros per year, and that the EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

It would be the first time the 27-nation bloc has sanctioned the country‚Äôs lucrative energy industry over the war.

A consensus among the 27 EU countries on targeting gas, the fuel used to generate electricity and heat homes, would be difficult to secure amid opposition from gas-dependent members like Germany, the bloc's largest economy.

Demands for increased sanctions intensified this week after grim images of bodies strewn across gardens and streets, and horrific accounts of civilian killings, rape and mass destruction emerged, as Russian troops withdrew from the outskirts of Kyiv, in towns and cities such as Bucha.

The Kremlin claims the images, which have stirred global revulsion, are fake and suggested the scenes were staged by the Ukrainians.

Ukraine's prosecutor and other officials claim Russian troops may have committed worse atrocities in the town of Borodyanka but the extent of destruction is not yet clear.",https://www.itv.com/news/2022-04-06/top-eu-chief-says-russian-soldiers-who-desert-war-should-be-offered-asylu

He also mentioned the need for more sanctions: ‚ÄúMeasures on oil and even gas will also be needed sooner or later.‚Äù On China, President Michel said, ‚Äúwe need to raise the awareness amongst the Chinese authorities not to support the war and not to help Russia avoid sanctions.‚Äù

Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said ‚Äúhumanity itself was killed in Bucha‚Äù, that the perpetrators must pay, and that they will be held accountable. With regard to the new package of sanctions against Russia, she said that the pressure on Putin must be further increased, to limit the Kremlin‚Äôs political and economic options. ‚ÄúThose sanctions will not be our last sanctions‚Äù, President von der Leyen said, stressing that ‚Äúwe must look into oil‚Äù and that Russia‚Äôs fossil fuel revenue stream must end.

‚ÄúWe have to have fewer rounds of applause but more arms for Ukraine‚Äù so they can defend themselves against Russia, EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell said, urging Europe to step up. Connecting energy policy with defence, he said Europe has so far spent roughly one billion euros on supporting Ukraine, the same amount the EU pays to Russia every day for its energy. ‚ÄúWe have to reduce our energy dependence: for once, climate change and geopolitics go hand in hand,‚Äù he said.

MEPs expressed shock at the images of the massacre in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, with several calling Vladimir Putin a war criminal and demanding he be tried at an international criminal court. In parallel, many MEPs argued for more support for Ukraine, including both money and weapons.

MEPs welcomed the fifth EU sanctions package presented on 5 April, but all speakers demanded the EU go further, with several proposing an immediate oil embargo. MEPs called for a complete ban on the use by Russian banks of the SWIFT system and bringing a wider group of oligarchs under the EU‚Äôs sanctions regime.

Several speakers warned that the surge in energy prices is affecting each member state differently and some of them dramatically so. They called for assistance for member states to ease their burden.
