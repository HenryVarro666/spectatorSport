Local officials had initially contested Russia’s claims that it had taken control of the crucial Black Sea port city of about 300,000 people early Wednesday.

But they conceded defeat late Wednesday, when Mayor Igor Kolykhaiev detailed a series of new rules for citizens after “armed visitors” stormed the city council, which included locals being allowed to go out only in pairs and drivers having to go slow and be “ready to show the contents of the transport at any moment.”

“The military will not be provoked. Stop at the first demand,” he wrote in a Facebook post.

“So far this is how it is,” he conceded. He said the Ukrainian flag was still flying, stressing, “And to keep it the same, these requirements must be met.”

The mayor added he was willing to talk because of the “huge difficulties” faced since the invasion, including “the collection and burial of the dead” as well as “the delivery of food and medicine.”

“We had no weapons and were not aggressive. We showed that we are working to secure the city and are trying to deal with the consequences of the invasion,” he said.

“I made no promises to them. … I just asked not to shoot people,” he said.

It was a key breakthrough for Russia, which has faced mounting signs of trouble in the invasion, with demoralized troops meeting tougher resistance than expected.

But the aggression continued for an eighth day Thursday, with a barrage of missiles continuing in several key cities — including Mariupol, whose mayor told CNN it had been shelled for 26 hours straight.

French President Emmanuel Macron said he believes “the worst is yet to come” in Ukraine following a 90-minute phone call he had Thursday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A senior French official told the Washington Post that Putin will be continuing “the military operation” and will “continue it to the end.”

However, a second round of peace talks could get underway Thursday with a Ukrainian official announcing early Thursday that a delegation is on its way via helicopter for talks with Russia.

Belarusian state news agency Belta had earlier quoted chief Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky as saying the high-stakes talks would begin in Belarus at 1200 GMT.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted in an interview with state TV Thursday that Moscow would press on with its military operation in Ukraine until “the end.”

He also accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, an ethnic Jew, of presiding over “a society where Nazism is flourishing.”

The Kremlin leader also accused NATO of seeking to maintain supremacy, insisting Russia could not let anyone undermine its interests — while downplaying fears the Kremlin was itching to use its nuclear arms.

“The thought of nuclear is constantly spinning in the heads of Western politicians but not in the heads of Russians,” he said. “I assure you that we will not allow any kind of provocation to unbalance us.”

He also expressed “great sorrow” over Russian military casualties, according to CNN.

“Naturally, we all express condolences to relatives and friends, those who have lost their husbands and children. Of course, this is a great tragedy for all of us,” Lavrov said.

Zelensky remained defiant Thursday.

“We have survived two world wars, three famines, the Holocaust, Babyn Yar, the Great Purge, the Chernobyl explosion, the occupation of Crimea, and the war in the east of our state,” Zelensky said in his latest Facebook video.

“They wanted to destroy us so many times, but they couldn’t.”

“We’ve been through so much,” the president continued. “And if someone thinks that after overcoming all this, Ukrainians, all of us, will be scared, broken, or surrendered, he just doesn’t know anything about us. He knows nothing about Ukraine.”

Western officials still believe that Russia is smarting at only having taken one city, having long assumed the plan was to swiftly topple the government in Kyiv.

But “the main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over [19 miles] from the center of the city having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion,” Britain’s Defense Ministry said in an intelligence update.

“The column has made little discernible progress in over three days,” it said. “Despite heavy Russian shelling, the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol remain in Ukrainian hands.”

A Ukrainian man living in the first major Ukrainian city captured by Russia told Insider he can't find food in stores and he only has enough food at home to last his family until tomorrow.

Stanislav, who lives near the center of the city with his wife and nine-year-old child, told Insider on Friday that he had food ""only for tomorrow.""

Stanislav — who asked only to be identified by his first name for his safety — said he had some potatoes, some flour, and around half a loaf of bread in his home.

He said he went into stores on Friday to try and buy food, but that shelves were empty: ""There is simply no food in supermarkets.""

""For now I am okay, but what will happen tomorrow, I don't know. Of course, I hope for a safe life,"" he told Insider.

Leaving the apartment to look for food is scary, Stanislav said.

He added that on Friday the city was relatively quiet as Russia was bringing in aid, but that he heard some shooting in the street.""

Russia has delivered some humanitarian aid to Ukraine since it invaded. But Stanislav said he would not eat the food for fear it has been poisoned, though he did not offer evidence for the fears.

Stanislav said that he would continue his search for food on Saturday, and hope to find something: ""I don't know. Maybe I'll find [food] somewhere, I'm not sure.""

Kherson was the first city to be captured by Russian troops in its invasion of Ukraine.

Other residents of the city have said they are concerned about food shortages, the Independent reported. One man in the city told the PA news agency, ""this town is going to starve if nothing comes.""

Ukrainian officials also say that the city of Mariupol is running low on food as Russia attacks it, according to the Financial Times. On Wednesday, Al Jazeera reported that food was running low in supermarkets in Kyiv.

Stanislav said on Friday that his apartment building was currently safe, but that he was afraid as Russians have hit residential buildings.

Stanislav previously spoke to Insider on March 2 before Kherson fell to Russian troops, when he said he was trying not to go outside for fear that he could be targeted by Russian troops.

""We are blocked in my city. The Russian soldiers are everywhere, even in the city. They have blocked the city, you cannot pass from one area to walk to another area because they shoot people.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-stores-empty-food-running-out-russians-capture-kherson-2022-3

With a column of Russian tanks and other vehicles apparently stalled for days outside the capital of Kyiv, fighting continued Thursday on multiple fronts across Ukraine.

Russia’s forces claimed to have taken complete control of Kherson, which would be the biggest city to fall in the invasion thus far. Britain’s Defense Ministry said that was possible, though not yet verified.

A senior US defense official earlier disputed the idea that the Russians controlled Kherson, a Black Sea shipbuilding city of 280,000.

“Our view is that Kherson is very much a contested city,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The mayor of Kherson, Igor Kolykhaev, said Russian soldiers were in the city and came to the city administration building. He said he asked them not to shoot civilians and to allow crews to gather up the bodies from the streets.

“We don’t have any Ukrainian forces in the city, only civilians and people here who want to LIVE,” he said in a statement later posted on Facebook.

The mayor said Kherson would maintain a strict 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew and restrict traffic into the city to food and medicine deliveries. The city will also require pedestrians to walk in groups no larger than two, obey commands to stop and not to “provoke the troops.”

“The flag flying over us is Ukrainian,” he wrote. “And for it to stay that way, these demands must be observed.”

A second round of talks aimed at ending the fighting was expected later Thursday in the Brest region of neighboring Belarus, which also borders Poland — though the two sides appeared to have little common ground.

Overnight, Associated Press reporters in the capital Kyiv heard at least one explosion before videos started circulating of apparent strikes on the capital.

The Ukrainian president’s office reported a powerful explosion Wednesday night between the Southern Railway Station and the Ibis hotel in Kyiv. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry is located near that area.

Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had knocked out a reserve broadcasting center in the Lysa Hora district, about 7 kilometers (4 miles) south of the government headquarters. It said unspecified precision weapons were used, and that there were no casualties or damage to residential buildings.

A statement from the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces didn’t address the strikes, saying only that Russian forces were “regrouping” and “trying to reach the northern outskirts” of the city.

In a videotaped address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Ukrainians to keep up the resistance. He vowed that the invaders would have “not one quiet moment” and described Russian soldiers as “confused children who have been used.”

“We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,” he said. “They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.”

He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who “go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat.”

“These are not warriors of a superpower,” he said. “These are confused children who have been used.”

In other developments, the UK Defense Ministry said Mariupol, a large city on the Azov Sea, was encircled by Russian forces.

However, Ukraine’s military said Russian forces “did not achieve the main goal of capturing Mariupol” in its statement.

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said the attacks there had been relentless.

“We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop,” he was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying.

Meanwhile, the senior US defense official said an immense Russian column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles appeared to be stalled roughly 25 kilometers (16 miles) from Kyiv and had made no real progress in the last couple of days.

The convoy, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, has been plagued with fuel and food shortages, the official said.

Russia’s long-telegraphed invasion has frequently appeared hamstrung by poor logistics, tactical blunders and fierce resistance from Ukraine’s underpowered and outgunned military — and from ever-swelling ranks of volunteer fighters.

Scores of images have emerged of burned-out Russian tanks, the charred remains of transporters and of unarmed Ukrainians confronting bewildered occupying forces.

“The advance on Kyiv has been rather not very organized and now they’re more or less stuck,” military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer told the AP in Moscow.

At least 227 civilians have been killed and another 525 wounded since the invasion began, according to the latest figures from the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Earlier, Ukraine said more than 2,000 civilians have died, a figure that could not be independently verified.

The UN office uses strict methodology and counts only confirmed casualties, and admits its figures are a vast undercount.

Russia isolated

Russian President Vladimir Putin now finds himself an international pariah, his country the subject of sanctions that sent the ruble into further freefall on currency markets Thursday.

Russia’s central bank — whose foreign reserves have been frozen in the West — imposed a 30 percent tax on all sales of hard currency, following a run on lenders by ordinary Russians.

The unfolding financial costs were underlined as ratings agencies Fitch and Moody’s slashed Russia’s sovereign debt to “junk” status.

Felgenhauer said with the Russian economy already suffering, there could be a “serious internal political crisis” if Putin does not find a way to end the war quickly.

“There’s no real money to run to fight this war,” he said, adding that if Putin and the military “are unable to wrap up this campaign very swiftly and victoriously, they’re in a pickle.”

Russia reported its military casualties for the first time in the war, saying nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and almost 1,600 wounded. Ukraine did not disclose its own military losses.

Ukraine’s military general staff said in a Facebook post that Russia’s forces had suffered some 9,000 casualties in the fighting. It did not clarify if that figure included both killed and wounded soldiers.

Refugee rush

Around Ukraine, others crowded into train stations, carrying children wrapped in blankets and dragging wheeled suitcases into new lives as refugees.

In an email, UN refugee agency spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams told the AP that the refugee count surpassed 1 million as of midnight in central Europe, based on figures collected by national authorities.

Shabia Mantoo, another spokesperson for the agency, said that “at this rate” the exodus from Ukraine could make it the source of “the biggest refugee crisis this century.”

The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, a city of about 1.5 million people where residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the city’s train station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed.

The EU Commission said it will give temporary residence permits to refugees fleeing the violence and allow them to study and work in the 27-nation bloc. The move would need the approval of member states, which have already expressed broad support.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/fate-of-ukraine-city-kherson-unclear-mariupol-encircled-ahead-of-2nd-round-of-talks/

Moscow’s advance on Ukraine’s capital has apparently stalled over the past few days, with a huge armored column north of Kyiv at a standstill, but the military has made significant gains in the south as part of an effort to sever the country’s connection to the Black and Azov seas.

The Russian military said it had control of Kherson, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed that forces have taken over local government headquarters in the Black Sea port of 280,000, making it the first major city to fall since the invasion began a week ago.

Heavy fighting continued on the outskirts of another strategic port, Mariupol, on the Azov Sea, plunging it into darkness, isolation, and fear. Electricity and phone service were largely down, and homes and shops faced food and water shortages.

Without phone connections, medics did not know where to take the wounded.

Ukrainians still in the country faced another grim day. In Kyiv, snow gave way to a cold, gray drizzle, as long lines formed outside the few pharmacies and bakeries that remain open. New shelling was reported in the northern city of Chernihiv, where the mayor said he was struggling to organize safe passage for civilians.

Families with children fled via muddy and snowy roads in the eastern region of Donetsk, while military strikes on the village of Yakovlivka near the eastern city of Kharkiv destroyed 30 homes, leaving three dead and seven injured, and rescuers pulled 10 people from the ruins, according to emergency authorities.

Ukrainian authorities called on the people to wage guerrilla warfare against Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s forces by cutting down trees, erecting barricades in the cities, and attacking enemy columns from the rear.

“Total resistance. ... This is our Ukrainian trump card and this is what we can do best in the world,” Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovich said in a video message, recalling guerrilla actions in Nazi-occupied Ukraine during World War II.

In just seven days of fighting, more than 2% of Ukraine’s population has been forced out of the country, according to the tally the U.N. refugee agency released to The Associated Press.

The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, with about 1.4 million people. Residents desperate to escape falling shells and bombs crowded the railroad station and pressed onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed.

At least 227 civilians have been killed and 525 wounded in that time, according to the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, though it acknowledged that is a vast undercount, and Ukraine earlier said more than 2,000 civilians have died. That figure could not be independently verified.

A second round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations was expected later in the day Thursday in neighboring Belarus, though the two sides appeared to have little common ground.

“We are ready to conduct talks, but we will continue the operation because we won’t allow Ukraine to preserve a military infrastructure that threatens Russia,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, repeating an accusation Moscow has repeatedly used to justify its invasion – that the West is turning Ukraine against Moscow.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. defense official said the immense Russian column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles appeared to be stalled roughly 25 kilometers (16 miles) from Kyiv and had made no real progress in the last few days.

The convoy, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, has been plagued with fuel and food shortages, the official said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian land forces have stalled and Moscow is now unleashing air attacks, but that they are being parried by Ukrainian defense systems, including in Kherson.

“Kyiv withstood the night and another missile and bomb attack. Our air defenses worked,” he said. “Kherson, Izyum – all the other cities that the occupiers hit from the air did not give up anything.”

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions heard overnight in the Ukrainian capital were Russian missiles being shot down by air defense systems.

In Kherson, the Russians took over the regional administration headquarters, said Hennady Lahuta, governor of the region. But he added that he and other officials continued to perform their duties.

From Kherson, Russian troops appeared to roll toward Mykolaiv, another major Black Sea port and shipbuilding center to the west. The regional governor, Vitaliy Kim, said that big convoys of Russian troops were advancing on the city.

A group of Russian amphibious landing vessels also headed toward the port of Odesa, farther west, the Ukrainian military said.

Russia reported its military casualties Wednesday for the first time in the war, saying nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and almost 1,600 wounded. Ukraine insisted Russia’s losses are many times higher but did not disclose its own military casualties.

In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Mr. Zelenskyy praised his country’s resistance.

“We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,” he said. “They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment.”

He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who “go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat.”

“These are not warriors of a superpower,” he said. “These are confused children who have been used.”

Around Ukraine, others crowded into train stations, carrying children wrapped in blankets and dragging wheeled suitcases into new lives as refugees.

Among the million-plus refugees who have fled Ukraine in recent days were some 200 orphans with severe physical and mental disabilities who arrived from Kyiv by train in Hungary on Wednesday.

""Sanctions against Russia are very significant. Economically painful. But still not enough for the Russian military machine to be left without means of subsistence. We promote stronger, more destructive ones,"" Zelenskyy said.

These are the key events so far on Tuesday, March 8. Get all the latest updates here.

Humanitarian corridor

Moscow opened corridors to allow people to leave five Ukrainian cities: Cherhihiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and the capital Kyiv, as well as Sumy. Russia’s Interfax news agency reported. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Tuesday that civilians will start leaving Sumy and Irpin. Earlier, Russia had announced plans for another ceasefire and opening of “humanitarian corridors” to let civilians in besieged Ukrainian cities evacuate in the direction of their choice. This came after Ukraine rejected an earlier Russian plan that proposed evacuation routes mostly to Russia and its ally, Belarus.

Shelling major cities while fleeing

Russian forces have launched hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks, dropping powerful bombs on residential areas of Chernihiv, a city north of Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said. Mykolaiv in the south and Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, were also shelled. Ukrainian forces were also defending Odesa, Ukraine’s largest port city, from Russian ships. But a long Russian armoured column threatening Kyiv remained stalled.

More talks

Russian negotiators said they did not have positive developments to report following talks with Ukraine and warned not to expect the next round to bring a final result. The talks “are not easy,” Vladimir Medinsky said. A fourth round will take place very soon, Russia said. The Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers are expected to meet in Turkey on Thursday.

Death toll

Ukraine’s military intelligence said that Ukrainian forces killed a Russian general near the besieged city of Kharkiv – the second Russian senior commander to die in the invasion. Russia’s defence ministry could not be immediately reached for comment. Ukraine says its forces have killed more than 11,000 Russian troops. Russia has confirmed about 500 losses. Neither side has disclosed Ukrainian casualties.

At least nine people, including two children, have died in an “enemy” air strike on the city of Sumy, some 350 kilometres (217 miles) east of Kyiv, the Ukrainian rescue services told AFP.

Oil crisis

Russia warned that oil prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it might close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West halts oil imports over the invasion of Ukraine, as peace talks made little progress. Russian natural gas company Gazprom continued gas shipments via Ukraine at the same volume of 109.5 million cubic metres a day, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.

Aid

The World Bank approved $723m in loans and grants for Ukraine to be transferred in the next few days. US congressional negotiators neared a deal to provide Ukraine with billions of dollars in emergency aid. The White House requested $10bn.

Refugee crisis

A Russian air attack hit a bread factory in northern Ukraine and killed at least 13 civilians, Ukrainian officials said. As many as five million Ukrainians could flee the country if Russia’s invasion continues, the EU’s top diplomat said, while the United Nations’ refugee agency said at least 1.7 million have left so far.

International repercussions on food

Germany will host a virtual meeting of agricultural ministers from G7 countries on Friday to discuss the effects of the invasion on global food security and how to best stabilise food markets, the government said.

The capture of the Black Sea city of 290,000 people, which just last year hosted NATO-supported war games, appeared a significant boost for Moscow as it readied for potential ceasefire talks on Thursday.

Russian ""occupiers"" were in ""all parts"" of Kherson, Ukrainian regional official Gennady Lakhuta conceded late on Wednesday.

After a three-day siege that left Kherson short of food and medicine, and struggling to collect and bury its dead, the town's mayor also announced he was in talks with ""armed guests.""

He had ""made no promises"" to the invading forces, but agreed to a night curfew and restrictions on car traffic.

""So far so good. The flag flying above us is Ukrainian. And for it to stay that way, these requirements must be met,"" he said in a Facebook post.

Stalled elsewhere, Russia continues to make significant advances on the southern front, with troops breaking through in Kherson -- opening the path west and north -- and besieging the larger strategically vital port city of Mariupol.

There, mayor Vadym Boychenko reported hours of punishing bombardments that trapped civilians in a city now without light, water or heating as temperatures hover around freezing.

Moscow's victory in Kherson comes one week after Russian President Vladimir Putin's army marched into Ukraine from the north, east and south, training a vast arsenal of weaponry at Ukrainian cities.

Russian forces have sporadically bombarded civilian targets across the country, including the capital Kyiv and the majority Russian-speaking second city of Kharkiv, which is now coming under more intense attack.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called the barrage of missiles, shells and rockets a ""war crime"" and the International Criminal Court has confirmed an investigation is underway.

Amid violence that has kindled memories of Europe's blood-soaked past, one million Ukrainians have now fled across the border into neighbouring Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova, according to the UN refugee agency's rapidly rising tally.

Putin's long-telegraphed invasion has frequently appeared hamstrung by poor logistics, tactical blunders and fierce resistance from Ukraine's underpowered and outgunned military -- and from ever-swelling ranks of volunteer fighters.

Scores of images have emerged of burned-out Russian tanks, the charred remains of transporters and of unarmed Ukrainians confronting bewildered occupying forces.

A senior US defence official said the massive column of Russian military vehicles amassed north of Kyiv had ""stalled"" due to fuel and food shortages.

Russian authorities had been silent on the toll of the invasion, and have a domestic media blackout on what the Kremlin euphemistically calls a ""special military operation"".

But the Ministry of Defence on Wednesday acknowledged for the first time that 498 soldiers had ""died in the line of duty"".

Ukrainian forces put the Russian toll at 10 times that number. The true figure is not known.

Despite risks and restrictions, Russians have turned out for large anti-war protests across the country, in a direct challenge to Putin's 20-year rule.

Thousands of anti-war demonstrators have been detained, including several dozen in rallies in Moscow and Saint Petersburg on Wednesday.

""I couldn't stay at home. This war has to be stopped,"" student Anton Kislov, 21, told AFP.

Diplomatic rebuke

At the United Nations, the General Assembly issued another powerful rebuke, overwhelmingly backing a resolution demanding Russia ""immediately"" withdraw from Ukraine.

Moscow lost the vote 141-5 winning the support of only four other nations -- Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria. Its allies China and Cuba abstained.

In Washington, top US diplomat Antony Blinken warned the human costs were already ""staggering,"" accusing Russia of attacking places that ""aren't military targets.""

""Hundreds if not thousands of civilians have been killed or wounded,"" said the secretary of state, who will travel to eastern Europe next week to shore up support for Ukraine -- and for efforts to secure a ceasefire.

Kyiv is sending a delegation to the Thursday ceasefire talks, at an undisclosed location on the Belarus-Poland border, but has warned it would not accept ""ultimatums"".

EU and NATO members have already sent arms and ammunition to Ukraine, although they have made clear that they will not send troops and the EU has dampened Zelensky's hopes of membership of the bloc.

Refugee total exceeds 1 million - UNHCR

BORODYANKA, Ukraine, March 3 (Reuters) - Ukraine said it would call for humanitarian corridors for its besieged citizens at peace talks with Russia on Thursday, as war entered its second week with Ukrainian cities surrounded and under bombardment.

Hundreds of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed since President Vladimir Putin sent his troops over the border on Feb. 24. Russia itself has been plunged into isolation never before experienced by an economy of such size. read more

The United Nations said more than 1 million refugees had fled in just seven days, one of the fastest exoduses in memory.

Ukrainian negotiator Davyd Arakhamia posted a picture on Facebook of himself preparing to board a helicopter for talks, which he said would start around 1400 GMT. He did not say where.

""The minimum programme: humanitarian corridors,"" he said. Neither side has suggested it was expecting breakthroughs after a first round of talks held in Belarus on Monday led to no progress.

Despite an initial battle plan that Western countries said was aimed at swiftly toppling the Kyiv government it describes as dangerous nationalists who threaten its security, Russia has captured only one Ukrainian city so far - the southern Dnipro River port of Kherson, which its tanks entered on Wednesday.

With its main assault force halted for days on a highway north of Kyiv, Russia has shifted tactics, escalating its bombardment of major cities. Swathes of central Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million people, have been blasted into rubble.

Mariupol, the main port of eastern Ukraine, has been surrounded under heavy bombardment, with no water or power. Officials say they cannot evacuate the wounded. The city council compared the situation to the World War Two siege of Leningrad. read more

'NOTHING TO LOSE'

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stayed in Kyiv, releasing regular video updates to the nation. In his latest message, he said Ukrainian lines were holding. ""We have nothing to lose but our own freedom,"" he said. read more

Britain's defence ministry said the main body of the huge Russian column advancing on Kyiv was still 30 km (19 miles) from the city centre, held up by Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. read more

""The column has made little discernible progress in over three days,"" it said in an intelligence update.

In Borodyanka, a small town 60 km (40 miles) northwest of Kyiv where locals had repelled a Russian assault, burnt out hulks of destroyed Russian armour were scattered on a highway, surrounded by buildings blasted into ruins. Flames from one burning apartment building lit up the pre-dawn sky.

""They started shooting from their APC towards the park in front of the post office,"" a man recounted in the apartment where he was sheltering with his family, referring to a Russian armoured personnel carrier.

""Then those bastards started the tank and started shooting into the supermarket which was already burned. It caught fire again.

""An old man ran outside like crazy, with big round eyes, and said 'give me a Molotov cocktail! I just set their APC on fire!...Give me some petrol, we'll make a Molotov cocktail and burn the tank!'.""

At least nine people were killed and four wounded in a Russian air strike that hit two schools and private houses in the eastern Chernihiv region on Thursday, governor Viacheslav Chaus said in an online post.

Footage from a car dashboard camera, verified by Reuters, showed buildings in a residential area in Chernihiv hit by apparent missiles. The street was engulfed in a fireball and a huge cloud of black smoke rose into the sky.

Two cargo ships came under apparent attack at Ukrainian ports. Four crew members were missing after Estonian-owned ship exploded and sank off Odessa, and at least one crew member was killed in a blast on a Bangladeshi ship at Olvia. Ukraine is one of the world's biggest grain and food oil exporters from its Black Sea ports.

'YOU ARE LYING TO YOURSELF'

Amid Moscow's increasing diplomatic isolation, only Belarus, Eritrea, Syria and North Korea voted with Russia against an emergency resolution at the United Nations General Assembly condemning Moscow's ""aggression"".

Putin spoke by telephone to French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday, telling him Russia would achieve its goals, including the demilitarisation and neutrality of Ukraine, the Kremlin said. Macron told Putin ""you are lying to yourself"", about the government in Kyiv, and said the war would cost Russia dearly, a French official said. read more

In Beijing, organisers sent Russian and Belarusian athletes home from the Paralympic Games, saying Moscow and Minsk were to blame for violating the Olympic Truce. Russia called the ban ""monstrous"". read more

In Russia itself, where nearly all major opposition figures have been jailed or exiled in a crackdown over the past year, the authorities have banned reporting that describes the ""special military operation"" as an ""invasion"" or ""war"".

Ekho Moskvy radio, the best-known independent broadcaster of the post-Soviet era and one of Russia's few remaining liberal voices, shut itself down on Thursday after authorities ordered it off the air.

Riot police snatched peaceful protesters off the streets in St Petersburg late on Wednesday, including a 77-year-old woman filmed being muscled away by men in black helmets. Activists distributed footage of a small girl weeping behind bars, having been arrested for holding up a sign that said ""No war"".

STALLED ADVANCE

Military analysts say Russia's advance has been a tactical fiasco, with poorly maintained columns now confined to roads as spring thaw turns Ukrainian ground to mud. Each day the main attack force lies stuck on the highway north of Kyiv, its condition deteriorates, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.

""The longer Russian forces sit forward, the lower their readiness and performance will be. Everything from state of tires, to supply availability, and in the end morale,"" he tweeted.

The great fear is that, as the likelihood of rapid victory recedes, Russia will fall back on tactics it used in Syria and Chechnya, where it pounded the cities of Aleppo and Grozny to ruins.

Russia has already acknowledged nearly 500 of its soldiers killed. Ukraine says it has killed nearly 9,000, though this cannot be confirmed. Ukrainian authorities have offered to free Russian prisoners if their mothers come fetch them.

Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, is the only significant urban centre to fall. Mayor Igor Kolykhayev said he had asked the Russians who entered city hall ""not to shoot people"".

The International Criminal Court's top prosecutor said an advance team had left The Hague for the Ukraine region on Thursday to start investigating possible war crimes. Russia denies targeting civilians and says its aim is to ""disarm"" Ukraine and arrest leaders it falsely calls neo-Nazis. read more

A resident from the Ukrainian city of Kherson told Thursday that there had been chaos and panic in the city as residents tried to get basic necessities amid Russia’s ongoing invasion.

According to the local resident, the town is suffering a severe lack of food and medicine — particularly insulin — with pharmacies being looted.

The local resident also claimed that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men.

Kherson’s Mayor Ihor Kolykhaiev said Wednesday in a statement shared on his Facebook page that the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of “armed people who came to the city’s administration” – indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control.

British military intelligence released early Thursday noted that “some Russian forces have entered the city of Kherson,” but cautioned that the military situation on the ground “remains unclear.”

In a statement on Thursday, Hennadii Lahuta, the head of the Kherson Regional State Administration, said Russian forces have “completely occupied” the regional state administration building.

“We have not given up our responsibilities. The regional operational headquarters, which I lead, continues its work and addresses issues to help residents of the region. We are waiting for humanitarian aid,” Lahuta added.

Speaking to CNN, the Kherson resident said some locals had approached Russian soldiers in the city, who told them that they were from the Russian city of Voronezh and doubted they would leave the city alive.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-03-22/h_908c3139eb50f5ee8be88aa09b27c6f8
