The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

(NEW YORK) — Russian President Vladimir Putin announced early Thursday local time that military operations had begun in Ukraine, kicking off a long-feared attack on their European neighbor.

Earlier Wednesday, Ukraine had taken steps to brace for a possible Russian invasion, declaring a nationwide state of emergency and calling up 36,000 military reservists.

U.S. President Joe Biden said a day earlier that the world is witnessing “the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine” as he announced new economic sanctions on Russia, after weeks of escalating tensions in the region.

Biden’s remarks followed a fiery address from Putin to the Russian public on Monday evening, when the leader announced he was recognizing the independence of two Russia-backed separatist areas in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region — the self-proclaimed People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk — which prompted a set of sanctions from Western countries, including Germany halting approval of a major gas pipeline from Russia.

While the United States says some 190,000 Russian troops and pro-Russian separatist forces are estimated to be massed near Ukraine’s borders, Russia has blamed Ukraine for stoking the crisis and reiterated its demands that Ukraine pledges to never join NATO.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russian President Vladimir Putin’s early morning attack on Ukraine is a “full-scale invasion” and added that the world needs to respond immediately.

“Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” Kuleba tweeted. “Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”

NATO secretary general condemns Russia’s ‘reckless and unprovoked’ attack

As reports of explosions came in from multiple Ukrainian cities, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg issued a statement condemning “Russia’s reckless and unprovoked attack.”

Booms and explosions have been heard in Kyiv — Ukraine’s capital, which is in the north-central part of the country — as well as Dnipro in central Ukraine and Odessa in the southwest.

“I strongly condemn Russia’s reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives,” Stoltenberg said. “Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.”

Stoltenberg said NATO allies would meet to talk about consequences of Russia’s “aggressive” actions.

“This is a grave breach of international law and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security,” he said. “I call on Russia to cease its military action immediately and respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”

Biden speaks on Russia attack: ‘Putin has chosen a premeditated war’

President Joe Biden released a statement calling Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military operation in Ukraine an “unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces.”

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Biden said. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.”

Biden said he would be monitoring the situation from the White House.

On Thursday, he will meet with his “G7 counterparts” — leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom — and then will give an address to announce “further consequences” on Russia “for this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security,” he said.

Additionally, Biden said, the U.S. will coordinate with NATO allies “to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance.”

Russia begins attack on Ukraine as UN pleads for him to pull back

As President Vladimir Putin announced his invasion of Ukraine on Russian state TV, President Joe Biden’s envoy at the U.N. was making a plea to Moscow to halt any action.

“This is a perilous moment, and we are here for one reason and one reason only: to ask Russia to stop,” Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said at the special session. “Return to your borders. Send your troops, and your tanks, and your planes back to their barracks and hangars. And send your diplomats to the negotiating table.”

“Back away from the brink, before it is too late,” she added, though it already appears to be too late.

Thomas-Greenfield said she spoke with Biden before Wednesday night’s meeting, saying he wanted to make clear the U.S. and its allies “will continue to respond to Russia’s actions with unity, clarity and conviction.”

Thomas-Greenfield threw down the gauntlet to other countries, saying “all parties are not culpable here. There’s no middle ground. … Russia is the aggressor here.”

Like other U.S. officials, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, she tried to appeal to the Russian people: “Everyday Russians should be asking themselves, right now, how many Russian lives Putin will sacrifice for his cynical ambitions?”

She ended by quoting the Ukrainian foreign minister, saying, “The people of Ukraine are counting on us. Let’s not let them down.”

Putin announces military operation in Ukraine

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would undertake a special military operation in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine in a speech on Russian state TV early Thursday morning.

Putin said the operation is aimed at what he called the “demilitarization” and “denazification” of Ukraine.

Putin said Russia’s plans did not include occupying Ukraine, but he called on Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms and go home.

He warned outside countries not to interfere.

UN Security Council session underway

The U.S., France and other members of the United Nations Security Council are working on a draft resolution to condemn Russia during its late-night session Wednesday, according to France’s permanent representative to the U.N.

In somewhat of a rarity, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the chamber, speaking to the urgency of the meeting.

Looking directly into the camera ahead of him, Guterres addressed Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“If indeed an operation is being prepared, I have only one thing to say from the bottom of my heart: President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died,” he said.

Before the meeting, Guterres chatted with Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya, who also talked with China’s envoy Zhang Jun.

It’s unclear if the resolution will get a vote during the emergency session. But when it comes up, it will likely be denied by Russia and its veto power.

In 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, a U.S. resolution declaring the action invalid was denied by Russia’s veto, while China abstained. The U.S. then brought the resolution to the U.N. General Assembly, where resolutions are non-binding but every member has a vote. It passed with about 100 votes in favor.

Russia issues notices for air travel to avoid northeastern Ukraine

Russia has issued a series of NOTAMs, or Notice to Air Missions, in northeastern Ukraine as a warning to civilian aircraft in the area.

There are 12 NOTAMs from Russia providing coordinates that map in northeastern Ukraine. They include warnings to airports in Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro and Odesa and say they are “due to potential hazard for civil aviation.”

These alerts are a warning from Russia to flights entering these areas that they do so at their own risk.

Ukrainian president posts video, says he tried to call Putin but got ‘silence’

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an impassioned televised address, in which he said Ukraine doesn’t want war and rejected Russia’s claims that Ukraine is a threat or home to Nazism.

Zelenskyy said he tried to call Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. “The result — silence,” he said.

Zelenskyy spoke in Russian for part of the address to appeal directly to the Russian people.

“We don’t need war. Not a cold one, nor a hot one, nor a hybrid one,” Zelenskyy said.

“We are separated by more than 2,000 kilometers of shared border. Along it today stand your troops, almost 200,000 soldiers, thousands of military vehicles,” he added. “Your leadership has approved their step forward, onto the territory of another country.

Pentagon warns Russia is ‘ready’ to invade

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby, at an afternoon press briefing on Wednesday, said Russian forces are now prepared for an invasion of Ukraine.

“What we see is that Russian forces continue to assemble closer to the border and put themselves in an advanced stage of readiness to act to conduct military action in Ukraine,” Kirby said. “We believe that they are ready.”

He said that the U.S. does not know when or how an invasion might begin but repeated President Joe Biden’s message that if a large-scale invasion happens, it will be a “war of choice” for Putin.

“There will be suffering, there will be sacrifice, and all of that must and should be laid at his feet because he’s doing this by choice,” Kirby said.

“I would hope that he understands that some of those lives at risk will be his soldiers’ lives and he’s going to have to answer to Russian moms and dads about their soldiers that aren’t making it back home alive or making it back with injuries. He’s going to have to answer for that,” Kirby added later.

Kirby went farther than a senior defense official who spoke to reporters earlier Wednesday, saying the U.S. “certainly” believes Russia is sending additional troops into the separatist-controlled areas of Donbas.

“We can’t confirm with any great specificity, the numbers and what the formations are, what the capabilities are, but we certainly that that’s happening,” he said.

State Department addresses Nord Stream 2 sanctions

State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at Wednesday’s briefing that “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is beginning.”

Price outlined the sanctions placed on Russia, including President Joe Biden’s recent sanctioning of Nord Stream 2 AG, the company in charge of the natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany.

“By acting together with the Germans, how we did when we did and the way in which we did, we have ensured that this is an $11 billion prize investment that is now a hunk of steel, sitting at the bottom of the sea,” Price said.

Echoing remarks from Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday, Price said the U.S. will no longer engage in the “pretense of diplomacy” with Russia, adding, “This is and has been, in some ways, diplomatic Kabuki theater on the part of the Russians.

“The goal now is to “avert the worst-case scenario” in Ukraine, he said, which may include “an attack on major urban centers, including Kyiv” and “horrific human rights abuses, atrocities, potential war crimes.”

“These are all things that even as the invasion is beginning, we are going to do everything we reasonably can to prevent from happening,” Price said.

When asked about former President Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praising Russian President Vladimir Putin this week, Price replied, “I have no response. In fact, I have no words.”

Pelosi defends Biden’s handling of crisis

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “tyrant” on Wednesday and defended President Joe Biden’s handling of the crisis in Ukraine.

“This is the same tyrant who attacked our democracy in 2016,” Pelosi said during her weekly press briefing. “This is the same tyrant who is opposed to democracy and wants to minimize, trivialize it, to downgrade it in the eyes of the Russian people.”

While Biden has faced political attacks from some Republicans who argue U.S. sanctions do not go far enough, Pelosi called the president’s actions “appropriate.”

“This is a unified effort by our allies in the NATO alliance. And what was proposed was what was agreed to in terms of timing,” she said.

ABC News’ senior congressional correspondent Rachel Scott asked Pelosi and other lawmakers if they believe the sanctions announced by the administration Tuesday were enough to deter Putin.

“I think the sanctions are going to just continue to increase and we’ll have an ultimately crippling impact on many sectors of the Russian economy,” Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., responded.

Pelosi added that Russia hasn’t seen the “depth” of the sanctions take hold yet.

“Putin is probably the richest man in the world,” Pelosi said. “Follow the money. That’s what’s the sanctions are about.”

Biden imposes US sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG

President Joe Biden announced additional sanctions on Wednesday impacting Nord Stream 2 AG, the company in charge of building Nord Stream 2, the massive natural gas pipeline connecting Russia to Germany’s Baltic coast.

“Yesterday, after further close consultations between our two governments, Germany announced that it would halt certification of the pipeline. Today, I have directed my administration to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers,” Biden said in a statement.

Biden said he had directed his administration to sanction Nord Stream 2 AG, as well as the firm’s corporate officers.

The Biden administration had held off sanctioning the company, holding the threat of sanctions as leverage.

The president said this move was part of the “initial tranche of sanctions” that he first announced and began to roll out on Tuesday.

Russian forces ‘as ready as they can be’ to invade: US defense official

About 80% of Russian forces amassed around Ukraine are in what the Pentagon calls “forward positions” and are “ready to go” if given the order to invade, a senior defense official said Wednesday.

The official said the U.S. has not seen Russian troops breaking out from the two separatist republics in eastern Ukraine but added that the U.S. is operating under the assumption that Russia has, indeed, sent more troops into the separatist-controlled area of Donbas.

“We have we have been saying any day now, and it is certainly possible that today is that day,” the official said. “They could go at any hour now.”

While the official said it still appears Russia is preparing for a large-scale invasion, they added, “If ever we want to be wrong, we want to be wrong about this.”

White House threatens other sanctions in US toolkit

Asked by ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Cecilia Vega on what the U.S. could do if sanctions imposed Tuesday don’t work, White House press secretary Jen Psaki laid out additional sanctions that the U.S. could still impose.

“Sanctions can take a number of formats, right?” Psaki said at Tuesday’s press briefing. “Export controls is certainly one of them. There’s many more sanctions that we have at our disposal. Swift, the SWIFT system is obviously significant, not in the first tranche, but there’s a range of options that remain on the table for sanctions.”

While the U.S. said Tuesday that cutting Russia off from the international SWIFT financial system was still an option, it’s conceivable the Russians could find a way around SWIFT and move to other less-regulated payments systems.

Psaki also said sanctions are not intended to have “the harshest impact on the first day” but are “designed to have a squeezing impact over the course of time and we have many more escalatory steps that we could take.”

The top White House official crafting U.S. sanctions on Russia, Daleep Singh, also told reporters that the U.S. wasn’t seeking to “max out on sanctions” but that “they’re meant to prevent and deter a large-scale invasion of Ukraine that could involve the seizure of major cities, including Kyiv.”

Psaki echoed Biden in saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s speech to the Russian people on Monday “was rife with historical inaccuracy” and that Putin “made clear that he does not view Ukraine, not just the areas he recognized yesterday, but that the totality of Ukraine as an independent country.”

Notably, Biden did not mention personally targeting Putin on Tuesday, which he had previously said he was considering.

Lawmakers warn Biden to seek authorization before sending troops to Ukraine

While President Joe Biden has made clear he is not considering sending U.S. troops into Ukraine, having said it would lead to war, a group of lawmakers sent him a letter late Tuesday to remind him that he must get authorization from Congress before he decides to engage the military in Ukraine.

The bipartisan oddball group of lawmakers who signed the letter includes Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, and Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., among about three dozen others.

“If the ongoing situation compels you to introduce the brave men and women of our military into Ukraine, their lives would inherently be put at risk of Russia chooses to invade,” read the letter, which Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., shared on Twitter. “Therefore, we ask that your decisions comport with the Constitution and our nation’s laws by consulting with Congress to receive authorization before any such development.”

Lawmakers wrote that the War Powers Resolution of 1973 has been abused by previous presidents, and they noted that the act restricted Biden from not only engaging troops in battle but also from launching a “pre-emptive strike.”

“Congress stands ready to deliberate over the potentially monumental implications of such scenarios,” they said.

EU imposes more sanctions on Russia

The European Union imposed Wednesday another slew of tough sanctions on Russia over its recognition of two pro-Russian separatist areas in eastern Ukraine.

The move is an attempt to deter Moscow from proceeding further withs its invasion of Ukraine and follows Tuesday’s decision by Germany to halt the certification of a key natural gas pipeline to Russia.

The package of measures adopted by the Council of the EU were published online Wednesday and include a ban on the Russian state and its central bank from accessing the EU’s capital and finance markets; sanctions against three Russian state banks; blacklisting all 351 members of the Russian parliament that voted earlier this week to ratify the decision to recgonize the separatist regions as independent; sanctions against 27 “high profile individuals and entities, including the Russian defense minister, top Kremlin officials and propagandists; and an import ban and restrictions on trade and investment, as well as a partial export ban on the two separatist areas.

Ukraine FM calls on UN to act or face ‘the darkest times of the 20th Century’

The United Nations General Assembly — which includes all U.N. recognized governments — is meeting Wednesday in its main hall to address the crisis created by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, fresh from his meetings Tuesday with President Joe Biden and other top U.S. officials, addressed the hall as the first country, speaking after U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. In a firm speech, Kuleba blasted Russia’s recognition of its separatist areas as “independent” and deployment of troops there as an “attack on the United Nations” itself — a “grim scenario which will throw us back to the darkest times of the 20th century.”

“I warn every nation in this distinguished chamber: No one will be able to sit out this crisis,” he said. “Your governments and your people will face painful consequences together with our government and our people,” Kuleba told the chamber.

“The beginning of a large-scale war in Ukraine will be the end of the world order as we know it. If Russia does not get a severe, swift, and decisive response now, this will mean a total bankruptcy of the international security system and international institutions which are tasked with maintaining the global security order,” he added.

He warned other actors will be “inspired” by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions and follow his lead — turning the United Nations into the League of Nations, the early 20th-century international organization that was seen as feckless in stopping the Axis Powers in the lead up to World War II — a history Kuleba directly referenced.

“We all read history books. We all watch movies about the mistakes politicians made in the run-up to 1914 and 1939, about the feats of our grandparents and the catastrophic price at which a revanchist ruler in Europe was defeated. There is no more important task today than to not repeat the mistakes of the past,” he said.

To prevent that, Kuleba called for “decisive, immediate, and proportional action” by the international community — not just condemnations and statements, but actions.

“These days, we have probably the last window of opportunity to do what Russia does not expect the United Nations and its member states to do — demonstrate unprecedented ability and readiness to act in order to stop aggression,” he said — finishing by calling on members, regardless of their relations with one another individually, to do “your ultimate duty, to defend the charter of the United Nations.”

Mikhail Fedorov, minister for digital transformation in Ukraine, announced that a “massive DDoS” attack hit around 4 p.m. local time. He said the websites of Ukraine’s cabinet, parliament and foreign ministry were down and that a number of banks were also having problems.

“It is connected with traffic switching on other provider for minimization of damage from the attack,” he said.

Russian attack may come in next 2 days: Ukraine’s military to lawmakers

Ukraine’s military has briefed key members of parliament that it now believes the situation in eastern Ukraine with Russia may sharply deteriorate in the next two days, according to four sources with knowledge of what was said during the briefing.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was present at the Wednesday night briefing, sources said, where the military said they now believe Russia may launch a major attack that would go beyond Eastern Ukraine, targeting at least two major cities. Sources said they told the members of parliament that Kyiv might also be a target — in line with U.S. officials warning that Russia is preparing a full-scale invasion that will go beyond eastern Ukraine and target Kyiv.

According to two sources, the military believes Russia may target Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city that is located around 20 miles from the border with Russia in the east, and also Kherson, a city in the south close to Crimea.

In a shift of tone Thursday, Ukraine has been taking new steps to brace for a possible attack, declaring a nationwide state of emergency and calling up 36,000 reservists. But publicly Zelenskyy’s administration has continued to say it is not certain whether Russia will attack. It has said, for now, a full-scale mobilization is not necessary, and it has not declared martial law.

Russia warned Wednesday that the latest sanctions imposed by the United States “will be met with a strong response.”

“The round of sanctions announced by the United States Administration [already the 101st in a row] affecting the financial sector with the expansion of the list of persons against whom personal restrictions are imposed is in line with Washington’s ongoing attempts to change Russia’s course,” the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. “There should be no doubt that the sanctions will be met with a strong response, not necessarily symmetrical, but well-grounded and sensitive for the American side.”

U.S. President Joe Biden announced Tuesday the latest sanctions, which he said would target two Russian banks, Russia’s sovereign debt and, starting Wednesday, the Russian elite and their relatives.

Ukrainian military begins calling up 36,000 reservists

Ukraine’s military said Wednesday it has begun calling up some reservists in response to an order from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The military general staff said they will be calling up reservists aged 18 to 60 starting Wednesday.

The secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said Wednesday that the number of reservists being called up was 36,000, most of whom he said already have combat experience.

On Tuesday, while signing a decree to call up some of Ukraine’s military reservists, Zelenskyy emphasized that it was not yet a full mobilization but just the “active reserve,” or troops with combat training.

Zelenskyy said the order was necessary because Ukraine’s military now needs to be at “heightened readiness” for any changes in the situation on the ground with Russia.

Ukraine to declare nationwide state of emergency

The secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, announced Wednesday that a nationwide state of emergency will be declared due to the threat of a Russian invasion.

The declaration must be approved by the Ukrainian parliament before the state of emergency can go into effect for an initial 30 days. The move, which differs from the introduction of martial law, would allow local authorities across the country of 41 million people to put restrictions and heightened security measures in place, such as curfews and limits on movement.

Danilov said the state of emergency would be a “preventative” measure “so that the country preserves its calm, so that our economy works and our country works.” Any restrictions imposed under the declaration would likely vary from region to region, according to Danilov.

“Depending on situation on the ground in a particular area, the local bodies can impose various measures including curfews, only if needed,” Danilov said at a press conference Wednesday. “We won’t make people suffer unnecessarily but we must insure people’s safety.”

He then gave examples of what those restrictions could be: “It can the reinforcing of security around public order and critical infrastructure facilities. It can be certain limits imposed of the movement of transport. It can mean additional vigilance. It can be the checking of various documents for people.”

Danilov noted that the state of emergency would be imposed on all of Ukraine’s territory except for the eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk because a special emergency status has been in place there since 2014, when pro-Russian separatists took control of some areas.

During Russia’s first invasion in 2014, the Ukrainian army was in disarray, prompting civilians to form volunteer battalions — many of them with right-wing ideologies. These highly motivated private armies — some funded by oligarchs — helped stem the fall of eastern Ukraine to Russia-backed separatists.

But once large-scale fighting had ended, the Ukrainian government moved the volunteer battalions back from the front line because they were seen as potentially provocative and problematic.

The so-called Right Sector is one of Ukraine’s most famous volunteer battalions. It’s made up of radical nationalists who played a crucial role in the 2014 revolution. In Russia, the group was made into a propaganda boogeyman.

The Right Sector’s return to the front line in eastern Ukraine will be used heavily by Russian propaganda. But it also shows how worried Ukrainians are getting, especially if more volunteer battalions start mobilizing.

In a Facebook post Wednesday, Right Sector said it is mobilizing its “assault brigade” due to the “high probability of the start of a full-scale invasion by the Russian army.”

“Our unit has already defended Ukrainian independence for 8 years from the occupiers,” the group said. “In the case of a full scale invasion we, as always, will be at the front of the fight.”

Russia claims 100,000 refugees have fled eastern Ukraine

The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed Wednesday that 100,000 refugees from two Russia-backed separatist areas in eastern Ukraine have arrived across the border in Russia.

The claim was unverified and highly improbable, as it appeared to be part of Russia’s intensifying efforts to spin an image of a major humanitarian crisis in the region to build a pretext for a possible invasion.

Russia-backed separatists have forced civilians living in the areas to evacuate despite the fact that there is no increased threat from the Ukrainian military. While thousands of people have been bused out of the region to Russia, the alleged figure of 100,000 appeared vastly exaggerated.

Russia’s claims have been accompanied by a barrage of false stories and staged videos of alleged attacks by Ukrainian forces, all of which have been blaring across Russian state media in recent days.

Russia-backed separatists make ‘terror attacks’ claim as Russia continues to build pretext

Russian-controlled separatists are claiming two large “terrorist attacks” took place in their territory Tuesday night, as the separatists and Russia continue to intensify their efforts to create a pretext for a possible Russian attack.

The separatists claimed explosions went off at a TV tower and near a trolley bus depot, and they released video afterward they claim shows emergency workers looking at damage.

The claims are highly suspect, and they came amid a barrage of fake reports of supposed Ukrainian attacks that are being swiftly debunked.

The claims also came as Ukraine released video showing heavy artillery fire from separatists hitting a village called Chastiya — which means “happiness” — on the Ukrainian side of the frontline. The video appears to show rockets striking a house.

Artillery fire also hit a power station nearby yesterday.

It appears the Russian-controlled separatists have intensified their fire onto Ukrainian positions in the hope of stoking return fire and creating an impression of a general escalation.

Read in-depth coverage from DW

Germany's Russian foreign policy famously focused on diplomacy instead of confrontation, given its own history with the Soviet Union during World War II. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine changes ties between the countries. What's next for Berlin?

Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to send troops across the border of a sovereign nation threatens European security, especially security of smaller eastern European states that aren't members of the EU or NATO. Here's how Russian invasion stands to shake up the geopolitical order as we know it.

Meanwhile, anti-war protests took place in numerous countries on Thursday, from Tokyo to Berlin to Madrid and even Moscow, until police intervened.

""We’ve been transparent with the world, we’ve shared intelligence…so there could be no confusion about what Putin is doing. Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war.""

Boris Johnson announces a new set of sanctions on Russia

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the ""largest-ever"" set of economic sanctions against Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking to parliament, Johnson said the UK was sanctioning more than 100 individuals and entities and freezing assets of all major Russian banks, including VTB Bank.

""Furthermore, we are also banning [Russian commercial airline] Aeroflot from the UK,"" Johnson said.

The prime minister said some of the main restrictions would target Russian access to British banks, urging the EU to do the same with its SWIFT transaction system.

""These powers will enable us totally to exclude Russian banks from the UK financial system, which is of course by far the largest in Europe, stopping them from accessing sterling and clearing payments through the UK,"" Johnson told parliament.

In answer to questions from British lawmakers, Johnson said the West has learned ""a bitter lesson"" about how to deal with Putin.

""The whole of the West failed to respond in the way we should,"" he said.

Putin would be condemned by the world and by history for his invasion, never able to cleanse the ""blood of Ukraine"" from his hands, Johnson said.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz appeared at the top of the hour in the 6 p.m. evening news in Germany, giving a short address in response to developments in Ukraine.

Scholz repeated his earlier comments in parliament when he had referred to the conflict as ""Putin's war.""

""He and not the Russian people decided on this war. He alone bears responsibility for it. This war is Putin's war,"" Scholz said.

Scholz said it was important to ensure that ""conflict does not spread to other countries in Europe."" He warned the Russian leader not to underestimate NATO's determination to protect its members, which do not include Ukraine.

G7 plans severe, coordinated response

Russian President Vladimir Putin has “re-introduced war to the European continent,"" the leaders of the G7 said in a joint statement following a virtual meeting on Thursday.

The Group of Seven industrialized nations plans to bring forward severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions against Moscow.

The G7 leaders also said they were ""closely monitoring"" volatile oil and gas markets, and ""stand ready to act as needed to address potential disruptions.""

Markets take a hit, oil prices skyrocket

Opposition lawmaker says Germany should reconsider arms stance

The West failed to take President Vladimir Putin's threat against Ukraine ""seriously enough,"" Thomas Silberhorn, a German opposition lawmaker from the conservative CDU/CSU alliance told DW.

He said Germany should now consider sending defensive weapons to aid Ukraine.

""It's always legitimate to support a country which is under attack. This is the minimum we should deliver as Western, liberal democracies,"" Silberhorn said. Until now, Germany had opted not to send weaponry to Ukraine, on the basis that it almost never approves arms exports to active conflict zones in the era since World War II.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine should provide impetus for Germany and Europe to reconsider its foreign policy, Silberhorn added.

""Our Western foreign policy and, in particular, our German foreign policy has been focused on dialogue, which is not wrong, but which is not sufficient. We need dialogue and deterrence and we need to do much, much more in Germany and in Europe to establish reliable and effective deterrents.""

Ex-German chancellor Schröder: Russia's interests don't justify 'military means'

Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who sits on the board of Russia's state-run energy company Gazprom, seemed to criticize the Kremlin's decision to launch a war in Ukraine.

""There were many mistakes — on both sides"" Schröder wrote in a social media post, commenting on the relationship between Russia and the West. ""But even Russia's security interests do not justify the use of military means.""

At the same time, Schröder called on the West not to sever ""the remaining political, economic and civil society links"" with Russia.

""Despite the current dramatic situation, these are the basis for a hope that we all have: that a dialogue on peace and security on our continent is possible again,"" he said.

Schröder led the German government from 1998 to 2005, when he was replaced by the recently retired Angela Merkel. Many German politicians, including members of his own left-leaning SPD, decry Schröder's close ties with the Kremlin.

According to Moscow, the leaders of the two Russian-held separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk have asked Putin for help to fend off Ukrainian ""aggression.""

Recounting the intelligence his administration has been declassifying and sharing with US allies over the past few weeks, as Russia geared up for war, Biden says, “We’ve been transparent with the world… so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.”

He accuses the Russian leader of planning the invasion for a long time and of lying to create pretexts for his actions in Ukraine.

“Putin is the aggressor, Putin chose this war,” Biden says, predicting that the Russian leader “will be a pariah on the international stage.”

“He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to reestablish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is all about,” he charges.

The US president, whose address comes after a meeting earlier today with leaders of the G7 group of nations, warns that powerful sanctions will exact a “severe cost” from Russia’s economy, “both immediately and over time.”

“We’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well over half of the global economy,” he says. “We’re in full and total agreement. We will limit… Russia’s ability to participate in the global economy.”

He says the steps imposed in coordination with Europe will block top Russian banks from the US financial system and “cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.”

The penalties fall in line with the White House’s insistence that it will look to hit Russia’s financial system and Putin’s inner circle, while also imposing export controls that aim to starve Russia’s industries and military of US semiconductors and other high-tech products.

But Biden, for now, holds off on imposing some of the most severe sanctions, including cutting Russia out of the SWIFT payment system, which allows for the transfers of money from bank to bank around the globe, or Russia’s energy sector.

On the military front, he vows to defend “every inch” of NATO territory, but reaffirms that no American troops will be deployed to Washington’s ally.

“As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with a full force of American power,” Biden says.

The president adds, however: “Our forces will not be engaged in a conflict with Russia in Ukraine.”

UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says Russia’s attack on Ukraine — as he appealed for President Vladimir Putin to stop his troops — was “the saddest moment” of his five-year tenure.

The U.N. chief opened the emergency Security Council meeting late Wednesday by urgently appealing to Putin: “In the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia.”

But during the meeting, Putin announced that he was launching a “special military operation” in eastern Ukraine.

Guterres later urged the Russian president to withdraw his troops and added: “In the name of humanity do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century, with consequences not only devastating for Ukraine, not only tragic for the Russian Federation, but with an impact we cannot even foresee in relation to the consequences for the global economy.”

A war would cause deaths and displacement and people will lose hope in the future, Guterres said, adding Russia’s actions would harm the global economy.

“What is clear for me is that this war doesn’t make any sense,” Guterres said, stressing that it violates the U.N. Charter and will cause a level of suffering if it doesn’t stop that Europe hasn’t know since at least the 1990s Balkans crisis.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s president is rejecting Moscow’s claim that his country poses a threat to Russia and warns that a looming Russian invasion could cause tens of thousands of deaths.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the comments in a video address early Thursday.

Speaking emotionally in Russia, he said: “The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace. But if we come under attack that threaten our freedom and lives of our people we will fight back.”

Zelenskyy says he tried to call Russian President Vladimir Putin late Wednesday but the Kremlin remained silent.

WASHINGTON — The White House says the request by Ukrainian separatists for Russian military assistance in the face of supposed “aggression” by Ukraine’s government is an example of the “false flag” operations the West has consistently warned against.

The U.S. and allies have alleged for weeks that Russia would try to create a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine through the use of such operations.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki says the Kremlin’s announcement Wednesday that the separatists are seeking help “is an example” of such an operation.

Psaki adds that “we’ll continue to call out what we see as false flag operations or efforts to spread misinformation about what the actual status is on the ground.”

MOSCOW — The Kremlin says the rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine have asked Russia for military assistance to fend off the Ukrainian “aggression.”

The appeal raises the prospect of Russia’s direct military involvement in eastern Ukraine amid Western fears that Moscow is poised to launch an all-out invasion of its neighbor.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the rebel chiefs wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin to tell him that shelling by the Ukrainian military has caused civilian deaths and forced many people to flee.

The move comes after Putin recognized the independence of Russia-backed rebel regions in eastern Ukraine and signed friendship treaties with them. On Tuesday, Russian lawmakers gave Putin permission to use military forces outside the country.

KYIV, Ukraine — Lawmakers in Ukraine have approved a nationwide state of emergency amid fears of an all-out Russian invasion.

The parliament approved Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s decree that imposes the measure for 30 days starting Thursday. The state of emergency allows authorities to impose restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organizations “in the interests of national security and public order.”

The move follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s move Monday to recognize the independence of two rebel regions in eastern Ukraine, where a nearly eight-year conflict with the pro-Russia rebels has left over 14,000 dead. Putin has sanctioned the deployment of Russian troops there to “maintain peace” and received a parliamentary approval to use military force outside the country.

Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly voiced concerns that Russia could try destabilize Ukraine by relying on Moscow supporters inside the country, including a pro-Russia political party in parliament.

WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that Russian aggression toward Ukraine is “an attack on democracy,” vowing that the U.S. will stand united with its allies around the world in swiftly imposing sanctions on Russia and ensuring financial and political support for an independent Ukraine.

Pelosi, who returned to the Capitol from a diplomatic overseas trip, compared the aggression to Russia’s intervention in the United States’ own democratic process during the 2016 election.

“There will be a price to pay for Vladimir Putin,” she said, flanked by lawmakers who had joined her delegation at the annual security conference in Munich.

Pelosi said the Russian president is one of the richest men in the world and warned that the sanctions being imposed by the U.S. and its allies are only the start of what is possible to inflict financial pain on his regime. “We’re doing this together,” she said.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is allowing sanctions to move forward against the company that built the Russia-to-Germany Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and against the company’s CEO for its actions against Ukraine.

Biden said Wednesday “I have directed my administration to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers. These steps are another piece of our initial tranche of sanctions in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine. As I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate.”

Germany said Tuesday that it was indefinitely suspending the project, after Biden charged that Russia President Vladimir Putin had launched “the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine” by sending troops into two separatist regions of eastern Ukraine.

The pipeline is completed but had not yet begun operating. Critics, including the U.S., have said the pipeline is a geopolitical move that will only increase Europe’s dependency on Russian natural gas.

WASHINGTON — There’s little support among Americans for a major U.S. role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to a new poll, even as President Joe Biden imposes new sanctions and threatens a stronger response that could provoke retaliation from Moscow.

Biden has acknowledged a growing likelihood that war in Eastern Europe would affect Americans, though he has ruled out sending troops to Ukraine. Gas prices in the U.S. could rise in the short term. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has a range of tools he could use against the U.S., including cyberattacks hitting critical infrastructure and industries.

“Defending freedom will have costs for us as well, here at home,” Biden said. “We need to be honest about that.”

Just 26% of Americans polled say the U.S. should have a major role in the conflict, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Fifty-two percent say a minor role; 20% say none at all.

The findings are a reminder for Biden and fellow Democrats that while the Ukraine crisis may consume Washington in the coming months, pocketbook issues are likely to be a bigger priority for voters heading into the midterm elections.

WASHINGTON — A senior U.S. defense official in Washington says the Russian forces arrayed along Ukraine’s borders are “as ready as they can be” for an invasion, if ordered to launch it.

U.S. authorities have estimated that Russia has more than 150,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders with Russia and Belarus.

About 80% of those forces are now in “what we would consider forward positions, ready to go,” the official said, adding that they are within 5 to 50 kilometers (3 to 31 miles) of the border. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information.

The official said the U.S. has indications — based on intelligence as well as visual evidence — that “they (Russian forces) have advanced their readiness to a point where they are literally ready to go now, if they get the order to go.”

UNITED NATIONS — China’s United Nations ambassador is urging a diplomatic and peaceful solution to the Ukraine crisis, stressing Beijing’s “consistent” position “on safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states” and upholding the U.N. Charter.

In brief remarks to the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday, Ambassador Zhang Jun, whose country is usually allied with Russia at the United Nations, did not mention Russia by name or in any way endorse President Vladimir Putin’s declaration of independence for Ukraine’s separatist areas or Putin’s decision to send Russian forces there as what he called “peacekeepers.”

The Chinese ambassador noted that the current situation in Ukraine “is rooted in a complex web of historical and present day factors” and said “all parties concerned should exercise restraint and avoid taking any action that may aggravate tensions.”

“China calls on all parties to recognize the importance of implementing the principle of indivisible security, to continue to engage in dialogue and consultation and to seek reasonable solutions that address each other’s concerns. through peaceful means on the basis of equality and mutual respect,” Zhang said.

BUDAPEST — Hungary’s prime minister said Wednesday that his country would seek to “stay out” of the worsening conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

In a video on his Facebook page, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said “we must do everything we can to avoid war.”

He added that “Hungary must stay out of this conflict … Because Hungary’s security is the most important interest.”

Orban reiterated an earlier announcement from Hungary’s defense minister that Hungarian soldiers would be deployed to the country’s border with Ukraine to prepare for the possible arrival of Ukrainian refugees. Orban is a fierce opponent of migration.

Orban went to visit Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this month and lobbied for larger shipments of Russia gas.

Earlier Wednesday, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary supports Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and would back European Union sanctions against Russia.

___

GENEVA — The Swiss government is condemning Russia’s recognition of two regions of eastern Ukraine as independent states and is vowing to make sure that Switzerland isn’t used to evade European Union and other international sanctions.

The executive Federal Council, a seven-member body, said Wednesday it decided not to adopt the EU sanctions — as it often does — but criticized the “violation of international law and Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.” Switzerland is not among the members of the 27-country EU, but is all but surrounded by four of them: Austria, France, Germany and Italy.

The Swiss government does not recognize the independence of the two territories, Donetsk and Luhansk.

Switzerland is a major international banking center, and its generally stable hard currency — the Swiss franc — and high-tech financial institutions have lured many international investors and elites, including those from Russia.

___

UNITED NATIONS — Russia’s U.N. ambassador is urging the world’s nations to rein in what he called Ukraine’s ongoing violence and “blatant genocide” in eastern separatist regions of the country that Moscow has declared independent.

The eastern Donbas region of Ukraine is a flashpoint in the tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as the United States warns Moscow is seeking a pretext to invade its neighbor. Ukraine has denied any aggression against pro-Russian forces in the eastern area, including Luhansk and Donetsk, which borders Russia.

Russian President Vladmir Putin has declared those republics independent and plans to send Russia troops there as what he called “peacekeepers.”

Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s U.N. ambassador, warned the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday that “no one intends to go softly, softly with any violators” of the peace in those eastern areas of Ukraine.

He said the departure of tens of thousands of people from Luhansk and Donetsk to Russia — including 96,000 people on Wednesday — shows Ukraine’s disparaging treatment of people there, including dubbing them “terrorists.”

___

UNITED NATIONS — U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield is telling countries around the world that “now is the time to get off the sidelines” and speak out against Russia’s actions toward Ukraine.

“There is no middle ground here. Calling for both sides to de-escalate only gives Russia a pass. Russia is the aggressor here,” Thomas-Greenfield said at a U.N. General Assembly meeting Wednesday.

She called on Russia “to come back to the negotiating table and to work toward peace.”

___

BERLIN — The head of the German parliament’s foreign policy committee says the government is considering providing further protective equipment to Ukraine.

Michael Roth said after a special meeting of the committee Wednesday with Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock that there are talks with the Ukrainian government on delivering night-vision devices, for example, German news agency dpa reported.

He said it’s also possible that protective equipment no longer needed after the German military withdrew from Afghanistan last year could be provided.

Germany has refused to deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine, a stance that has irked some allies, but has said it would deliver 5,000 helmets.

___

BOSTON — Ukrainian government and banking websites have been knocked offline with another wave of distributed-denial-of-service attacks.

The targets Wednesday included the defense, foreign and interior ministries, as well as Privatbank, the country’s largest commercial bank.

Many of the same sites were similarly hit in Feb.13-14 attacks that the U.S. and U.K. governments quickly blamed on Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency. Such attacks barrage websites with junk traffic, rendering them unreachable.

Wednesday’s DDoS attacks appeared to be less impactful than the previous onslaught, with targeted sites soon reachable again as emergency responders blunted them.

Cyberattacks have been a key tool of Russian aggression in Ukraine since 2014, when the Kremlin annexed Crimea and hackers tried to thwart elections.

___

BRUSSELS — European Union sanctions against Russia have taken effect.

They are the first steps in a planned series of retaliatory measures devised to be cranked up if Russian President Vladimir Putin orders an attack or pushes his troops deeper into Ukraine.

The sanctions that took effect Wednesday targeted senior Russian government officials, several companies and hundreds of lawmakers who voted in favor of recognizing the independence of separatist parts of southeast Ukraine.

The sanctions are mostly a freeze on the assets of those listed and a ban on them traveling in the 27-nation EU.

The measures come on top of a slew of economic and other sanctions slapped on Russia since it annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

Those sanctions already targeted Russia’s financial, energy and defense sectors, as well as goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes.

___

UNITED NATIONS — Ukraine’s foreign minister wants the world to stand together against Russia, arguing that Moscow’s aggression toward his country will have wider repercussions for the international order.

Dmytro Kuleba told the U.N. General Assembly that the deployment of Russian troops in rebel-held parts of eastern Ukraine and Moscow’s recognition of the rebel regions as independent amounts to an “attack on the United Nations.”

He said: “If Russia does not get a severe swift and decisive response now, this will mean a total bankruptcy of the international security system and international institutions.”

Kuleba urged countries to use tough economic sanctions, strong messages and “active diplomacy” to get Russia to back off from Ukraine.

“We are at a critical juncture of world history, and our actions today define it for years to come,” he said, drawing parallels with the leadups to the last century’s two world wars.

___

BRUSSELS — European leaders plan an in-person emergency summit on Thursday evening in Brussels to discuss the tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

European Union Council president Charles Michel said in his invitation letter to the 27 leaders that the “use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the 21st century.”

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had already planned to hold a 90-minute virtual meeting of Group of Seven leaders on Thursday afternoon. That meeting was announced last week.

Michel praised the heads of states and government for the unity shown by the bloc in recent days to ensure the adoption of sanctions against Russia and deter its suspected plans to invade Ukraine.

MOSCOW — Russia has started evacuating its embassy in Kyiv, as fears mount that Russian President Vladimir Putin might be about to order an invasion of Ukraine.

Russian state news agency Tass reported that Russia began pulling personnel from its diplomatic posts in Ukraine on Wednesday.

The move came a day after the Russian Foreign Ministry announced a plan to evacuate, citing threats against Russians in Ukraine.

At the same time, Ukraine urged its citizens to leave Russia as the region braced for a military confrontation, with some 150,000 Russian troops deployed around Ukraine’s borders.

Putin on Tuesday received authorization to use military force outside his country and the West responded with sanctions.

___

BRUSSELS — The deputy chairman of Russia’s State Duma claims Russians are unimpressed by the sanctions slapped on their country by the European Union.

Pyotr Tolstoy, who is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Wednesday that Moscow is planning a response to the sanctions. He did not give details.

Tolstoy told Belgian broadcaster RTBF the EU sanctions were “worthless.”

The EU on Tuesday announced sanctions against the 351 Duma legislators who voted in favor of formally recognizing pro-Russian separatist regions in Ukraine, among others.

___

MOSCOW — Ukraine’s top diplomat wants to see tougher sanctions slapped on Russia over its aggressive posture toward his country.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Wednesday on Twitter: “To stop Putin from further aggression, we call on partners to impose more sanctions on Russia now.”

He expressed thanks for international sanctions imposed on Moscow the previous day. But he asked countries to crank up the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Kuleba wrote: “Hit his economy and cronies. Hit more. Hit hard. Hit now.”

11:15 a.m.: Russian troops, tanks enter eastern Ukraine, Latvian PM says

“Additional” Russian troops and tanks have crossed into separatist areas of Ukraine’s Donbas region, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized them as “independent,” Latvian Prime Minister Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš told CNN.

“According to the information at my disposal, Putin is moving additional forces and tanks into the occupied Donbas territories,” Kariņš told CNN.

Sources confirmed to CNN that additional Russian troops have entered Ukraine since Putin said Tuesday that he was sending “peacekeepers” into the separatists’ so-called “republics” in Luhansk and Donetsk.

A senior U.S. official told CNN that Russia has deployed two battalion tactical groups, which are each made up of about 800 troops, to the region, though CNN cautioned it wasn’t able to independently confirm that.

11:00 a.m.: Ukraine banks, government sites under cyberattack

Ukraine’s minister for digital transformation says cyberattacks are disrupting government websites and those of some banks in his country.

10:30 a.m.: Russia evacuates its embassy in Kyiv

Russia has started evacuating its embassy in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, as fears mount that Russian President Vladimir Putin might be about to order an invasion of Ukraine.

Russian state news agency Tass reported that Russia began pulling personnel from its diplomatic posts in Ukraine on Wednesday.

By Wednesday afternoon, the Russian flag was no longer flying over the embassy in Kyiv, and police surrounded the building.

The move came a day after the Russian Foreign Ministry announced a plan to evacuate, citing threats against Russians in Ukraine.

After weeks of trying to project calm, Ukrainian authorities also signaled increasing concern. The Foreign Ministry advised against travel to Russia and recommended anyone there leave immediately, saying Moscow’s “aggression” could lead to a significant reduction in consular services.

7 a.m.: Ukraine to declare state of emergency, Russia warns U.S. of 'consequences' of sanctions

As a possible large-scale Russian invasion looms, Ukraine plans to introduce a 30-day state of emergency and has begun the process of mobilizing its reservists, according to Axios.

The head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, said it will be up to regional authorities to determine which measures to apply, but they could include additional protection for public facilities, restrictions on traffic, and additional transport and document checks.

After weeks of trying to project calm, Ukrainian authorities signaled increasing concern on Wednesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been hesitant to mobilize troops and enact emergency measures over fears it would spark panic, but he said he had to, given Russia’s threats.

Ukraine does not plan to evacuate cities or villages in the east, and it has encouraged civilians to carry on with normal life. The government has pledged to use diplomatic tools to stop Russia, but if that doesn’t work, it is ready to fight and defend every inch of its land.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry advised against travel to Russia and recommended anyone there leave “immediately,” saying Moscow's “aggression” could lead to a significant reduction in consular services.

Tensions rose dramatically after Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, got the OK to use military force outside his country. The West responded with a raft of sanctions.

During a televised address on Russia’s veterans’ day, Putin praised the armed forces, saying, “Weapons that have no equal in the world are now on combat duty.”

After the U.S. and its allies moved to impose the harshest sanctions yet on Moscow, the Kremlin warned Americans will feel the financial “consequences” of the sanctions, according to the Washington Post.

Hopes for a diplomatic way out of a new, potentially devastating war appeared all but sunk as the U.S. and key European allies accused Moscow on Tuesday of crossing a red line in rolling over Ukraine's border into separatist regions — with several, including the U.S., calling it an “invasion.”

6:00 a.m.: China blasts US over approach to Ukraine crisis

China is accusing the United States of creating “fear and panic” over the crisis in Ukraine.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Wednesday that China opposes new sanctions on Russia, reiterating a longstanding Chinese position.

She said the U.S. was fueling tensions by providing weapons to Kyiv in response to Russia’s large troop deployment around Ukraine’s borders and fears of an invasion.

China-Russia ties have grown closer under Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin at talks in Beijing earlier this month.

The two sides issued a joint statement backing Moscow’s opposition to a NATO expansion in former Soviet republics and buttressing China’s claim to the self-governing island of Taiwan — key foreign policy issues for Beijing and Moscow.

5:30 a.m.: Pope says ‘the peace of everyone is threatened’

Pope Francis is urging all sides in the Russia-Ukraine dispute to examine their consciences before God and pull back from threats of war.

In an appeal at the end of his weekly general audience Wednesday, Francis said he was pained and alarmed by developments in Ukraine, which he said “discredit international law.”

He didn’t single out Russia’s massing of troops at Ukraine’s borders or its recognition of two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine. But he noted: “Once again, the peace of everyone is threatened by vested interests.”

5:00 a.m. U.N. chief says world faces ‘biggest global peace and security crisis in recent years’

The United Nations chief says the world is facing “the biggest global peace and security crisis in recent years” and is calling Russia’s declaration of the “so-called `independence’” of separatist areas in eastern Ukraine a violation of its territorial integrity, and accusing Moscow of “the perversion of the concept of peacekeeping.”

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Tuesday he is proud of the achievements of the U.N.’s far-flung peacekeepers, but when troops of one country enter the territory of another country without its consent, as Russian forces have done, “they are not impartial peacekeepers -- they are not peacekeepers at all” as Moscow has called them.

Guterres said Russia’s unilateral actions “conflict” with the U.N. Charter and are “a death blow to the Minsk Agreements” aimed at restoring peace to eastern Ukraine.
