Bank sanctions are a sharper sword than cutting Russia off SWIFT, German minister says

The package of banking sanctions that the European Union is imposing will hit Putin’s government harder than excluding Russia from the SWIFT payments system, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has said.

Excluding Russia from SWIFT would make it impossible to support civil rights groups in Russia from abroad, or for Russian students abroad to send money to help their grandmothers, she told ARD public television.

“The sword that looks hardest isn’t always the cleverest one,” she said. “It’s not just oligarchs who do financial transactions … The sharper sword at the moment is listing banks. Government bonds can’t be sold abroad any more.”

US defence official says Russian forces have lost momentum amid stiff resistance

Russia’s drive to seize control of Ukraine has lost momentum amid stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces, both on the ground and in the air, a senior US defence official says.

“Their momentum, particularly as it comes to Kyiv, has slowed over the last 24 hours,” the official told reporters at a Pentagon briefing on condition of anonymity.

Russian forces have yet to seize any of Ukraine’s major cities, or achieve air superiority over the country, the official said.

“They have not achieved the progress that we believe they anticipated they would … [and] are meeting more resistance than they expected” the official added. “A good indicator of that is no population centers have been taken. None.”

Russia puts ‘partial restriction’ on Facebook access

Russian authorities have announced access to Facebook will be partially restricted after the social media network banned the accounts of several Kremlin-backed news outlets over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Russian state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it had demanded that Facebook lift the bans it had on Thursday placed on state news agency RIA Novosti, state TV channel Zvezda, and pro-Kremlin news sites Lenta.Ru and Gazeta.Ru. The agency said Facebook didn’t reinstate the media outlets.

Roskomnadzor cast its action as a move “to protect Russian media.” It said Russia’s Foreign Ministry and the Prosecutor General’s office found Facebook “complicit in violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as the rights and freedoms of Russian nationals”.

It did not clarify what exactly the move means.

Russia claims Kyiv has gone silent on talks

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said there is a “pause” in contact between Moscow and Kyiv over possible in-person talks between the two sides following a discussion over where any such meeting should take place.

Peskov said Moscow had offered to hold the talks in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, but Kyiv had instead proposed Warsaw as a venue.

He said the Ukrainians had then taken what he described as quite a long time-out. During that pause, he claimed Ukrainian “nationalists” had deployed missile systems in residential areas within the country’s big cities, mirroring claims made by Putin.

Peskov did not provide evidence to support his assertion but said it was a very dangerous development. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities.

Ukrainians build makeshift roadblocks to stall Russian advance

Some Ukrainians are building makeshift roadblocks in a bid to stall Russian troops.

Vladimir, a former coalmine owner who fled Ukraine’s eastern region of Luhansk for Kyiv in 2014, when Russian-backed separatists took control of swaths of territory there, is among them.

The 47-year-old’s fortification, which features several concrete slabs and about a dozen sandbags, stands in the town of Rzhyshchiv, on the outskirts of Kyiv.

It is manned by six men, including Vladimir, who declined to give his surname. Two of those guarding the site are armed with hunting rifles.

“We won’t stop tanks with it, but we can stop other vehicles,” he told Al Jazeera, adding he had paid for the supplies from his own pocket.

Dozens of similar roadblocks have reportedly sprung up around the capital and elsewhere in Ukraine.

‘The problem for the Kremlin is Zelenskyy’

Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith, reporting from Moscow, says Russia’s suggestions it is ready for talks with Ukraine in Minsk were made after Moscow called for Kyiv to “lay down its arms” and warned it could never recognise Zelenskyy’s government as democratic.

“It is worth reminding people that the current Ukrainian president was elected in 2019 with a landslide 73 percent share of the vote, so he was democratically elected,” Smith said.

“But clearly, the problem for the Kremlin is Zelenskyy, and whether they will be able to have talks while he remains in power is unclear,” he added.

Zelenskyy had appealed for talks with Putin prior to the Kremlin’s suggestions of a summit in the Belarusian capital, which has hosted previous rounds of discussions between officials from Ukraine and Russia.

“I would like to address the President of the Russian Federation once again. There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let’s sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people’s deaths,” Zelenskyy said in a video message to the nation.

Kyiv’s residents take shelter in metro stations

Thousands of people have taken shelter in metro stations throughout the Ukrainian capital amid Russia’s assault.

“They always do the ugliest things at dawn, so I am spending the night here,” Tetyana Udovichenko, 61, told Al Jazeera overnight from inside the Druzhby Narodiv station.

Udovichenko, an accountant, said she had taken his 82-year-old mother Olha Krisevich underground with him. The pair were joined by dozens of other people, who arrived shortly after 7pm local time (17:00 GMT) on Thursday carrying blankets, suitcases and even, in some instances, pets.

Many looked distressed, but some opted for dark humour instead and aimed scornful jokes at Putin for ordering an invasion of their country.

Hungary opens humanitarian corridor for third-country citizens fleeing Ukraine

Hungary will open a humanitarian corridor for citizens from third-party countries like Iran or India fleeing Ukraine, letting them in without visas and taking them to the nearest international airport, in Debrecen, the Hungarian foreign minister says.

Peter Szijjarto also said in a video posted on his Facebook page that crossing from Ukraine was continuous at five crossing points but cars were queuing for up to three-five kilometres on the Ukrainian side.

His remarks came after Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, said he had requested Hungary’s assistance to evacuate Iranian citizens from Ukraine during a phone call with Szijjarto.

Iran’s foreign ministry had previously said it was seeking a permit to send a flight to Kyiv to repatriate its citizens, but it appears Russia’s offensive has eliminated that possibility.

“What we are going to find is that when these Russian forces reach the capital there is likely to be fierce resistance. The overall mood is one of horrendous fear of what’s going to happen next.”

Vladimir Putin keeps moving his pieces in a very dangerous chess game that is putting Ukrainian lives in in mortal danger. During a what appears to be a previously recorded speech on Russian state television, the president of Russia announced that his country is set to undertake a special military operation to demilitarise the area. He also claimed that the Ukrainian government has been supporting nazis and he has a clear objective of eliminating all nazi sympathizers. Although Putin did say that Russia doesn't plan to occupy the country of Ukraine, he did call on all soldiers to lay down their weapons and head home if they don't want to suffer the consequences. Putin also sent a stern warning to all outside countries to not interfere in his decision or this could escalate to an even greater conflict.

Presiden Joe Biden's response to Russia's attack on Ukraine.

In a quick response to this attack on Ukraine, here is President Joe Biden's full statement directly from the White House press core: ""The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.""

""I will be monitoring the situation from the White House this evening and will continue to get regular updates from my national security team. Tomorrow, I will meet with my G7 counterparts in the morning and then speak to the American people to announce the further consequences the United States and our Allies and partners will impose on Russia for this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security. We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance. Tonight, Jill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of Ukraine.""

What does Russia want from Ukraine?

Putin has said that the expansion of NATO is ""menacing"", so the fact that Ukraine could join the European Union and join NATO is a concern for the Russian president. In December of 2021, Russia demanded a guarantee that Ukraine would never join NATO and that NATO would order forces in other Eastern European countries to back down, but this hasn't happened. Furthermore, the USA has sold hundreds of anti-tank Javelin missiles to Ukraine in recent years and Turkey has supplied the Ukrainian army with armed drones. (Read more)

What sanctions can the US impose on Russia?

The United States and its allies are coordinating new sanctions on Russia after Moscow's movement recognizing two Ukrainian regions as independent.

European members, including Germany, began considering sanctions in response to Putin's actions:

When did Ukraine separate from Russia?

Crimea was originally part of Russia from 1783 until 1954 when the Soviet government transferred the region to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

However no further information of the transfer was made available for the remainder of the Soviet Union, becoming available to the public in 1992 when the Union dissolved.

Since that time Crimea has become a disputed region in its own sense, peaking in interest between Ukraine and Russia in 2014 when Crimea declared itself independent before being annexed by Russia. (Read more)",https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2022/02/24/6216fca2ca4741a0458b4599.html

Meanwhile, at Moderna, shareholders will vote on whether the company should study the feasibility of sharing vaccine technology to help increase global production. This has been a hot issue in recent months as many of the world's mRNA shots have gone to developed countries, while low- and middle-income countries were forced to wait for donations.

At J&J's upcoming annual meeting, shareholders will have a chance to vote on an Oxfam proposal to force the company to release its COVID-19 vaccine pricing strategy. Oxfam previously asked J&J to share the information considering the drugmaker received substantial funding assistance from the U.S. government while it was developing the shot. During the company's shareholder meeting last year, 32% of J&J's shareholders voted for a similar resolution, Oxfam notes.

“The losses we are seeing continue to be elevated over 2019 levels due at least in part, we believe, to the pandemic and the existence of either delayed or unavailable healthcare,” Globe Life finance chief Frank Svoboda told analysts and investors earlier this month.

In earnings calls for the past two quarters, Globe Life Inc., Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Primerica Inc. and Reinsurance Group of America Inc. were among insurers noting higher non-Covid-19 deaths, compared with pre-pandemic baselines.

Some insurers see continued high levels of these deaths for some time, even if Covid-19 deaths decline this year.

Industry executives and actuaries believe many of these other fatalities are tied to delays in medical care as a result of lockdowns in 2020, and then, later, people’s fears of seeking out treatment and trouble lining up appointments.

U.S. life insurers, as expected, made a large number of Covid-19 death-benefit payouts last year. More surprisingly, many saw a jump in other death claims, too.

I doubt Putin was a WEF Young Leader, I think Schwab misremembered. But I also think that Schwab wrongly remembering Putin being a young WEF hope is notable.

Also, WEF didn’t start the Young Global Leaders program (as “Global Leaders for Tomorrow”) until 1993 when Putin was already 41.

Apparently WEF “Young Global Leaders” must be 38 or under when they are admitted. At 38 Putin would have still been in the KGB in the dying days of the USSR in 1990.

Ghislaine Maxwell's husband selling mansion for nearly $7.3M Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 16:09 Ghislaine Maxwell's estranged husband has put the historic Massachusetts mansion he shared with the now-convicted madam on the market for nearly $7.3 million. Scott Borgerson '-- who reportedly dumped the British socialite while she was in jail '-- told the Wall Street Journal that he was selling the Manchester-by-the-Sea mansion he had shared with his ex. ''She was here years ago, but actually left when this thing started to rear its ugly head '-- her situation from conduct decades ago,'' Borgeson told the paper of Maxwell sex trafficking underage girls for her earlier ex, pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The waterfront property, known as the Phippen-Smith house, is owned by Borgerson's limited liability company Tidewood LLC. He told the WSJ that although Maxwell, 60, had lived there, she has no ownership stake, which was confirmed by Brian Basham, a friend of the Maxwell family who has served as their spokesman. Borgerson refused to discuss with the WSJ whether he and Maxwell had legally married. Arctic Circle AssemblyBorgeson told the paper that he believes his house was built around 1660 in Salem, Mass., before it was moved by barge in 1917 to its current location in an enclave known as the Sharksmouth Estate. His company paid $2.45 million for it in 2016, records show. He also spent another $2.5 million restoring it, he told the paper. The house now has five bedrooms spread across roughly 6,100 square feet, with modern amenities including Tesla charging stations. The property first came into focus in the summer of 2019 when it first emerged that Maxwell was hiding out there amid the intensifying focus of her earlier involvement of Epstein's sex trafficking. Borgerson reportedly dumped the British socialite while she was in jail. Josh Reynolds for The New York PostShe managed to avoid the spotlight, however, secretly moving to a rented mansion in New Hampshire where she was tracked down and arrested in a major operation in July 2020. It was only after her arrest that it emerged she was married '-- with even Maxwell's supportive siblings later admitting they had no idea. However, Borgerson refused to discuss with the WSJ whether he and Maxwell had legally married. Maxwell was found guilty of sex-trafficking underage girls for pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. (C) SDNY via ZUMA Press WireThe Post first revealed in December, in the middle of Maxwell's trial, that Borgeson had been spotted having affectionate outings in Manchester-by-the-Sea with Kris McGinn, a yoga enthusiast with ''an ass that could crack open a walnut,'' according to one admiring local. Later reports said that he had dumped Maxwell in a ''confrontational'' phone call while she was in solitary confinement. The real estate agents with the listing, Tracy Campion and Ryan Clunan, told the WSJ that they did not expect the shady history to affect interest in the sale. ''We believe the beauty of the house and the location will surpass or outweigh the connection,'' Mr. Clunan said, noting that a house on the same street sold for $20 million in 2020. Maxwell, who often socialized with disgraced UK royal Prince Andrew, was convicted at the end of last year of recruiting and grooming underage girls for years as Epstein's madam. She faces up to 65 years in prison. However, she formally called for a retrial last month after it was revealed that a juror failed to disclose their childhood sexual abuse during jury selection. Epstein, 66, killed himself in his Manhattan lockup in August 2019 while awaiting trial on further serious sex charges.

The U.S. Import Surge Is Skipping the Train - WSJ Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 15:39 Shippers are increasingly choosing trucks over railroads because of supply-chain bottlenecks and a need for speed, pushing more freight onto the country's highways Tens of thousands of container loads of cargo that would normally move on railroads are being hauled on American roads each month as companies look to get around continuing supply-chain bottlenecks. U.S. intermodal transports, in which railroads carry containers and truck trailers, were down nearly 12% in the first six weeks of this year from a year ago, according to the Association of American Railroads, after tumbling in the second half of last year even as retailers and manufacturers rushed to bring in goods. Trucking... Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Tens of thousands of container loads of cargo that would normally move on railroads are being hauled on American roads each month as companies look to get around continuing supply-chain bottlenecks. U.S. intermodal transports, in which railroads carry containers and truck trailers, were down nearly 12% in the first six weeks of this year from a year ago, according to the Association of American Railroads, after tumbling in the second half of last year even as retailers and manufacturers rushed to bring in goods. Trucking and rail industry officials say demand to move freight 500 miles or more'--which is often done by rail'--remains strong, as companies restock depleted inventories. But shippers are more often than usual choosing highways over railroads because shortages of labor, equipment and warehouse space across supply chains can create unpredictable delays. Railroads ''should be seizing the day and winning more business,'' said Paul Svindland, chief executive of Bensenville, Ill.-based STG Logistics. Mr. Svindland's firm has been placing more cargo than usual on trucks because he can't find enough of the containers railroads need to most easily handle such shipments, he said. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Intermodal transport, which uses trucking for the final leg of delivery, is slower and more complicated than long-haul trucking. But it is also cheaper and less damaging to the environment. Lawrence Gross, president of Gross Transportation Consulting, said intermodal loads have lost a little over 1% of their market share to long-distance trucking since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Based on current freight volumes, that translates to about 30,000 additional long-distance truck moves each week, he said. John Gray, senior vice president for policy and economics at the AAR, said freight railroads could comfortably handle an extra 20,000 to 30,000 intermodal loads a week. ''I am confident there is a lot more capacity out there,'' Mr. Gray said. U.S. supply chains are struggling to ingest record cargo volumes that began surging into the country in the summer of 2020, a few months after the Covid-19 pandemic triggered lockdowns, when consumers switched their spending from services to goods. Imports were up 14% in 2021 over the year before at the nation's busiest container port complex at Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., clogging port terminals, rail yards, truck yards and warehouses. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Railroads carried record levels of intermodal cargo toward the end of 2020 and through the first half of 2021. But last summer, the system ground to a halt as rail yards in the Chicago area filled with tens of thousands of boxes, backing up shipments at a key hub for transport to destinations east of the Mississippi River. Rail and trucking industry officials say the congestion was caused by too many boxes flowing into the region for warehouses and truckers to handle, a situation that has popped up intermittently at other intermodal hubs around the country. Jim Filter, chief commercial officer of Green Bay, Wis.-based trucking and logistics provider Schneider National Inc., said shipping customers took 30% longer than usual, on average, to unload containers last year because their warehouse space was packed and they had too few workers. That tied up the containers and the steel trailers used to pull boxes, making it harder to find equipment already in short supply. In July, some railroads restricted cargo into Chicago for days until the bottlenecks cleared, pushing shippers to trucking for long-distance routes to inland warehouses. The period coincided with massive bottlenecks at U.S. ports, where container ships at the port complex in Southern California waited weeks or months to unload cargo. To make up for lost time, some shippers chose to pay more for the certainty and speed of trucking, said Bob Biesterfeld, chief executive of freight broker C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue ''If they're waiting for days and weeks to get product out of the port and into their warehouse, they're looking for the fastest way to do that, and ultimately that is almost exclusively by truck,'' he said. Truckload volumes moving through the spot market on routes that mirror the nation's busiest inland route, from Los Angeles to Chicago, were up 130% year-over-year in early February according to DAT Solutions LLC. Such demand is contributing to high trucking rates. Dean Croke, DAT's principal freight market analyst, said spot rates on the Los Angeles to Chicago routes are up 59% year-over-year, or $1.04 a mile. But railroad officials say there are signs intermodal freight is beginning to bounce back. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Tom Williams, group vice president for the consumer products business unit of BNSF Railway, said intermodal cargo volumes on container ships en route to the United States are up 25% compared with the start of the year. ''It hasn't arrived yet, but it's coming,'' he said. Still, officials warn that without sufficient equipment, truck drivers, warehouse space and workers to process cargo, rail systems could become clogged again. ''We need the entire chain to be able to handle it at the same pace so we don't get into a similar situation where the trains keep coming and the street and the warehouses can't process it fast enough,'' said Elise Gosch, assistant vice president of intermodal sales at Union Pacific Corp.

Trump calls Putin's moves on Ukraine 'smart' and 'savvy' - The Washington Post Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 15:16 Those clamoring for former president Donald Trump's voice in their social media feeds can turn to Liz Harrington, once an attorney for the Republican National Committee and now spokeswoman for him. Until Trump's own social media platform is actually running, Harrington's Twitter feed is the best immediate source for the various Twitter-esque riffs and links that Trump puts out through his political action committee several times a day. So, for example, one could learn from Harrington on Tuesday morning that Trump would be making an appearance on a right-wing radio program. And then, a few hours later, you could hear part of the discussion for yourself, dutifully shared by Harrington. Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip Bump For example, you could hear how Trump replied when the show's hosts asked him about President Biden's response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's sending military forces into Ukraine. Story continues below advertisement ''In the last 24 hours we know Russia has said that they are recognizing two breakaway regions of Ukraine, and now this White House is stating that this is an 'invasion,' '' host Buck Sexton said. ''That's a strong word. What went wrong here? What has the current occupant of the Oval Office done that he could have done differently?'' ''Well, what went wrong was a rigged election,'' Trump said, once again misrepresenting the results of the 2020 presidential contest. ''What went wrong is a candidate that shouldn't be there and a man that has no concept of what he's do '-- '' Trump said ''doing,'' actually, but Harrington's clip cut off a bit too early. That's probably because of what Trump said next. Story continues below advertisement ''I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, 'This is genius,' '' Trump continued. ''Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine '-- of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful. So, Putin is now saying, 'It's independent,' a large section of Ukraine. I said, 'How smart is that?' And he's gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That's strongest peace force '... We could use that on our southern border.'' He continued to praise Putin a bit later. ''Here's a guy that says, you know, 'I'm gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent' '-- he used the word 'independent' '-- 'and we're gonna go out and we're gonna go in and we're gonna help keep peace,' '' Trump said. ''You gotta say that's pretty savvy. And you know what the response was from Biden? There was no response.'' Story continues below advertisement Harrington's clip didn't include all of that about how Putin's move was ''genius'' and ''smart'' and ''savvy,'' something Trump said more than once. And when your press person is cutting off quotes early, that's not an accident. On Feb. 22, White House press secretary Jen Psaki dismissed former president Donald Trump's comments after he called Russia's move on Ukraine ''smart.'' (The Washington Post)I suspect that you are not surprised to hear this. The disdain for Biden that enveloped the comments about Putin isn't a surprise, even as Trump's dismissal of Biden's response was undercut by the announcement of new sanctions on Tuesday afternoon. Nor is it a surprise that Trump would express admiration for Putin. Few people better encapsulate the right's mixture of respect for Putin's autocratic tendencies and the perceived embarrassment of Democratic presidents that results than Donald Trump. When Putin seized Crimea in 2014, Trump declared that ''Putin has eaten Obama's lunch'' and pretended to worry that President Barack Obama would do something ''very foolish and very stupid to show his manhood.'' This, of course, came less than a year after Trump wondered if Putin would become his ''new best friend'' when the Miss Universe pageant was held in Moscow. Story continues below advertisement There's little need to articulate the extent to which Trump flirted with Putin and Russia during his 2016 campaign and his presidency. Remember when he invited Russia's foreign minister to the Oval Office the day after he fired FBI Director James B. Comey for pressing forward on the Russia probe? Remember when he met with Putin in Helsinki and then emerged to take Putin's side on Russia's 2016 election interference? Remember his repeated insistences that he thought it was important to get along with Russia, by which he meant it was important to get along with Vladimir Putin '-- someone who was not his enemy but might still turn out to be a friend? Remember when he said that Putin said he was brilliant, which Putin didn't really say but which helped fuel months of Trumpian enthusiasm about how he and Putin might end up as pals? Remember, too, how Putin was just one of a contingent of authoritarians (Turkey, China, North Korea) who Trump enjoyed being around, preferring being stroked by America's enemies to being challenged by our allies? So, without even being asked to take sides in the power struggle between our country and Russia, Trump took sides. Putin was clever and wily, and Biden inept and toothless. There are ways to criticize Biden without explicitly praising the Russian authoritarian actively seeking to reorder democracy in Europe '-- see the example of every vocal Republican in the Senate '-- but this was not the path Trump chose to follow. Story continues below advertisement At another point on Tuesday '-- and about two seconds later in the radio interview '-- Trump reiterated his claim that Putin wouldn't have entered Ukraine were he president. The impression he hopes to give is one of strength; that Putin feared his response. There's no evidence for that, of course. What was the point in Trump's presidency when Putin might have felt intimidated by Trump's exercising of American power? The sanctions he didn't want to apply? His refusal to blame Russia for interfering? As I wrote on Tuesday, it seems much more likely that, if American politics played any role at all, Putin would want to move when he could expect the political right to criticize Biden more than himself. That includes the former president. After all, Putin's so savvy, right? This response from Trump is not surprising. It is nonetheless noteworthy.

More surprisingly, many saw a jump in other death claims, too. Industry executives and actuaries believe many of these other fatalities are tied to delays in medical care as a result of lockdowns in 2020, and then, later, people's fears of seeking out treatment and trouble lining up appointments. Some insurers see continued high levels of these deaths for some time, even if Covid-19 deaths decline this year. In earnings calls for the past two quarters, Globe Life Inc., Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Primerica Inc. and Reinsurance Group of America Inc. were among insurers noting higher non-Covid-19 deaths, compared with pre-pandemic baselines. ''The losses we are seeing continue to be elevated over 2019 levels due at least in part, we believe, to the pandemic and the existence of either delayed or unavailable healthcare,'' Globe Life finance chief Frank Svoboda told analysts and investors earlier this month. Among the non-coronavirus-specific claims are deaths from heart and circulatory issues and neurological disorders, he said. ''We anticipate that they'll start to be less impactful over the course of 2022 but we do anticipate that we'll still at least see some elevated levels throughout the year,'' he said. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Primerica executives similarly cautioned in their fourth-quarter call about outsize numbers of non-Covid-19 deaths in 2022. ''Some of these will be the result of delayed medical care or the increased incidence of societal-related issues, such as the increased prevalence of substance abuse,'' Chief Financial Officer Alison Rand said in an email interview. From early stages of the pandemic, many medical professionals have raised concerns about Americans' untreated health problems, as Covid-19 put stress on the nation's healthcare system. Trade group American Council of Life Insurers said the pandemic in 2020 drove the biggest annual increase in death benefits paid by U.S. carriers since the 1918 influenza epidemic, totaling billions of dollars. The hit to the industry's bottom line has been less than initially feared, however, because many victims have been older people who typically have smaller policies, if any coverage. Still, Covid-19 and other excess deaths have cut into many carriers' quarterly earnings, especially as deaths linked to the Delta variant increased for people in their working years with employer-sponsored death benefits. ''Earnings impacts have been material and there still appears to be some Covid-19 discount, but investors are starting to look through mortality claims costs,'' said Andrew Kligerman, Advertisement - Scroll to Continue a stock analyst with Credit Suisse Securities. Industrywide, death-benefit claims usually vary only slightly year-to-year, so the recent increases are outside the norm. Non-Covid-19 excess deaths jumped in last year's third quarter, after negligible or modest counts in earlier quarters, some life insurers said. Those numbers line up with results from an ongoing Covid-19 survey of 20 of the nation's leading sellers of group-life insurance to employers by the Society of Actuaries Research Institute. In the third quarter, the survey shows, incurred claims counts were 37.7% higher than a pre-pandemic baseline, with a nearly 50-50 split between claims directly tied to Covid-19 and those that weren't, according to R. Dale Hall, managing director of research at the society, a professional organization. The group is still assessing fourth-quarter data. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue The third-quarter non-Covid-19 excess claims were 19%, compared with 18.7% for Covid-19 claims, Mr. Hall said. Non-coronavirus-specific excess claims hadn't topped 6.4% in previous quarters. In discussing third-quarter results with analysts, Hartford Financial Chief Executive Christopher Swift said the company had ''experienced higher levels of non-Covid excess mortality during the quarter,'' including heart, stroke and cancer causes of death. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue He said the company's experience with such claims ''has been very bouncy over the last six quarters so I don't see a trend per se,'' beyond those seeming ''to indicate maybe a second-order effect with Covid and people not taking care of themselves.'' The insurer is one of the nation's biggest group-benefits providers. At nonpublicly traded OneAmerica Financial Partners, another group-life-insurance seller, claims for working-age adults ran at about 140% of a pre-pandemic baseline during the third quarter, CEO J. Scott Davison said. About two-thirds of these excess deaths are Covid-19-specific, he said. Of the remainder, in addition to deaths driven by deferred medical care, Mr. Davison's team believes that some may stem from earlier Covid-19 infections. He cited scientific research indicating that the virus may pave the way for future medical complications, so survivors may ''later die from the toll Covid has taken on their bodies.'' The impact on the cost of life insurance from Covid-19 both directly and indirectly is unclear. Some insurers say they are repricing group-life contracts modestly on the assumption that the virus will be around at least through 2022. Those contracts are typically repriced every couple of years. Meanwhile, insurers are still trying to determine what implications there may or may not be on long-term mortality.

Johnson & Johnson, Moderna set to face shareholder votes on vaccine pricing strategy, manufacturing tech sharing | FiercePharma Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 15:09 Throughout the global push to produce COVID-19 vaccines, pharma companies have frequently come under fire for unequal access to their shots. Oxfam, in a bid to force better access, has scored a pair of wins in its effort to exact pricing and intellectual property information from Johnson & Johnson and Moderna, respectively. At J&J's upcoming annual meeting, shareholders will have a chance to vote on an Oxfam proposal to force the company to release its COVID-19 vaccine pricing strategy. Oxfam previously asked J&J to share the information considering the drugmaker received substantial funding assistance from the U.S. government while it was developing the shot. During the company's shareholder meeting last year, 32% of J&J's shareholders voted for a similar resolution, Oxfam notes. Meanwhile, at Moderna, shareholders will vote on whether the company should study the feasibility of sharing vaccine technology to help increase global production. This has been a hot issue in recent months as many of the world's mRNA shots have gone to developed countries, while low- and middle-income countries were forced to wait for donations. After Oxfam filed the shareholder resolutions late last year, J&J and Moderna asked the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow them to omit the proposals from their annual meeting materials. The SEC denied the requests, according to agency records. In rejecting Moderna's request, SEC said the proposal ""transcends ordinary business matters and does not seek to micromanage the company."" As for J&J, the SEC disagreed with the drugmaker that its public disclosures ""substantially implement the proposal."" RELATED: Shareholders to push for detailed COVID-19 pricing strategies from Pfizer, J&J at annual meetings Oxfam also filed a technology-sharing proposal with Pfizer, similar to Moderna. It isn't clear whether the SEC has ruled on that potential shareholder vote yet. An Oxfam representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The vaccine heavyweights have come under fire from a range of global groups amid the COVID-19 immunization drive that started last year. Last March, as it became clear there'd be a serious supply shortfall in developing countries, calls to break vaccine patents began to gather steam. In May 2021, the Biden administration backed a proposal at the World Trade Organization to suspend intellectual property protections for COVID shots so that companies around the world could begin to pump out their own doses. The move angered the industry, which has argued that established vaccine players are in the best position to quickly scale up production of pandemic vaccines. Further, companies have argued that suspending patent rights will spur a global fight for critical raw materials, hurting output. Meanwhile, COVID vaccine sales have been adding up in a big way, especially at Pfizer and Moderna. Pfizer reported $36.8 billion in 2021 COVID-19 vaccine sales, and Moderna is set to report full-year revenues on Thursday. RELATED: Biden admin backs proposal to suspend intellectual property on COVID-19 vaccines, angering industry After Pfizer reported its earnings earlier this month, Oxfam's senior manager of private sector advocacy Robbie Silverman responded that the results are ""clear evidence of how the company has used its monopoly to enrich its shareholders at the expense of almost half the world's population, who still have no access to lifesaving vaccines."" ""It is obscene that we have allowed pharmaceutical companies to put their profits before the good of humanity as the pandemic drags on,"" he added. ""No corporations should decide who lives and who dies."" As for J&J, the company's COVID shot generated $2.39 billion in 2021. In the U.S., the shot faced an early setback when authorities briefly paused its use to investigate rare blood clots. Afterward, the vaccine never really gained traction to keep up with its mRNA rivals. In all of last year, the industry churned out an estimated 12 billion doses.

Antibiotics can impede flu vaccines | Nature Reviews Immunology Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:55 Perturbations in the gut microbiota have been shown to affect various immune components and impair the efficacy of treatments such as cancer immunotherapy. Now, work from the group of Bali Pulendran shows that antibiotic-mediated disruption of the gut microbiota can impair the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in individuals with low levels of pre-existing immunity. Credit: S. Bradbrook/Springer Nature Limited Most studies exploring how the microbiota shapes immune function have used animal models. To examine the effects of the microbiota on the human immune system, Hagan et al. vaccinated antibiotic-treated or control subjects with the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). They initially enrolled 22 healthy adults and subjected 11 individuals to a 5-day broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen (commencing 3 days before vaccination and ending 1'day after) and collected biological samples regularly until 1 year after vaccination. Antibiotic-treated subjects showed a marked reduction in bacterial loads and profound changes in microbial community composition, chiefly characterized by an overabundance of Enterobacteriaceae and reduced proportions of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae and Veillonellaceae. This restriction in bacterial diversity was apparent for at least 6 months after cessation of antibiotics administration. In this initial study, the authors did not see any differences between the TIV-induced antibody responses of antibiotic-treated and control individuals. However, many individuals showed high baseline antibody titres; therefore, in a subsequent study the authors enrolled additional subjects with low pre-existing titres of antibody against influenza. In this follow-up study using individuals with limited pre-existing immunity, antibiotic treatment markedly impaired binding and neutralization antibody responses against the H1N1 A/California strain of influenza (although not against the other two strains targeted by the vaccine) following TIV vaccination. Specifically, the antibiotic-treated subjects showed markedly impaired production of IgG1 and IgA1 specific for H1N1 A/California following vaccination. The authors found that antibiotic treatment alone was associated with increased expression of gene modules linked with pro-inflammatory signalling and dendritic cell activation, similarly to what had previously been observed in elderly subjects. These changes normalized following cessation of antibiotics, suggesting they were linked with perturbations in the gut microbiota. As the gut microbiota plays an important role in dietary metabolism, the authors examined changes in the blood metabolomes of the different groups. They found that antibiotic treatment was associated with metabolite changes, including changes in bile acid and tryptophan metabolism. The gut microbiota is responsible for converting liver-derived primary bile acids into secondary bile acids; notably, treatment with antibiotics led to a dramatic reduction in levels of secondary bile acids. Accordingly, the authors found prominent differences in the metabolic response to TIV between the antibiotic-treated and control subjects. Analyses by the authors suggested an inverse correlation between the levels of individual secondary bile acids and expression of various inflammatory modules. In particular, the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid (LCA) showed a 1,000-fold reduction in the plasma of antibiotic-treated subjects and downregulation of LCA was associated with increased expression of inflammasome signalling genes. Further gene network analyses by the authors suggested that the increased inflammatory signalling associated with secondary bile acid disturbances and the impaired IgG1 response to TIV vaccination arise as independent effects of antibiotic-mediated disturbance of the microbiota. ''antibiotic-mediated disruption of the gut microbiota can impair the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in individuals with low levels of pre-existing immunity'' Virtually all humans have been previously exposed to influenza virus and this study indicates that, where pre-existing immunity exists, the immune system can maintain appropriate responses to pathogens despite significant metabolic disturbances arising from transient dysbiosis. However, in situations where immunity may be less mature (such as in adults with low pre-existing immune memory or in infants), dysbiosis may have a greater impact on the development of an appropriate immune response.

The Next Step for the World Economic Forum ' Brownstone Institute Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:55 It has been obvious since early 2020 that there has been an organized cult outreach that has permeated the world as a whole. It's possible that this formed out of a gigantic error, rooted in a sudden ignorance of cell biology and long experience of public health. It is also possible that a seasonal respiratory virus was deployed by some people as an opportunity to seize power for some other purpose. Follow the money and influence trails and the latter conclusion is hard to dismiss. The clues were there early. Even before the WHO declared a pandemic in March 2020 (at least several months behind the actual fact of a pandemic) and before any lockdowns, there were media blitzes talking about the ''New Normal'' and talk of the ''Great Reset'' (which was rebranded as ''Build Back Better''). Pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Astra-Zeneca were actively lobbying governments to buy their vaccines as early as February 2020, supposedly less than a month after the genetic sequence (or partial sequence) was made available by China. As a person who spent his whole professional career in pharmaceutical and vaccine development, I found the whole concept of going from scratch to a ready-to-use vaccine in a few months simply preposterous. Something did not add up. I knew of the names with which everyone has become familiar. Bill Gates, Neil Ferguson, Jeremy Farrar, Anthony Fauci, and others had either been lobbying for or pursuing the lockdown strategies for many years. But still, the scope of the actions seemed too large to even be explained by those names alone. So, the fundamental questions that I have been asking myself have been why and who? The ''Why'' seems to always come back to issues besides public health. Of course the ''Who'' had the obvious players such as the WHO, China, CDC, NIH/NIAID, and various governments but there seemed to be more behind it than that. These players have been connected to the ''public health'' aspect but that seemed to be only scratching the surface. I am not an investigative journalist and I would never claim that role, but even I can do some simple internet searches and start to see patterns evolve. The searches that I have done have yielded some very interesting ''coincidences.'' If I give you the names of the following people '' Biden, Trudeau, Ardern, Merkel, Macron, Draghi, Morrison, Xi Jinping '' what do you think that they have in common? Yes, they are all pampered and stumble over themselves, but that is also not the connection. One can see very quickly that these names certainly connect to lockdown countries and individuals who have ignored their own laws and/or tried in some way to usurp them. But, there is more to it than that and I will give a hint by providing a link with each name. Joseph Biden, President, United States Boris Johnson, PM of United KingdomJacinda Ardern, PM of New Zealand Angela Merkel, Former PM of GermanyEmmanuel Macron, President of France Justin Trudeau, PM of Canada Xi Jinping, CCP Leader, ChinaMario Draghi, PM of Italy Scott Morrison, PM of Australia They are all associated with the World Economic Forum (WEF), a ''nonprofit'' private organization started (in 1971) and headed by Klaus ''You will own nothing and be happy'' Schwab and his family. This is a private organization that has no official bearing with any world governance body, despite the implication of the name. It could just as well have been called the ''Church of Schwabies.'' The WEF was the origin of the ''Great Reset'' and I would guess that it was the origin of ''Build Back Better'' (since most of the above names have used that term recently). If you think that the WEF membership ends with just leaders of countries, here are a few more names: Gavin Newsom, Governor of California Jay Inslee, Governor of Washington State Anthony Fauci, Director NIAID Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House Allow me to introduce more of the WEF by giving a list of names for the Board of Trustees. Al Gore, Former WP of the USMark Carney, UN Special Envoy for Climate ActionT. Shanmugaratnam, Seminar Minister SingaporeChristine Lagarde, President, European Central BankNgozi Okonja-Iweala, Director General, WTOKristalian Georggieva, Managing Director, IMFChrystia Freeland, Deputy Minister of CanadaLaurence Fink, CEO, BlackRock You can see a cross section of political and economic leaders on the board. The leader of the organization, that is the leader of the Board, is still Klaus Schwab. He has built an impressive array of followers. If you want to really see the extent of influence, go to the website and pick out the corporate name of your choice; there are many to choose from: Abbott Laboratories, Astra-Zeneca, Biogen, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India, BASF, Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, Blackrock, CISCO, Dell, Google, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Zoom, Yahoo, Amazon, Airbus, Boeing, Honda, Rakuten, Walmart, UPS, Coca-Cola, UBER, Bank of China. Bank of America. Deutsche Bank, State Bank of India, Royal Bank of Canada, Lloyds Banking, JP Morgan-Chase, Equifax, Goldman-Sachs, Hong Kong Exchanges, Bloomberg, VISA, New York Times, Ontario (Canada) Teacher's Pension Plan The extent of reach is huge even beyond the worldwide leader network. For example, we all know what Bill Gates has been doing with his wealth via the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). But, the Wellcome Trust is equal to the task. Who is the Director of the Wellcome Trust? One named Jeremy Farrar, of the United Kingdom SAGE and lockdown fame '' arguably the architect of the US-UK lockdowns in 2020 '' is closely associated with WEF. Concerning the reach that can occur, let me give some examples from the BMGF alone, and it comes from the time that I spent in 2020 reading their extensive funding list. A few years ago, the BMGF awarded the Institute for Health Metric Evaluation (IHME) a ten-year, almost $280 million award. IHME (associated with the University of Washington in Seattle) was at the forefront of the computer modeling that was driving the lockdowns and the nonpharmaceutical Interventions during 2020. People have seen their name often in print or on MSNBC or CNN. In 2019, IHME awarded the Editor of the Lancet (Dr. Richard Horton) a $100,000 award and described him as an ''activist editor.'' The Lancet, once considered one of the best medical journals, has been at the forefront of censoring opposing scientific viewpoints since 2020 and publishing ''papers'' that were not fit to be published. I never could understand what it meant to be an ''activist'' editor in a respected scientific/medical journal because, stupid me, I always thought that the first job of the editor was to be impartial. I guess I learned in 2020 how wrong I was. Of course, the Lancet is also heavily funded from pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer (also a member of the WEF). But, the BMGF reach goes far beyond just IHME and these connections have been quite recognizable. Here are some examples of the organizations and moneys received during 2020 alone broken down by areas. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grants 2020Organization NameAmount USDJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health20+ millionWorld Health Organization (WHO)100+ millionOregon Health Sciences Univ.15+ millionCDC Foundation3.5+ millionImperial College of London7+ millionChinese CDC2+ millionHarvard TH Chan School of Public Health5+ millionInstitute of Health Metric Evaluation (IHME)28 million (part of a 10 yr/279 million USD grant)Nigeria CDC1.1 millionDeutsche Gesellschaft f¼r Internationale Z.

The BMGF has also given close to $100 million to the Clinton Health Access Initiative. The questions now have to be asked: Is this some beginning of a controlled authoritarian society intertwined via the WEF? Has the Covid panic been staged to set the stage? Please note, I am not a ''Covid Denier'' since the virus is real. But, has a normal seasonal respiratory virus been used as an excuse to activate the web?The next questions, for those of us who at least pretend to live in ''Democratic'' societies, have to be: Is this what you expected and/or want from the people you elect? How many people knew of the ''Associations'' of the people that they voted for? (I certainly did not know of the associations until I did the searches but maybe I am just out of touch)Can we anticipate their next moves? There may be some hints. The Next Move Jeremy Farrar of The Wellcome Trust recently wrote an article for the WEF with the CEO of Novo Nordisk Foundation, Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen. It is a summary of a larger piece written for and published by the Boston Consulting Group. In this article, they propose that the way to ''fix'' the problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria is via a subscription service. That is, you pay a fee and when you need an antibiotic, presumably an effective one will be available for you. My guess is that they have the same philosophy for vaccines and that certainly seems to be the approach with Coronavirus. Keep paying for and taking boosters. In view of this philosophy, the vaccine mandates make sense. Get society ''addicted'' to an intervention, effective or not, and then keep feeding them. This becomes especially effective if you can keep the fear going. This approach is so shortsighted, from a scientific viewpoint, it astounds me. But, like much of recent history, I think science has little to do with it. The goal is not scientifically founded but control founded. After the discovery of penicillin almost one century ago, there were scientists who warned that antibiotic usage should be considered very carefully in practice because evolutionary pressures would lead to antibiotic resistant species of bacteria. At that time, they were considered to be rogue scientists; after all, didn't we suddenly have a miracle cure for many deadly problems? From the time of discovery, it took over a decade before fermentation methods were developed to produce sufficient quantities of antibiotics to be practical. These methods allowed for the use of penicillin on the battlefield towards the end of WWII and undoubtedly saved many lives then and later in subsequent wars (Korea and Vietnam) by preventing serious infections resulting from wounds sustained during battle. However, it did not take long before the medical establishment was handing out antibiotics like candy. I experienced this myself when I was a child in the 1960s. It seemed like every time we went to the doctor, no matter what the problem, I was given a series (not just one) of injections of penicillin. There were never any attempts to determine if I had a virus, bacteria, or even an allergy. The answer was: in with the needle. I cannot count how many times I was ''jabbed'' as a child. It didn't take long before resistance species started to appear. The result was that more and more money was pumped into R&D for antibiotics. When I was in graduate school during the 1980s, one sure way to get some NIH funding was to tie the research into the ''antibiotic'' search. Antibiotics became big business. We now have several classes of antibiotics that are used for specific cases. We have Aminoglycosides (Streptomycin, Neomycin, etc.), Beta-Lactams Cephalosporins (four generations including Cefadroxil-G1, Cefaclor-G2, Cefotaxime-G3, Cefepime-G4 , Beta-Lactams Penicillins (including Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, and Penicillin), Other Beta-Lactams (Meropenem), Fluoroquinolones (Levofloxacin, Gemifloxicin, etc.), Macrolides (Azithromycin, Clarithromycin, etc.), Sulfonamides (Sulfisoxazole, etc.), Tetracyclines, and others such as Clindamycin and Vancomycin (typically reserved for resistant bacteria). All in all, physicians have over 50 different choices for antibiotics. The most common place to encounter antibiotic resistant bacteria is in a hospital. Most people who get some sort of infection in the normal routine of life, like a sinus infection or skin infection, will not likely encounter an antibiotic resistant species. Except there has been another source of the problem and that has been in the food supply. Antibiotics have become very popular with large scale meat production facilities of all types including beef, poultry, swine, and even fish. These include actual farms where the animals are raised as well as in the processing of the meat. The overuse of antibiotics in these industries has also produced resistant forms of bacteria. For example, in attempts to limit the bacteria e. coli, common to mammalians, antibiotics have been used and this has resulted in some antibiotic resistant forms of e. coli. An infection via e. coli (antibiotic resistant or not) can be avoided by proper cooking and handling of meats. However, sometimes that does not happen and there are e. coli outbreaks (also from improperly washed vegetables that may use contaminated irrigation water). For most healthy people, experiencing e. coli (either resistant or not) is only a passing discomfort that includes intestinal cramps, diarrhea, and other GI complaints. Depending on the amount of contamination, a person may suffer for a day or two or for several days. But, with some people, it can be serious or deadly (such as in elderly people in poor health and young children). If that occurs, then the presence of an antibiotic resistant form can be a serious matter. Presence of a non-resistant form can be treated more readily. A few years ago I had pneumonia; a relatively mild case. I was given a choice of in-patient treatment or out-patient and it was a no-brainer. If I wanted to make sure that my pneumonia could be handled by the normal course of antibiotics (I was given a quinolone), staying at home and away from the hospital was important. I knew that hospital-acquired pneumonia could be a much more serious situation. So, I stayed at home and easily recovered. That did not mean I was guaranteed getting a more serious resistant form in the hospital but I understood that the risk was much greater. Producing more antibiotics and giving them on subscription to the users is not the answer. That will only lead to more resistant forms and there will be this continuing loop of antibiotic use. But, if the actual goal is societal addiction to antibiotics out of fear, just like addiction to universal Covid vaccines out of fear, then it makes sense. Finding a few universal antibiotics that deal with the resistant forms is important and it is also important to use those sparingly and only as a last resort. In addition, better management of antibiotic use in our society would go a long way to attenuating the problem. There is nothing particularly controversial about that observation. It was accepted by nearly every responsible health professional only two years ago. But we live now in different times of extreme experimentation, such as the deployment of world-wide lockdowns for a virus that had a highly focused impact, with catastrophic results for the world. It was the WEF on March 21, 2020 that assured us ''lockdowns can halt the spread of Covid-19.'' Today that article, never pulled much less repudiated, stands as probably the most ridiculous and destructive suggestion and prediction of the 21st century. And yet, the WEF is still at it, suggesting that same year that at least lockdowns reduced carbon emissions. We can easily predict that the WEF's call for a universal and mandated subscription plan for antibiotics '' pushed with the overt intention of shoring up financial capitalization of major drug manufacturers '' will meet the same fate: poor health outcomes, more power to entrenched elites, and ever less liberty for the people.

Fast-spreading HIV variant doubles rate of immune system decline | | UN News Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:53 Newly published research from the Netherlands has revealed the existence of a more transmissible and damaging variant of HIV, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) said on Monday. People living with the newly revealed subtype, experience double the rate of immune system decline (measured by the CD4 count level of infection-busting T cells) and have higher viral loads. They are also vulnerable to developing AIDS two to three times faster after diagnosis, than if they were living with other strains of the virus. The research also revealed that the variant has been circulating in the Netherlands for years and remains receptive to treatment. The study, led by researchers from the University of Oxford's Big Data Institute, is the first to report on the subtype-B of the virus. Treatment still worksAccording to UNAIDS in press statement, the discovery highlights the urgency to ''halt the pandemic and reach all and reach all with testing and treatment'' The long-running HIV pandemic continues to take a life every minute and scientists have long worried about the evolution of new, more transmissible, variants of the virus. According to UNAIDS, the newly identified variant does not represent a major public health threat but underscores the urgency of speeding up the UN's drive to end AIDS. In a statement, the Programme Deputy Executive Director, Eamonn Murphy, noted that around 10 million people living with HIV are still not on antiretroviral therapy, ''fuelling the continued spread of the virus and potential for further variants.'' ''We urgently need to deploy cutting-edge medical innovations in ways that reach the communities most in need. Whether it's HIV treatment or COVID-19 vaccines, inequalities in access are perpetuating pandemics in ways that harm us all'', he said. 79 million infectionsHIV remains the deadliest pandemic of our time, said UNAIDS. Since first discovered in the early 80s, an estimated 79 million people have become infected with the virus, for which there is still no vaccine and no cure. Some 36 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the start of the pandemic and 1.5 million people were newly infected in 2020. Of the 38 million people living with the virus today, 28 million are on life-saving antiretroviral therapy, keeping them alive and well and preventing transmission.

Many of those behind the demonstration, which was planned as an American version of the past month's chaotic Canadian protest, have connections to the violent attack on the Capitol in January 2021, or supported the lie that fraud in the 2020 presidential election was to blame for Donald J. Trump's loss. ''We're just trying to show what the people who back us believe '-- and our own beliefs '-- of what our country needs to go back to,'' said Jeff Sandberg, a Republican truck driver from Texas whose vehicle was hauling a massive banner covered in slogans such as ''We Will Not Comply!!'' and ''Let's Go Brandon,'' a meme created to insult President Biden. Brian Brase, a convoy spokesman and Ohio-based truck driver, said the motorcade was expected to grow as the trucks wended across the country. ''We believe tens of thousands will join in,'' he said. About 40 truckers were on hand with their rigs as the convoy rolled out on Wednesday in Adelanto, Calif., about 180 miles west of the Arizona state line. A flag-strewn send-off rally that resembled a Make America Great Again event drew about a hundred more vehicles. At truck stops in the surrounding area, most local drivers seemed only dimly aware of the California convoy or too busy to take part. Unlike in Ottawa, where a recent weekslong protest shut down parts of Canada's capital, the activity near Barstow, Calif., on Wednesday seemed highly staged, with memorabilia stands and food trucks. The group behind the convoy '-- one of several in the United States expected to launch over the next few days '-- is demanding an end to the national emergency, meant to streamline the government response to the pandemic, that was first declared by Mr. Trump in March 2020 and recently extended by Mr. Biden. The protesters also want congressional hearings into the origin of the pandemic and an end to government health rules requiring masks and vaccinations, a move that has already begun as new cases have ebbed. Image Charity Reyes, the wife of Adelanto's part-time mayor, Gabriel Reyes, sang the national anthem. Credit... Meridith Kohut for The New York Times Image The protesters want an end to government health rules requiring masks and vaccinations. Credit... Meridith Kohut for The New York Times Mr. Brase, a former public affairs director for an advocacy group that pushed during the Trump administration to relax limits on driving time for commercial truckers, said that the cross-country protest would be peaceful. A statement by the group said the demonstration would end near the nation's capital, but that the convoy would not enter Washington. Law enforcement authorities warned against disruption of the sort that roiled Canada for several weeks. ''Attempting to block or shut down a freeway or state highway to protest is unlawful, dangerous and prevents motorists from safely reaching their destinations,'' the California Highway Patrol said in a statement. ''If necessary, the C.H.P. will take enforcement action that includes, but is not limited to, issuing citations, impounding vehicles, arresting individuals who intentionally block traffic on the state's transportation system or pose a threat to public safety.'' In Washington, officials from the U.S. Capitol Police said they would facilitate the demonstration as a ''lawful First Amendment activity,'' but also had set some security measures in motion. The Defense Department authorized deployment of about 700 unarmed National Guard personnel from the District of Columbia and neighboring states to help manage traffic, and Capitol Police said that plans were being drawn up to reinstall the temporary fence that was erected around the Capitol after last year's Jan. 6 riot. An American trucker protest has been discussed for at least a month on social media and right-wing news outlets, inspired by the one that crossed Canada, demanding an end to a mandate requiring truckers crossing the U.S.-Canada border to get vaccinated against Covid-19. American truckers have no such mandate, and as a towering surge in new cases has rapidly ebbed, most states '-- including California '-- have eased restrictions. But Mr. Brase said his group felt compelled to express solidarity with health care workers, public employees and others for whom vaccination has become a requirement. Last week, a conservative political action committee that has focused in the past on defending Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and ally of Mr. Trump who is being investigated by the Justice Department, issued a call for participation in an American convoy that would start in Ohio and California and reach Washington on March 6. Darrel Courtney, the chief executive of the Adelanto Stadium and Event Center, said he received a call last Tuesday from Leigh Dundas, an Orange County lawyer and Republican activist, who wanted to rent the parking lot. Ms. Dundas, a lawyer for an anti-vaccine group whose leader was charged with entering the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, was videotaped the day before the riot rallying pro-Trump crowds with calls to kill any ''alleged Americans'' who might have helped undermine the 2020 elections. Two hours northeast of Los Angeles, Adelanto is known chiefly for its prisons. Gabriel Reyes, the city's part-time mayor '-- a Republican who operates a small currency trading and marketing business '-- said the city-owned stadium, which once hosted minor league baseball, was little used except for an annual cannabis festival, ''Kushstock.'' Image The truckers are hoping to build on the protests in Canada that paralyzed Ottawa. Credit... Meridith Kohut for The New York Times Image About 40 truckers gathered at Adelanto Stadium before heading east. Credit... Meridith Kohut for The New York Times ''I didn't see us making beaucoup bucks off of this,'' he said, ''but if they all want to fill up at our Arco station and we get that California tax, then hey, we're going to say, 'Thank you!''' On Wednesday, the mayor's wife sang the national anthem for the truckers before they departed for their next stop, Kingman, Ariz. Speakers at the rally included Dr. Pierre Kory, a vocal advocate of the discouraged use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin as a Covid-19 treatment, and Rob McCoy, a Republican politician and Southern California evangelical pastor who has gained prominence flouting pandemic rules and calling the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, ''Governor Newssolini.'' Ms. Dundas, who was the event's M.C., said, ''It's been two years, and it is time to open this darn economy with no more restrictions on it.'' A list of organizations supporting the convoy included those led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leader in the anti-vaccine movement, and Gen. Michael Flynn, the former Trump administration national security adviser. That latter group, the America Project, has combined its attempts to challenge Covid-19 policies with the relentless promotion of pro-Trump election conspiracy theories. The group is run by Patrick Byrne, the former chief executive of Overstock.com, who, with General Flynn, was central in a bizarre plot to persuade the former president to use the military to seize voting machines in a bid to stay in power. Yet another group, the American Foundation for Civil Liberties and Freedom, which is raising money for the truckers, hosted an event in Los Angeles last summer at which participants promoted baseless claims that there were widespread irregularities in the presidential voting results in Michigan. Outside Adelanto, Mario Acevedo, who had stopped to wash the tires of his big rig on the way to Nevada, said he did not ''have that time or luxury, unfortunately,'' to skip work for the convoy. ''I got to provide for my family,'' he said. Shawn Hubler reported from Adelanto, Calif., and Alan Feuer from Albany, N.Y. Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.

Credit: TwitterFrench No 1 Gael Monfils withdraws from Davis Cup citing a ''health glitch'' following the Covid vaccine.FRENCH No 1 tennis player Gael Monfils withdraws from next month's Davis Cup citing a ''health glitch'' following his third dose of the Covid vaccine. He revealed that this was the reason for his absence from recent competitions. Writing on Twitter, the 35-year-old said: ''Hello everyone, I wanted to give you some news following my recent withdrawals from tournaments. I suffered a small health glitch (probably following my third dose of vaccine). ''On the advice of my doctor, I decided to take some time to rest. So unfortunately I will not be able to play the Davis Cup next week. I hope to be able to return in the United States.'' The world number 25, who has not played for over three weeks, opened up further about his announcement after receiving hateful comments calling him an anti-vaxxer '' despite receiving three doses of the mRNA vaccine. In a series of tweets following the backlash, the Frenchman, who is married to current Ukrainian tennis number one Elina Svitolina, revealed that he wasn't trying to push anti-vax propaganda. ''Thank you very much for all your messages of support,'' he wrote. ''This tweet was just an update on my current state of fitness following my latest tournament withdrawals. After several tests, the doctors have made a hypothesis about the potential nature of my condition. ''The causes of my pins and needles remain unclear and even the doctors can't tell me exactly what it is. My goal was simply to be transparent with you and not to push anti-vax propaganda,'' the tennis star continued. ''Let's stop appropriating everyone's words for political purposes or simply to serve your beliefs. I don't regret having been vaccinated at all. Everyone does what they want. ''I feel better and better and I hope to be ready for Indian Wells! (I don't want to answer all the haters like last time but you still make me laugh and thanks for that.)'' According to the Daily Mail, Monfils is the second French player to be forced off court after a suspected adverse reaction to a coronavirus vaccine.

Metal prices surge on fears of supply disruption, aluminum hits record Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:22 A worker watches as aluminum ingots pass along a conveyor belt after cooling in the foundry at the Krasnoyarsk aluminum smelter, operated by United Co. Rusal, in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. Andrey Rudakov | Bloomberg | Getty Images Commodities prices surged across the board Thursday amid fears of a supply disruption after Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia is a key producer and exporter of not just energy, but metals and grains, too. Markets were already tight ahead of the invasion, meaning there's little ability to absorb any output cuts. ""With base metals inventories already running extremely low, there is very little additional cushion for further supply disruptions '-- either from Russia directly or via higher-for-longer gas and power prices,"" JPMorgan said in a note to clients. Aluminum prices jumped more than 3% to hit a record high of $3,450 per ton on the London Metal Exchange. Nickel is now trading at the highest level in more than a decade: around $25,000 per ton. Platinum jumped more than 2%, while palladium surged more than 6%. Russia is a key producer of all four metals. The country supplies 35% of the world's palladium and 10% of world platinum, according to data from Cru. Aluminum, nickel, and crude steel production stands at 6%, 5% and 4%, respectively. ""[A]luminum and nickel are making further gains amid fears that these two base metals could suffer supply outages from Russia as sanctions are imposed and counteraction is taken,"" Commerzbank said Thursday in a note to clients. Wheat prices jumped to the highest level in more than nine years, while corn futures also advanced. Oil surged more than 8%, breaking above $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, traded as high as $100.54 per barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded above $105. ""Though there have been no physical supply disruptions yet, there are serious concerns that Russia could move to restrict commodity exports in response to US sanctions,"" RBC said Thursday. ""With the notable exception of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has already been halted, the White House has gone to great lengths to convey that it will not target the Russian energy sector and exacerbate an already tight supply situation,"" the firm added. Natural gas futures jumped 4.6% to trade at $4.835 per million British thermal units. The move in Europe was far more extreme, with prices surging more than 30%. Russia supplies around one third of Europe's natural gas.

Here's how your Tesla could be affected by AT&T's 3G network shutdown | TESLARATI Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:09 AT&T will officially shut down its 3G network today, completing a phase-out of the near-obsolete connectivity as newer, high-speed options are now available. If you own a Model S vehicle built before June 2015, your car may be affected. AT&T planned to shut down its 3G network as LTE, 4G, and 5G networks offer customers faster speeds. 3G is simply no longer needed. However, customers of other companies who have used AT&T's 3G network are also affected. This, unfortunately, includes anyone who owns a pre-June 2015 build of the Model S, as its infotainment center needs to be upgraded to be compatible with the newer networks. In July, Teslarati reported that AT&T's 3G network shutdown would require a retrofit in any Model S built before June 2015. The retrofit is available for only $200, even though a vehicle affected could be nine years old by this time. Infotainment Upgrades for owners who drive pre-April 2018 versions of the Model S or Model X are eligible to purchase the MCU2 upgrade as well, but it's available for $2,000 plus tax unless Autopilot Computer 2.0 or 2.5 is installed. For vehicles equipping the Autopilot 2.0 or 2.5 computer, the upgrade is only $1,500. How to know if your Tesla Model S is affectedTesla encourages owners to check if their vehicles are affected. ''Your vehicle will be affected by AT&T's 3G network shutdown if it is a Model S vehicle built before June 2015 and has not been upgraded to an LTE-capable modem or purchased Infotainment Upgrade, as these vehicles were not produced with a 4G/LTE capable modem.'' ''You can also check your vehicle's cellular network by looking at the connectivity status bars/icon near the top of the touchscreen. If 'LTE' is displayed next to this icon at any time (may require stable cellular connectivity), your vehicle will not be affected by AT&T's 3G network shutdown,'' Tesla said. Owners can schedule the appointment by going to the Tesla Mobile App. Select 'Schedule Service' > 'Upgrades & Accessories' > 'LTE Upgrade.' The upgrade is needed because the Model S built before June 2015 uses a modem that is 3G compatible. New builds contain LTE-compatible modems that will operate with 4G and 5G networks. Without upgrading, owners will lose the ability to access the following features unless connected to Wi-Fi: Roadside assistance to unlock your vehicle remotelyCertain mobile app capabilities, including Summon, cabin pre-conditioning, vehicle location, remote unlock, etc.Certain Infotainment features, including navigation, maps, live traffic updates, up-to-date Supercharger availability and outage information, online music streaming, and onboard map updatesOver-the-air updatesAT&T told CNN Business in a statement earlier today, ''For nearly two years, we've proactively sent numerous communications via direct mail, bill messaging, emails and text messages to help customers transition to next-generation networks before 3G services end on February 22.'' AT&T has been provided free replacement phones to many users with a 3G device since 2020. 3G networks launched back in 2002 and were an integral part of the growth of cell phones and wireless communications. Eventually, faster speeds were needed and shutting down the 3G networks globally is part of a larger commitment to re-use 4G and 5G infrastructure, which is more efficient than 3G. Verizon and T-Mobile will also deactivate their 3G networks by the end of the year. I'd love to hear from you! If you have any comments, concerns, or questions, please email me at joey@teslarati.com.

JUST IN: US Homeland Sec. Director Warns Of Urgent CYBERATTACK Threat By Russia Against Power Plants, Banks, Communications, GPS Navigation and Water Treatment Facilities Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 13:33 Biden responded to Russia's incursion into Eastern Ukraine that is happening right now by placing sanctions on the country that will undoubtedly affect gas prices in the US and costs on other items. Biden billed this as a necessary 'sacrifice' that Americans will have to make to stand up to Russia. This morning, Russia issued a warning after the United States imposed sanctions, warning that there would be a 'painful' response. According to Latvian intelligence reports, Russia launched a nationwide cyberattack against Ukraine and has already staged hundreds of tanks and heavy artillery in Eastern Ukraine. On the surface, sanctions seem like a safe option'--but are they? Sanctions don't always have the intended consequence.Will pushing Vladimir Putin's back against the wall by issuing sanctions against Russia work, or will it invite further escalation, including retaliation? It appears as though the US is preparing for the latter, as Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is warning of possible crippling cyberattacks on the United States of America by Russia. While Mayorkas is saying there are no specific threats, he is warning that we need to be prepared in the event of cyberattacks against our banks, communications, power plants, and water treatment facilities.

Advocaat: gijzelnemer Apple Store overleden | Het Parool Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 13:00 Gekleed in een camouflagepak hield A. een klant van de winkel urenlang onder schot. Beeld ANP Dat laat advocaat Jan-Kees van den Brink op verzoek van de moeder van Akkad weten aan Het Parool. ''Hij was niet meer aanspreekbaar en is inmiddels overleden,'' zegt Van den Brink. De raadsman stond Akkad in het verleden meermaals bij in strafzaken. Omdat Akkad niet bij kennis is geweest, heeft hij niet om een advocaat kunnen vragen. Van den Brink benadrukt dan ook dat hij namens de moeder van Akkad spreekt en niet namens zijn oud-clint. Gijzeling duurde 5 uur Abdel Rahman Akkad liep dinsdag aan het eind van de middag, gehuld in een camouflagepak waaraan explosieven bevestigd waren, met twee vuurwapens de Apple Store aan het Leidseplein in. Hij schoot tenminste vier keer op de politie die op de melding van een overval af kwam en zette vervolgens een 44-jarige Bulgaarse klant van de winkel een wapen op het hoofd. Wat volgde was een gijzeling die 5 uur duurde. Een enorme politiemacht en zwaarbewapende eenheden van onder andere de Dienst Speciale Intreventies (DSI) kwamen ter plekke om de situatie tot een goed einde te brengen. Ook waren er gesprekken met onderhandelaars van de politie. Aan het begin van de gijzeling zocht Akkad zelf contact met de politie. Hij eiste uiteindelijk 200 miljoen aan cryptovaluta. In het pand beleefden medewerkers en klanten van de Apple Store ondertussen hachelijke momenten. Vier mensen zaten in doodsangst verstopt in een kast. Op de bovenverdiepingen van het Hirschgebouw, waar de Apple Store op de begane grond zit, zaten nog ongeveer 65 slachtoffers urenlang vast tot de politie ze bevrijdde. Zwaargewond Omstreeks half elf 's avonds vroeg Akkad om water. Toen dat via een robot voor de deur werd bezorgd, kreeg de gegijzelde de opdracht het water te pakken, maar hij nam de benen. Akkad rende hem achterna, waarna een lid van een arrestatieteam vol gas gaf en hem hard aanreed. De gijzelnemer werd zwaargewond overgebracht naar het ziekenhuis en is tot zijn overlijden niet meer bij kennis geweest. ''Het belangrijkste is nu dat de moeder van Abdel Rahman de pers verzoekt om de familie met rust te laten,'' aldus Van Den Brink. Hier zou content moeten staan van bijv.

Chicago lifting mask and vaccine mandates on Feb. 28 but will keep masks in schools for now - Chicago Sun-Times Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 12:56 Chicago will lift its mask and proof-of-vaccine mandates next week, but Chicago Public School students, teachers and employees must keep their masks on '-- at least for the time being. Starting this coming Monday, patrons of restaurants, bars and gyms will be free to take their masks off and keep their vaccine cards in their wallets, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady announced at a City Hall news conference Tuesday. ''It's important for us to recognize this moment for what it is: a huge step forward in our effort to overcome COVID-19,'' Lightfoot said. ''We would not have been in a position '-- even a few weeks ago '-- to be making this kind of announcement today.'' But rather than risk yet another confrontation with the Chicago Teachers Union '-- and with vaccination rates varying dramatically between school communities '-- Lightfoot and CPS CEO Pedro Martinez said they will abide by the agreement struck with CTU that ended a dispute that canceled classes for five days last month. The safety agreement with the teachers union mandates masks in schools until August. ''We have made great progress in recent weeks against this virus, and we do not want to jeopardize that progress by moving too quickly,'' the district said in a statement released later Tuesday. ''We look forward to the day when we can be mask-optional at CPS, but we still need to get more students vaccinated across our District, and we still need to work with our public health and labor partners on the best way to preserve a safe in-person learning environment for all.'' The CTU said in a statement it was ''glad that CPS will continue to honor the safety agreement that our members sacrificed four days of pay [for] last month ... despite a right-wing legal attack to remove public health protections.'' Still, a lawsuit by CPS parents in Mount Greenwood against the mandate could impact the situation going forward. Mask mandates already have been removed in more than 150 school districts around the state after a judge blocked Gov. J.B. Pritzker's school mask requirement. Transit, health care will keep masksThe mayor noted that masks would continue to be required on public transit, in health care settings and in other congregate spaces, following federal mandates and CDC guidance. Lightfoot also urged understanding of individual decisions, something that has been in short supply in recent weeks during the raging controversy over masks that has divided the nation. ''Many residents may continue to wear masks in public spaces for a variety of reasons '--even if they are vaccinated or as more mandates and advisories fade. ... Also, some venues may continue to impose their own mitigation efforts to keep their clients and customers safe. That is their right. And we must respect it,'' Lightfoot said. Noting that she caught a mild case of COVID-19, Lightfoot said she intends to continue wearing a mask, particularly in restaurants where diners will soon have no idea whether other customers are vaccinated. ''I don't want to put myself at risk. ... That's my personal choice,'' Lightfoot said. Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia welcomed the mayor's decision to lift the mandates, keeping to the same statewide date set by Pritzker. ''We're going back to a sense of normalcy. That's what the general public wants to see. And if operators still want to impose mask mandates at their individual restaurants, they can. I think there might be a few,'' Toia said. Since Jan. 3, Chicago has required restaurant, bar and gym patrons to show proof of vaccination and a photo ID. Rudina Alihajdaraj, a hostess with Pequod's Pizza, inspects a COVID-19 vaccination card on Monday, Jan. 3, 2022, the first day that proof of vaccination mandate is required to eat inside at Chicago restaurants. Tyler LaRiviere/Sun-Times The requirement forced restaurants and bars already struggling with a shortage of staff to reassign some workers to check vaccination cards and IDs '-- or ask beleaguered wait staff to do it. Either way, it's been a burden that has occasionally resulted in confrontations between employees and customers, Toia said. ''It has been difficult. When you get a party of five or six that comes in, three or four might have the vaccine and a couple don't. Then, a party of five leaves because all five of 'em do not have the vaccine. That's tough. It's been a tough January and February for restaurant operators,'' he said. The mayor acknowledged that the mask and proof of vaccine mandates have been a ''challenge to enforce and a challenge to the bottom lines'' of restaurants. The move to lift the mandates comes after the bottom dropped out on the Omicron surge. As of Tuesday, Chicago's average daily case rate was 283 '-- down 37% from the 452 cases-a-day just one week ago. Hospitalizations were down 29% '-- to a daily average of 27. Deaths were down 51 % over the last week '-- from 9.7 last week to 4.7. The city's positivity rate was 1.5%. That's down from 2% a week ago. Even by the mayor's own standards for lifting mitigations, Chicago now passes the test with flying colors. Lightfoot was asked Tuesday whether the declaration of independence from masks and proof-of-vaccine mandates marks an end to a pandemic that has dragged on for two years. ''From your lips to God's ears,'' she replied. ''We really don't know.''

City leaders go mute as a scandal involving heroin, a CPD chief's car, a confidential police informant, and the city's police oversight agency brews - CWB Chicago Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 12:56 A scandal is brewing, and city officials appear to be battening down the hatches. Tuesday, three city offices involved in the story, the mayor, the police department, and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) all failed to respond to questions about it. Let's get you up to speed quickly. Last week, news broke that a man with a long list of felony drug convictions was charged with felony heroin distribution after he allegedly threw $6,300 worth of heroin from a Lexus owned by CPD's chief of internal affairs, Yolanda Talley. Talley was not in the car. Her niece was driving it at the time. When cops pulled the Lexus over, the niece told them, ''My auntie's probably your boss,'' the Sun-Times reported last night. The man who allegedly threw the heroin from the car's passenger seat is in a relationship with Talley's niece, according to the report. CWB reported exclusively on Monday that the man who allegedly threw the heroin from the car, Kenneth Miles, is identified in public records as the confidential police source whose bad information led to the wrongful raid of Anjanette Young's home in February 2019. The city cut a $2.9 million settlement check to end litigation with Young just two months ago. Our story also revealed that COPA's public report about the botched raid exposed Miles as the informant by giving the date, time, and police district where the ''John Doe'' informant who sparked the Young raid had been arrested. Arrest records, including dates, times, and locations, are public information. Miles' CPD arrest report from that date includes a police supervisor's note that he wanted to ''John Doe'' a search warrant hours before cops raided Young's home, we reported. Asked to confirm Miles' involvement in the Young search warrant, a CPD spokesperson on Monday said, ''To ensure the safety of all involved and to maintain the integrity of the ongoing investigation, CPD cannot and will not comment on whether someone is or is not a confidential source.'' The department has refused to answer any questions about the heroin arrest involving Talley's car, saying the matter is under investigation by the city's inspector general. A problematic reportCOPA's exposure of a confidential police source is troubling. Also troubling is this: CWB found other information in COPA's report that exposed other private citizens' personal details. One of those additional exposures is particularly egregious. We shared that specific example with COPA and the office of Mayor Lori Lightfoot in separate sets of emailed questions on Tuesday morning. We sent a third set of questions to the Chicago Police Department. Neither the mayor's office, COPA, nor CPD responded to our inquiries. Unanswered questionsWe sent the following questions to CPD's top spokespersons, Don Terry and Tom Ahern, on Tuesday morning. They did not reply. What is Chief Talley's current position and status with the Chicago Police Department?If she is still in position as chief of internal affairs: Why is it appropriate for the person in charge of internal investigations to remain in place while under investigation?Did COPA ask CPD to review the public Anjanette Young report before release to ensure that no compromising information was included? If so, who at CPD handled that review?In a Tuesday morning email to Ephraim Eaddy, COPA's public information officer, we provided examples of compromising information within the agency's Anjanette Young report along with the following questions. Our inquiry noted that we were not asking COPA to confirm our previous reporting. The questions stand on their own. He did not reply. Who is responsible for preparing COPA reports for public release (redacting sensitive information, etc)? What is their training? Do they have law enforcement experience? Which COPA supervisors, managers, and executives signed off on the content of the publicly-released Anjanette Young report?Did COPA ask CPD to review the public Anjanette Young report before release to ensure that no compromising information was included? If not, why not? If so, who at CPD handled that review?Will COPA conduct a review of its report review system to ensure that sensitive information is not released to the public? Who will handle the review? What is the timetable for completion? Will a public report of findings be available? When? If no review will be conducted, why not?Also on Tuesday morning, we sent examples of COPA's compromised information and the following questions to Cesar Rodriguez, the mayor's press secretary. Again, we noted that we were not asking the mayor's office to confirm CWB's reporting in any way. He did not reply. Did the mayor read COPA's public report before it was released?Will the mayor order an investigation and/or review of COPA's report review system to ensure that sensitive information is not released to the public? Who will handle that? What is the timetable for completion? Goals? If no such order will be made, why not?Why is it appropriate for the head of CPD internal affairs to remain in position while OIG is investigating her and the circumstances of the heroin arrest involving her vehicle?Did the city consider bringing in a non-city agency to handle the investigation of the arrest involving Talley's vehicle? If not, why not? If so, wh",https://www.noagendashow.net/listen/1428
