When Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, many Russian-speaking Jews in the U.S. started organizing direct humanitarian aid to Ukrainians. I talk with one of those Jews, 23-year-old Alice Chudnovsky, about her fundraising for humanitarian and evacuation efforts in the city of Kharkiv.

The news only came out after this episode was fully recorded. Miracle -- but the attack is still a war crime. Say hello!

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

4,e59c709f-ab21-4081-9930-be4e1703319a,['Doug Drinkwater'],,"The IT Ukraine Association represents about 100 leading companies with 75,000 professional IT members between them in the country, which has become a near-shore haven for Western companies seeking skilled personnel, particularly relating to software development and engineering.

Ukraine’s Office of Foreign Affairs says that more than 100 of the Fortune 500 outsource to the country, with IT export volume increasing 36% to US$6.8 billion in 2021, up from US$5 billion in 2020 and US$4.2 billion in 2019, according to the IT Ukraine Association. Separate studies have found that the IT industry grew from 0.06% of GDP in 2013 to 3.3% in 2018, with talented IT professionals emerging through universities and government schemes, such as the IT Creative Fund.

Despite such progress, the IT Ukraine Association’s executive director, Konstantin Vasyuk, is speaking to journalists online in a dimly-lit home from an undisclosed location, with air raid sirens audible in the background.

As Russian military forces advance from the south and east of the country, and with the port town of Mariupol under a constant siege, he’s worried about his safety, but seemingly not as much as his broadband connection. He spoke to Computerworld while his children were doing schoolwork online.

[ Keep up on the latest thought leadership, insights, how-to, and analysis on IT through Computerworld’s newsletters. ]

Acting as a conduit to Ukrainian ICT businesses and their employees, Vasyuk says that the organisation and its members have remained resilient through a month of war. The Ukrainian ICT industry donated US$24 million to the army and humanitarian aid within the first 10 days of war, and he says most organisations can still deliver on IT projects, even as Ukraine-based employees joined the army or volunteered to bolster the country’s cybersecurity defences.

The trade association’s own research reveals that about 70% of IT professionals are still working in “safe” regions of Ukraine, with about 16% of the IT workforce, many of them women, stationed abroad. About 2% of IT professionals have joined the armed forces, while 5% have volunteered to assist with cybersecurity efforts and the support of critical national infrastructure. “Maybe it will sound like a cliché, but it's that type of responsibility, reliability, and determination that drives us now, to continue working,” said Vasyuk, in an interview organized by TechlinkUkraine.

Secure networks and banking in Ukraine

Internet access remains relatively unaffected by the Russian invasion so far, Vasyuk said. Fiber-optic networks are “stable,” while Elon Musk’s Starlink satellites connections are available on reserve channels, following a plea for help on Twitter from the country’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov.

The ongoing disruption in regions such as Mariupol, Kharkiv, and Kherson has hit the local economy, but Vasyuk maintains that core banking and payment services remain relatively unaffected. “Some companies have had problems with the access to their accounts, but it's a very small percentage,” he said, adding that Russian sanctions have hit some smaller businesses in regions under Russian military control. (The Donbas regions of Luhansk and Donetsk have been under separatist Russian control since 2014, so are not covered by his assessment.)

Rozdoum CEO’s story of defiance

Since the onset of war on February 24, tech companies have looked to leave Ukraine. EPAM, one of the country’s biggest exporters, software development, and consultancy providers, reacted by supporting staff, halting services to Russia-based customers, and spending US$100 million on humanitarian aid. The company has also implemented BI dashboards to track employee safety, rented buses and developed a ridesharing app to help people cross borders, and helped those displaced by the war to find accommodation.

Andrey Dekhtyar is the CEO of Rozdoum, a custom application developer and Atlassian partner with offices in Kharkiv, Ukraine, and Jersey City, New Jersey. His family has relocated to Europe and safer parts of Ukraine, but he returned to Kharkiv. He sees it as his “moral obligation. It's my country, my home and I contribute in the way I can,” he said, during a 20-minute interview in which continuous shelling from Russian forces could be heard in the background.

He’s been busy, too, from influencing partners like Atlassian and Dell to stop business operations in Russia to buying second-hand cars out of his own pocket and giving them to the military. The day-to-day work continues, with no interruption of service, and he has actively encouraged staff to volunteer on the “cyber frontline” when they have the time.

Business continuity planning has largely been in place since the start of the Russian conflict in 2014, and accelerated through COVID-19, with colleagues moved from workstations to laptops and mobile devices, and with offices temporarily closed. “We still have 100% of our clients. None of them terminated their contracts,” he said, adding that some prospective clients even paid ahead of time, to support the organization’s finances.

How global organizations and leaders can help Ukraine

Vasyuk was keen to emphasize that the country’s IT industry remains in strong shape. The group’s research shows that 85% of IT professionals are still working, with only about 5% of local ICT projects cancelled or postponed. Most clients, he said, understand the situation and have managed to mitigate risks through business continuity plans, to the point where “there are no major changes [clients] can feel or see.”

Vasyuk said that most Ukrainian technology firms have a diversified landscape of partners inside and outside the country on whom they can rely in the event of further disruption.

He encouraged new and existing clients to continue working with Ukrainian technology businesses, not only because they can continue to deliver effectively and affordably, but because the investment will prop up the economy and feed humanitarian aid.

It’s a theme that struck a chord when Computerworld spoke to Dekhtyar. “The more money we can get, the more services we can provide. … That will help our economy to survive. It seems like the war is being transported from the short war into the long war … so it’s more and more going to be a war of economics.”

Dekhtyar also said that Ukraine’s industrial sector has been “lost or damaged” due to the shelling in the east of the country, so this places greater focus on an ICT industry “that can work and is working.”

Vasyuk, meanwhile, senses an opportunity for local tech firms to pick up work following Russian sanctions and the reported brain drain of Russian talent leaving the country. “It gives a chance to Ukrainian companies to have additional contracts from those companies who closed relations with Russian IT providers,” he says, suggesting that US-based companies are seeking recommendations for service providers in the region.

Dekhtyar said global and European IT-based leaders can help by pressuring local politicians to stop doing business in Russia and relocating staff, but was keen to emphasize that such support will have limited impact if employees’ taxes don’t return to the local Ukrainian economy.

Ultimately, both technology leaders are adamant that the country will prevail, propelled by its robust and resilient IT industry. “We want foreigners to know that even though Ukraine is going through difficult times, that doesn't mean that Ukrainians should let their hands down and just sit it out,” Vasyuk said.

The IT Ukraine Association is looking to collaborate with partners on a jobs platform for displaced Ukrainians and can be contacted through its LinkedIn page.

From the war drums and bugles of medieval warfare to the medley of air-raid sirens, the shrill, screaming shells, the deafening blasts of bombs, the crash of falling edifices, the ominous thunder of approaching enemy aircraft that make up the music of modern war, each note is an aural signifier of all that ails civilization. But in the course of history, war has spurned the creation of an equally fierce, audible music: the music of resistance. Russia’s bloodfest in Ukraine has not been an exception. Among the many haunting images that make up the visual register of the Ukraine war are the photographs and footages of impromptu concerts that an embattled, patriotic people have organized against insurmountable odds. Bombed-out Kharkiv’s ‘Concert in between explosions’ saw musicians perform compositions of Johann Sebastian Bach and Antonin Dvorak along with Ukrainian folk songs. Several other contemporary theatres of conflict have also witnessed similar, unbelievable acts of individual and collective courage. Ayham al-Ahmad caught the world’s attention when he played the piano in Yarmouk in a Syria that had been reduced to rubble. Then, there was the Cellist of Sarajevo: Vedran Smailovic would turn up unfailingly every evening in a ruined square and play Albinoni to commemorate those who had fallen victim to the fire that was raging around him in Sarajevo.

Unsurprisingly, a number of possibilities have been cited to explain these interludes of harmony among horror. Music, especially classical music, transcends the narrow boundaries of entertainment. It is a code for the most enduring, civilizing values: freedom, liberty, humanity et al find expression in these lilting, uplifting concertos. As with all ciphers, the messaging is layered. The argument that the preference for Bach, as opposed to, say, Tchaikovsky, is, in fact, a message from the people of Ukraine to Vladimir Putin that the country endorses an organic relationship with West Europe as opposed to an aggressive Russia in spite of a shared history cannot be dismissed. These concerts, among bloodied, torn cities, inside bomb shelters, amidst unprecedented paucity of the basic needs of sustenance, are also an expression of fortitude: that humanity, in spite of its fundamental flaws and follies, also retains the ability to rebuild from ruin, spot light in darkness, mobilize a sense of community in a fractured land.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/editorial-bach-versus-bombs-what-does-it-mean-when-classical-musicians-take-up-the-violin-in-ruined-kharkiv/cid/1858616
