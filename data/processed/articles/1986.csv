The official spoke on condition of anonymity to provide a battlefield update. The Russian forces are now nearly 40 miles outside of the capital.

But that has all begun to change this week, U.S. and European officials have indicated, with the still outmanned and outgunned Ukrainian forces beginning to go on the offensive to take back territory from Russian troops who have failed to take control of the skies and remain beset by logistical problems, trying to regroup.

Russian troops have been on the offensive in Ukraine for the better part of the monthlong war, making slow and grinding progress to occupy a handful of cities in the eastern and southern portions of the country.

The latest military push represents a remarkable turnaround for the Ukrainian military from the early days of war, when the capture of Kyiv by the numerically superior Russian forces seemed all but certain in the eyes of Western leaders and defense analysts.

But experts caution that Ukraine may have just a small window of opportunity to seize on this momentum. Russian troops could learn from their initial blunders and begin to camouflage tactical positions, forward lines, and command posts, as well as to fortify logistics hubs with berms and other earthworks.

“The Ukrainians, if they are going to mount any kind of large-scale offensives, are probably going to have to do it in the next few weeks before the Russians are able to fortify the ground they’ve taken,” said Mick Ryan, a recently retired two-star general in the Australian Army. “Otherwise the Russians will dig in and they’ll be very difficult to dig out.”

Other experts say the United States and its NATO allies need to step up the delivery of weapons and other military supplies to Ukraine quickly so they can retain their momentum.

“The Ukrainian military has performed way above expectations,” said William Taylor, a scholar at the U.S. Institute of Peace think tank and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. “But in order for them to continue, it’s going to require a lot of support from NATO and from the United States. And that needs to come now.”

So far, Ukraine has been most successful on the counteroffensive instead of mounting attacks from scratch, hitting Russian troops away from the front lines and at weak points, such as blowing up the lead vehicles of a 40-mile Russian military convoy that was aimed at the capital in the early days of the war and blowing up bridges to foil ground movements.

The intelligence arm of Britain’s Ministry of Defense assessed on Wednesday night that Ukrainian forces had probably retaken the towns of Makariv and Moschun to the east of the capital and could realistically encircle Russian forces in Bucha and Irpin directly to the west, according to a statement. Irpin, where Ukrainian forces blew up a bridge to stop Russia’s advance, has seen some of the heaviest fighting of the war so far.

Ukrainian troops have also begun to have military success in the south and east, where Russia’s monthlong offensive has seen more success. British defense intelligence officials assessed on Thursday that Ukraine launched strikes at a landing ship and ammunition storage depots in Russian-occupied Berdyansk, in ongoing efforts to disrupt Russia’s military supply chain and hurt morale. Ukraine has also repeatedly repulsed Russian forces advancing on Mykolaiv, near the port city of Odesa. U.S. defense officials also believe that the town of Izyum, southeast of Kharkiv, that was overtaken by Russia last week is also being contested.

“Against the odds, they have snarled up Russia’s invading army, inflicting defeat after defeat,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at a NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday. “The heroism of Ukraine has changed the geopolitics of Europe.”

U.S. defense officials and diplomats tracking the conflict describe Ukraine’s military gains as a surprise success story, given how many forces Russia had amassed on the country’s borders in the months leading up to the invasion.

They point to a combination of the Ukrainian military’s savvy tactics, the arms supplies and multiyear military training missions Western countries have sent to Ukraine, and Russia’s military blunders and ineptitude.

“There’s another big factor here: Ukraine’s fighting spirit,” added one U.S. diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak publicly. “They’ve shown us, and more importantly [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, that they’re not just going to keel over, that they are wholly unified in the fight against Russia.”

But Russian troops have begun making tweaks to their approach, despite officials and experts pointing out the seeming lack of an overall Russian command structure for the war—as well as the deaths of numerous senior Russian military figures on the front lines.

Yet some military analysts see the Russian tweaks as less of a strategic move and more of a face-saving measure, as the Russian military’s command structure has been decimated by the losses of top generals and colonels on the battlefield.

“You can’t get food, you can’t get ammo, and you have nobody really telling you what to do,” said Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and CIA paramilitary officer. “Why not just stop what you’re doing?”

Satellite imagery shared with Foreign Policy and others by the space technology company Maxar last week showed Russian forces using berms to protect and conceal armored units near Antonov Airport, located less than 20 miles from Kyiv, where Russia has sought to build an air bridge to attack the Ukrainian capital, as well as in the nearby towns of Zdvyzhivka and Berestyanka.

U.S. and European officials have also said Russia is considering plans to send in reinforcements: a motley force that could include conscripts, foreign fighters from Syria, and members of the paramilitary Wagner Group. Some Wagner Group members are already engaged in battle against Ukrainian troops in the Donbass region.

But officials and experts are not sure whether the introduction of new troops could further compound Russia’s command problems.

One Ukrainian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said that many of the Russian conscripts already sent into the fight were in their late teens and had little specialized combat training. Many of them thought they were being deployed for training exercises in western Russia and Belarus.

“As we see, their Army is bullshit,” the official said. Russia’s strategy is an effort “to try to beat us with [sheer] numbers of their troops,” the person said. “They’re trying to fight an ancient war, like in the 19th century. They don’t act like a modern army.”

Meanwhile, weapons have continued to flow to Ukraine from the West, with U.S. officials telling reporters that the first deliveries of a new $800 million weapons package announced by U.S. President Joe Biden is likely to begin landing in Europe in the coming hours.

The shipment will restock Ukraine’s supply of Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. A senior U.S. defense official said on Wednesday that the Western anti-air systems have prevented Russian pilots from lingering in Ukrainian airspace.

The British government said on Wednesday night it would provide 6,000 new defensive missiles to Ukraine and over $30 million in new military aid commitments. Washington has also begun consulting with NATO about providing anti-ship missiles to Ukraine, a senior U.S. administration official said on Thursday, a move aimed at helping Ukrainian forces repel Russian naval and amphibious assaults from the Black Sea.

But even as Ukraine’s military strength has earned Kyiv plaudits in Western capitals, the question of further military integration with the United States and Europe remains taboo.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has recently pressed Western countries to accept Ukraine as a member of NATO and the European Union, but that is unlikely to happen in the near term.

Zelensky has also criticized NATO for not doing more to aid Ukraine’s fight against Russia, while touting the effectiveness of his country’s military.

“Never, please, never tell us again that our army does not meet NATO standards,” he said in a televised address on Thursday. “We have shown what our standards are capable of.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/24/ukraine-russia-counterattack/

KYIV, Ukraine — A month into a war that began with widespread expectations of a quick Russian rout, Ukraine’s military is undertaking a counteroffensive that has altered the central dynamic of the fighting: The question is no longer how far Russian forces have advanced, but whether the Ukrainians are now pushing them back.

Ukraine has blown up parked Russian helicopters in the south, and on Thursday claimed to have destroyed a naval ship in the Sea of Azov. Its forces struck a Russian resupply convoy in the Northeast.

Western and Ukrainian officials also have claimed progress in fierce fighting around the capital, Kyiv.

The asserted gains in territory are hard to quantify, or verify. In at least one crucial battle in a suburb of Kyiv, where Russian troops had made their closest approach to the capital, brutal street fighting still raged on Thursday and it was not clear that Ukraine had regained any ground.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/world/ukraine-counteroffensive-russia-war.html

3,40507299-6b66-439b-a5f8-658ef5bb613e,['Jamie Dettmer'],,"Western defense officials say Ukraine has been employing agile insurgency tactics to disrupt Russia's invasion, and in the suburbs northwest and east of Kyiv, to push their adversaries back.



Hitting and ambushing Russian forces behind the contact lines with fast-moving units, often at night, has proven among its most effective field tactics and is adding to the logistical missteps the Russians still have not been able to overcome, military strategists say. They add that the tactics are also demoralizing Russian troops.



""They're doing a tremendous job,"" said Colonel John Barranco of the Atlantic Council, a New York-based think tank.

""The Ukrainians have developed a very competent military with good leadership at the lower level and they're motivated. And this is why, when I looked at the Russian forces deployed for the invasion, I thought, this doesn't seem like a well thought-out effort.""

Barranco, who oversaw the U.S. Marines' initial operations in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks and served two tours in Iraq, said Russia miscalculated the resilience and capability of Ukrainian ground forces and the determination the Ukrainians would show in defending their territory. He said when he analyzed Russian forces arrayed along Ukraine's borders in February, before the invasion, he discounted the likelihood of a full-scale offensive.



""It seemed like the Kremlin attack plan might have been written in 2014. The Ukrainians have spent eight years building up their military and training,"" he said. Barranco credited training the Ukrainians have received since 2014 by U.S. National Guard units from California and other states in small-unit tactics for some of Ukraine's battlefield successes.





In the past 48 hours, Russian forces have struggled to maintain offensive actions northwest and east of Kyiv and have lost ground, with Ukrainian ground forces reoccupying territory they had lost, according to the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces. Ukrainians say they have now managed to encircle the Russian-occupied towns of Bucha, Irpin and the village of Hostomel northwest of Kyiv.

Earlier this week, the Ukrainians retook the strategically located village of Makariv outside Kyiv. Much of the success rests with the Ukrainians targeting Russia's already challenged supply lines.



Britain's Defense Ministry said the Ukrainians will likely continue to target logistical assets in Russian-held areas, forcing the Russians to ""prioritise the defence of their supply chain and deprive them of much needed resupply.""



British defense officials also confirmed Friday that Ukraine has reoccupied towns east of Kyiv. ""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian Forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to re-occupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometers east of Kyiv,"" they said in a public intelligence update.



""In the south of Ukraine, Russian Forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west toward Odesa, with their progress being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance,"" they added.



Russian forces also appear to be preparing defensive positions around Kyiv, ready for a war of attrition. Earlier this week VOA reported that satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies, a space technology and earth-observation company, appeared to show Russians soldiers building protective dirt berms near the villages of Ozera, Zdvyzhivka and Berestyanka, northwest of Kyiv, and around Antonov Air Base.



The berms are likely being built to guard against Ukrainian counterattacks, Western officials said.



""The Ukrainians know their territory — they know their ground. They've thought about this for a long time, and they are outperforming the Russians at the small-unit level,"" Barranco told VOA.



He and other military analysts said the Ukrainians are using a variety of tactics to push the Russian forces onto the back foot.

Among them are setting up so-called kill boxes, or defined target areas, and then drawing their foes into them; unleashing highly focused and ferocious attacks on isolated Russian troops; creating fallback routes after ambushes as they set up a subsequent attack; and striking mechanized units when they are stalled.



Another advantage the Ukrainians are exploiting is competent leadership by noncommissioned officers (NCOs), the officials say, which is also consistent with U.S. military doctrine and training.



""The U.S. puts a lot of focus on building a professional, noncommissioned officer corps of corporals and sergeants who understand the big picture and are given the delegated authority to make decisions on the battlefield as they lead their units,"" Barranco said.



""Junior officers are also taught to work closely with professional NCOs. The Russian military has acknowledged they have a problem with poorly trained NCOs and have started an NCO academy because they realize they do not have good leadership at the lower levels,"" he added.

Mason Clark, Fredrick W. Kagan, and George Barros

March 25, 5:00 pm ET

The Russian General Staff issued a fictitious report on the first month of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on March 25 claiming Russia’s primary objective is to capture the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Sergei Rudskoi, first deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, gave a briefing to Russian press summing up the first month of the Russian invasion on March 25.[1] Rudskoi inaccurately claimed Russian forces have completed “the main tasks of the first stage of the operation,” falsely asserting that Russia has heavily degraded the Ukrainian military, enabling Russia to focus on the “main goal” of capturing Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

Rudskoi’s comments were likely aimed mainly at a domestic Russian audience and do not accurately or completely capture current Russian war aims and planned operations. Russia’s justification for the invasion of Ukraine from the outset was the fictitious threat Moscow claimed Ukrainian forces posed to the people in Russian-occupied Donbas. The Kremlin has reiterated this justification for the war frequently as part of efforts to explain the invasion to its people and build or sustain public support for Putin and the war. Rudskoi’s framing of the capture of the rest of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts as the “main goal” of the operation is in line with this ongoing information operation.

Rudskoi’s assertion that securing the unoccupied portions of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts was always the main objective of Russia’s invasion is false. The Kremlin’s initial campaign aimed to conduct airborne and mechanized operations to seize Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, and other major Ukrainian cities to force a change of government in Ukraine.[2] Rudskoi’s comments could indicate that Russia has scaled back its aims and would now be satisfied with controlling the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, but that reading is likely inaccurate. Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine have not stopped fighting and have not entirely stopped attempting to advance and seize more territory. They are also attacking and destroying Ukrainian towns and cities, conducting operations and committing war crimes that do not accord with the objectives Rudskoi claims Russia is pursuing.

Russia continues efforts to rebuild combat power and commit it to the fight to encircle and/or assault Kyiv and take Mariupol and other targets, despite repeated failures and setbacks and continuing Ukrainian counter-attacks. The Ukrainian General Staff reports that the Russian military is building “consolidated units,” likely comprised of individuals or small units drawn from a number of different battalions, brigades, and regiments, to replace combat losses and deploying them on the west bank of the Dnipro near the Chernobyl exclusion zone, among other locations. Russian forces continue their grinding and likely costly advance in Mariupol as well.

The absence of significant Russian offensive operations throughout most of Ukraine likely reflects the inability of the Russian military to generate sufficient combat power to attack rather than any decision in Moscow to change Russia’s war aims or concentrate on the east. Rudskoi’s comments are likely an attempt to gloss the Russian military’s failures for a domestic audience and focus attention on the only part of the theater in which Russian troops are making any progress at this point. The West should not over-read this obvious messaging embedded in a piece of propaganda that continued very few true statements.

Key Takeaways

The Russian General Staff is attempting to adjust the war’s narrative so make it appear that Russia is achieving its aims and choosing to restrict operations when in fact it is not achieving its objectives and is being forced to abandon large-scale offensive operations because of its own failures and losses as well as continuing skillful Ukrainian resistance.

Ukrainian forces claimed to kill the commander of Russia’s 49th Combined Arms Army, operating around Kherson.

Ukrainian counterattacks northwest of Kyiv made further minor progress in the past 24 hours.

Ukrainian forces additionally conducted a successful counterattack east of Kyiv in the past 24 hours, pushing Russian forces east from Brovary.

Russian attempts to encircle Chernihiv remain unsuccessful.

The military situation in northeastern Ukraine did not change in the past 24 hours.

Russian forces continue to take Mariupol street-by-street and have entered the city center.

Russian forces did not conduct any offensive operations around Kherson in the past 24 hours.





The Russian General Staff continued to downplay Russian casualties and issued likely false claims of damage inflicted on the Ukrainian military. Rudskoi claimed 1,351 Russian servicemen have been killed and 3,825 wounded since February 24. NATO estimates 7,000-15,000 Russian servicemen have been killed, and Kremlin-affiliated outlet Komsomolskaya Pravda posted and quickly deleted an article on March 22 citing the Russian Defense Ministry that 9,861 Russian soldiers have been killed and 16,153 have been wounded.[3]

Rudskoi falsely claimed Ukraine’s air force and air defenses ""are almost completely destroyed” and its navy “ceased to exist.” Russian forces have failed to secure air superiority, with the Ukrainian General Staff reporting on March 25 that Ukrainian air defenses destroyed one plane, one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and four cruise missiles in the past 24 hours; the Ukrainian air force remains active.[4] Rudskoi additionally claimed that all Ukrainian units have suffered significant losses, including 65.7% of tanks and armored vehicles, 42.8% of field artillery guns and mortars, 30.5% of multiple launch rocket systems, and 82% of S-300 and Buk-M1 anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as three-quarters of Ukrainian aircraft, half their helicopters, and 35 of Ukraine‘s 36 TB2 drones. These figures are likely falsified and inaccurate.

Rudskoi claimed that Western states are only supplying Ukraine with weapons to prolong the conflict with Russia, not to support Kyiv. Rudskoi additionally claimed the number of “foreign mercenaries” in Ukraine peaked at 6,600 but has fallen due to desertion. Rudskoi falsely and preposterously claimed Russian forces do not strike civilian infrastructure in Ukraine and blamed all destruction on Ukrainian “nationalists.” He also falsely claimed that Russia opens daily humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians and falsely claimed Ukraine has not opened a single corridor.

Russia continues to rush forces to Ukraine to replace high combat losses, including the commander of the 49th Combined Arms Army. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at noon local time on March 25 that Ukrainian forces killed Lieutenant General Yakov Rezantsev, commander of the 49th Combined Arms Army (operating around Kherson), though ISW cannot independently confirm this claim.[5] The Ukrainian General Staff stated on March 25 that Russia is deploying “consolidated units”—likely referring to BTGs formed from larger units that suffered combat losses earlier in the war—from the 37th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (36th CAA, EMD), 5th Separate Tank Brigade (36th CAA, EMD), 38th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (35th CAA EMD), and 40th Naval Infantry Brigade (Pacific Fleet) to Belarus.[6] The Ukrainian General Staff additionally reported on March 24 that Russia is withdrawing unspecified units from Ukraine after sustaining personnel losses over 50 percent.[7]

We do not report in detail on the deliberate Russian targeting of civilian infrastructure and attacks on unarmed civilians, which are war crimes, because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv; Supporting effort 1a—Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances northward and westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis are aimed at encircling the city from the northwest, west, and east.

Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro

Ukrainian counterattacks northwest of Kyiv made small gains in Irpin on March 25, confirmed by videos of Ukrainian troops operating in previously Russian-controlled areas of the town.[8] Local civil authorities reported heavy fighting ongoing in Irpin, Hostomel, and Makariv on March 25.[9] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces northwest of Kyiv did not make any advances on March 25 and were limited to shelling Ukrainian positions.[10] The General Staff additionally reported on March 25 that unspecified Russian Eastern Military District forces established a field camp in the Chernobyl region.[11]

Subordinate supporting effort—Chernihiv and Sumy axis

Ukrainian forces conducted a successful counterattack east of Kyiv on March 24, recapturing Luk’yanivka (40km east of Brovary) and several other small towns.[12] Ukrainian forces claimed to have destroyed nine Russian APCs and two tanks and killed 40 troops.[13] Local social media users confirmed Ukrainian forces retook the town on March 24 and depicted several destroyed and abandoned Russian vehicles.[14] Ukrainian media reported the Ukrainian counterattack pushed Russian forces back 25km on March 24.[15] The Ukrainian Armed Forces and several Ukrainian media outlets reported Ukrainian forces continued the counterattack on March 25, but ISW cannot independently confirm any further Ukrainian gains on March 25.[16] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces near Brovary went over to the defensive as of noon local time on March 25 in response to the Ukrainian counterattacks.[17]

Ukrainian forces repelled Russian attacks on Chernihiv city as of noon local time on March 25.[18] The Ukrainian General Staff reported ongoing Russian efforts to encircle Chernihiv continue to be unsuccessful.[19] The General Staff additionally reported Russian forces are distributing propaganda leaflets around Chernihiv to “decrease resistance from the civil population,” but ISW cannot verify the content or location of these leaflets.[20]

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv:

The military situation in northeastern Ukraine did not change in the past 24 hours. Russian forces continued to shell Kharkiv but did not conduct any ground attacks in the past 24 hours and are unlikely to resume efforts to direct assault the city in the coming weeks.[21] Civilian authorities in Kharkiv stated Russian forces continued to shell humanitarian aid distribution points and civilian infrastructure on March 24-25.[22] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian attack toward Kamyanka (south of Izyum) as of noon local time on March 25.[23] Russian forces likely intend to encircle Izyum after failing to take the city through direct assault but are unable to successfully break through Ukrainian defenders. Russian forces did not conduct any offensive operations around Sumy in the last 24 hours.[24]

Supporting Effort #1a—Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts:

Russian forces paused their ground operations in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts in the past 24 hours and regrouped their forces.[25]

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol:

Russian forces continue to take Mariupol street-by-street, with several social media users depicting Russian troops entering downtown Mariupol.[26] Chechen forces claimed to have captured the entire left (eastern) bank of Mariupol on March 24.[27] The Mariupol City Council additionally reported Russia’s ruling United Russia party opened an office in occupied Mariupol, framed as a ”humanitarian headquarters,” to distribute pro-Russian news.[28] Russian forces will likely fully reduce the Mariupol pocket and capture the city in the coming weeks.

Click here to expand the map below.

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and advances northward and westwards:

Russian forces did not conduct any offensive operations in the southern direction in the past 24 hours. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces paused to restore combat capabilities and that up to five Russian BTGs “moved to the defense in the Zaporizhya direction,” but did not specify which bank of the Dnipro River these Russian forces are on.[29]

The Ukrainian General Staff additionally reported that Ukrainian forces sank the alligator-class landing ship Saratov and damaged the Caesar Kuniko and Novocherkassk landing ships in Berdyansk on March 24.[30] Initial reports incorrectly stated that Ukrainian forces sank the Orsk and damaged or sank one other Russian vessel.[31]

Immediate items to watch

Russian forces will likely capture Mariupol or force the city to capitulate within the coming weeks and have entered the city center;

Russia will expand its air, missile, and artillery bombardments of Ukrainian cities;

Ukrainian officials suggest that Ukrainian forces may launch a larger counterattack in western Kyiv Oblast in the coming days;

The continued involvement of the Black Sea Fleet in the Battle of Mariupol reduces the likelihood of an amphibious landing near Odesa, Russian naval shelling of Odesa in recent days notwithstanding.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is now well into its second month, but President Vladimir Putin’s troops have failed to make significant military progress in the country.

Having failed to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and topple the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Kremlin’s forces are now set to focus their efforts on the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine - an area that includes the cities of Donetsk, Luhansk and Mariupol.

So, how big is Ukraine’s army - and how does it compare to Russia’s military?

Fighting has been concentrated in the North, South and East of Ukraine (graphic: Mark Hall)

How big is Ukraine’s army?

According to the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS), Ukraine had 196,600 active military personnel when the invasion began on 24 February.

This split into:

125,600 ground troops

35,000 air personnel

15,000 naval troops

Another 900,000 reservists

These numbers have been bolstered as men aged between 18 and 60 have been conscripted and other civilians have volunteered to bear arms.

The country also has paramilitary groups fighting Russia, such as the controversial far-right Azov Battalion which reported on Tuesday (12 April) that it has been subjected to a chemical weapons attack in Mariupol.

These reports have not been officially confirmed.

The latest official estimate from Ukraine (from 12 March) is that it’s lost 1,300 soldiers.

The Russian defence ministry put Ukraine’s troop losses at 14,000 killed and 16,000 wounded as of 25 March.

Russia also says it has downed 99 Ukrainian aircraft, 1,194 tanks and armoured vehicles, and 443 artillery guns since the invasion began, according to the Interfax news agency.

None of these claims have been independently verified.

Most of Ukraine’s firepower is land-based, with the country boasting more than 2,000 tanks, 1,960 artillery pieces and 2,870 armoured vehicles at the time of Russia’s invasion.

Troops also have around 400 surface-to-air missile launchers that could take out Russian aircraft and access to Nato lethal aid, including 4,000 anti-tank weapons donated by the UK and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles from Germany.

The UK has provided a further 6,000 missiles, 120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems, as well as £25 million in backing to the Ukrainian military in recent weeks, with Boris Johnson traveling Kyiv for face-to-face talks with President Zelensky on 9 April.

At a NATO summit on 24 March, US President Joe Biden revealed the US was sending an $800 million arms package to Ukraine.

Ukraine’s air power consists of 146 attack aircraft and 42 attack helicopters.

Ukraine’s navy contains just two warships.

It remains the only country in the world to have given up its nuclear weapons, meaning it has no deterrent to threaten Russia with.

Given the country has been fighting so-called Russian backed separatists in the East of the country since 2014, its armed forces are well-versed in combat.

However, with a defence budget of between $2bn to $5bn, it does not boast the capabilities of its powerful neighbour.

How big is Russia’s army?

Russia’s military vastly outguns Ukraine’s, with a budget of between $40bn to $65bn.

These are its capabilities:

900,000 active military personnel across land, sea and air

280,000 soldiers

165,000 air personnel

150,000 naval troops

Around two million reservists.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4, Professor Michael Clarke - a security expert and former director of the Royal United Services Institute - estimated 40% of the active Russian army consists of conscripts.

Vladimir Putin previously denied conscripts were fighting in Ukraine, but his defence ministry has since admitted some have played a role in the invasion.

Russian men between the ages of 18 and 27-years-old have to serve for a 12-month period every year but are not supposed to see frontline action under Russian law.

A new draft took place on Friday (1 April).

The number of troops Russia had in and around Ukraine at the time of the invasion was estimated to be 190,000, as well as several hundred mercenaries from the Wagner Group.

It is thought Russia has called up more troops from Chechnya, Eastern Russia and Syria in recent weeks to further bolster its force - although the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) believes it is struggling to find more troops.

Having retreated from the Kyiv region in early April, a western official has said they now believe Russia is aiming to “double or perhaps treble” the number of troops it has in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine - although it’s believed this redeployment could take “some considerable time”.

Satellite images released on 10 April by Maxar Technologies and shared by CNN have already shown an eight-mile long military convoy moving south through the east Ukraine town of Velkyi Burluk.

Meanwhile, western intelligence assessments seen by Politico have shown Russia is moving dozens of military aircraft close to its border with Ukraine, including 30 Su-27 fighter jets.

These same assessments have found Russia is transporting military hardware initially targeted at Kyiv by train back through Belarus towards the eastern front.

Ukraine claims to have killed around 19,600 Russian personnel (more than 10% of the initial invasion force).

An unnamed NATO official quoted in the Wall Street Journal claims 40,000 Russian troops have either been killed, wounded, or have gone missing - more than a fifth of its fighting force.

Western leaders believe Russian losses sit between 7,000 and 15,000 troops.

Russia has only officially admitted to losing 1,351 soldiers - a figure given on 25 March.

It’s impossible to independently verify these claims,

Casualties are believed to include seven high-ranking Russian generals - potentially a third of Russia’s senior military leadership in Ukraine.

It’s thought they have been forced to move into more advanced positions due to a breakdown in communications with frontline troops and to bolster reported low morale among Russian troops, putting them at greater risk of being killed.

Russia’s land-based capabilities include more than 13,000 tanks, just under 6,000 artillery pieces and close to 20,000 armoured vehicles - although not all of this firepower is being thrown at Ukraine.

Ukraine claims to have destroyed 732 tanks and 349 artillery pieces.

Russia’s main advantage is its long-range weaponry, with the country possessing more than 500 land-based ballistic missile launchers.

It claims to have used air-launched Kinzhal hypersonic missiles for the first time - something US President Joe Biden confirmed on 21 March.

But the UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update that the weapon is still “developmental” and that its use was “highly likely intended to detract from a lack of progress in Russia’s ground campaign”.

Russia has used missiles to hit sites across Ukraine, including in the city of Lviv which is close to the border with NATO member Poland.

As well as key infrastructure, projectiles and artillery shells have also hit civilian areas, including flat blocks and railway stations.

When it comes to aircraft, the country has 1,328 attack planes and more than 470 attack helicopters.

Ukraine claims to have downed or captured 157 aircraft and 140 helicopters.

At sea, its 74 warships and 51 submarines dwarf Ukraine’s tiny fleet - although Ukraine says it has still been able to destroy seven Russian vessels.

Russia has had plenty of battlefield experience over the last decade as a result of its involvement in Syria’s civil war, where it has propped up the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

It has also sent forces to Libya and Kazakhstan.

However, this experience appears to have counted for little in Ukraine given the army has struggled with widely reported logistical issues and shoddy lines of communication.

Professor Michael Clarke told the BBC there is also “deep corruption” within the Russian ranks and said the fact that most of the army believed it was on exercise in the run up to the invasion meant it was not battle ready.

“When they’re on exercise, they agree to all sorts of things that aren’t really true - they tick the boxes for maintenance that [isn’t] really there and they sell their equipment because they’re paid so little. And so the forces that have gone over the border, actually, are extremely unprepared,” he said.

Russia’s biggest threat to Ukraine and the rest of the world is its stockpile of nuclear weapons, the mere existence of which acts as a deterrence to directly engaging in warfare with the country.

Vladimir Putin heightened the alert level for Russia’s nuclear forces at the beginning of March.

How big are the UK’s armed forces?

According to the latest publicly available assessment by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the UK’s full-time armed forces consist of more than 159,000 personnel.

This figure includes 76,300 ground soldiers, 29,960 air personnel and 29,136 naval troops.

Some of these troops are currently on deployment with Nato in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states amid fears Russia could be planning to invade other neighbours and former USSR states.

The UK actually has a target to reduce its land-based forces to 72,500 by 2025, meaning it would have 30,000 fewer troops than it did in 2010

At present, it has more than 32,000 reservists.

How big is the US army?

Few countries can match the might or technology of the US military machine.

According to the latest estimates from 2020, the country spends north of $700bn annually on its armed forces.

In 2020, this was 37% of the entire global defence budget.

There are believed to be more than one million active ground troops, more than 300,000 naval personnel and over 300,000 air troops.

How big is the NATO army?

The defence organisation Nato has around 3.5 million active and reserve personnel it can call upon should one of its members be attacked.

Ukraine has “probably” reclaimed Makariv, a small suburb 37 miles northwest of Kyiv considered a “gateway” to the capital, the MoD said in its latest intelligence update.

There is now a “realistic opportunity” that Ukrainian forces may also be able to encircle Russian units in Bucha and Irpin, neighbouring towns just north of Kyiv, the MoD said.

Nick Reynolds, a research analyst at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), warned that it would take “some time and heavy combat” to completely repel Russian forces from Kyiv’s suburbs.

However, he added that Russia could lose its foothold on the outskirts of Kyiv if encircled, “given the logistics and morale problems there”.

Russia has so far failed in its number one priority of storming Kyiv and removing the government, with normal life still persisting in some parts of the capital.

Missiles have hit buildings in the city in recent days, including a warehouse in the suburbs this morning, but have not yet inflicted any major damage on civilians.

Despite reports that Russian mercenaries are currently stalking the city centre to hunt down President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian leader was emboldened to take to the streets of Kyiv on Wednesday night unarmed and unguarded to deliver an address to the world in English.

The MoD said it was likely that Russia has suffered heavy losses in the face of a fierce Ukrainian resistance, with President Vladimir Putin’s troops already grappling with “considerable supply and morale issues”.

“Russian forces have almost certainly suffered thousands of casualties during their invasion of Ukraine,” it said.

While Russia has not officially updated its casualty figures since claiming earlier this month that 498 servicemen had been killed, Western sources believe the number could now be as high as 15,000.

It follows reports that large numbers of Russian troops have begun deserting their posts in the face of tough battle conditions, including frostbite and ongoing fuel, ammunition and food shortages.

Radio chatter between Russian forces in the battlefield revealed a bleak picture of poor morale and communications failures, the New York Times reported.

The MoD added that Russia may now have to draw from its “reservist and conscript manpower, as well as private military companies and foreign mercenaries, to replace these considerable losses”.

“It is unclear how these groups will integrate into the Russian ground forces in Ukraine and the impact this will have on combat effectiveness,” the briefing added.

British intelligence sources said on Thursday that successful counterattacks by Ukrainian troops would “disrupt the ability of Russian forces to reorganise and resume their own offensive towards Kyiv”.

The US Pentagon said that there were signs that Ukraine was “going a bit more on the offensive” for the first time since the start of the invasion.

A spokesperson for the US defence ministry said a “nimble” Ukrainian defence had begun to repel forces in the southern port of Kherson, which became the first major city to fall to Russian troops earlier this month.

Kherson Mayor Ihor Kolykhayev said this afternoon that authorities in the city had hung a large Ukrainian flag on the outside of the council building. The Kremlin’s grip on the city is understood to be waning, with protests erupting on Kherson’s streets in recent days.

Ukraine also claimed it had destroyed a Russian landing ship in the Sea of Azov near the port city of Berdyansk. The country’s navy released photos and videos this morning of fire and thick smoke coming from the port area.

There are fears that President Putin could turn to increasingly brutal attacks as the invasion enters its second month with little material progress for the Kremlin. President Zelensky on Thursday accused Russia of deploying phosphorus weapons in his country.

“This morning, by the way, phosphorus bombs were used. Adults were killed again and children were killed again,” he told Nato representatives via videolink. The use of such weapons against civilians is prohibited under the Geneva Convention.

Nato announced that it was doubling its military presence in the countries on its eastern flank near Ukraine, adding that it would help President Zelensky prepare for possible chemical, biological and even nuclear threats from Russia.

Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato Secretary General, said on Thursday there were signs the Kremlin could be preparing the ground for an attack by accusing the West of atrocities.

“We have seen before that this way of accusing others is actually a way to try to get a pretext to do the same themselves,” he said. “Any use of chemical weapons will totally change the nature of the conflict with wider consequences. This is a dangerous situation.”

The White House has also assembled a team of national security officials to sketch out scenarios of how the US will respond if President Putin unleashes chemical, biological and nuclear warfare, the New York Times reported.

The UK’s response to increasing Russian violence has remained rather more muted, despite the Kremlin accusing Boris Johnson on Thursday of being the most “anti-Russian” leader in the west.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss unveiled a raft of new sanctions targeting Russian oligarchs, banks and defence companies on Thursday morning, as she insisted that Britain will focus on ramping up economic pressure on Russia.
