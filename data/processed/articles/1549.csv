11:53 A.M. CET

MODERATOR: Well, good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining the White House background call on the President’s trip to Europe. As a reminder of the ground rules, this call will be on background, attributable to “senior administration officials.”

For your awareness but not for your reporting, the three officials joining us on our call today are [senior administration officials].

We will have two sections of the call today. The first will be a recap of the President’s time at NATO, which will be embargoed until the call concludes. The second section, which previews the G7 and EU meetings, will be embargoed until this afternoon at 2:15 p.m. Central European Time, or 9:15 a.m. Eastern Time.

With that, I’ll turn it over to our first speaker, [senior administration official], for the first section of the call.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks. And good morning, almost good afternoon, to everyone. I just stepped out of the listening room where I have been for the last hour or so, and I’m happy to share a little bit of color from what’s been happening in the meeting.

So, Secretary General Stoltenberg opened the meeting. I’m sure all of you saw his open remarks, which were open to press. Then the leaders went into a closed session.



As I think everyone is tracking, President Zelenskyy was beamed in via video link from Ukraine to address the group. He spoke very eloquently, as he has to a number of national parliaments in recent weeks, with a message very much focused on the efforts of the Ukrainian military and people to defend their country, to defend their citizens, and also to defend our shared democratic values.

He repeated his requests for continued and increased Western security assistance. But notably, there was not a request for a no-fly zone. There was also not a request for NATO membership in his remarks.

Following his intervention, he departed on the video link, and the members moved into a closed session among the Alliance.

After him, the President was the first speaker. He set out the three-pronged approach that we have taken throughout this this crisis, noting that today marks the one-month anniversary of the launch of Russian military aggression against Ukraine.

First, he talked about everything that we have done to impose costs on Russia, including the very significant package of sanctions.

Second, he reiterated our strong support for Ukraine, both in terms of security assistance — increased and continued security assistance, as well as humanitarian assistance that we were continuing to provide to those both in Ukraine and to those fleeing the violence.

And third, a very strong message of support for NATO — reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Article 5 and the steps that the United States, in partnership with other Allies, had taken in recent weeks to reinforce the security of the eastern flank.



As part of that, speaking more generally: In terms of the Alliance, he talked about force posture adjustments, as I mentioned. He welcomed the similar moves that we have seen from a number of countries to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank. He welcomed the increased defense spending pledges that we have seen from a number of countries, as well as the ongoing robust exercises that are continuing.

Finally, he looked ahead to the Madrid summit, which will be in about two and a half months in late June, and laid out a number of issues that the Alliance is going to have to grapple with in advance of that summit, given the changed security context that we see ourselves in and as the Alliance is finalizing the strategic concept that will be addressing a number of these changes in security architecture.

By the time I left the room, I think about six leaders had spoken. So, just to give you a sense of the mood: First, there was a very strong sense that we are facing a significant, historical moment, and very strong support from all of the leaders who spoke about the need to defend our democracy, the need to defend our shared values, and a strong sense that NATO was appropriately poised to be able to do that.

Second and relatedly, there was a very strong message of unity — notes of how united the NATO Alliance was, notes of unity across the transatlantic alliance; very strong support for NATO, for its Article 5 commitments; a number of leaders speaking about increases in their own defense spending; and also notes about changes that various countries have made in terms of force posture, particularly with what we’ve seen in the last couple of weeks with a significant movement of NATO forces to NATO’s eastern flank to defend the security of Allies there.

Third, very strong admiration for the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian people in terms of everything they are doing to defend their country from Russian aggression.

There was also very strong pledges of support from across the Allies that I heard speak about their readiness to continue, as well as increase, their security assistance to Ukraine.

Related to that, many of the leaders also spoke about the importance of economic sanctions and the need for us to continue imposing robust economic costs on Russia in response to its aggression.

Related to that: On the Ukrainian people, very strong support for refugees; a lot of appreciation to the eastern flank Allies that have been bearing the brunt of the crisis; and continued pledges by Allies to continue contributing financially to the humanitarian assistance, as well as, of course, a number of these countries taking in refugees themselves.

And just a final note: There was also a reference by many of the speakers to China and a recognition that China needs to live up to its responsibilities within the international community as a U.N. Security Council member, that we need to continue to call on China not to support Russia in its aggression against Ukraine, and that we need China to call for a peaceful end to the conflict as a responsible member of the international community.

So the mood overall has been sober, it’s been resolute, and it’s been incredibly united.

So let me stop there with my opening comments.

MODERATOR: Thank you so much, [senior administration official]. With that, we’ll open it up to a couple of questions on the NATO portion before we move on to the second portion of the call, which will be EU and G7 specific.

If I can ask everyone who has a question to please indicate you have one using the “raise hand” feature.

Josh Wingrove from Bloomberg. I saw your hand up first.

Q Thank you very much. Hello from the travel pool. Thank you for doing this. Can you give me a sense of what President Zelenskyy did ask for if he didn’t mention NATO membership and didn’t mention the closure?

And also, NBC is reporting that 100,000 refugees — the U.S. will announce a pledge to take in 100,000 refugees. Is there anything you can tell us on that in particular that we could publish before any later embargo?

Thank you.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Great. Thank you for that.

So, on your question about refugees, I don’t want to steal any thunder from my colleague, so let me defer that to the later part of the call where [senior administration official] is going to have more information specifically on some of our refugees and humanitarian assistance.

In terms of President Zelenskyy’s comments, I will let the Ukrainian government speak for themselves in terms of what specifically Zelenskyy conveyed to leaders in what was a closed, private session to leaders.

What I can say is that President Biden was very clear in his remarks about the security assistance that the U.S. has continued to provide, underscoring the $2 billion that we have provided over the last year, underscoring the billion dollars in new security assistance to Ukraine that we have just announced; talked in some specifics, as he has done previously, about the additional types of assistance that we have been providing to Ukraine.

And then, just more broadly, I would say that we have started consulting with Allies on providing anti-ship missiles to Ukraine. There may be some technical challenges with making that happen, but that is something that we are consulting with Allies and starting to work on.

MODERATOR: Thank you. Next, we go to Kevin Liptak with CNN.

Q Hi. Thank you. Yesterday, Jake said that discussion of Russia’s potential use of chemical or biological or nuclear weapons would come up in all these discussions. I wonder if you could say whether that came up at NATO today and what the leaders — what was — if there was a consensus among the leaders about whether NATO would be obliged to respond to the use of those kinds of weapons should that take place.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, there were some references to that. I think there is a recognition that NATO needs to continue a lot of the good, ongoing work to be prepared to respond to various contingencies. It’s something that NATO, as a military alliance, is already postured to do, and it’s something that they recognize that they need to continue to do given the various scenarios that could emerge as part of this conflict.



The United States is already taking steps both nationally, as well as through NATO, to enhance the readiness and capability of our defense forces to respond to chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear incidents. Frankly, for NATO, this is an important part of strengthening our longer-term defense and deterrence postures.



NATO has a Combined Joint CBRN Defence Task Force, which is an element of the NATO Response Force, which is prepared to deploy at SACEUR’s direction. This includes specially trained and equipped forces who are able to deal with these types of incidents if there are attacks against NATO populations, territory, or forces.



And NATO Allies are also continuing to consult, as well as to take national decisions, to be able to provide on a bilateral basis protective equipment and medical countermeasures to help Ukraine detect, identify, and respond to these types of threats.



So, in sum, yes, it was a subject that came up in discussion today and I assume is a continuing part of the ongoing discussion.



Second, there are broader conversations within NATO about how to respond to these types of incidents.



And third, some NATO Allies are already taking national decisions to be able to respond to, potentially, Ukrainian needs on these threats as well.



SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you. And then we’ll do one more question from Chris Megerian with AP. After that, we’ll move on to the second portion.



Q Hi, everybody. I wanted to see if you could talk any more about force posture adjustments. What specifically are we speaking about?



And then on China, when you said that China needs to do more, what specifically do you want to see them do more or see them stop doing?



SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks for that. So, in terms of force posture, there was considerable discussion by leaders about the number of changes that have already been made across the Alliance. I think what we’ve seen within the last couple of weeks with NATO Allies acting with great unity and speed to deploy additional defensive forces and capabilities in response to renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine.



NATO activated its response plans. It deployed the NATO Response Force. It increased NATO’s readiness. And there’s now approximately 40,000 Allied forces under direct NATO command with particular emphasis on the eastern flank.



As part of that, the United States has already deployed thousands of additional forces to Europe. There’s now approximately 100,000 U.S. forces on land, in the air, at sea, training, exercising, and ready to defer — or to deter and defend against any threat.



So, in the parts of the meeting that I was in, there was a lot of recognition about the steps that the U.S. has taken and, frankly, that a large number of other Allies have taken to move their forces to the eastern flank as well.



And in terms of China, I would refer to what I had said earlier in terms of similar messages that Stoltenberg himself actually has given within the last couple of days as well: that there is a desire for China to live up to its responsibilities within the international community, clearly a strong desire for Russia [China] not to provide economic or military assistance to Russia in furtherance of its aggression against Ukraine, and for China to join with other responsible members of the international community in calling on Russia to end its violence.



SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you. And with that, that concludes the first portion of the call, which, as a reminder, is embargoed until this call concludes.

1,5f12f867-08ae-47df-82c2-0ac56fd0570e,"['Sky Uk Limited', 'Sunita Patel-Carstairs', 'News Reporter']",,"NATO's chief has pledged to send more weapons to Ukraine to bolster the alliance's response to the Russian invasion - as he said it was ready to defend every inch of its territory with more troops on the ground and in the air.

Jens Stoltenberg said the 30-nation military alliance had also agreed to send equipment to Ukrainians that could help them defend themselves against potential Russian cyber, biological, chemical and nuclear attacks.

""There is also a risk that it (a chemical weapons attack) will have a direct effect on people living in NATO countries,"" he said.

World leaders are becoming increasingly alarmed by the prospect that Russia may resort to more desperate measures and use outlawed weapons such as chemical agents which could spread across the border into a NATO member state - bringing the war to the alliance.

The NATO secretary general called the conflict the ""biggest threat to our security in a generation"" and announced a boost in defence spending and the deployment of ""four new battle groups"" in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

There are already around 40,000 troops spread from the Baltic to the Black Sea.

US President Joe Biden also announced new sanctions ""in alignment with the European Union"" that would target more than 400 individuals and entities, including oligarchs and Russian defence companies ""that fuel the Russian war machine"".

He said the US would commit more than $1bn (£760m) in humanitarian assistance ""to help give relief to millions of Ukrainians affected by the war in Ukraine"" and welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees.

He said he thinks Russia should be removed from the G20 grouping of major economies and the possibility was discussed with other world leaders.

Mr Stoltenberg said NATO is ""determined to do all we can to support Ukraine"" and called on China to refrain from supporting Moscow's war effort.

""China must not provide economic or military support for Russian invasion. Instead, Beijing should use its significant influence on Russia and promote an immediate peaceful resolution,"" he said.

Earlier Mr Zelenskyy told NATO leaders Russian forces would not stop at Ukraine - and next target alliance members in Eastern Europe including Poland.

""NATO has yet to show what the alliance can do to save people,"" the Ukrainian leader said in an impassioned pre-recorded video message to the summit - exactly a month on from the start of the Russian invasion.

""The alliance can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from Russian occupation by giving us all the weapons we need,"" he added - listing fighter jets, tanks, and better air defence and anti-ship weaponry.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""we're very conscious of what he's asking for"" but it was ""logistically"" very difficult to provide tanks and jets.

He said the missiles and other equipment being provided were more valuable.

Mr Zelenskyy has failed to get Western allies to create a no-fly zone over his country - and the European Union has so far refused to follow the US example of banning Russian oil and gas.

The US is looking for ways to increase the supply of natural gas to Europe to reduce the bloc's reliance on Russian imports, according to Mr Biden's national security adviser.

'New sense of urgency,' says NATO chief

Mr Stoltenberg said President Putin had made a ""big mistake"" and underestimated the ""strength and bravery"" of the Ukrainian people who with the significant support of its allies are ""fighting back the invading Russian army"".

He said there is a ""new sense of urgency"" about Europe's defence which is why the presence of NATO troops has been increased on the eastern flank.

But he reiterated there would be no NATO troops on the ground in Ukraine or planes in the air which would increase the risk of a ""fully fledged war between NATO and Russia"".

The Kremlin said most NATO member states had a ""hysterical and inadequate"" understanding of what is going on in Ukraine.

Is the tide turning for Ukraine?

There are signs Ukraine might be starting to turn the tide against the Russian troops, according to British military intelligence, with the UK's Ministry of Defence suggesting Russian forces are depleted and ""have almost certainly suffered thousands of casualties during their invasion of Ukraine"".

""Russia is likely now looking to mobilise its reservist and conscript manpower, as well as private military companies and foreign mercenaries, to replace these considerable losses,"" the MoD said in its latest update. ""It is unclear how these groups will integrate into the Russian ground forces in Ukraine and the impact this will have on combat effectiveness.""

Russia is moving fresh units close to the Ukrainian border, also calling up soldiers who have recently served in Syria.

US intelligence suggests Russian advances towards Kyiv city centre have stopped and Russian forces are now setting up defensive positions around 10 miles away.

Moscow is sending more military equipment to Belarus to boost its efforts to capture the capital, according to Ukraine's defence ministry.

2,5f12f867-08ae-47df-82c2-0ac56fd0570e,"['Sky Uk Limited', 'Deborah Haynes', 'Security', 'Defence Editor']",,"A summit of NATO leaders in Brussels was meant as a show of unity against Russian President Vladimir Putin and of unwavering support for Ukraine.

But the 30-member alliance is performing a hugely difficult balancing act in an evolving response to Russia's war with its neighbour.

Allies needed to help the Ukrainian armed forces defend their territory, with individual member states providing various types of increasingly lethal weapons, but not assist so significantly that it's viewed by Moscow as a direct intervention - something that could trigger World War Three.

At the same time, there is much less regard about angering Russia when it comes to bolstering the number of troops, warships and jets on a higher state of readiness within the alliance's own borders - something that previously restricted NATO's willingness to strengthen its ability to defend against and deter Russian aggression.

When it comes to Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, there remains a gap between a new request for support from Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the country's wartime president, and what countries are willing to give.

The space did seem to be shrinking as the Ukrainian leader, who addressed allies at the morning summit remotely by video-link, appeared to adjust his requirements.

Change in no-fly zone demand

He no longer asked for a no-fly zone - something that had been a mantra for the Ukrainian government since the start of the invasion, but which countries like the US and the UK have rejected as unworkable.

This is because it would require NATO jets to shoot Russian war planes and missiles out of the sky and destroy Russian air defence systems to defend Ukraine's air space.

That kind of action could quickly lead to a full-scale war in Europe with much greater death, destruction and human suffering.

Instead, President Zelenskyy asked for more potent fighting equipment than the (albeit vital) anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles he is already receiving, making a pitch for 1% of all NATO warplanes and tanks.

But this too could potentially breach an invisible threshold of western assistance, shifting from allies gifting more arguably defensive weapons to more offensive ones.

Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, whose term in office was extended for another year because of the war - a move that prompted a round of applause from the leaders - explained the dilemma when asked about the Ukrainian request during a news conference after the summit.

""NATO allies provide significant support to Ukraine and we provide also lethal weapons, advanced systems and also systems that help them to shoot down planes and attack battle tanks with anti-tank weapons and many other types of systems including drones,"" he said.

""At the same time we have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe, involving not just Ukraine and Russia but NATO allies and Russia. That would be more dangerous and more devastating and I think we have to be honest about that and that is exactly what we were being in our meeting today.""

Another balancing act is also being carried out by NATO when it comes to spelling out how allies would respond should President Putin launch a chemical or biological weapons attack in Ukraine.

If the West makes such action a red line requiring a direct NATO military intervention, then once again the consequences risk blowing up into the Third World War.

Finally - though no longer as pronounced - there is a balance to be struck for the alliance as it strengthens its own ability to deter Russian aggression.

Every NATO move can be twisted by Moscow

NATO plans to deploy even more soldiers, warships and jets at high readiness across the alliance but every move it makes can be twisted by the Kremlin to accuse allies of being the aggressors and to justify greater Russian hostilities against them.

This equation is becoming less difficult to manage, however, than it was back in 2014 when the alliance first had to reset significantly its defence and deterrence posture in response to Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine, when Moscow annexed Crimea.

At that time, the desire was to strengthen the alliance's eastern flank by creating battlegroups in the Baltic states and Poland.

But there was a nervousness about going too far and triggering an escalatory response from Russia.

Image: Cars and buildings ablaze after Russian forces shelled Mykolaiv, Ukraine on Wednesday

Previous NATO posture clearly failed

Yet the posture that was agreed upon back then has clearly failed given President Putin felt he could, however mistakenly, get away with launching an all-out war against Ukraine eight years later.

It means the alliance is no longer allowing itself to be limited in its actions by an agreement struck between NATO and Russia back in 1997 that set out fundamental principles limiting the deployment of NATO forces on the territory of member states.

As a result, NATO has been exponentially faster in expanding the original battlegroups and now setting up four new ones in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia - something confirmed at the summit.

They have also activated an emergency NATO Response Force for the first time and put swathes of allied military personnel on a higher state of readiness.

Further longer-term decisions on force sizes and postures are set to be taken at another leaders' summit in June.

Pledges to bolster defence spending are also being accelerated - a sign that NATO has found a renewed sense of purpose and that all allies are starting to relearn the reality that their security and values cannot be guaranteed without credible defences.",https://news.sky.com/story/nato-faces-balancing-act-between-helping-ukraines-defence-and-avoiding-direct-intervention-against-putin-12574283

NATO has agreed to strengthen its defenses in Europe in the face of Russia's continuing aggression toward Ukraine. Speaking after an extraordinary summit of the military alliance in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters that the organization has collectively agreed to reinforce its defense capabilities in the region. ""Today NATO leaders agreed to reset our deterrents and defense for the longer term to face a new security reality. On land, we will have substantially more forces in the eastern part of the alliance at higher readiness, with more pre-positioned equipment and supplies,"" he said.

""In the air, we will deploy more jets and strengthen our integrated air and missile defense. At sea, we will have carrier strike groups, submarines and significant numbers of combat ships on a persistent basis,"" he added, with members also set to strengthen their cyber defenses. Further details would be decided at the alliance's next summit in June, Stoltenberg said. A statement from the alliance at the conclusion of its meeting called Russia's aggression against Ukraine, ""the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades."" ""Russia's war against Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe and is causing enormous human suffering and destruction,"" it said.

Global leaders gathered in Europe on Thursday to discuss the war in Ukraine and how to help the country survive Russia's onslaught. As well as the extraordinary NATO summit taking place in Brussels there are meetings of EU leaders and the G-7. Ahead of the summit, Stoltenberg said the alliance's meeting was taking place as leaders faced ""the most serious security crisis in a generation."" Leaders would address this crisis, he said, and its implications ""for Ukraine, for NATO and for the whole international rules-based order."" Stoltenberg, who has extended his tenure as secretary-general by a year, said NATO had agreed to increase its military presence in the eastern part of the alliance, with around 40,000 extra soldiers deployed to the region and that significant air and naval assets had been placed under direct NATO command. NATO had already earlier announced the establishment of four new battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance, in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. These four new battlegroups will be in addition to four other battlegroups already present in the Baltic countries and Poland.

Stoltenberg made separate comments to CNBC Thursday in which he said that ""President [Vladimir] Putin has made a big mistake and that is to launch a war, to wage a war, against an independent sovereign nation."" ""He has underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian people, the bravery of the Ukrainian people and armed forces,"" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also addressed NATO members Thursday and claimed during his speech that Russia has used phosphorus bombs in an attack. ""This morning we had phosphorus bombs from Russia, people were killed, children were killed,"" Zelenskyy said during an address via videolink to the NATO summit.

4,5f12f867-08ae-47df-82c2-0ac56fd0570e,"['Lorne Cook', 'Associated Press']",2022-03-24 13:26:55+00:00,"BRUSSELS (AP) — With the threat of wider conflict hanging over Europe, NATO opted for stability on Thursday by extending Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg’s term in office for an extra year to help steer the 30-nation military alliance through the security crisis sparked by Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Stoltenberg tweeted Thursday that he is “honored” by the decision of NATO leaders to extend his term until Sept. 30, 2023.

“As we face the biggest security crisis in a generation, we stand united to keep our alliance strong and our people safe,” he said, after U.S. President Joe Biden and his counterparts agreed to extend his term at a summit in Brussels.

The former Norwegian prime minister was named to NATO’s top civilian post in October 2014. It’s the second time that his term of office has been extended. His mandate was due to expire in September.

In a tweet, Biden said that Stoltenberg has “done a remarkable job leading and strengthening our Alliance — particularly during this critical moment for international security.”

In February, Norway’s government appointed Stoltenberg as head of the Scandinavian country’s central bank and said it hoped he could start in his new role around Dec. 1.

In Oslo, Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum confirmed that Stoltenberg had resigned from the job. Temporary governor Ida Wolden Bache has been nominated in his place and her appointment is expected to be confirmed later Thursday.

“Of course I would like to see Jens Stoltenberg become our next central bank governor, but we are in the middle of a dramatic situation in Europe and I have great understanding that he prioritizes continuing in the important role he has in NATO,” Slagsvold Vedum said.

Stoltenberg, 63, has described Russia’s war on Ukraine as “the most serious security situation we have been in for decades.”

Stoltenberg has been praised for steering NATO through a difficult and divisive period under the Trump administration, when the U.S. threatened not to come to the aid of member countries that weren’t spending enough on defense.

Speaking to reporters on an Air Force One flight to Brussels on Wednesday, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Biden and Stoltenberg have “developed a relationship of trust.”

“Secretary-General Stoltenberg has played an instrumental role in helping secure the powerful unity you’ve seen at NATO through this crisis,” Sullivan said

Stoltenberg was twice prime minister in Norway — from 2000 to 2001 and then again from 2005 to 2013 — and he also served as finance minister, and industry and energy minister.

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told Norwegian news agency NTB that Stoltenberg had done “a solid job” as NATO chief. “Never before has the alliance been stronger, and never before in the alliance’s history has unity been more important.”

Wolden Bache was due to be formally be named the central bank chief later Thursday for a six-year term.

“Norges Bank has great respect for Mr Stoltenberg’s decision made in the light of his very important responsibilities as Secretary General of NATO,” she said.

Prior to Thursday’s announcement, speculation had been rife that a woman would be named at the helm of the world’s biggest security organization for the first time.

5,5f12f867-08ae-47df-82c2-0ac56fd0570e,[],,"Zohar Palti, a former senior Mossad official who wrapped up a stint as head of the military’s political-military bureau this week, is speaking to the media for the first time, opening up about his opposition to Israel attacking Iran a decade ago, and his current opposition to a new nuclear deal which may be nearing finalization.

Speaking to Haaretz, he says he led opposition to Israel taking military action against Iran in 2012, when then-prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-defense minister Ehud Barak were pushing for a strike.

“During the spring-summer of 2012, the operational preparations reached a peak. In my understanding, they [Netanyahu and Barak] were truly preparing to attack,” he tells Haaretz.

“I am not claiming to read the secrets of the heart. But when the IDF is instructed to deploy for ‘P+16’ [possible attack within 16 days], when air force aerial refueling planes are brought back from long-term servicing, it’s an emergency situation. The air force put all its planes into the air in order to prepare. Quite a few risks were taken in that period.”

“But what are you going to attack in Iran? An enrichment facility? I am in favor of attacking if there is an urgent need, if a sword is held to your throat, as [former Mossad head Meir] Dagan put it. But that was not the situation in 2012 or in the preceding years,” he adds.

Speaking to Channel 13, he claims Israel will be given free rein to act against Iran if it does build a bomb.

“If they go for the bomb, in my opinion there will be no limitations on us. If the Iranians build a bomb and continue on their current path, I don’t know a single democratic state on earth, and certainly none that is allied with us, that would stop us. To the contrary. They would greatly respect our right to make our own decisions, on the basis of our capabilities.”

Palti describes the new nuclear deal as “crap.”

“From the moment the agreement is signed, billions of dollars will flow into Iran. That money will not reach the civilian population, it will go first of all toward financing the terrorism of the Revolutionary Guards,” he tells Haaretz.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-24-2022/

Stoltenberg tweeted Thursday that he is “honoured” by the decision of NATO leaders to extend his term until Sept 30, 2023.

“As we face the biggest security crisis in a generation, we stand united to keep our alliance strong and our people safe,” he said.

The former Norwegian prime minister was named to NATO's top civilian post in October 2014. It's the second time that his term of office has been extended. His mandate was due to expire in September.

In February, Norway's government appointed Stoltenberg as head of the Scandinavian country's central bank and said it hoped he could start in his new role around Dec 1.

In Oslo, Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum confirmed that Stoltenberg had resigned from the job. Deputy governor Ida Wolden Bache has been nominated in Stoltenberg's place and her appointment is expected to be confirmed later Thursday.

“Of course I would like to see Jens Stoltenberg become our next central bank governor, but we are in the middle of a dramatic situation in Europe and I have great understanding that he prioritizes continuing in the important role he has in NATO,” Slagsvold Vedum said.

Stoltenberg, 63, has described Russia's war on Ukraine as “the most serious security situation we have been in for decades”. Stoltenberg has been praised for steering NATO through a difficult and divisive period under the Trump administration, when the US threatened not to come to the aid of member countries that weren't spending enough on defense.

Speaking to reporters on an Air Force One flight to Brussels on Wednesday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that President Joe Biden “thinks very highly of Secretary-General Stoltenberg”.

“They've developed a relationship of trust,” Sullivan said. “Secretary-General Stoltenberg has played an instrumental role in helping secure the powerful unity you've seen at NATO through this crisis.”

Stoltenberg was twice prime minister in Norway — from 2005 to 2013 and from 2002 to 2014 — and he also served as finance minister, and industry and energy minister.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-extends-stoltenberg-term-for-a-year-due-to-russia-s-war-101648131033067.html

(CNN)

Yuliia Karpenko, 17, and her family lived through winter without heat for weeks in their Mariupol home, taking shelter as the port city in southeastern Ukraine came under unrelenting fire by Russian forces.

Speaking from Berlin — where she recently escaped to with her mother — the teenager on Thursday described their life under Russia's assault.

""On March 2 they turned off everything but gas — and they turned off gas a few days later,"" she told CNN. At the time, the temperature outside had dropped as low as -7 degrees Celsius (19.4 degrees Fahrenheit).

""We had to sleep in our jackets, and we had five sweaters and T-shirts on, and we slept under all the blankets we had — but I was cold anyway,"" she said.

Karpenko said the family melted snow for water and used candles to light their small shelter, while living with the mental stress of constant attacks.

""I couldn't see my friends, I couldn't talk to them, I could only talk to my family,"" she said. ""It's a feeling of helplessness, and it's the feeling that you don't know when it ends ... when you don't have anything but the sound of bombings.

""You're only feeling more and more miserable. You know that nowhere is safe.""

After she left Mariupol, her family's building was directly hit, and much of it burned down, she said. Videos of the building show ""nothing is left,"" she added.

In Germany, Karpenko plans to find a school to attend and pursue higher education. But her stepfather, dogs and grandparents are still in Ukraine. ""They didn't want to leave,"" she said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-24-22/index.html
