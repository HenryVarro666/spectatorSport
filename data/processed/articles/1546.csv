Good morning.

We meet here at the NATO Headquarters facing the most serious security crisis in a generation.

We will address this crisis together and address the threat that means for Ukraine, for NATO and for the whole international rules-based order.

President Zelensky will address the NATO leaders.

The leaders will focus on our support to Ukraine. Allies have provided support to Ukraine for several years and we have stepped up with more military support, financial support, humanitarian support to help Ukraine uphold its fundamental right for self-defence.

NATO's core task is to protect and defend all Allies.

We have increased our military presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.

The NATO leaders will today address the need for a reset of our deterrence and defence in the longer term.

And the first step is the establishment of four new battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

We need to do more, and therefore we need to invest more.

There is a new sense of urgency and I expect that the leaders will agree to accelerate the investments in defence to meet the pledge we have made to invest more in defence.

And I welcome that several Allies have already made announcements on investing more in defence.

The meeting today will demonstrate the importance of North America and Europe standing together facing this crisis.

We are the strongest Alliance in the world. And as long as we stand together, we are also safe.

Thank you.

Hadley Gamble (CNBC): I want to get a sense from you of NATO's understanding of President Putin's actual mental state at this point, because what we understand of course, is that even his central bank governor is trying to leave her post and he's being… he's seeing some defection, if you will, from his inner circle. What's your sense of his mental state at this point?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: President Putin has made a big mistake and that is to launch a war, to wage war, against an independent sovereign nation. He has underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian people, the bravery of the Ukrainian people and the armed forces, and therefore they're also meeting much more resistance than they expected. We need, in a way, to address the actions that we see Russia is doing in Ukraine. And that's also the reason why we have significantly stepped up the support to Ukraine, and why we have increased the presence of NATO troops in the eastern part of the Alliance and increased the readiness of our troops. We do so to be able to respond and address any threat, any challenge to our security, and what kind of decisions… and what kind of decisions they make in Moscow, I will not speculate further about that.

Ukrainian media: [inaudible]

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: NATO Allies provide significant military support to Ukraine. NATO Allies have trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who are now on the front line fighting against the invading Russian forces. The Ukrainian army is much better equipped, much better trained, much better commanded now than in 2014. And the combination of the training and support from NATO Allied countries with the bravery and the courage of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is enabling the Ukrainians to really resist and actually fight back the invading Russian Army. We provide Ukraine also with advanced air defence systems, with anti-tank weapons, with ammunition and fuel. So Allies are providing many different types of support. But we have also made it clear that we will not send in NATO troops on the ground, or NATO planes in the air. We do that because we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not escalate beyond Ukraine. That will cause even more suffering, even more death, even more destruction. And to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine means that we need to impose it, and to impose a no-fly zone means that we need to massively attack Russian air defence systems in Russia, in Belarus and in Ukraine, and also be ready to shoot down Russian planes. And then the risk for a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia will be very high, and that will cause more deaths and more destruction.

Bloomberg: You mentioned yesterday that if chemical weapons are used in Ukraine it could have a direct impact in NATO countries. Could this be considered an attack on a NATO Ally?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: I will not speculate beyond saying the following, that any use of chemical weapons would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict. It will be a blatant violation of international law and it will have widespread and severe consequences. The seriousness of using chemical weapons of course becomes even more obvious knowing that there is a risk always for contamination, for that chemical agents are spread over bigger areas. So this will be a catastrophe for the people of Ukraine, but of course there is also a risk that we can see the spread of chemical agents also into NATO territory. I will not speculate beyond the fact that NATO is always ready to defend, to protect and to react to any type of attack on a NATO Allied country.

ARD: How concerned are you about China’s role in this? And my second question, what does the new military posture of NATO mean in terms of national defence spending?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: On national defence spending, I see a new sense of urgency among Allies. They all understand that since we now need to do more – we face the most serious security crisis in a generation, so therefore, we need to invest more in our security. And the Allies understand that the only way to do that is also to allocate more money for national defence budgets. And I expect Allies to agree to accelerate the implementation of the commitments we have made to invest more in defence. And I welcome the decision, for instance, by Germany to spend 2% of GDP on defence. This will really make a difference because Germany has such a big economy, so the increased investments by Germany makes a different for the whole Alliance.

We call on China to join the rest of the world in clearly condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine and not provide political support. And of course, neither provide any kind of material support to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Question: If Allies were to unanimously ask you to stay on as General Secretary today, would you say yes?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So I will leave that decision to the 30 leaders to decide. I don't have any further comments.

Danish television: Would you call what is happening in Ukraine now a genocide? And if so, what kind of responsibility does NATO have to prevent a genocide?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: NATO is providing unprecedented support to Ukraine, helping them to defend themselves. NATO Allies are also imposing unprecedented sanctions on Russia to hamper, reduce the capability of Russia to finance this war against Ukraine. And we are also, of course, making sure that we are ready to protect and defend all Allies. What we have seen is attacks against civilians, civilian infrastructure, and this is a clear violation of international law. I therefore also welcome that the International Criminal Court has started an investigation and will look into this, because at the end it has to be this body that decides on issues related to violation of international law.

Georgian public broadcasting: Yesterday, you mentioned that it's important to protect other partners as well. What about Georgia, and do we see some statements about Georgia at the end of the communique of NATO?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: I expected that Allies also today… or today in the meeting, that the leaders today in the meeting will express their support to partners which are under pressure from Russia and that includes of course, Georgia. Georgia has the right to choose its own path. NATO Allies have provided support for Georgia over many years to help them to implement reforms, to modernise the defence and security institutions. And the brutal invasion of Ukraine just highlights, underscores the need to provide support to Georgia.

Pro TV Romania: Mr Secretary General, given the war in Ukraine, what is NATO's view regarding possible permanent NATO bases, presence, in Romania? And regarding the battlegroup, will it be made up of the troops that have already been sent from US, Belgium, France in Romania in the past month, or there will be additional troops from other countries?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So NATO has already increased its military presence in Romania. We have deployed the elements of the high readiness joint task force led by France. I visited Romania a few weeks ago and I also met with the troops from the United States and from other countries, and they will demonstrate the commitment to stay and to protect and help to defend NATO territory also in Romania. These troops will be there as long as necessary. But this is part of the immediate response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Then I expect at the meeting today that the leaders will start the process that will provide us with advice to make more longer term decisions on our longer term deterrence and defence, because we need to reset our deterrence and defence. These decisions, I expect leaders to take them at the summit later on in June. So these are two different processes, one is what we already have done, and that will be there as long as necessary. And then we are addressing the more longer term changes in our deterrence and defence. The fact is that we face the most serious security crisis in a generation and therefore NATO needs to respond. And that's the reason why we need to reset our deterrence and defence for the long term. Thank you.","https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193611.htm#:~:text=NATO%20Secretary%20General%20Jens%20Stoltenberg%3A%20NATO%20is%20providing%20unprecedented%20support,finance%20this%20war%20against%20Ukraine."

Good afternoon.

We have just finished an extraordinary summit of NATO leaders to address the biggest threat to our security in a generation:

President Putin’s war against Ukraine.

The people of Ukraine are resisting with courage and determination.

Fighting for their freedom and for their future.

We stand with them.

President Zelensky addressed us with an impassioned message.

Thanking NATO Allies for the significant support we are providing.

And stressing the vital importance of even more military assistance.

Today, NATO leaders agreed that we must and will provide further support to Ukraine.

We will continue to impose unprecedented costs on Russia.

And we will reinforce Allied deterrence and defence.

Leaders approved our four new NATO battlegroups.

In Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia.

These are in addition to the four already in the Baltic countries and Poland.

So we have eight multinational NATO battlegroups now.

From the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.

Across Europe, there are one hundred thousand US troops supporting NATO efforts.

And European Allies and Canada have also stepped up.

We have 40,000 forces under direct NATO command, mostly in the eastern part of the Alliance.

Backed by major air and naval power.

Including an unprecedented five carrier strike groups from the High North to the Mediterranean.

Today, NATO leaders agreed to reset our deterrence and defence for the longer-term.

To face a new security reality.

On land, we will have substantially more forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, at higher readiness.

With more prepositioned equipment and supplies.

In the air, we will deploy more jets.

And strengthen our integrated air and missile defence.

At sea, we will have carrier strike groups, submarines and significant numbers of combat ships on a persistent basis.

We will also strengthen our cyber defences.

And enhance our exercises, focusing on collective defence and interoperability.

I expect we will decide on the details at our next Summit in Madrid in June.

Today, Allied leaders also agreed to provide further support to Ukraine.

Helping to uphold their fundamental right to self-defence.

Allies are also equipping Ukraine with significant military supplies.

Including anti-tank and air defence systems, and drones.

Which are proving highly effective.

As well as substantial financial and humanitarian aid.

Today, we agreed to do more.

Including cybersecurity assistance.

And equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats.

This could include detection, protection, and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management.

We are determined to do all we can to support Ukraine.

And I welcome the concrete offers of assistance made by Allies today.

At the same time, we have a responsibility to ensure the conflict does not escalate further. Because this would be even more dangerous and more devastating.

Allies agreed that we must also increase our support for other partners at risk from Russian threats and interference.

Including Georgia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Working together, and with the European Union, we must help them uphold their sovereignty and strengthen their resilience.

We also addressed Beijing’s role in the crisis.

Today, Allied leaders called on China to refrain from supporting Russia’s war effort.

China must not provide economic or military support for the Russian invasion.

Instead, Beijing should use its significant influence on Russia.

And promote an immediate, peaceful resolution.

Allies also agreed that Belarus must stop acting as an accomplice to Putin’s invasion.

At today’s meeting, leaders reaffirmed our strong commitment to NATO’s Open Door policy, under Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.

NATO enlargement has been an historic success.

Spreading democracy, freedom, and prosperity across Europe.

One month since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, NATO’s security environment has fundamentally changed.

For the long haul.

And we are responding.

But security does not come for free.

And doing more will cost more.

So NATO leaders agreed to redouble efforts to meet the Defence Investment Pledge we made in 2014.

Allies will submit additional plans on how to meet the pledge in time for the Madrid Summit in June.

And I welcome that a number of Allies today announced plans for significant increases in defence spending.

At this dangerous time, transatlantic unity and solidarity are vital.

Europe and North America are standing, and will continue to stand, strong together in NATO.

With that, I am ready to take your questions.

Natasha Bertrand (CNN): Hi, Mr Secretary General, thank you. President Zelensky in his address to NATO accused Russia of deploying phosphorus munitions. I am wondering whether NATO has seen evidence of that and what your response is or would be? And then I am wondering, did you discuss during this meeting a permanent basing of forces in any of these countries such as the Baltics and abandoning the NATO-Russia Founding Act?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So we are resetting NATO’s deterrence and defence for the long term, with more troops, with more air assets and more maritime capabilities. We have already increased our presence in the east and today we decided on four new battlegroups. The leaders agreed to task our military commanders to provide options for a long-term reset of our presence, of our military posture in the eastern part of the Alliance and across the whole Alliance. Details will be then decided at our summit in June but that comes on top for what we have already done. So this is long term, we are prepared for long haul because we can already today say that the Russian invasion, President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has changed our security environment for the long term. It is a new reality. It is a new normal and NATO is responding for the long term. We have seen very credible reports about the use of use of military force against civilians. Of course, this is a great concern for all NATO Allies.

NBC: Secretary General thank you for taking my question. How do you believe NATO will respond if China begins to support Russia economically and perhaps with military supplies? And also do you believe that there is a role to play for NATO when it comes to alleviating energy costs? And I'm talking about speaking directly to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers. Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So NATO Allies are coordinating their efforts when it comes to also energy security. It was also addressed in the meeting today to step up supplies, to diversify sources of supply and also to reduce dependence on supplies from Russia and later today, I will also participate in the G7 meeting. In different frameworks, G7, working with the EU, there are different formats where NATO Allies address the need to strengthen energy security and reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. Our message to China is that they should join the rest of the world and clearly condemn the brutal war against Ukraine and not support Russia and neither with economic support or with military support.

Irina Somer (Interfax Ukraine): I would like to ask you if Polish leadership put at the table today for discussion, the proposal to send peacekeeping mission to Ukraine and if yes what kind of discussion it was? And is there some conclusion? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: We discussed a wide range of issues and the message is that we have to stand united and also that we need to provide support to Ukraine. At the same time, we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not become a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia. And that is also the reason why Allies have declared that we will not deploy troops on the ground in in Ukraine because the only way to do that is to be prepared to engage in full conflict with Russian troops.

Henry Foy (Financial Times): Thank you very much, Secretary General. Congratulations on your annual extension. You said in the statement that Allies agree to ‘enhance preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats’. Is that based on credible intelligence that those threats could be imminent, and how does the Alliance strengthen its protection against those threats? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So we are concerned, partly because we see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext accusing Ukraine, United States, NATO Allies [of] preparing to use chemical and biological weapons. And we have seen before that this way of accusing others is actually a way to create a pretext for doing the same themselves. And of course, accusations against Ukraine and NATO Allies are absolutely false. Any use of chemical weapons will totally change the nature of the conflict. It will be a blatant violation of international law and it will have widespread consequences and, of course, be extremely dangerous. It will affect the people in Ukraine. But there's also a risk that it will have a direct effect on people living in NATO countries, because we can see contamination, we can see the spread of chemical agents or biological weapons into our countries. We also know that Russia has used chemical agents against its own opposition, and they have used it on NATO territory, in Salisbury, before. And we also know that Russia has facilitated, supported, the Assad regime in Syria when they used chemical weapons against their own population.

So this just highlights the importance of ending this war immediately because this is a dangerous situation and therefore we impose the sanctions, and therefore we support Ukraine. Allies agreed to supply equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. This could include detection equipment, protection and medical support, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management. We are also enhancing Allies’ preparedness and readiness for chemical and biological and nuclear threats. Our top military commander, General Wolters, has activated NATO's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements, and Allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defences to reinforce our existing and new battlegroups. So we are taking measures both to support Ukraine, and also to defend ourselves.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): President Zelensky, when he addressed… you recall the fact he first spoke to you a month ago, and he says he didn't get clear answers. So this time he asked you specifically for 1% of all your tanks, for 1% of all your aircraft, for multi-launch rocket systems, anti-ship weapons and means of air defence – a very specific list. What is your clear answer?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: We all listened very carefully to President Zelensky. And many of the leaders in the room have had contacts with him over these weeks. I also spoke with him and the Ukrainian defence minister participated in our defence ministerial meeting last week. We listened carefully. And of course, we took note of his very compassionate message to all NATO Allies.

NATO Allies provide significant support to Ukraine. And we provide also lethal weapons, advanced systems, and also systems that help them to shoot down planes and attack battle tanks with anti-tank weapons, and many other types of systems including drones. I will not go into the details of the exact type of systems we are deploying. There is close contact between NATO Allies and Ukraine. But what I can say is that Allies do what they can to support Ukraine with weapons so Ukraine can defend themselves. Self-defence is a right enshrined in the UN Charter.

At the same time, we have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe, involving not only Ukraine and Russia, but NATO Allies and Russia. That will be more dangerous and more devastating. And I think we have to be honest about that, and that's exactly what we have been in our meeting today, and also what I say to you in the press conference now.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): So again, no clear answer?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: Well, what we do is that we are delivering a lot of equipment, and that is an answer. But I will not go into the details. I don't think that's wise for operational reasons if I listed exactly what and when and how we are delivering essential equipment to Ukraine. NATO Allies have stepped up and it is essential for the progress they have been able to make in the fight against the invading Russian forces.

NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu: Thank you very much, colleagues. I know there are many questions. I'm afraid the Secretary General needs to go to the G7 meeting, but there will be other briefings throughout the day. Thank you so much.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193613.htm

Speaking on the Global Conversation, said the NATO allies are doing “as much as they can” to provide support for Kyiv.

It's first and foremost the courage of the Ukrainian Army Defence Forces which is making the difference on the battleground. But the support from NATO allies is a crucial factor in enabling them to resist the invading Russian forces. Jens Stoltenberg NATO secretary-general

“We are providing Ukraine with advanced anti-tank weapons, air defence systems,” he said. “And we also have to remember that the NATO allies have trained the Ukrainian army for many years, tens of thousands of soldiers who are now on the frontline. So the Ukrainian army is much better equipped, much better trained and much stronger now than in 2014, when Russia invaded for the first time. It's first and foremost the courage of the Ukrainian Army Defence Forces which is making the difference on the battleground. But the support from NATO allies is a crucial factor in enabling them to resist the invading Russian forces. And we see the effect of the weapons and the support we have provided.”

Stoltenberg also warned Russia that “any use of chemical or biological weapons or nuclear will fundamentally change the nature of the conflict”.

He was speaking to Euronews Brussels correspondent Meabh Mc Mahon.

INTERVIEW:

Meabh Mc Mahon, Euronews: This week we saw a massive show of unity at NATO. Will that help stopping the war in Ukraine?

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO secretary-general: Yes, it will help. And actually, it's already helping in providing support to Ukraine. I think President Putin has really underestimated the unity and the strength of NATO, the European Union and all of us who believe in democracy and the rule of law and the international rules-based order. Because we are standing together in imposing unprecedented sanctions on Russia, but also in providing support to Ukraine, which helps them resist invading Russian forces.

Any deliberate attack on civilians will be a war crime

Meabh Mc Mahon, Euronews: Is President Putin a war criminal?

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO secretary-general: What we have seen is that civilians have been attacked, civilian infrastructure has been attacked, schools, hospitals and any deliberate attack on civilian infrastructure, civilians, will be a war crime. And therefore I think it is extremely important that the International Criminal Court has opened an investigation and those responsible must be held accountable. And it just highlights and underscores the importance that this war needs to end. And to end this war tomorrow. By ending the war, withdrawing his troops and engaging in good faith in diplomatic efforts

NATO allies are doing as much as they can

Meabh Mc Mahon, Euronews: And this week was all about showing support. Of course, the Ukrainians... President Zelenskyy joined the meeting virtually. He said he wants one per cent of NATO weapons. Is this doable?

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO secretary-general: What is doable is that the NATO allies are doing as much as they can to provide support: financial support, humanitarian support, but also military support to Ukraine. And we are providing Ukraine with advanced anti-tank weapons, air defence systems. And we also have to remember that the NATO allies have trained the Ukrainian army for many years, tens of thousands of soldiers who are now on the frontline. So the Ukrainian army is much better equipped, much better trained and much stronger now than in 2014, when Russia invaded for the first time. It's first and foremost the courage of the Ukrainian Army Defence Forces which is making the difference on the battleground. But the support from NATO allies is a crucial factor in enabling them to resist the invading Russian forces. And we see the effect of the weapons and the support we have provided.

Use of chemical or biological weapons would change nature of conflict

Meabh Mc Mahon, Euronews: And this week, NATO announced it would activate the CBRN - the Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Task Force. How big a deal is this? How worried should we be?

We are sending a message to Russia that any use of chemical or biological weapons or nuclear will fundamentally change the nature of the conflict. It will be a blatant violation of international law and it will have far-reaching consequences. Jens Stoltenberg NATO secretary-general

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO secretary-general: Well, we are concerned. But at the same time, we are sending a message to Russia that any use of chemical or biological weapons or nuclear will fundamentally change the nature of the conflict. It will be a blatant violation of international law and it will have far-reaching consequences. So this is something which is very serious. And that's also yet another reason why this war has to end. Because this is a dangerous war. It's the most serious security crisis we have been in for decades and therefore we are imposing sanctions on Russia. We are providing support to Ukraine. But we are also increasing the readiness and the presence of NATO troops in the eastern part of the alliance.

Meabh Mc Mahon, Euronews: And this CBRN task force, would it be able to protect Ukraine and of course NATO allies from a possible chemical attack?

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO secretary-general: Well, our military commanders, they have some measures to protect NATO forces and we have more NATO forces in the eastern part of the alliance. We have also some capabilities to assist civilian authorities in dealing with chemical or biological weapons and the effects of those. And then we are providing some support to Ukraine when it comes to protective equipment and other means to protect themselves against chemical or biological weapons.

Meabh Mc Mahon, Euronews: And all this, of course, will cost money. And we've seen NATO members now they're putting their hands in their pocket. They're putting money on the table, like the Belgians have said they will put one billion Euros now towards defence spending. How much will this all cost taxpayers? As it seems this war could last a while.

Spending has made NATO stronger

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO secretary-general: Our security doesn't come for free and we have seen over the last years, especially since 2014 tensions, going up. We have seen Russia using force against Ukraine: first illegally annexing Crimea, then destabilizing the eastern part of Ukraine, Donbas, and now fully-fledged invasion of Ukraine. And Russia is also threatening... has also threatened NATO: calling on NATO to remove all its infrastructure and all forces from the eastern part of the alliance. So we have to invest more in our security. The good news is that NATO allies are doing exactly that. We made the decision in April 2014 to increase defence spending. Since then, all NATO allies have increased. We have added in total $270 billion extra for defence, and that has made us stronger and we see that we have more capabilities, more readiness. And that's also a reason why we have been able to deploy significantly more troops in the eastern part of the alliance and more ships and more planes in the air, to make sure that there is no room for misunderstanding in Moscow when it comes to NATO's readiness to protect all NATO allies based on the core principle of NATO: one for all, all for one. An attack on one ally would trigger a response from the whole alliance. By doing that, we're not provoking conflict, but we are preventing conflict.

I feel very privileged to be asked to continue as the secretary-general of NATO. Jens Stoltenberg NATO secretary-general

Meabh Mc Mahon, Euronews: OK, just finally, one brief question. President Biden was here this week and he proposed that you stay on in your job for another year. Although you were meant to move on to Norway, to the bank, how does that make you feel? Are you ready for another year of this?

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO secretary-general: I feel very privileged to be asked to continue as the secretary-general of NATO, especially now in the midst of an extremely serious security crisis, and to ensure that we continue to stand united and that the unity that was demonstrated in the meeting this week, the NATO summit this week, is something which is inspiring me to continue to stay fully focused on my task as secretary-general of NATO.",https://www.euronews.com/2022/03/25/nato-support-crucial-to-ukrainian-resistance-stoltenberg-tells-euronews

NATO is also establishing four multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The eight battlegroups will extend all along NATO’s eastern flank, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.

NATO Allies are also increasing the resilience of their societies and infrastructure to counter Russia’s malign influence. This includes enhancing cyber capabilities and defences, and providing support to each other in the event of cyber attacks. Allies are ready to impose costs on those who harm them in cyberspace, and are increasing information exchange and situational awareness, enhancing civil preparedness, and strengthening their ability to respond to disinformation. NATO Allies will also enhance their preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

In addition to these immediate responses, NATO is also strengthening its deterrence and defence posture for the longer term, to face a more dangerous strategic reality. This will include significant developments in all domains – from major increases to forces on land, in the air and at sea, to stepping up cyber defences, to making the best use of space assets. These steps will be supported by enhanced exercises with an increased focus on collective defence and interoperability.

NATO is not seeking a war with Russia. NATO is a defensive Alliance. All measures are and will remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.

“Allies utterly condemned the horrific murders of civilians we have seen in Bucha and other places recently liberated from Russian control,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said following the meeting. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba thanked NATO Allies for their substantial support. “Allies have been doing a lot, and are determined to do more, now, and for the medium and longer term to help the brave Ukrainians defend their homes and their country, and push back the invading forces,” Mr Stoltenberg said.

Ministers also agreed to step up practical support to other partners at threat of Russian aggression, including Georgia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, to help strengthen their resilience. Allied Foreign Ministers were joined by their counterparts from Ukraine, Georgia, Finland, Sweden, and the European Union, and by NATO’s Asia-Pacific partners, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea. NATO will increase its cooperation with Asia-Pacific partners in areas like cyber, new technologies, disinformation, maritime security, climate change, and resilience, “because global challenges demand global solutions,” Mr Stoltenberg added.

Ministers agreed that NATO’s next Strategic Concept, which will be finalised at the Madrid Summit in June, must take account of NATO’s future relations with Russia, and China’s growing influence on Allied security.

At the same time, we have a responsibility to ensure the conflict does not escalate further, because this would be even more dangerous and more devastating,"" Stoltenberg said, stressing that the deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine would result in a direct military clash with Russia.",https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/NATO-No-Troops-to-Avoid-War-with-Russia---Stoltenberg-20220324-0015.html

Summary Facing 'the biggest security crisis in a generation'

Stoltenberg was due to become Norges Bank chief

Acting central bank governor is proposed for full term

OSLO/BRUSSELS, March 24 (Reuters) - NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday he will extend his term as head of the alliance by a year as it faces the ""biggest security crisis in a generation"" due to the war in Ukraine.

Stoltenberg's term had been set to expire on Oct. 1 and he had been due to take up a post as central bank governor of his native Norway by the end of 2022. read more

""Honoured by the decision of #NATO Heads of State and Government to extend my term as Secretary General until 30 September 2023,"" Stoltenberg tweeted.

""As we face the biggest security crisis in a generation, we stand united to keep our Alliance strong and our people safe.""

Russia's invasion of Ukraine a month ago has triggered Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War Two and led Western nations to fundamentally rethink their defence policies. read more

Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" his neighbour. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

Stoltenberg, an economist by training and former leader of Norway's Labour Party, was Norwegian prime minister from 2000-01 and 2005-13 before becoming NATO chief the following year. He has also been finance minister and energy minister.

FIRST WOMAN TO RUN NORGES BANK

Norway's government last month said the central bank's deputy chief, Ida Wolden Bache,would work as governor until Stoltenberg took over the top job at the end of the year.

The finance ministry said it would now propose Wolden Bache to head the bank for the full six-year term. She is the first woman to run Norges Bank in its 206-year history.

""We have to find a new governor and that would be Ida Wolden Bache for six years ... if the government accepts,"" a finance ministry spokesperson said.

Stoltenberg's nomination to the central bank in February created controversy in his home country, with the opposition in parliament worrying his appointment could weaken Norges Bank's independence. read more

Norway is ruled by a coalition led by the Labour Party, which Stoltenberg used to lead.

Bache, who earlier on Thursday presented the Norwegian central bank's decision to hike rates to 0.75% from 0.50%, said she would agree to continue in the post.

""I applied because I am strongly committed to Norges Bank, its highly competent staff and its mission. My commitment is just as strong today,"" she said in a statement.

The central bank governor is in charge of setting interest rates and managing financial stability as well as overseeing Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest with assets of $1.4 trillion.

Wolden Bache's appointment to a full term is unlikely to change the course of monetary policy.

Monetary policy in Norway relies to a significant degree on staff recommendations and forecasts, as well as consensus-building on the five-member policy committee, economists have previously said. read more

Wolden Bache ""has already been the acting governor for a few weeks and fills the role well"", Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum said in a statement. ""Norway will have an excellent central bank governor in her.""

WASHINGTON — NATO leaders meeting in Brussels discussed the response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, ways the alliance can support Ukraine's defense, and ways to best defend NATO nations, said alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

The secretary general spoke following the meeting of NATO heads of state that includes President Joe Biden. Stoltenberg called Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine ""the greatest security threat in a generation.""

The Russian invasion has solidified the 30-member NATO alliance in opposition to Putin's threats, not only to Ukraine, but to the international rules-based order.

""The people of Ukraine are resisting with courage and determination fighting for their freedom and for their future,"" Stoltenberg said. ""We stand with them.""

The summiteers heard from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian leader thanked NATO allies for their support, and he asked for even more military assistance, the secretary general said.

""Today, NATO leaders agreed that we must and will provide further support to Ukraine,"" he said. ""We will continue to impose unprecedented costs on Russia, and we will reinforce Allied deterrence and defense.""

During the summit, leaders approved four new NATO battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. These join four existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. These NATO formations stretch ""from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea,"" Stoltenberg said.

He noted that the United States now has more than 100,000 troops in Europe and that there are 40,000 forces under direct NATO command, mostly in the eastern part of the alliance.

These forces are backed by major air and naval power, ""including an unprecedented five carrier strike groups from the High North to the Mediterranean,"" he said.

But NATO leaders are looking to the future. The secretary general said the Russian invasion has changed the security environment on the globe and the alliance must respond. ""Today, NATO leaders agreed to reset our deterrence and defense for the longer-term, to face a new security reality,"" he said.

NATO will place more land forces in the eastern countries of the alliance and place prepositioned equipment and supplies there.

""In the air, we will deploy more jets and strengthen our integrated air and missile defense,"" he said. ""At sea, we will have carrier strike groups, submarines and significant numbers of combat ships on a persistent basis. We will also strengthen our cyber defenses.""

The alliance will also step up exercises, focusing on collective defense and interoperability, he said.

Stoltenberg said alliance officials will work with member states to hash out the details of the plan so leaders can decide on the program at the Madrid Summit in June.

The allies will continue to provide significant support to Ukraine, including anti-tank and air defense systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles. These capabilities are proving highly effective against the Russian invaders, Stoltenberg said.

The allies will also continue substantial financial and humanitarian aid.

The allies pledged to do more, including cybersecurity assistance and ""equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats,"" he said. ""This could include detection, protection and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management.""

NATO cannot allow this war in Ukraine to metastasize. ""We have a responsibility to ensure the conflict does not escalate further, because this would be even more dangerous and more devastating,"" the secretary general said. ""Allies agreed that we must also increase our support for other partners at risk from Russian threats and interference including Georgia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.""

The leaders addressed Beijing's role in the crisis. ""Today, allied leaders called on China to refrain from supporting Russia's war effort,"" Stoltenberg said. ""China must not provide economic or military support for the Russian invasion. Instead, Beijing should use its significant influence on Russia and promote an immediate, peaceful resolution.""

The allies also called on Belarus to stop enabling the Russian invasion.

The leaders reaffirmed their support for the alliance's open-door policy. ""NATO enlargement has been an historic success, spreading democracy, freedom and prosperity across Europe,"" he said. ""One month since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, NATO's security environment has fundamentally changed for the long haul, and we are responding.""",https://www.army.mil/article/255033/nato_leaders_discuss_responses_to_russias_ukraine_invasion

Stoltenberg tweeted Thursday that he is “honored” by the decision of NATO leaders to extend his term until Sept. 30, 2023.

“As we face the biggest security crisis in a generation, we stand united to keep our alliance strong and our people safe,” he said.

The former Norwegian prime minister was named to NATO’s top civilian post in October 2014. It’s the second time that his term of office has been extended. His mandate was due to expire in September.

In February, Norway’s government appointed Stoltenberg as head of the Scandinavian country’s central bank and said it hoped he could start in his new role around Dec. 1.

In Oslo, Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum confirmed that Stoltenberg had resigned from the job. Deputy governor Ida Wolden Bache has been nominated in Stoltenberg’s place and her appointment is expected to be confirmed later Thursday.

“Of course I would like to see Jens Stoltenberg become our next central bank governor, but we are in the middle of a dramatic situation in Europe and I have great understanding that he prioritizes continuing in the important role he has in NATO,” Slagsvold Vedum said.

Stoltenberg, 63, has described Russia’s war on Ukraine as “the most serious security situation we have been in for decades.”

Stoltenberg has been praised for steering NATO through a difficult and divisive period under the Trump administration, when the U.S. threatened not to come to the aid of member countries that weren’t spending enough on defense.

Speaking to reporters on an Air Force One flight to Brussels on Wednesday, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that President Joe Biden “thinks very highly of Secretary-General Stoltenberg.”

“They’ve developed a relationship of trust,” Sullivan said. “Secretary-General Stoltenberg has played an instrumental role in helping secure the powerful unity you’ve seen at NATO through this crisis.”

Stoltenberg was twice prime minister in Norway — from 2005 to 2013 and from 2002 to 2014 — and he also served as finance minister, and industry and energy minister.
