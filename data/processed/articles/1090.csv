The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

Spurred by reports of Russian atrocities outside Ukraine’s capital, and alarmed at signs that Russia’s invasion force is about to escalate assaults in eastern Ukraine, many civilians in that region are fleeing while they can, officials said Wednesday.

“The cities of the Luhansk region are in ruins,” warned one eastern governor. “Thousands of residents have not yet left. Get out of the way!”

The exodus accelerated as Western nations moved to provide more weapons to Ukraine’s military and further ostracize Russia economically with new sanctions, including restrictions on its leading banks and on the assets of President Vladimir V. Putin’s children.

The new sanctions are a response to outrage and revulsion over the atrocities, including executions and torture, that appear to have been carried out by Russian forces before they retreated from areas outside Kyiv in the past few weeks. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the atrocities were fabricated or were committed by the Ukrainians themselves.

The European Union also was weighing a ban on coal from Russia, the leading provider of fossil-fuel energy to Europe, and Russia appeared to move closer to default on its foreign debt because of U.S. currency restrictions.

“Together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” said President Biden, who has described Mr. Putin as a war criminal and suggested he should not remain in power.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — roughly one in four — have fled their homes since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the United Nations, including more than four million who have fled the country. It is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The Russian military announced last week that it would focus its campaign on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. The redeployment came as the Russians, hampered by botched planning and fierce Ukrainian military resistance, retreated from the Kyiv area and apparently abandoned — at least for now — any effort to capture the capital in their war to subjugate the former Soviet republic.

Western military analysts have said the Russians vastly underestimated the challenges in Ukraine and that their initial invasion force of more than 150,000 has been weakened by losses, exhaustion and low morale. But that does not mean Russia’s military cannot undertake a powerful new assault in eastern Ukraine.

The shift has accelerated civilian displacement in the east. Thousands of people have been leaving, according to Ukrainian officials, and photos and videos posted online. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have been massing in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.

In Kramatorsk, a city in the north of the Donetsk region, photos showed crowds of people huddled at a platform in a central train station.

At least two people were killed and five injured when Russian forces launched a strike on a humanitarian aid site in the town of Vugledar in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk governor.

Russian forces now control 60 percent of the town of Rubizhne, in the Luhansk region, according to the governor there, Serhiy Haidai, who said the attackers had scaled up their offensive this week.

“Evacuations are taking place under the roar of enemy guns,” Mr. Haidai wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that approximately 30,000 people had left the region since Russia invaded. He urged remaining residents to flee before Russia scaled up attacks.

Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the Kharkiv military region, said Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the army would evacuate two towns in the eastern part of the country because fighting was escalating there.

The towns, Lozova and Barvinkove, are southwest of Izium, a city Russian forces seized as part of an apparent drive toward Sloviansk, which military analysts say is strategically critical to Russia’s plan to gain full control of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, speaking on national television, said “large groupings of Russian troops” had been massing in the region.

“They are not going to stop,” he said. “They have a great desire to create big problems for our armed forces in this direction, and we also expect that fierce battles will be fought there for our territory in the near future.”

The Pentagon’s assessment of Russian deployments appeared to corroborate what Ukrainian officials were saying. Pentagon officials said Russia had withdrawn all of its troops arrayed against Kyiv and another city in the north, Chernihiv, and sent them back to Russia or to its ally Belarus to rearm, resupply and possibly redeploy in eastern Ukraine.

The Pentagon officials said those forces included as many as 40,000 troops that, in many cases, had departed under fierce attack from the Ukrainian military units that retook the territory.

“We believe they are all out,” one senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational issues.

Russia now has about 30 battalion tactical groups — as many as 30,000 troops — in the east, the senior Pentagon official said. Earlier this week, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said Russia would most likely send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east” in the coming weeks.

Largely in anticipation of this next major phase of the war, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been used with high success in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.

NATO foreign ministers, meeting this week, have been discussing how to further help Ukraine prosecute the war without entangling the alliance in direct combat with Russian forces.

The war, they said, is far from over, noting that however badly Russia’s forces have performed, and their retreat from areas around Kyiv notwithstanding, they are making slow and brutal progress in the east.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general.

Ukrainian officials in a number of areas, including Mykolayiv in the south and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, have been sharing schedules of planned evacuations or links to online portals for people to sign up to join buses and trains that are transporting residents to safer places.

But in some besieged cities in the south, like Mariupol, it is already nearly impossible to leave, making evacuations sporadic and risky.

Attempts by the Red Cross to enter Mariupol to supervise civilian departures have repeatedly been scrubbed, leaving fearful residents to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, 500 people who had escaped Mariupol to join a Red Cross convoy in the nearby city of Berdyansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 100 miles away.

The climate of fear gripping Mariupol has spread to the region of Kherson, near the Black Sea, where people have lived under occupation by Russian forces since they encircled and entered the city and its suburbs on March 2.

“Anyone who did not leave early is now stuck here,” said Evgeniya Selivantseva, a doctor from Velyka Lepetyka, a village on the Dnipro River, in the Kherson region.

Dr. Selivantseva, 38, described a deepening humanitarian crisis in the village: Gasoline stations have run out of fuel, and food and medical supplies are running low. Food is so scarce that local leaders have started a makeshift flour mill.

“We feel helpless and totally defenseless,” she said. “People are afraid to leave their homes.”

The proposed European Union ban on Russian coal, part of the bloc’s effort to further penalize Russia over atrocities in Ukraine, reflected a choice of an imported energy source that would be the easiest to replace.

Deliberations over the ban and other sanctions were set to continue into Thursday, and European Union officials and diplomats anticipated that the measures would be approved. The process reflected the challenges of reaching agreement among all 27 member nations on the penalties, which would also include banning Russian ships from E.U. ports.

If approved, the sanctions would be the harshest enforced by the bloc since the invasion.

Though the European Union depends on Russian coal, the bloc could find substitute imports more easily than for natural gas and oil.

But banning coal from Russia could send energy prices soaring for European consumers, given the existing shortages in the bloc, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Carlos Torres Diaz, a senior vice president at Rystad, called the potential sanctions “a double-edged sword.”

As the brutal war in Ukraine continues, NATO countries have gradually been ramping up their military assistance and are now supplying a range of weapons, drones and vehicles to Kyiv.

Britain will send Ukraine more weapons worth £100million and will work to get more tanks to Kyiv in the face of Russian war crimes, Boris Johnson revealed tonight.

He pledged high-tech supplies including more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles, anti-tank rockets and drones as he hosted a joint press conference with German chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also confirmed today that the UK will send Mastiff armoured vehicles to Ukraine.

Speaking to Sky News, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: 'We will be sending armoured vehicles, protective armoured vehicles - such as Mastiff - to make sure that Ukraine has that support.

'It's very important that we do what we can to help Ukraine and where they ask us for equipment, if we've got it or we can help other people provide it, we'll do that.'

Additional support is also expected to be announced in the coming days, as the war enters what Foreign Secretary Liz Truss calls 'a new and difficult phase'.

Speaking to The Times, a senior government source said: 'The next three weeks will be critical. [The Ukrainians] have already partly won. They have exhausted the Russian army, won the battle of occupation and condemned Putin to eternal isolation. Can they push back the Russian army? Can they break the Russian army? Possibly. Depends on what help we can all give.'

Earlier this week it was also announced that Britain has joined with the US and Australia to develop hypersonic missiles, as well as the technology to shoot them down, known as 'counter-hypersonics'.

United Kingdom

Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapons (NLAW)

More than 4,000 supplied to Ukraine

Combat range of up to 2,624ft

Expected cost of £120 million

So far, the UK has supplied more than 4,000 NLAW anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. NLAWs were developed in 2002 by Saab, and are described as a 'single-soldier, short-range, anti-tank weapon system'

Since January, the UK has supplied more than 4,000 NLAW anti-tank missiles to Ukraine.

NLAWs were developed in 2002 by Saab, and are described as a 'single-soldier, short-range, anti-tank weapon system.'

The weapons can be operated from almost any position, and weigh just 27.5lbs, meaning they easily be transported on foot.

Lars-Orjan Hovbrandt, Technical Sales Support Manager for Ground Combat within Saab, explained: 'With NLAW, you don't need a platoon to attack tanks. You can train an ordinary soldier to use the system in an hour.

'And then you can have NLAW-equipped soldiers across the entire environment waiting for a tank to advance. There could be an NLAW equipped soldier behind any rock or bush.'

Javelin missiles

'Small consignment' sent to Ukraine

Additional 4,600 sent from the US

£130,000 ($175,000) each just for the missile

Last month, the UK government confirmed that alongisde the NLAWs, it was also sending a 'small consignment' of Javelin missiles to Ukraine

Javelin missiles use a 'curveball' shot - approaching their target from above - which makes them especially deadly against tanks which have less armour on the top. They also have two warheads which are designed to overcome 'reactive' armour that Russia uses

Last month, the UK government confirmed that alongside the NLAWs, it was also sending a 'small consignment' of Javelin missiles to Ukraine.

Like NLAWs, Javelin missiles are fired from the shoulder, but have a longer range of up to 8,000ft.

Lockheed Martin, which developed the Javelin missile, describes it as the 'world's premier shoulder-fired anti-armour system.'

'Using an arched top-attack profile, Javelin climbs above its target for improved visibility and then strikes where the armor is weakest,' Lockheed Martin explained.

'To fire, the gunner places a cursor over the selected target. The Javelin command launch unit then sends a lock-on-before-launch signal to the missile. With its soft launch design, Javelin can be safely fired from inside buildings or bunkers.'

Starstreak anti-air missiles

Top speeds of 2,300mph (Mach 3)

Range of up to 22,965ft

Three laser-guided projectiles allow for multiple hits on targets

The third type of missile provided by the UK is the STARStreak Short Range Air Defence High Velocity Missile - although it remains unclear how many have been sent over

The third type of missile provided by the UK is the STARStreak Short Range Air Defence High Velocity Missile - although it remains unclear how many have been sent over.

This high-velocity weapon features three laser-guided projectiles for multiple hits on targets, with top speeds of Mach 3 (2,300mph).

'The missile itself comprises three tungsten darts, released from a carrier which is powered by a rocket motor,' explained Thales, the manufacturer of the weapon.

'The darts are accelerated to a speed in excess of Mach 3.0 and the fire control system's laser beam riding guidance ensures exceptional accuracy whilst being almost totally resistant to countermeasures.'

Mastiff vehicles

UK sending in armoured vehicles

Sensitive equipment stripped

Armed with latest weapon systems

The UK has confirmed that it is sending protected patrol vehicles called Mastiffs to Ukraine. Mastiff is a heavily armoured, six by six wheel-drive patrol vehicle which can carry eight troops plus two crew

The British hardware heading to Ukraine Harpoon anti-ship missiles: Fitted with a 500lb high explosive blast warhead, the system is carried by 600 Nato warships and 180 submarines around the world. The 15ft missiles are accurate to a range of 70 miles. Mastiff armoured patrol vehicles: Designed to be impregnable of the battlefield, it was developed after hundreds of British troops were killed or wounded by Taliban IEDs while in vehicles equipped with inferior armour. The vehicle has a top speed of 50mph and is armed with a 7.62mm general purpose machine gun, 12.7mm heavy machine gun or 40mm grenade launcher. Other vehicles may include the smaller Ridgback and the faster Husky: Reconnaissance vehicles such as the Jackal may also be sent. Advertisement

The UK has confirmed that it is sending protected patrol vehicles called Mastiffs to Ukraine.

Sensitive equipment will be stripped from the vehicles and British soldiers sent to a neighbouring country of Ukraine to carry out training, a defence source said.

Mastiff is a heavily armoured, six by six wheel-drive patrol vehicle which can carry eight troops plus two crew.

'Mastiff has a maximum speed of 90kph, is armed with the latest weapon systems, including a 7.62mm general purpose machine gun, 12.7mm heavy machine gun or 40mm automatic grenade launcher,' the UK army website explains.

Harpoon anti-ship missiles - POSSIBLE

Sources say UK has agreed to send Harpoon anti-ship missiles

Fitted with 500lbs high explosive blast warhead

Carried by 600 Nato warships

According to sources, the UK has agreed to send Harpoon anti-ship missiles in a bid to break the Russian navy's siege of Black Sea ports.

Fitted with a 500lb high explosive blast warhead, the system is carried by 600 Nato warships and 180 submarines around the world.

The 15ft missiles are accurate to a range of 70 miles.

Hypersonic weapons - POSSIBLE

Top speeds of 3,800mph – at least five times the speed of sound

Can carry either conventional explosives or nuclear warheads

Timeline unclear

Speaking to MailOnline, Dr James Bosbotinis, an Independent Specialist in Defence and International Affairs, explained what Britain's hypersonic missiles are likely to look like. The UK could opt for a scramjet hypersonic missile, much like the US's X-51A, which it successfully tested in September 2021

What are hypersonic missiles? Hypersonic missiles can travel at staggering speeds of 3,800mph – at least five times the speed of sound – and carry either conventional explosives or nuclear warheads. Their speed and ability to fly at low altitudes puts them beyond the line of sight of ground-based radars, making them harder to defend against. Hypersonic missiles come in two variants - hypersonic cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles. 1. Hypersonic cruise missiles Hypersonic cruise missiles reach speeds in excess of Mach 5 with the help of a high-speed jet engine. 2. Hypersonic glide vehicles Hypersonic glide vehicles are launched into space by a rocket on an arching trajectory. As the warheads are released, they fall towards the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. The warheads are attached to a glide vehicle, which re-enters the atmosphere, and rides the shockwaves generated by its own lift as it breaches the speed of sound. Advertisement

Britain has joined with the US and Australia to develop hypersonic missiles, as well as the technology to shoot them down, known as 'counter-hypersonics'.

Speaking to MailOnline, Dr James Bosbotinis, an Independent Specialist in Defence and International Affairs, explained what Britain's hypersonic missiles are likely to look like.

Hypersonic missiles come in two variants – hypersonic cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles.

Hypersonic cruise missiles, such as the scramjet X-51A – which was developed by Boeing and successfully tested by the US in September 2021 – reach speeds in excess of Mach 5 with the help of a high-speed jet engine.

Meanwhile, hypersonic glide vehicles are launched into space by a rocket on an arching trajectory. As the warheads are released, they fall towards the atmosphere at hypersonic speeds.

Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Bosbotinis explained that a powered cruise missile is most likely for the UK.

'In terms of options for a UK hypersonic weapon, a powered cruise missile is more likely,' he said.

'The UK would look to launch such missiles from combat aircraft such as the Typhoon and potentially from the vertical launch silos of the forthcoming Type 26 City-class frigate (due to enter service from 2027/28).'

While the UK government is yet to disclose which companies is working on the hypersonic missiles, it has worked with several leading munitions suppliers in the past.

According to Statista, in 2020, BAE Systems was the leading supplier (13.5 per cent) to the Ministry of Defence, followed by Babcock (8.2 per cent), Rolls Roys (3.3 per cent), Airbus (3.3 per cent) and Lockheed Martin (3 per cent).

Hypersonic missiles (purple line) are much less likely to be detected by radars than intercontinental ballistic missiles (white dotted line) thanks to their speed and ability to fly at low altitudes. China is working on a fractional orbital bombardment system (green line), which sends missiles into a partial orbit of the Earth to strike from an unexpected direction

Lockheed Martin has previously worked with the US Air Force on a hypersonic weapon, called the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, which is a boost glide weapon that is propelled to a maximum speed of more than Mach 20 by a missile before gliding towards its target.

Meanwhile, BAE Systems has previously developed the Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) - a medium-range, surface-to-air missile developed to protect warships from advanced anti-ship cruise missiles.

While Dr Bosbotinis wasn't able to provide an estimate for the cost of developing a hypersonic missile, he advised that such a projectile would be 'costly'.

'Hypersonic weapons are not cheap, the materials and manufacturing processes involved mean that they are highly complex and thus costly weapons,' he said.

United States

Stinger anti-aircraft systems

More than 1,400 sent to Ukraine

Famously used in Afghanistan

Effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft

The US has provided more than 1,400 Stinger missiles - lightweight, self-contained air defense missiles that are most effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft

The US has provided more than 1,400 Stinger missiles - lightweight, self-contained air defense missiles that are most effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft.

'The Stinger missile has a greater than 90 per cent success rate in reliability and training tests,' explained Raytheon, the developer of the missile.

'Its supersonic speed, agility and a highly accurate guidance and control system give the weapon an operational edge against cruise missiles and all classes of aircraft.'

Stinger missiles were famously used in Afghanistan, where they helped to bring down hundreds of Russian aircraft and helicopters during the Soviet occupation.

AT-4 anti-armour system

More than 6,000 sent to Ukraine

Disposable, single-shot launcher

Readily deployed in over 15 countries

More than 6,000 AT-4 missiles have been provided to Ukraine by the US. These single-shot weapons are fully disposable and can be used by soldiers of 'any experience level', according to its developer, Saab

More than 6,000 AT-4 missiles have been provided to Ukraine by the US.

These single-shot weapons are fully disposable and can be used by soldiers of 'any experience level', according to its developer, Saab.

'For any experience level, a dismounted soldier simply aims, fires and destroys the target before discarding the empty tube. AT4 is truly characterised by its ease of use and handling,' it explained.

As part of an $800 million assistance package, announced on March 16, the US has also sent Ukraine 2,000 Javelin missiles and 1,000 light anti-armour weapons.

Switchblade drones

100 tactical unmanned aerial systems sent

Small drones are hand-launched and size of a baguette

Fitted with explosive warhead

One hundred switchblade drones are also included in the US's $800 million assistance package. These tactical unmanned aerial systems are fitted with explosive warheads, and at around the size of a baguette, can be hand-launched

One hundred switchblade drones are also included in the US's $800 million assistance package.

These tactical unmanned aerial systems are fitted with explosive warheads, and at around the size of a baguette, can be hand-launched.

AeroVironment, the firm behind the drones, said: 'Supporting conventional or special operations forces in the field or from fixed defensive positions, the combat-proven Switchblade 300 with patented wave-off feature is the ideal loitering missile for use against beyond-line-of-sight targets.

'Backpackable and rapidly deployable from air, sea or ground platforms, Switchblade 300 delivers increased warfighter lethality with real-time GPS coordinates and video for precise targeting with low collateral effects.'

The most powerful version of the Switchblade drone can travel at speeds of up to 115mph and has a range of 50 miles, while a lighter version has a range of six miles.

Mi-17 helicopters

Five Mi-17 helicopters

Top speed of 280mph

Can reach altitudes of 20,000ft

Five Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters have been transferred from the defunct Afghan Air Force to Ukraine, probably for use as transports

This Russian-made helicopter has been in production since 1975, and can be found all around the world.

They were used by the Afghan Air Force and five were withdrawn last year, as part of the U.S. draw down, and delivered to Ukraine, where pilots are familiar with Soviet-era aircraft.

It has a top speed of 280 miles per hour, and can operate at altitudes up to 20,000 feet.

It is used mostly as a transport but there are armed gunship versions in use around the world.

Patrol boats

Three patrol boats

Delivered to Ukraine last year

Top speed of almost 30 knots

Last year, two refitted former U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats were delivered to bolster the Ukrainian Navy

Last year, two refitted former U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats were delivered to bolster the Ukrainian Navy.

The two Island-class cutters have a top speed of almost 30 knots and Reuters reported at the time that Ukrainian sailors had already been trained on the vessels in the U.S.

Last month, President Biden revealed they were 'armed.'

Counter-artillery and counter-unmanned aerial system tracking radars

Four counter-artillery sent

Include devices to counter Russian drones

Counter-battery radar can locate hostile batteries up to about 30 miles away depending on weather and terrain.

No further details were revealed about the systems, other than they also include devices to counter Russian drones.

Humvees and other vehicles

At leasts 35 arrived last year

Total of some 70 Humvees sent

The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle is a highly mobile, high-performance, air-droppable family of tactical vehicles. It is better known as the Humvee

The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle is a highly mobile, high-performance, air-droppable family of tactical vehicles. It is better known as the Humvee.

It has been in service with the U.S. military since 1983, and fully loaded has a top speed of 55 miles per hour.

At least 35 arrived in a shipment last year, and in total some 70 Humvees have been sent to Ukraine.

Czech Republic

T-72 tanks

Reportedly sent more than a dozen T-72 tanks

Most widely used main battle tank in the world

9M119 Svir or 9M119M Refleks guided missiles

The Czech Republic has become the first NATO country to send tanks to Ukraine, providing T-72 and armoured infantry vehicles following President Zelensky's plea for help (pictured, tanks loaded on a train bound for Ukraine)

First made in Russia, the T-72 is staple of eastern European militaries and is owned by the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria.

Most of these are the T-72M standard model, which are slightly behind Russia's updated T-72B3 versions that have been used in Ukraine.

The Czech Republic has ordered 35 tanks upgraded to T-72M4 CZ, giving the tank a comprehensive upgrade in every aspect and costing more than $5million per tank.

It is understood the tanks Prague has sent to Ukraine are not the T-72M4 but have undergone some local modifications.

BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles

Five BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles sent

Light combat amphibious vehicle

Equipped with 73 mm cannon type 71 with a smooth barrel, coupled 7.62 mm PKT tank machine gun

Last week, the Czech Republic sent five BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles over to Ukraine. The BVP-1 is a light combat amphibious tracked vehicle, equipped with huge weaponry and armoured protection

Last week, the Czech Republic sent five BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles over to Ukraine.

The BVP-1 is a light combat amphibious tracked vehicle, equipped with huge weaponry and armoured protection.

The Ministry of Defence & Armed Forces of the Czech Republic said: 'Its capabilities increase the firepower and movement operations of mechanised units even if weapons of mass destruction were used.'

The vehicle is equipped with a 73 mm cannon type 71 with a smooth barrel, coupled 7.62 mm PKT tank machine gun and a launching rail for anti-tank guided missiles.

Turkey

Bayraktar TB2 drones

First shipments arrived in Ukraine in 2019, with dozens sent to Ukraine since

Estimated cost of $2 million each

Significant impact throughout the early days of the Russian invasion

The first shipments of the Turkish-made drones began arriving in Ukraine in 2019, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The TB2 aircraft are able to stay in the air for 25 hours at a height of 25,000 feet with the pilot able to control it from several hundred miles away.

Ukraine's use of the drones contributed to its early successes in slowing the Russian advance, according to military analysts.

Aaron Stein, director of research at the US Foreign Policy Research Institute, described the Bayraktar TB2 drones as the 'Toyota Corolla of drones'.

He said: 'It doesn't do everything that your high-end sports car does, but it does 80 per cent of that. So even for a high-end military, like the US the basic concept of using in an attritable, cheap platform to strike a superior force has inherent value.'

Other countries

In total, more than 30 countires have provided military aid to Ukraine. This includes:

Germany

Germany has broken its long-standing foreign policy of banning all exports of lethal weapons to conflict zones. So far, it has delivered 1,000 anti-tank rocket launchers, 500 Stinger missiles, 14 armoured vehicles and nine Howitzers.

Sweden

Like Germany, Sweden has broken with its neutral stance amid the conflict. At the end of March, Sweden's Defence Minister confirmed that it will provide Ukraine with an additional 5,000 anti-tank weapons.

France

While France has refused to detail its military support Ukraine, it has committed defence equipment and fuel support.

Belgium

The Belgian government has promised 2,000 machine guns, 3,800 tons of fuel, 3,000 additional automatic rifles and 200 anti-tank weapons.

Netherlands

The Netherlands has already sent protective equipment to Ukraine, and has promised to provide 200 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles.

Portugal

Portugal has offered protective equipment such as bulletproof vests and helmets as well as night vision goggles, grenades and ammunition to Ukraine.

With Russia’s attack on Ukraine in its sixth week, however, there remains a significant chasm between what Kyiv says it needs to win the war and what the West says it can provide.

“There’s obviously a lot more the U.S. could be doing,” said Steven Horrell, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis and a former U.S. naval intelligence officer. “The balancing point from those who are making the decisions is ‘would that or would that not be more escalatory?’”

The U.S. and Europe continue to focus largely on sanctions and other penalties meant to cripple the Kremlin’s economy and make the country an international pariah in response to alleged war crimes at the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Military support for Ukraine has also steadily increased during the war, but — short of the fighter jets and no-fly zone that Kyiv has requested — Ukrainian officials have warned Western leaders they too will have blood on their hands if they do not do more.

Earlier this week, news broke that the Czech Republic has been quietly sending old Soviet-designed tanks into Ukraine — the first time another country had provided the vehicles to Kyiv since the Kremlin began its invasion on Feb. 24. And the Biden administration on Tuesday said it would send up to $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, its fourth such lethal aid package to the country since the war began, after confirming that it sent more than 100 switchblade drones.

Photos of civilians apparently killed execution-style by Russian troops in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha have drawn fresh outrage over the Kremlin’s attack on Ukraine. Images of the fallen suggested Russian troops had indiscriminately tortured, shot and killed individuals during their occupation of the town, and satellite images indicated that bodies had been left in the streets for weeks, contradicting Moscow’s claims that the photos were staged.

The United States and other countries quickly moved to punish Russia, with the Biden administration on Wednesday announcing a wave of new sanctions targeting Russia’s two largest banks, Putin’s two adult daughters and family members of Russia’s top diplomat, as well as blacklisting members of Russia’s Security Council.

“I made clear that Russia would pay a severe and immediate price for its atrocities in Bucha,” President Biden tweeted in revealing the sanctions.

Biden’s action follows that of European Union leaders, who on Tuesday said they planned to phase out Russian coal imports. Some countries also moved to expel groups of so-called Russian “intelligence officers” registered as diplomats. Greece, Denmark, Italy, France and Germany all pushed out such individuals this week.

And the United Kingdom, a country no longer part of the E.U., revealed its own new sanctions, including a freeze on Russia’s largest bank and a pledge to end Kremlin oil and coal imports by the end of the year.

But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in an emotionally charged speech to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, called for more to be done and for the body to expel Russia.

“Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It is not there, though there is a Security Council,” Zelensky said in a fiery speech that referenced citizens thrown into wells and “crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road,” and women “raped and killed in front of their children.”

In addition to harsher penalties for Russia, Zelensky has pushed for the transfer of larger weapons including fighter jets, tanks and missile defense systems.

Though Russia has the military advantage over Ukraine due to its larger troop numbers and more advanced weapons, the Ukrainian forces have been able to hold major cities through sheer will and billions of dollars’ worth of Western-supplied weapons.

Zelensky weeks ago stopped publicly pressing NATO to enforce a no-fly zone in the skies over Ukraine – a step the United States and the alliance could quickly escalate and expand the war – but the Ukrainian leader continues to plead for major defense systems to hold Kremlin troops at bay.

In particular, Kyiv wants Soviet-designed MiG-29 fighter jets and S-300 long-range air defense systems currently scattered around the continent, weapons they are already familiar with and are trained to use.

Those asks, however, have been met with resistance. The U.S. has outright rejected Poland’s plans from March to transfer its entire fleet of MiG-29s to a U.S. base in Germany to then be sent to Ukraine, calling the idea not “tenable.”

And the U.S. has sought to have Slovakia provide its S-300 systems to Ukraine, but the NATO ally wants a guarantee it will quickly get a “proper replacement” for the system. There has yet to be a public agreement between the two countries.

Zelensky later denounced the West for its “ping-pong about who and how should hand over jets and other defensive weapons to us.”

Horrell, the former naval intelligence officer, called it a “negative” that the U.S. has consistently said what it would and wouldn’t do in response to Russia’s invasion.

“Sadly, I think that’s not productive.” Horrell told The Hill. “Everything that we take off the table represents an advantage for [Putin].”

But the clear scenes of Russian brutality have prompted Western countries to take further action to try to bring the war to an end, he noted.

“The recent decision for the Czechs to send T-72 tanks, it reflects that it’s just been one more thing crystallizing the West’s reaction and response in favor of Ukraine.”",https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3261319-allies-up-military-support-amid-emerging-atrocities-in-ukraine/

8,902f1fa9-79a0-49fb-bda8-fab090401656,"['Valerie Insinna', 'Jaspreet Gill', 'Millennium Space Systems', 'Breaking Defense']",2022-04-06 15:03:11+00:00,"LOS ANGELES: Obsolete parts and workforce issues are presenting a problem for the United States as it considers ramping up production of the shoulder mounted Stinger anti-aircraft system in order to surge weapons for Ukraine and replenish US stocks, the Pentagon’s No. 2 official said Tuesday.

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, US and NATO-provided munitions such as the Raytheon-made Stinger have been integral for Ukrainian forces as they attempt to retain control of their airspace against the larger, better equipped Russian military.

However, lawmakers’ concerns about the US military’s own dwindling stockpile has raised questions about how best to replenish the munitions — questions that Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks said the Pentagon is still in the process of figuring out how to resolve, particularly with regard to Stinger.

“There are some very specific issues with regard to Stinger and some obsolescence issues that we have to overcome,” Hicks told traveling press, including Breaking Defense, on Tuesday. “That’s because we in the US, we’re focusing ourselves forward on new capability. So now we want to make sure we can produce, or see what it takes to produce, what we need for this crisis.”

Another issue, Hicks added, is that the US defense industry has been focused on building the more advanced munitions the US military has been procuring in recent years, whereas producing older weaponry like the 1970s era Stinger requires different skills.

“Transitioning that workforce over to the munitions that are appropriate for the Ukraine fight, that requires some shift of priority and training,” she said.

“We’ve had a lot of opportunity between the [Pentagon’s acquisition and sustainment] community… and the policy community to start thinking about how we work with other armaments directors in Europe and elsewhere to understand what they have, to start to understand the supply chain interrelationships, and see if we can speed some of that up.”

In a House Armed Services Committee hearing earlier on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers that the Pentagon is working with industry to figure out how to expedite the projected schedule for replenishing munitions stockpiles that have dwindled due to Ukraine.

“I’m optimistic that we’ll be able to truncate, you know, the forecasted timelines that we got early on,” he said. “We’re working this very hard. Industry has been responsive. And if we need additional help or authorities from Congress, we won’t hesitate to ask.”

The comments from Hicks and Austin came just hours before the Biden administration announced an additional $100 million for Javelin anti-tank weapons for Ukraine, which Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby characterized in a statement as an urgent need. So far, the United States has provided $1.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion started on Feb. 24, and more than $2.4 billion since the Biden administration began in 2021.

Stinger Production Line: Can it Even Be Restarted?

While Javelin — which is made by a Lockheed Martin-Raytheon joint venture — remains in production for the US military, the US Army and Marine Corps have not bought Stinger systems for decades. Today, the Stinger production line services only a single international customer, who has sourced and provided many of the obsolescent parts needed to build its own Stingers.

Because Stinger is made with number of components that are no longer in production, there is a finite number of Stingers that could be manufactured with the existing parts available on the market.

There are also concerns that — due to the workforce considerations referenced by Hicks — Ukraine could need Stingers more quickly than the US could replenish its own stockpile, leading to a deficit. In the months since the conflict started, the United States has provided Ukraine about 2,000 Stingers, but it currently takes 18 to 24 months to produce a single production lot of Stinger missiles, CNN reported on March 28.

A source told Breaking Defense that the production process involves very little automation, with artisans fabricating Stingers together by hand.

In March, HASC Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., and Ranking Member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., implored Pentagon leadership to begin working on a modern short range air defense system that could replace Stinger. They called the issue “a matter of the highest urgency” and stipulated that the new system be low-cost, exportable and ready in 36 months.

The fiscal 2022 budget, which was signed into law last month, earmarked $3.5 billion for the Pentagon to replenish munitions given to Ukraine. That money should be used to find new parts and production methods that could bridge the gap between Stinger and a modern system, a senior congressional aide told Breaking Defense last week.

“If we’re waiting for the FY23 [National Defense Authorization Act] to get this problem fixed, we’ve waited way too long and wasted months,” the aide said. “If we’re spending six months dithering then it’s too late, and we wasted half a year. We don’t have that wiggle room.”",https://breakingdefense.com/2022/04/no-easy-answer-for-ramping-up-stinger-production-pentagon-no-2-says/
