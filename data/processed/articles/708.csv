NATO is expected to discuss enhancements of the military, humanitarian, and financial support they are giving Ukraine, officials said, while stiffening economic sanctions on President Vladimir Putin and Russia.

In a string of Sunday show interviews, U.S. and global security officials also said potential NATO topics include the prospect of deploying a peacekeeping force in Ukraine and the chances of Russian-Ukrainian peace talks. They again warned Russia against the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, speaking on NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" said ""we haven't yet decided on the exact format of that summit,"" but it will be a ""platform to demonstrate our unity, our support to Ukraine, but also our readiness to protect and defend all NATO allies.""

Proclaiming unity within the U.S.-European military alliance, Stoltenberg said ""by sending that message, we are preventing an escalation of the conflict to a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia.""

U.S. President Joe Biden is scheduled to attend the summit Thursday in Brussels.

Heading into the summit, Poland has proposed creation of a peacekeeping force, but officials said they do not know if NATO is willing to take such provocative action at this point.

Marek Magierowski, Poland's ambassador to the United States, told CNN's ""State of the Union: ""It's a very preliminary concept.""

U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, also on CNN, said American troops will not be sent to Ukraine.

Biden ""has been very clear that we will not put American troops on the ground in Ukraine,"" Thomas-Greenfield said when asked about the prospect of a peacekeeping force. ""We don't want to escalate this into a war with the United States.""

War in Ukraine:Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion

Global security officials expressed more hope for peace talks involving Putin and Ukraine, though they acknowledged that negotiations are also in the preliminary stages.

Citing Turkey's willingness to facilitate negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, Stoltenberg told NBC that ""it's far too early to say whether these or other talks can lead to any concrete outcome.""

Biden's schedule for this week's trip to Europe is still being finalized, but officials confirmed that it will not include a visit to Ukraine itself. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki tweeted that ""the trip will be focused on continuing to rally the world in support of the Ukrainian people and against President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, but there are no plans to travel into Ukraine.""

While in Brussels, Biden will also attend a summit of the European Council.

As they prepare for their conference, NATO and U.S. officials also took opportunities to repeat warnings to Russia from Biden and others against the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. They did not specify what the reaction of NATO, the U.S., or other countries might be.

Chemical weapons ""would be a blatant and brutal violation of international law,"" Stoltenberg said on NBC. But he added that NATO wants to avoid turning ""a very bloody, ugly, horrific conflict in Ukraine to something that turns out to be a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia in Europe and potentially involving, of course, the United States directly.""

He added: ""That would be extremely dangerous and that’s exactly what we need to prevent.""",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/20/war-ukraine-nato-discuss-more-support-against-russian-invasion/7112857001/

NATO member states are pumping more military, humanitarian, and financial support for Ukraine, the alliance's Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, revealed Sunday.

""NATO allies are stepping up their support to Ukraine partly be delivering military support, humanitarian support and billions and billions of financial support to Ukraine,"" said Stoltenberg to NBC News.

The NATO chief claimed that the alliance's responsibility was to ensure that the Ukraine crisis did not get out of control and spread beyond the Ukrainian borders.

""Our allies support Ukraine, but at the same time it is extremely important that we prevent this conflict becoming a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia,"" Stoltenberg noted, toying with the possibility to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, although Washington affirmed its disinterest in such a move.

No no-fly zone? Send us aircraft, defense systems: Zelensky to US

If a no-fly zone is too much for Ukraine to ask for, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the US Congress on Wednesday, then Kiev could be given aircraft and S-300 air defense systems.

""Is this a lot to ask for to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative. You know what kind of defense systems we need - S-300 and other similar systems,"" he told the US legislative body.

He also stressed that the Americans know how much the battlefield depends on the ability to have access to the airspace. ""Powerful strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom, our land, aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe,"" he claimed during a videoconference with Congress.

Zelensky noted that Washington knew the equipment existed, ""But they are on the ground, not in the Ukrainian sky.""

In response, the United States and its NATO allies are sending surface-to-air missile systems to Ukraine, including Soviet-era systems, such as the SA-8 and the SA-12 systems, CNN reported Wednesday, citing a senior US official.

But Ukrainian forces are doing ""well"", they say, to take small towns back from Russian forces. In coming days, they expect a focus more on Russian forces manoeuvring in the east of the country.

Russia has been frustrated in its plan to move on three axes simultaneously and may focus more on the east. A concern is that if the Russian forces make breakthroughs, they could surround the main Ukrainian fighting force, the JFO, in the east, the official said.

6,b3d6a716-1fbc-4d13-a4fc-d4c376f4e7bc,[],,"NATO is a political and military alliance, whose principal task is to ensure the protection of its citizens and to promote security and stability in the North Atlantic area. The Alliance must be able to address the full spectrum of current and future challenges and threats from any direction, simultaneously. The Alliance continues to strengthen its deterrence and defence posture in light of the changed and evolving security environment.

Russia’s aggression against Ukraine poses the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades, shattering peace in Europe and reinforcing the need for NATO to ensure that its deterrence and defence posture is credible and effective.

In response, NATO has activated its defence plans, deployed elements of the NATO Response Force and significantly increased the number of forces on its eastern flank.

On 24 March 2022, at an extraordinary summit about Russia’s war on Ukraine, NATO leaders agreed to deploy four battalions in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to the four already present in the Baltic States and Poland. More generally, they decided to take measures to ensure the security and defence of all Allies across all domains, reinforcing the Alliance’s longer-term deterrence and defence posture.

NATO continues to face distinct threats and challenges emanating from all strategic directions; from state and non-state actors; from military forces and from terrorist, cyber and hybrid attacks.

Two military concepts set the direction for NATO’s ongoing evolution: the Concept for Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area focuses on force employment to deter and defend today, while the NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept offers a vision to guide the Alliance’s long-term warfare development to remain militarily strong now and in the future

At the Brussels Summit in 2021, NATO leaders approved the “NATO 2030” initiative, which has led to the introduction of additional measures to ensure NATO remains strong militarily, becomes even stronger politically and adopts a more global approach to security.

European Allies and Canada have made considerable progress in increasing defence spending and investing in major equipment, taking steps toward fairer burden-sharing within NATO: 2021 was their seventh consecutive year of increased defence spending, with a cumulative extra contribution of USD 190 billion since 2014.

A rapidly changing security environment

NATO faces the most complex security environment since the end of the Cold War. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is jeopardising European security, and terrorism continues to represent a global security challenge and a threat to stability. At the same time, the rise of China is shifting the global balance of power, with implications for the Alliance's security, values and way of life. Growing global uncertainty, more sophisticated and disruptive cyber and hybrid threats, and exponential technological change are having a substantial impact on the Alliance.

Russia's military aggression against Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe and is causing enormous human suffering and destruction. It is the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security and the rules-based international order in decades. To the south, the security situation in the Middle East and Africa has deteriorated due to a combination of factors that are causing loss of life, fuelling large-scale migration flows and inspiring terrorist attacks in Allied countries and elsewhere.

Safeguarding the freedom and security of its members

NATO's essential and enduring purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and military means. Collective defence is at the heart of the Alliance, as set out in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. NATO's greatest responsibility is to protect and defend Allied territory and populations against attack in a world where peace and security cannot be taken for granted.

Deterrence is a core element of NATO's overall strategy: preventing conflict and war, protecting Allies, maintaining freedom of decision and action, and upholding the principles and values it stands for – individual liberty, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Free societies and the rules-based international order need to be backed by credible transatlantic defence.

NATO's capacity to deter and defend is supported by an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional, and missile defence capabilities, which complement each other, and is underpinned by an array of civil and military resources to support these capabilities and the posture more broadly. NATO also maintains the freedom of action and flexibility to respond to the full spectrum of challenges with an appropriate and tailored approach.

Resilience: the first line of deterrence and defence

Enhancing resilience by strengthening the capacity of societies to absorb the full range of threats and hazards is an integral part of NATO's deterrence and defence posture. At its peak, the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of resilience, including the ability to deal with mass casualties or ensuring the continuity of civil supply chains. At the same time, resilience impacts NATO's ability to conduct its missions and maintain the mobility of its troops and equipment. It requires close civil-military cooperation, and the effort of the whole of government and society to assure overall resilience. Since 2014, NATO has been providing guidelines to assist national authorities in improving their resilience across seven baseline requirements by reducing potential vulnerabilities.

NATO responded to the COVID-19 crisis by protecting military personnel, facilitating the airlift of critical medical supplies, and harnessing resources to deliver innovative responses. Allied armed forces supported civilian efforts with logistics and planning, field hospitals and hospital ships, transport for patients, repatriation of citizens abroad, disinfection of public areas, and at border crossings. These efforts helped to increase the national resilience of Allies, while the operational readiness of the Alliance remained undiminished. Lessons learned from Allies' experiences with the pandemic are important for the Alliance to continue to address hybrid activities as well as future challenges that target Allies' civil societies.

Bolstering NATO's readiness, responsiveness and reinforcement

The Readiness Action Plan (RAP), launched at the Wales Summit in 2014, was a major driver for change in the Alliance's deterrence and defence posture. The RAP was initiated to ensure the Alliance is ready to respond swiftly and firmly to new security challenges from the east and from the south.

Building on the RAP, NATO Heads of State and Government approved a strengthened deterrence and defence posture at the Warsaw Summit in July 2016. It is providing the Alliance with a broad range of options to be able to respond to any threats from wherever they arise to protect Alliance territory, populations, airspace and sea lines of communication. For instance, since 2017 four multinational battlegroups have been deployed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, and measures have also been taken to reinforce security in the south-eastern region of the Alliance. Furthermore, a number of measures have been undertaken to adapt the Alliance to the challenges emanating from the south, including capacity-building, dedicated exercises and advance planning, as well as setting up the Regional Hub for the South in Naples, Italy, which contributes to NATO's situational awareness.

Exercises remain an integral part of NATO's deterrence and defence since military training is an essential requirement to maintain the Alliance's readiness levels and interoperability.

NATO's adaptation efforts continue in all domains and in areas such as civil preparedness and countering hybrid threats, including in cooperation with the European Union (EU). Relations with the EU include increased cooperation, as well as complementary and interoperable capability development to avoid duplication and contribute to transatlantic burden-sharing.

At the 2018 Brussels Summit, NATO Leaders reiterated their resolve to bolster the Alliance's readiness, responsiveness and reinforcement to respond to threats from any direction in a 360-degree approach. A NATO Readiness Initiative was launched to enhance the Alliance's rapid-response capability, either for reinforcement of Allies in support of deterrence or collective defence, including for high-intensity warfighting, or for rapid military crisis intervention, if required. Since then, Allies have committed to providing 30 mechanised battalions, 30 air squadrons and 30 battleships ready to use within 30 days or less and are working to build and maintain the level of readiness of these forces and organise them into larger formations.

NATO continues to address the security implications of Russia's growing arsenal of nuclear-capable missiles, which poses a significant risk to Alliance security and violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. The Alliance is responding by strengthening its advanced conventional capabilities, investing in new platforms – including fifth-generation fighter aircraft – and adapting its exercises, intelligence, and air and missile defence posture. It is doing so while ensuring its nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective. At the same time, NATO remains strongly committed to effective arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, and continues to call for all actors, including Russia and China, to engage constructively.

NATO has recognised cyberspace as a domain of operations in which it must defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land and at sea. The creation of a new Cyberspace Operations Centre in Belgium and the formation of counter-hybrid support teams to assist Allies in need also bolster the Alliance's deterrence efforts.

At the December 2019 Leaders' Meeting in London, NATO declared space as a fifth operational domain. The information gathered and delivered through satellites is critical for NATO activities, operations and missions, including collective defence, crisis response and counter-terrorism. In October 2020, defence ministers decided to establish a NATO Space Centre in Ramstein, Germany. This Centre will serve as a focal point for sharing information, coordinating Allies' efforts and supporting NATO's operations and missions.

In addition to the defensive measures they had already taken since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (which started on 24 February 2022), NATO leaders met in Brussels on 24 March 2022 to address the consequences of this brutal and unprovoked aggression and take measures to strengthen NATO’s deterrence and defence. They decided to deploy four multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to those already present in the Baltic States and Poland, effectively doubling the number of battlegroups on its eastern flank from four to eight. They also decided to step up cyber defences and scale up exercises focused on collective defence and interoperability. NATO leaders agreed on a number of measures, which will significantly strengthen the longer-term deterrence and defence posture of the Alliance, including the development of ready forces and capabilities necessary to maintain credible deterrence and defence.

Maintaining Alliance's military and technological edge

The Alliance continues to strengthen its deterrence and defence posture in light of the changed and evolving security environment. While the Alliance needs to be able to preserve peace today, it also needs to prepare for the increasingly unpredictable security environment of the future. Keeping its technological edge has always been an essential enabler of NATO's ability to deter and defend against potential adversaries. Innovations in artificial intelligence, autonomous weapons systems, big data and biotech are changing warfare. To help preserve its technological edge, NATO recently agreed an implementation strategy for emerging and disruptive technologies. The Alliance will play an important role as a forum for cooperation on various security-related aspects of these emerging technologies.

Investing in defence

The Defence Investment Pledge, adopted by NATO Leaders in 2014, called for all Allies to stop cuts to defence budgets and meet the NATO-agreed guideline of spending at least 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defence within a decade. Allies also agreed, in that same timeframe, to move towards spending at least 20% of annual defence expenditure on major new equipment, including related research and development. Finally, the Pledge committed Allies to ensuring that their land, air and maritime forces meet NATO-agreed guidelines for deployability, sustainability and other agreed metrics, and that their armed forces can operate together effectively, including through the implementation of NATO standards and doctrines.

Since 2014, Allies have made considerable progress in increasing defence spending and investing in major equipment, taking steps toward fairer burden-sharing. 2021 was the seventh consecutive year of increased defence spending by European Allies and Canada, which contributed a cumulative extra of USD 190 billion since 2014. Allies are not just delivering more of the heavier, high-end capabilities NATO needs; they are also improving the readiness, deployability, sustainability and interoperability of their forces. With heightened security threats and challenges, Allies have committed to accelerating efforts to meet the requirements of the 2014 Defence Investment Pledge and will submit plans in time for the Madrid Summit in June. The need to invest in defence remains essential to ensure the Alliance has the forces and capabilities it needs.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_133127.htm
7,b3d6a716-1fbc-4d13-a4fc-d4c376f4e7bc,[],,"Poland will formally propose a plan to organize an international peacekeeping mission in Ukraine at an emergency NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday, an idea that is at odds with the alliance’s official stance and one the United States rejected on Sunday.

Poland’s deputy prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, first proposed the idea when the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia traveled to Kyiv last week to meet with Ukraine’s leaders.

“I think that it is necessary to have a peace mission — NATO, possibly some wider international structure — but a mission that will be able to defend itself, which will operate on Ukrainian territory,” Mr Kaczynski said at a news conference in Kyiv.

So far, NATO has maintained that it will not send troops to Ukraine in fear that it may escalate tensions and be interpreted as an act of war against Russia.

“I can’t preview what decisions will be made at this NATO conference and how NATO will respond to the Polish proposal. What I can say is American troops will not be on the ground in Ukraine at this moment,” the US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told CNN on Sunday.

During a news conference on Thursday, Piotr Müller, a Polish government spokesman, made it clear that Poland is not advocating “getting into direct conflict with Russia.” The proposed peacekeeping mission would only be stationed in the parts of Ukraine which are not occupied by Russia, “to send a clear signal that war crimes will not be accepted” Mr Müller explained.

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, said during a news conference on Wednesday that while the alliance “supports peace efforts” and “calls on Russia and President Putin to withdraw its forces,” it has “no plans of deploying NATO troops on the ground in Ukraine.”

NATO has deployed peacekeeping missions to conflict-stricken countries in the past, such as Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the role of the troops was to ensure public safety and support international humanitarian efforts. However, these missions were usually launched after the end of military conflicts, and not while they were still in place.",http://cis.mit.edu/publications/analysis-opinion/2022/poland-will-propose-nato-peacekeeping-mission-ukraine-alliance%E2%80%99s
8,b3d6a716-1fbc-4d13-a4fc-d4c376f4e7bc,['Simon Tisdall'],2022-03-20 00:00:00,"What’s the plan, Joe? When he descends on Brussels this week for an emergency Nato summit, US president Joe Biden will proudly point to his big achievement during the Ukraine crisis: maintaining the unity of the alliance and keeping out of the war.

Biden wants Russia to lose, to be seen to fail. But bold, decisive action to that end is lacking. The US approach is essentially reactive, tactical, detached. Is this really all that risk-averse American global leadership has to offer these days?

As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told Congress last week, weapons and sanctions are not enough. US fears of escalation are well understood in Kyiv. But its forces still need combat planes, aerial protection and safe humanitarian corridors.

More than that, Ukraine’s people need effective, inspiring western leadership in support of the democratic ideals Biden champions. Their children are dying each day while Nato acts like a self-preservation society. They need a saviour. They need a plan.

“You are the leader of your great nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world [which] means to be the leader of peace,” Zelenskiy told Biden in what sounded very much like a reproach. Republican senator Ben Sasse was more forthright. “They [Ukrainians] are fighting for the free world. We’re a superpower. We should act like it,” he said.

Unfolding around Ukraine’s mass graves and blasted cities is a new “forever war” of the type Biden vowed to end. Judging by his latest comments, Vladimir Putin will not cease fire any time soon. Talking peace to him is like begging a butcher to turn vegetarian. Bloodbath upon atrocious bloodbath beckons.

America’s president needs a strategy with open-ended options. First, he must stop naively assuring Putin that the allies will not intervene in any circumstances. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair, who knows a thing or two about invasions, gently chided him on this point last week.

“Is it sensible to tell him [Putin] in advance that whatever he does militarily, we will rule out any form of military response?” It was a “strange tactic”, Blair wrote. Some British ministers reportedly share his concern.

“Not provoking Putin” is the nearest the western powers have come to a mission statement. Yet the US alone is providing $2bn in military aid. British anti-tank weapons are exacting a grim toll.

Russia is targeting western arms convoys, has bombed a staging post near the Polish border and twice sent military drones into neighbouring Nato states. Like it or not, mutual provocations are multiplying uncontrollably.

Biden says Putin is a “war criminal”. So will he now seek his arrest? Will the US join the UN-backed International criminal court, where war crimes are tried? Don’t bet on it.

By leaving Ukraine to fight alone, Biden risks confirming the long-held view on the European left that Nato is mostly about America’s forward defence, not enhancing Europe’s security or upholding international law.

Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, would surely take exception to that claim. His focus is on defending Nato members and he’s doing a fantastic job. “Nato will not tolerate any attack on allied sovereignty,” he declared last week.

Fine. So what’s the plan, Jens?

What about the slaughter next door? US-led Nato is not a purely defensive alliance. Nato forces fought in Afghanistan for 20 years. They bombed Serbia during the Kosovo conflict.

A little more imagination in Washington and Brussels about what might be militarily possible, without triggering world war three, could go a long way in Ukraine.

It’s unfair to blame weak US leadership alone. Nato has 30 member states, mostly European. Despite Biden’s talk of unprecedented unity, cracks are showing. East European countries, notably Poland and the three Baltic republics, want Nato and the EU to adopt a more robust military and sanctions posture. They also support Ukraine’s EU membership. Germany, Italy, Hungary, Greece and others are opposed.

When the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia travelled to Kyiv to meet Zelenskiy last week, Brussels hastened to make clear this was not an EU delegation, again for fear of provoking Putin. When Jarosław Kaczyński, the Polish leader, suggested an armed “peace mission” inside Ukraine, he was slapped down.

So what’s the plan, Olaf? Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, Europe’s most powerful country, has hugely increased national defence spending and suspended a Russian gas pipeline.

But he rejects Ukraine’s call for an immediate, total energy embargo and is blocking or delaying additional sanctions. Zelenskiy lambasted Germany’s record last week, accusing it of prioritising economic interests over European security.

These widening divisions could make for an explosive EU summit. It will take place alongside the Nato meeting this week. French president Emmanuel Macron is firmly in the German camp. The French oil giant TotalEnergies, for example, is conducting business as usual in Russia. Internal EU tensions will surely grow as the war drags on amid “sanctions fatigue”.

Since Biden, Nato and the Europeans lack an agreed long-term strategy to save Ukraine, could this be “global Britain’s” big moment?

What’s the plan, Boris?

Alas, he doesn’t have one either. As usual, Britain’s Churchill tribute act is hugging Washington close, whatever he may privately think about Biden’s leadership. His UK Joint Expeditionary Force carries an unfortunate whiff of Dunkirk.

Doing America’s bidding, Boris Johnson went cap in hand to Saudi Arabia last week in search of cheap oil and was ritually humiliated by another mass murderer.

Far from holding the ring, Britain, as matters stand, will not even be in the room this week when Europe ponders its biggest security and refugee crisis since 1945.

Nestle to suspend ‘vast majority’ of sales in Russia

Nestle is to halt the sale of a wide range of brands in Russia, including KitKat chocolate bars and Nesquik, amid Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s criticism of the world’s biggest food company for its continued presence in the country.

The products affected include pet food and coffee, and make up the “vast majority of volume and sales” in Russia — which totalled 1.7bn Swiss francs ($1.82bn) in 2021, a Nestle spokesperson said.

The Swiss company had already halted non-essential imports and exports to Russia and had also stopped all advertising and capital investment in the country and said it would donate profits from Russia to Ukrainian relief efforts.

Zelenskyy said Nestle had not done enough to live up to its “Good Food, Good Life” slogan by continuing to operate in Russia.

Nestle also said that it stands with the people of Ukraine and its 5,800 employees in the country.

US sets some red lines for China over support for Russia

United States national security adviser Jake Sullivan has laid out some broad guidelines about the types of Chinese support for Russia that would warrant a response from the United States, after warning Beijing last week of potential dire consequences.

Sullivan said US sanctions enforcement will look closely at whether China facilitates settlement of Russian payments or attempts to counter export controls passed since Russia invaded Ukraine.

The US is looking out for companies that are “attempting to backfill in response to the export controls that we have imposed,” Sullivan said. If Chinese companies or others “choose to backfill”, the US has tools to ensure that can’t happen, he added.

In terms of payments, Sullivan said, the US and its G7 allies are looking for and will respond to “systematic efforts, industrial-scale efforts to try to reorient the settlement of financial payments and so forth”.

“Our assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources.”

Western official encouraged by resignation of Russian envoy

The resignation of Kremlin special envoy Anatoly Chubais over the invasion of Ukraine is encouraging but is unlikely to shake Russian President Vladimir Putin’s firm grip on power, a Western official has said.

The official said that the resignation of Chubais was a “significant statement” but added he was “relatively high up on the list” of people who might make such a step.

“I think it’s encouraging that there are senior members of the Russian political class that are doing such things, but it doesn’t lead me to a conclusion that this is in any way undermining the security of Putin and his regime, given the iron grip that he holds together with those at the centre of his power,” the official said, on condition of anonymity.

“But nonetheless, I think it is an encouraging statement that such a figure would make this move.”

He said 12 diplomats had been ordered to leave, but the ambassador would stay with sufficient staff in Minsk to continue consular services.

NATO chief warns Moscow ahead of emergency meeting

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has addressed reporters ahead of the US-led alliance’s emergency meeting on Thursday. Here are some of his remarks.

Stoltenberg said he expects NATO will move to strengthen its eastern flank by deploying four new battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.

He called on China to condemn Russia’s invasion and “to engage in diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful way to end the war as soon as possible”.

Stoltenberg warned Moscow it cannot “win a nuclear war” and urged the Kremlin to stop its “dangerous irresponsible nuclear rhetoric”.

He accused Belarus of being “complicit” in Russia’s invasion by allowing its territory to be used for massing troops.

He also said Minsk continues to enable the offensive by allowing Moscow to use its military airfields in comments that come a day after reports that Belarus was likely to join Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Stoltenberg reiterated that NATO would not send troops into Ukraine but said the crisis had shown the alliance must reset its deterrence and defence posture.

“The changes will only affect the currency of payment, which will be changed to Russian roubles,” he added.

Putin said the government and central bank had one week to come up with a solution on how to move these operations to the Russian currency and that gas giant Gazprom would be ordered to make the corresponding changes to gas contracts.

Russia’s list of “unfriendly” countries, which corresponds to those that imposed sanctions, includes the US, European Union member states, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada and Ukraine, among others.

He also reportedly said that only a handful of volunteers have managed to get to the city via little-known roads in swampy areas with medicines for hundreds of wounded Ukrainian servicemen in city hospitals.

Zelenskyy’s adviser urges immediate harsher sanctions on Russia

Oleg Ustenko, an economic adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has said Russia’s frozen assets and central bank reserves, according to Ukraine’s foreign allies, have reached an estimated value of $300bn.

Ustenko told Al Jazeera that the assets could be used for the reconstruction of Ukraine, adding: “However, this is not enough, as every new day of war increases the price we need for reconstruction.”

“Our priority right now is to allocate the frozen Russian assets – meant for war – for reconstruction instead,” the adviser said.

He also said: “We strongly believe that our allies in Europe and the US should impose many harsh sanctions on Russia. This is not just related to the economic gains and benefits and it does not just mean that we no longer have trade exchanges like before, but it also should mean that the current status must change. And this is a civil side of things that they must adhere to.”

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, did not provide evidence.

Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations who spoke to reporters in New York earlier, had a “stark message” for Russia, according to a UN statement.

“This war is unwinnable,” he told Moscow. “Sooner or later, it will have to move from the battlefield to the peace table. This is inevitable. The only question is: How many more lives must be lost?”

He added: “The war is going nowhere fast. For more than two weeks, Mariupol has been encircled by the Russian army and relentlessly bombed, shelled and attacked. For what? Even if Mariupol falls. Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city, street by street, house by house.”

The UN chief also called for urgent talks, saying there was “enough on the table” for an immediate ceasefire.

“We have a concept of domestic security and it’s public, you can read all the reasons for nuclear arms to be used. So if it is an existential threat for our country, then it [the nuclear arsenal] can be used in accordance with our concept,” he said.

Russia has failed to achieve its goals in Ukraine, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has said, warning that despite the apparent Russian setbacks, the war will not end “easily or rapidly”.

Sullivan said Russia had set three objectives for itself when it started its invasion: subjugating Ukraine, enhancing Moscow’s power and prestige, and dividing the West.

“Russia has thus far manifestly failed to accomplish all three objectives. In fact, it has thus far achieved the opposite,” said Sullivan.

NATO, G7 and EU summits will on Thursday discuss the conflict, which began on Feb. 24 and has caused more than 3.6 million refugees to flee the country and already led to the unprecedented isolation of Russia’s economy.

Responding to a slew of sanctions that have already frozen assets and hit individuals and firms, President Vladimir Putin said Moscow planned to switch gas sales made to “unfriendly” countries to roubles, alarming international markets.

Biden’s visit could also shine light on a dispute with European allies, some of whom are heavily reliant on Russian oil and gas, over whether to impose further energy sanctions.

The issue has been a “substantial” topic and the subject of “intense back and forth” in recent days, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.

The U.S. plans to announce more sanctions on political figures and oligarchs, he said.

Biden will start his visit by meeting NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who on Wednesday said the alliance will boost its forces in Eastern Europe by deploying four new battle groups - in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia. “I expect leaders will agree to strengthen NATO’s posture in all domains,” he said.

Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour’s military capabilities.

The West says this a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.

And in a sign of disquiet at home, a veteran aide to Putin, Anatoly Chubais, resigned over the war and has left Russia with no intention to return, two sources said. He becomes the first senior official to break with the Kremlin since the incursion.

Although the Kremlin says its operation is going to plan, Russian forces have taken heavy losses, got stuck on most fronts and face supply problems. They have turned to siege tactics and bombardments, causing huge destruction and many civilian deaths.

Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, told reporters on Wednesday that 264 civilians in the city had been killed by Russian attacks. He later said that one person was killed and two wounded on Wednesday when shells hit a shopping centre parking lot in a northern part of Kyiv.

Russia has denied targeting civilians.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday night called on people all over the world to take to the streets on Thursday, four weeks since Russia invaded, to demand an end to the war.

“Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities, come in the name of peace, come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life,” he said in an English-language video address.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States has assessed that members of Russia’s forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.

Blinken said there had been “numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, as well as other atrocities”, specifying attacks in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol.

‘UNFRIENDLY’ COUNTRIES

As Western leaders prepared to meet, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would push for an increase in defensive lethal aid to Ukraine.

The first U.S. shipment from a new, $800 million arms package for Ukraine authorized last week will start flying out in the next day or so, a senior defence official said.

Putin’s announcement that Russia would switch certain gas sales to roubles sent European futures soaring on concerns the switch would exacerbate an energy crunch and jam up deals that run to hundreds of millions of dollars every day.

Russian gas accounts for some 40% of Europe’s total gas consumption.

Moscow has drawn up a list of “unfriendly” countries which corresponds to those that imposed sanctions. They include the United States, European Union members, Britain and Japan, among others.

“The changes will only affect the currency of payment, which will be changed to Russian roubles,” said Putin.

And as an information battle also rages, a Russian regulator has blocked Alphabet’s news aggregator Google News, saying it allows access to what it calls fake material about the military operation, Interfax news agency said.

Google was not immediately available for comment.

Earlier the company said it will not help websites, apps and YouTube channels sell ads alongside content that it deems exploits, dismisses or condones the conflict.

SMOKE AND FLAMES

The war has driven a quarter of Ukraine’s 44 million people from their homes, according to United Nations agencies.

A total of 4,554 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Wednesday, a senior official said, considerably fewer than managed to escape the previous day.

Worst hit has been Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands of people have been sheltering since the war’s early days, under constant bombardment and with food, water and heating supplies cut.

Satellite photographs from commercial firm Maxar showed massive destruction of what was once a city of 400,000 people, with columns of smoke rising from residential apartment buildings in flames.

While Russia was pressing hard in the south and east, British military intelligence said the entire battlefield across northern Ukraine - which includes armoured columns that once threatened Kyiv - was now static.",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-ukraine-crisis-idUKKCN2LK00J
