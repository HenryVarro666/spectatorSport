The Kremlin's advances on the ground appear to have largely stalled out in the face of Ukrainian resistance and major supply chain problems. Its forces have now shifted their focus to a brutal campaign of encircling and bombarding major cities. At the same time, the United States and other countries continue to levy new sanctions on Russia and work to isolate it politically on the international stage while pouring thousands of weapons into the country to support Ukraine's defense.

Before diving into the latest news below, readers can get up to speed on the present state of the conflict in Ukraine in our previous rolling coverage here.

The Latest

POSTED: 9:25 PM EST—

“For the first time, we don’t expect them to make any gains in the next few days,"" a NATO official told CNN earlier today, underscoring the degree to which Russia's advances on the ground have slowed. ""They are putting in everything they have and are still making very little progress.""

The U.S. military now assesses that the Kremlin has committed almost 100 percent of the forces it had arrayed around Ukraine in recent months and that it has lost around five percent of that combat capacity since the invasion began. Russian forces have now launched more than 670 ballistic and cruise missiles against Ukrainian targets, according to the Pentagon and appears to be stepping up those and other kinds of strikes.

Russian forces have still not achieved air superiority, a senior U.S. defense official said today.

Many Ukrainian cities are increasingly subject to Russian siege warfare tactics, including air, missile, and bombardments. This continues to create significant risks and hardships for civilian populations in these areas, as underscored by the U.K. government intelligence assessment below.

The video below, showing evacuations earlier from the city of Irpin, just outside Kyiv, rams home what civilians in Ukraine are increasingly facing. This reality is also highlighted by the picture in the Tweet below that showing the tail end of an artillery rocket lodged in a civilian vehicle inside a parking structure in Kharkiv to the east.

The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has assessed that there are between 10 days and two weeks worth of general supplies available to sustain the remaining populace of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv should it become completely cut off by Russian forces. Russia's military is still trying to make a push on Kyiv from three different directions and continues to send small units into the city itself to skirmish with forces there and ""disrupt normal life,"" according to a senior U.S. defense official.

The Russian military appears to be preparing for amphibious landings along Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. This could include long-expected operations targeting the port city of Odesa.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said tonight that ""the world doesn't believe in Russia's future"" and ""there will most certainly be a future"" for his country. This comes after he recently said that he is open, at least to some degree, to acquiescing to some of Russia's more maximalist demands, such as ceding control of the Crimean Peninsula and areas of the country's eastern Donbas region.

The United States and countries in Europe have begun to talk about Ukraine's eventual reconstruction following this conflict, even as military and humanitarian aid continue to flow to it now.

U.S. Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, who is currently Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and head of U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM), told lawmakers at a hearing earlier today that, at least so, Russian cyberattacks had been more limited than expected in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. He attributed this to hard work on the part of the Ukrainian government and others ""to prevent their actions.""

At the same hearing, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that Russian cyberattacks remain one of the most realistic avenues for spillover from the conflict in Ukraine to directly impact the United States.

Avril Haines, the Director of National Intelligence, and William Burns, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), highlighted at that hearing how China has been unsettled by Russia's stumbling in its invasion of Ukraine and the international community's reaction to the conflict. They say that what Beijing has observed in this context could have an impact on its own calculus regarding the potential use of force against Taiwan.

New high-resolution satellite imagery has emerged online of an air base in Russia relatively close to the Ukrainian border that shows some interesting aircraft deployed there. The image, taken on March 3, shows that a substantial number of An-2 Colt biplanes, as well as specialized electronic warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, were there on that date. The presence of the An-2s, in particular, which was first observed back in February, remains curious, as you can read more about here.

Commercial satellite imagery provider Maxar has released new imagery of various locations in Ukraine showing the impacts of the conflict.

The video in the Tweet below shows a Ukrainian service member or a member of the country's volunteer Territorial Defense FOrces armed with a German-made Panzerfaust 3 shoulder-fired anti-armor weapon. This is one a number of shoulder-fired missile and rocket launchers that Ukrainian forces have received or expect to soon, as you can read more about here.

Ukrainian forces have made good use of these launchers, especially anti-tank guided missiles with firing modes that allow them to strike the tops of tanks and other armored vehicles, where the armor is typically thinnest, in their defense of the country. Visual evidence of their impact these weapons are having on Russian operations continues to grow, including the picture below showing the addition of sandbags on top of improvised cage-type armor on a Russian tank.

Imagery continues to emerge on social media showing Ukrainian citizens towing away abandoned Russian armored vehicles.

Russia's economy is buckling more and more under the weight of new international sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Ratings agency Fitch has warned that a default on the country's sovereign debt could be ""imminent.""

We will continue to update this post with new information until we state otherwise.

It’s also taco Tuesday, but I don’t think that’s really relevant to this post…

And here’s President Zelenskyy’s address to Parliament in case you wanted to watch it and haven’t had a chance:

Lot’s of big news today. So if I miss something smaller, but relevant, try to flag it in the comments or tomorrow. Also, for those of you who are read more tag enthusiasts (fetishists?), I simply forgot to toggle it on last night, that’s why it wasn’t there. No need to freak out, I just plain forgot to embed it. Remember, there’s a war on where one side’s rules of engagement appear to be disregard all laws of war, Geneva conventions, and professional military ethics in order to commit as many war crimes as possible. So maybe if the read more tag isn’t used you don’t have anything real to actually bitch about provided no one is dropping 1,000 pound bombs on your home or shooting at you from a tank while you’re in your car in front of a hospital or invading your city and forcing you to hide with no food, water, electricity, or medical supplies/medicine or you’re walking however far you have to go to get to safety.

You can let us know there’s an issue without the drama. If there’s a legitimate problem with the site, let someone know, otherwise, perspective people, get some!

One last house keeping item: everyone please dial it back a bit in the comments. I get it, everyone is pissed off at Russia. Unfortunately, because of the nature of Putin’s Russia, we do not have any really good way of knowing how much popular support he has for this war against Ukraine, nor how many people really actually know what is going on. Being pissed at Putin, the oligarchs, siloviki, strongmen, political, and military leaders, as well as the repugnant people licking his jackboots in Russian state controlled media is all well and good. But it is important to keep a bit of perspective here and separate all of those horrible people and the Russian state from the actual Russian people. Because when all of this is over, those people who have been propagandized to believe we’ve been waging war on them for 30 plus years, are going to need a lot of our help, compassion, and charity. And that doesn’t mean that the Ukrainians are more deserving of any and all of that right now and won’t need it too.

Let’s start with everyone’s favorite: MiG 29s, MiG 29s, who has the MiG 29s? Poland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs put out the following statement this morning:

Statement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland in connection with the statement by the US Secretary of State on providing airplanes to Ukraine The authorities of the Republic of Poland, after consultations between the President and the Government, are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America. At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes. The Polish Government also requests other NATO Allies – owners of MIG-29 jets – to act in the same vein.

And everyone started celebrating. Unfortunately no one seemed to have told either the State Department or the Department of Defense!

Undersecretary of State Toria Nuland, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, just said this statement was not pre-consulted with the U.S. Seems to have come as a bit of a surprise. https://t.co/GpjvK7MMwB — Amy Mackinnon (@ak_mack) March 8, 2022

⚡️ Pentagon questions Poland's proposal to transfer MIG-29 jets to US. “It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said. — The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) March 8, 2022

I’m not sure if anyone has any idea what is actually going on with the Polish MiGs right now. This may have just been Poland’s way of dumping the logistics problem back on the US. So until we can fix it, nothing is actually happening, but Poland looks like it did something so everyone stops pestering them.

I also want to highlight this statement from Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov from earlier today before we get to the read more jump. Especially because the PRC’s Foreign Ministry seems to be backing it up.

#BREAKING: #Russia's FM Lavrov: ""We have information the #US built two biological warfare labs in #Kiev & #Odessa. They have developed pathogens in those labs in #Ukraine."" Things are going from bad to worse……….pic.twitter.com/Tp2TJkX7ID — Indo-Pacific News – Watching the CCP-China Threat (@IndoPac_Info) March 8, 2022

#BREAKING: #China — “The #US has 336 bio labs in 30 countries under its control, including 26 in #Ukraine alone. It should give a full account of its biological military activities at home and abroad and subject itself to multilateral verification.“pic.twitter.com/Xk2onke51V — Indo-Pacific News – Watching the CCP-China Threat (@IndoPac_Info) March 8, 2022

Russian military doctrine for setting a theater of operations is to achieve informational dominance prior to conducting actual lethal or kinetic operations. My worry is that’s what they’re doing here with these clearly bullshit accusations. Specifically that the agitprop that Lavrov is spewing and the PRC’s Foreign Ministry is amplifying is not just misinformation, but intended to establish an informational narrative and context in which Russia undertakes a biological attack against either Russian speakers in Donestk or Luhansk or Russians within Russia proper. This would reinforce their false causus belli, but also serve as a provocation to rally Russians to support Putin and his war against Ukraine. Also, because it is an accusation the US has biological warfare labs, this is intended to be easily digested, repeated and retransmitted, and amplified by the QAnon and anti-Fauci crowd here in the US.

Much, much, much more after the jump!

Biden announced that the US will stop purchasing Russian petroleum:

⚡️Biden announces US ban on Russian oil, gas imports. U.S. President Joe Biden said that some European countries may not be able to join the ban due to shortages of energy supplies. — The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) March 8, 2022

Britain is doing the same thing on an extended timeline:

⚡️UK to phase out Russian oil imports by end of 2022. The transition period will give the market enough time to find alternatives for Russian imports, the U.K. government announced, according to BBC. — The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) March 8, 2022

The rest of the EU member states so far are not on board. We’ll see if this becomes a major issue between the US, the UK, and the EU.

For those of you that have to have a Coke or a Pepsi, you’ll be happy to know that both companies are suspending sales and operations in Russia for the time being. McDonald’s is also closing operations at their stores in Russia too.

A lot of people are making maps of the Russian invasion forces, where they are, what they’ve occupied, etc. All of them have flaws and if you all want I can do a technical post on the specifics later, but the bottom line is they’re both showing that Russia is controlling too much of Ukraine and not enough of Ukraine at the same time. Basically, showing the roads that Russia has convoys of troops and/or supplies on is indicating more control than Russia has in those areas of Ukraine. Not being able to drill into the actual cities or towns or villages may either under or over represent the Russian control in some places. And since everyone is trying to be careful and not give away Ukrainian military positions, the Ukrainian military information is usually completely missing from these maps. Why is this important?

There’s been a lot talk, reporting, and analysis that Russia will have Kyiv encircled soon, but provided this Ukrainian MOD map is correct, unless something changes, that doesn’t seem likely:

As long as the Ukrainians can hold their lines in the suburbs, bedroom communities, and towns outside of Kyiv, then they can hold Kyiv. Putin needs to take that capitol as quickly as possible. He needs to be able to get his quislings in place ASAP so they can claim to be the new, real de-NAZIfied Ukrainian government and sign the bogus documents on official letterhead capitulating to Putin’s demands. Every day the defenses in Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Gostomel hold is a day that Putin is definitely not winning!

Which is why this reporting is good news!

Kharkiv is under full control of UA Armed Forces. No RU sabotage groups in the city. Today RU landed an air assault group of 120 people on 3 helicopters in Volchansk district.

That is going to leave a mark!

I’m sure that by now everyone has seen references to twenty-seven senior, experienced foreign policy professionals signing an open letter calling on the Biden administration to establish an aerial exclusion zone over Ukraine. Every signatory knows exactly what that entails including the risks.

Open Letter Calling for Limited No-Fly Zone We, the undersigned, urge the Biden administration, together with NATO allies, to

impose a limited No-Fly Zone over Ukraine starting with protection for humanitarian

corridors that were agreed upon in talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials on

Thursday. NATO leaders should convey to Russian officials that they do not seek direct

confrontation with Russian forces, but they must also make clear that they will not

countenance Russian attacks on civilian areas.

Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine has caused massive devastation and loss of

life for Ukrainians. His premeditated, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression has

created the greatest crisis on the European continent since the end of World War II.

Despite the truly heroic efforts by Ukrainian soldiers and average citizens to resist the

marauding Russian forces, Putin’s military is poised for further attacks on major cities,

including the capital Kyiv. Targeting residential buildings, hospitals and government

complexes, as well as nuclear power plants, Russian forces will be responsible for an

even higher death toll.

The international community has responded swiftly through an unprecedented array of

sanctions and a significant increase in lethal military assistance to help Ukraine defend

itself. But more must be done to prevent more widescale casualties and a potential

bloodbath. President Biden and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg have stated that neither the

United States nor NATO will engage Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine. What we

seek is the deployment of American and NATO aircraft not in search of confrontation

with Russia but to avert and deter Russian bombardment that would result in massive

loss of Ukrainian lives. This is in addition to the request from Ukrainian leaders for A-10

and MIG-29 aircraft to help Ukrainians defend themselves, which we also strongly

support. Already more than a million Ukrainians have fled their country to escape the brutality

Putin has unleashed. Estimates suggest that that number could reach 5 million, more

than 10 percent of the population. Several thousand Ukrainians have already died from

Putin’s latest aggression, on top of the more than 14,000 killed following Putin’s first

invasion of Ukraine starting in 2014. Ukraine is facing a severe humanitarian disaster,

and the effects are being felt across the European continent and beyond.

The refrain “never again” emerged in the wake of the Holocaust, and Ukrainians are

wondering whether that pledge applies to them. It is time for the United States and

NATO to step up their help for Ukrainians before more innocent civilians fall victim to

Putin’s murderous madness. Ukrainians are courageously defending their country and

their freedom, but they need more help from the international community. A U.S.-

NATO enforced No-Fly Zone to protect humanitarian corridors and additional military

means for Ukrainian self-defense are desperately needed, and needed now.

The twenty-seven signatories and their affiliations are at the link. I know two of them, but not well. On a personal note, no one ever asks me to sign their open letters to presidential administrations…

We spend a lot of time highlighting what is going on in Ukraine, but not a lot about what is going on in Russian occupied Dohetsk and Luhansk. Largely because there’s not a lot of coverage of what is going on there. Russian forces have occupied 100 towns, villages, etc. This site has updates:
