What is Vladimir Putin’s ultimate goal? Today, Playbook author Ryan Lizza talks to former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker — who led Trump’s Ukraine negotiations — about how President Biden is responding to the Ukraine threat and how he would counter Putin’s strategy. Plus, journalist Uliana Pavlova joins us from Moscow to describe the sentiment on the ground.

On the worst that could happen

Ryan Lizza: ""President Putin has placed over 100,000 troops in and around Ukraine. There's a sort of war of words going on between NATO's leaders, especially President Biden and Russia. An increasing list of deterrent actions by the United States, including threats of sanctions. President Biden is also saying that he might personally sanction President Putin. A determination to reinforce NATO's troops in Eastern Europe. Some signs that there are Russian soldiers penetrating beyond their current positions. As we sit here and talk, give us the sort of worst-case scenario that we're trying to prevent here.""

Ambassador Volker: ""The worst-case one would be that Russia launches a major invasion into Ukraine that attempts to take over the entire country and subordinate Ukraine to Russia again, as was the case with the Soviet Union. That would cause, you know, massive fighting inside Ukraine. The Ukrainians are far more capable than they were in 2014 and 2015. There would be internal resistance in Ukraine, and there would be a lot of assistance to Ukraine this time compared to 2014, 2015, when it was Crimea and the invasion just in the Donbas. So I think that countries are much more prepared to help out. That would lead to a wider conflict with Russia, which could even cause Russia to then, as part of its doctrine, consider the deployment of nuclear weapons. That would really escalate in a tremendous and terrible way if that were to happen. I do not think that scenario is likely. I think what is much more likely is that Russia does invade Ukraine, but does it in the south, the east, maybe a few fronts in the north as well, tries to take more territory, does it quickly and then tries to, or is willing to then have a new cease-fire. I think they're interested in linking Crimea to the reservoirs to the north of Crimea, which used to feed water to Crimea. And I think they're interested in connecting Crimea by land to Donbas and to Russia. That would include taking, for instance, the whole coastline in the Sea of Azov, city of Mariupol, and that would create a contiguous territory that would connect all of this to Russian territory itself. And then we'll see whether he just leaves it at that, whether he recognizes it as an independent state of Novorossiya or whether he decides to annex it to Russia. I think a lot of those things are then possible. Even in doing this, there would be substantial fighting, there would be people killed, there would be refugees that Ukrainian forces will fight back. It is going to be a big and messy war if they do this. But Russia does have superior military forces, particularly superior air and naval forces, and I think is in a position to prevail. But I think that is a more likely scenario, and that's what I think the efforts of the administration and NATO and European allies are all seeking to prevent now.""

On Putin’s motivations

Ryan Lizza: ""There's a lot of talk, and we heard it from President Biden recently, that he [Putin] is driven by reintegrating all of the former Soviet states. I want to get your take on whether that's an accurate understanding of Putin as time has gone on and the decades have passed, that he has a slightly less ambitious view of what actually can be regained. I don't think anyone really thinks that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are ever going back. He'd have to be — tell me if I'm wrong — quite deluded to believe that. Give us a little bit of background on your education in 'Putinism' and what your view is of his goals and intentions here and what sort of drives them.""

Vladimir Putin NOT ready for compromise on Ukraine warns senior US official

Russian president Vladimir Putin is not ready to make compromises to end his invasion of Ukraine, a senior US official has warned.

The official told Reuters that Putin would not be willing to make concessions at this point despite the first face-to-face negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in more than two weeks being set to resume.

Russia has suffered significant losses during the invasion, with Ukraine claiming that 16,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, as well as substantial losses of military hardware such as tanks, aircraft, and ships.

But despite the war not appearing to go the way that Putin had planned, the Russian president does not appear ready to compromise to broker a peace agreement.

The senior US State Department official told Reuters on condition of anonymity: ""Everything I have seen is he is not willing to compromise at this point.""

The ominous prediction comes after Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky had sketched out a potential way to bring the invasion to a close.

Kyiv has now said that it will no longer consider any concessions on territory as the fighting on the ground appears to be shifting in its favour.

Nonetheless the situation for Ukrainian citizens remains desperate, with Russia blocking civilian evacuation from the besieged city of Mariupol despite Ukrainian reports that 90% of the city has been damaged by the relentless bombardment.

The talks have been arranged to begin on Monday following meetings between Putin and President Recep Erdoğan of Turkey.

Turkey has the southern coast of the Black Sea, opposite from the Crimea, and has had historic agreements with Russia over the rights of military vessels to enter the Black Sea.

Morale among Russian soldiers on the ground also appears to be low, with a report of one soldier even running over their commanding officer with a tank.

Russian forces may not even have the numbers to be able to successfully occupy Ukrainian cities, and a campaign of horrific bombardment has been carried out, most notably in the city of Mariupol.

The Kremlin has also expressed alarm over remarks from US President Joe Biden, who said that Putin must not remain in power in a speech on Saturday.

When Russia and Ukraine last met in person, Ukraine accused Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of ignoring pleas to consider a ceasefire.

Lavrov said that a halt to the fighting was not on the agenda.

The sides have since met via videolink, but neither side has made any concession on territorial questions, in particular contested areas of Donbas, the Russian-speaking communities of which Putin has claimed the operation was to defend, and the Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.

Nonetheless, despite new face-to-face talks opening, Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko has expressed doubt about progress towards a ceasefire, telling Reuters: ""I don't think there will be any breakthrough on the main issues.""",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/vladimir-putin-notready-compromise-ukraine-26576497

More than a month into Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, talks appear to have ramped up with the aim of bringing the fighting to a stop. These have so far focussed on Ukraine’s relationship with NATO and the status of Crimea and Donbas.

Following the latest round of talks, Russian Foreign Minister hailed the “significant progress” and “positive movement” he believed had been made. But others suggested his view of Ukraine’s position was divorced from the truth. Lavrov told reporters Kyiv understood “the issues of Crimea and Donbas are settled for good”. Ukraine has maintained it will not back down on these contested regions, insisting its territorial integrity is a red line.

Oleg Nikolenko, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, added Lavrov had grasped the wrong end of the stick. He wrote: “Lavrov demonstrates a misunderstanding of the negotiation process. “The issues of Crimea and Donbas will be settled for good after Ukraine restores its sovereignty over them. “During the talks in Istanbul, the Ukrainian delegation presented its proposals on how to achieve this goal.” READ MORE: Roman Abramovich may have been targeted by 'modified WW1 gas'

Ukraine signalled it was prepared to at least talk about the status of Crimea, but wishes to push talks on this back to a later date due to the desire to focus instead on ending the war. It proposed 15-year bilateral talks, stipulating neither side could influence any final decision with force. A similar approach has been adopted on the status of Donbas, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggesting he would only discuss the matter face-to-face with Putin. DON'T MISS:

There does, however, appear to have been more progress on the question of Ukraine’s relationship with NATO. Lavrov told reporters Ukraine had “recognised the need” to give up on membership of the Western alliance. This point is also not as clear cut as the Russian Foreign Minister suggested, given Ukraine has stressed it is seeking security guarantees “stronger than NATO’s”.

A Russian invasion of Ukraine could drive up already high oil and natural gas prices, prolonging elevated inflation around the world and dealing a blow to any country dependent on Russia for energy.

Oil and gas prices have been marching upward for months as exporting countries like Libya have struggled with production problems and demand has rapidly recovered after two years of the pandemic. But all of that pales in comparison with what could happen if a war in Eastern Europe and potential Western sanctions on Russia curtail that country’s production, analysts said.

Russia produces 10 million barrels of oil a day, roughly 10 percent of global demand, and is Europe’s largest supplier of natural gas, a critical fuel for power plants and for heat.

The United States is not a big importer of Russian oil — it gets about 700,000 barrels a day, or roughly 3 percent of its demand. But even Americans would be hurt because the price of the commodity is set in global markets.

Nobody quite knows what President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intends to do in Ukraine, and most analysts agree that a war would hurt his country as much as the rest of the world, if not more, given the Russian economy’s dependence on energy. Yet, by simply amassing tens of thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border, Mr. Putin has created the kind of threat to the global energy market that the world hasn’t seen since the end of the Cold War.

“Governments had hoped that these days were over,” said David L. Goldwyn, who was a leading State Department energy diplomat during the Obama administration. “No one was gaming for a cutoff of Russian oil and gas to the global market.”

Oil prices have risen to well over $90 a barrel — their highest levels since 2014 — in recent days as fears of war have grown. Many energy experts say an invasion would easily propel the price above $100 a barrel. The average price for regular gasoline in the United States has risen to nearly $3.50, a rise of almost 20 cents over the last month and nearly $1 more than a year ago, according to AAA. Diesel prices have been rising a penny a gallon every day recently.

Higher fuel prices hurt rural and working-class consumers the most because they spend a larger percentage of their incomes on energy and because they typically drive longer distances in less fuel-efficient cars. For every penny that a gallon of regular gasoline rises, it costs American consumers $4 million a day, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service.

“We are going to push the envelope with inflation that infiltrates every nook and cranny of the economy,” Mr. Kloza said. “I’m most worried about diesel. It doesn’t provoke a public outcry like gasoline, but it can be a silent killer of commerce and profits.”

Oil markets rose about 2 percent on Monday. They eased early in the day as traders took note of reports that Russian officials remained willing to negotiate a potential settlement before climbing again in the afternoon. European natural gas prices rose about 6 percent.

The biggest immediate threat from an invasion would be Russian natural gas exports through Ukrainian pipelines to Europe. If the gas stopped flowing, many Europeans could struggle to heat their homes. Utilities might have to cut back electricity production, and factories might have to close early. Mr. Putin could also seek to further increase pressure on the West by restricting oil exports to Europe.

Those moves would, of course, hurt Russia, and make the economic sanctions promised by the Biden administration and its allies all the more punitive. That threat may turn out to be the primary reason Mr. Putin eventually looks for a compromise.

There are reasons to hope an energy crisis could be averted. The United States has been producing more oil in recent weeks, and the Biden administration is working on efforts to revive a nuclear deal with Iran that would release as much as a million barrels a day on the world market.

The European winter has been relatively mild, and the wind is blowing far stronger than last year, easing pressure on the wind power sector. Further, the Biden administration has had some success in sending more liquefied natural gas to Europe by persuading Japan and other Asian consumers to forgo some shipments.

But global oil production has not kept up over the last year with the growth of demand despite the lingering pandemic. The output of several members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has declined, and there have been production interruptions outside the cartel, including in Ecuador and Kazakhstan, because of natural disasters and political turmoil. Renewed political tension could also tip Libya back into civil war, which could put at risk 300,000 barrels of production or more.

“Simply the threat of war and disruption can be enough to send prices spiraling higher,” said Nishant Bhushan, senior oil market analyst at Rystad Energy, a consulting firm.

At the same time, many commuters have given up on mass transit because of fears of contracting the coronavirus and are driving more.

American oil companies have been gradually increasing production, although they are not yet pumping out the roughly 13 million barrels a day they were in 2019. Reduced investment in exploration and production because of the pandemic, and lower investor interest in oil and gas for environmental reasons, have stretched supplies thin.

Oil executives remain cautious, in part because they borrowed heavily in recent years to bolster output only to see prices drop. Some executives also said they were struggling to predict and respond to geopolitical developments.

“If Putin invades, then oil rises over $100 to $120 a barrel,” said Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Texas oil and gas company. “If Biden removes sanctions on Iran, then there will be a $10 drop.”

He added, “Demand is strong and there is not enough supply long term, so eventually oil will be over $100 regardless.”

Rising oil prices are also a threat to policies aimed at curbing climate change. As prices rise at the pump, some lawmakers and voters may become more willing to support increasing oil and gas production, seeing it as a more immediate solution to high energy prices than investing in, say, renewable energy and electric cars.

“This is a huge watershed for governments trying to manage the energy transition and energy security simultaneously,” said Mr. Goldwyn, the former Obama administration official. “The need to have adequate reserves of oil and gas and diverse sources of supply is more urgent than ever during an energy and geopolitical crisis.”

Some energy analysts said high prices might not persist for that long. That’s because people may seek to reduce their expenses by, for example, driving less or switching to more efficient vehicles and appliances. A report on Monday by analysts at RBC, an investment bank, forecast that oil prices could reach $115 a barrel or higher this summer. It added, “The oil cycle will price higher until it finds a level of demand destruction.”

The recent jump in gasoline prices comes at a time of year when people tend to drive less. To some energy experts, that is worrisome because a seasonal upswing in prices is not that far away.

“Not only are oil prices up, but the bulk of the nation is starting the multi-month transition to summer gasoline, further adding to the rise at the pump,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, a technology company that tracks fuel prices.

A diplomatic settlement, of course, would relieve the pressures, and energy prices would go down.

“Average prices in 2022 could be lower than 2021 with more supplies from the United States and the gulf, including Iran,” said René Ortiz, a former secretary general of OPEC and former oil minister in Ecuador. “That is the best scenario, and I think diplomacy will prevail. It would be crazy for Putin to invade.”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/14/world/russia-ukraine-news

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.

[music]

Today: Russia is making preparations for what many fear may be a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, prompting warnings from the U.S. of serious consequences if it does. I spoke to my colleague, Moscow bureau chief Anton Troianovski, about what Vladimir Putin wants from Ukraine and just how far he may go to get it. It’s Wednesday, December 8. Anton, describe the scene right now on the border between Ukraine and Russia. What does it look like? What exactly is happening there?

anton troianovski

Well, what you’re seeing on the Russian side of the border within 100 to 200 miles away is that thousands of Russian troops are on the move.

archived recording 1 A top military official says intelligence shows nearly 100,000 Russian troops — archived recording 2 Russian troops have massed on the border of Ukraine. archived recording 3 — troops on the border with Ukraine. And that’s prompted fears of an invasion early next year.

anton troianovski

We’re seeing a lot of social media footage of tanks and other military equipment on the move, on trains, in some cases, heading west toward the Ukraine border area from as far away as Siberia.

archived recording Tensions between Russia and Ukraine have been building for some time in the wake of —

anton troianovski

These satellite images that we’re seeing show deployment areas around Ukraine that were empty as recently as June that are now full of military equipment-like tanks and armored personnel carriers.

archived recording The U.S. called it unusual activity.

anton troianovski

And obviously, Russia moves its forces all the time. It does big military exercises, snap military exercises all the time, but what we’re being told is that these military movements are very unusual. Some of them are happening at night and, in other ways, seemingly designed to obfuscate where various units are going. And experts are saying we’re also seeing things like logistics and medical equipment being moved around, stuff that you really would see if there were real preparations being made for large-scale military action.

michael barbaro

So what’s happening in Russia is not just the movement of the troops that would perhaps carry out an invasion, but the kind of military personnel and equipment that would be required to deal with the repercussions of something like invading Ukraine?

anton troianovski

Yes. So American intelligence officials are seeing intelligence that shows Russia preparing for a military offensive involving an estimated 175,000 troops —

michael barbaro

Wow.

anton troianovski

— as soon as early next year.

michael barbaro

And Anton, is Ukraine preparing for what certainly looks, from what you just described, as a potential invasion?

anton troianovski

They’re in a really tough spot because no matter how much they prepare, their military would be utterly outgunned and outmatched. Ukraine doesn’t have the missile defense and air defense systems that could prevent a huge shock-and-awe campaign at the beginning of Russian military action. They also don’t know, if and when an attack comes, which direction it might come from, because Russia could attack from any of three directions. So we’re not seeing a big mobilization in Ukraine right now, but our reporting on the ground there does show a grim and determined mood among the military. The soldiers on the border have made it clear that if it comes to it, they will be prepared to do what they can to make this as costly as possible for the other side.

michael barbaro

So I guess the question everyone has in this moment is why would Putin want to invade Ukraine right now and touch off what would no doubt be a major conflict, one in which, as you just said, Russia would have many advantages, but would nevertheless end up probably being a very deadly conflict?

anton troianovski

So obviously, we don’t yet know whether Putin has made the decision to invade. He’s clearly signaling he’s prepared to use military force. What we do know is that he has been extraordinarily fixated on the issue of Ukraine for years. But I think to really understand it, you have to look at three dates over the last 30 years that really show us why Ukraine matters so much to Putin.

michael barbaro

OK. So what’s the first date?

anton troianovski

The first one, 1991, almost exactly 30 years ago, the Soviet Union breaks up, and Ukraine becomes an independent country. For people of Putin’s generation, this was an incredibly shocking and even traumatic moment. Not only did they see and experience the collapse of an empire, of the country that they grew up in, that they worked in, that, in Putin’s case, the former K.G.B. officer that they served. But there was also a specific trauma of Ukraine breaking away. Ukraine, of all the former Soviet republics, was probably the one most valuable to Moscow. It was a matter of history and identity with, in many ways, Russian statehood originating out of the medieval Kiev Rus civilization. There’s the matter of culture with so many Russian language writers like Gogol and Bulgakov coming from Ukraine. There was the matter of economics with Ukraine being an industrial and agricultural powerhouse during the Soviet Union, with many of the planes and missiles that the Soviets were most proud of coming from Ukraine.

michael barbaro

So there’s a sense that Ukraine is the cradle of Russian civilization, and to lose it is to lose a part of Russia itself.

anton troianovski

Yeah. And it’s a country of tens of millions of people that is also sandwiched between modern-day Russia and Western Europe. So the other issue is geopolitical, that Ukraine in that sort of Cold War security, East-versus-West mindset, Ukraine was a buffer between Moscow and the West. So 1991 was the year when that all fell apart. And then by the time that Putin comes to power 10 years later, he’s already clearly thinking about how to reestablish Russian influence in that former Soviet space in Eastern Europe and in Ukraine in particular. We saw a lot of resources go in economically to try to bind Ukraine to Russia, whether it’s discounts on natural gas or other efforts by Russian companies, efforts to build ties to politicians and oligarchs in Ukraine. Really, a multipronged effort by Putin and the Kremlin to really gain as much influence as possible in that former Soviet space that they saw as being so key to Russia’s economic and security interests.

michael barbaro

Got it.

anton troianovski

And then fast forward to the second key date, 2014, which is the year it became clear that that strategy had failed.

archived recording Now, to the growing unrest in Ukraine and the violent clashes between riot police and protesters.

michael barbaro

And why did that strategy fail in 2014?

anton troianovski

That was the year that Ukraine had its — what’s called its Maidan Revolution.

archived recording 1 The situation in Kiev has been very tense. archived recording 2 Downtown Kiev has been turned into a charred battlefield following two straight nights of rioting.

anton troianovski

It’s a pro-Western revolution —

archived recording They want nothing short of revolution, a new government and a new president.

anton troianovski

— that drove out a Russia-friendly president, that ushered in a pro-Western government, that made it its mission to reduce Ukraine’s ties with Russia and build its ties with the West.

archived recording Ukrainians who want closer ties with the West are once again back in their thousands on Independence Square here in Kiev. They believe they —

michael barbaro

Hmm. And what was Putin’s response to that?

anton troianovski

Well, Putin didn’t even see it as a revolution. He saw it as a coup engineered by the C.I.A. and other Western intelligence agencies meant to drive Ukraine away from Russia. And —

archived recording With stealth and mystery, Vladimir Putin made his move in Ukraine.

anton troianovski

— he used his military.

archived recording At dawn, bands of armed men appeared at the two main airports in Crimea and seized control.

anton troianovski

He sent troops into Crimea, the Ukrainian Peninsula in the Black Sea that’s so dear to people across the former Soviet Union as kind of the warmest, most tropical place in a very cold part of the world.

archived recording Tonight, Russian troops — hundreds, perhaps as many as 2,000, ferried in transport planes — have landed at the airports.

anton troianovski

He fomented a separatist war in Eastern Ukraine that by now has taken more than 10,000 lives and armed and backed pro-Russian separatists in that region. So that was the year 2014 when Russia’s earlier efforts to try to bind Ukraine to Moscow failed and when Russia started taking a much harder line.

michael barbaro

And this feels like a very pivotal moment because it shows Putin’s willingness to deploy the Russian military to strengthen the ties between Russia and Ukraine.

anton troianovski

Absolutely. Strengthened the ties or you can also say his efforts to enforce a Russian sphere of influence by military force. And it’s also the start of what we’ve been seeing ever since, which is Putin making it clear that he is willing to escalate, he is willing to raise the stakes and that he essentially cares more about the fate of Ukraine than the West does. And that brings us to the third date I wanted to talk about, which is early this year, 2021, when we saw the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, really start taking a more aggressive anti-Russian and pro-Western tack. He cracked down on a pro-Russian oligarch and pro-Russian media. He continued with military exercises with American soldiers and with other Western forces. He kept talking up the idea of Ukraine joining NATO. That’s the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western military alliance. And in a sense, this is what Putin seems to fear the most, the idea of NATO becoming more entrenched in this region. So Putin made it clear that this was starting to cross what he describes as Russia’s red lines and that Russia was willing to take action to stop this.

michael barbaro

So to put this all together and understand why Putin is doing what he’s doing when it comes to Ukraine, we have as a backdrop here this fixation with Ukraine for historic, political, economic and cultural reasons. And what’s new and urgent here for Putin is his belief that Ukraine is on the verge of a major break with Russia and toward the West — in particular, a military alliance, NATO — and that he cannot tolerate. And so that brings us up to now and this very imminent and scary threat of a Russian invasion.

anton troianovski

That’s right, Michael. I spoke to a former advisor of Putin’s recently who described Ukraine as a trauma within a trauma for the Kremlin — so the trauma of the breakup of the Soviet Union plus the trauma of losing Ukraine specifically for all those reasons you mentioned. And the thing is it’s true. Russia is losing Ukraine. I think objectively, though, you have to say it’s losing Ukraine in large part because of Putin’s policies, because of the aggressive actions he’s taken. And if you look at the polls before 2014, something like 12 percent of Ukrainians wanted to join NATO. Now, it’s more than half.

michael barbaro

Wow.

anton troianovski

So you put all that together, Ukraine is indeed drifting toward the West. It does seem like Putin feels like he’s running out of time to stop this and that he’s willing to escalate, he’s willing to raise the stakes, to keep Ukraine out of the West. And what we’re seeing right now on the border is all that playing out.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Anton, the question right now is will President Putin actually carry out an invasion of Ukraine? And how should we be thinking about that?

anton troianovski

Well, it’s quite perilous, of course, to try to get inside Putin’s head, but here’s the case for invading now. Number one: NATO and the United States have made it clear that they are not going to come to Ukraine’s defense, because Ukraine is not a member of the NATO alliance, and NATO’s mutual defense pact only extends to full-fledged members. And of course, I think, politically, Putin believes that neither in the U.S., nor in Western Europe, is there the will to see soldiers from those countries die fighting for Ukraine.

michael barbaro

Right. And President Biden has just very publicly pulled the United States out of the war in Afghanistan and more or less communicated that unless American national security interests are at play, he will not be dispatching troops anywhere.

anton troianovski

Exactly. So Putin saw that, and he sees that potentially things could change. If the West does have more of a military presence in Ukraine in the future, let alone if Ukraine were to become a member of NATO at some point — it’s not going to happen in the next few years, but perhaps at some point — then attacking Ukraine becomes a much more costly proposition. So it’s a matter of war now could be less costly to Russia than war later.

michael barbaro

Right. The geopolitics of this moment may work in favor of him doing it in a way that it might not in a year or two or three.

anton troianovski

Absolutely. And then there’s a couple of other reasons. There’s the fact that if we look at everything Putin has said and written over the last year, he really seems convinced that the West is pulling Ukraine away from Russia against the will of much of the Ukrainian people. Polling doesn’t really bear that out, but Putin really seems to be convinced of that. And so it seems like he may also be thinking that Ukrainians would welcome Russian forces as liberators from some kind of Western occupation. And then third, there’s the economy. The West has already threatened severe sanctions against Russia were it to go ahead with military action, but Russia has been essentially sanctions-proofing its economy since at least 2014, which is when it took control of Crimea and was hit by all these sanctions from the U.S. and from the E.U. So Russia’s economy is still tied to the West. It imports a lot of stuff from the West. But in many key areas, whether it’s technology or energy extraction or agriculture, Russia is becoming more self-sufficient. And it is building ties to other parts of the world — like China, India, et cetera — that could allow it to diversify and have basically an economic base even if an invasion leads to a major crisis in its financial and economic relationship with the West.

Right. So this is the argument that Putin can live with the costs of the world reacting very negatively to this invasion?

anton troianovski

Exactly.

michael barbaro

OK. And what are the reasons why an invasion of Ukraine might not happen? What would be the case against it, if you were Vladimir Putin?

anton troianovski

Well, I mean, I have to say, talking to analysts, especially here in Russia, people are very skeptical that Putin would go ahead with an invasion. They point out that he is a careful tactician and that he doesn’t like making moves that are irreversible or that could have unpredictable consequences. So if we even look at the military action he’s taken recently, the annexation of Crimea, there wasn’t a single shot fired in that. That was a very quick special-forces-type operation. What we’re talking about here, an invasion of Ukraine, would be just a massive escalation from anything Putin has done so far. We are talking about the biggest land war in Europe since World War II, most likely. And it would have all kinds of unpredictable consequences. There’s also the domestic situation to keep in mind. Putin does still have approval ratings above 60 percent, but things are a bit shaky here, especially with Covid. And some analysts say that Putin wouldn’t want to usher in the kind of domestic unpredictability that could start with a major war with young men coming back in body bags. And then finally, looking at Putin’s strategy and everything that he’s said, for all we know, he doesn’t really want to annex Ukraine. He wants influence over Ukraine. And the way he thinks he can do that is through negotiations with the United States. And that’s where the last key point here comes in, which is Putin’s real conviction that it’s the U.S. pulling the strings here and that he can accomplish his goals by getting President Biden to sit down with him and hammering out a deal about the structure of security in Eastern Europe. So in that sense, this whole troop build-up might not be about an impending invasion at all. It might just be about coercive diplomacy, getting the U.S. to the table, and getting them to hammer out an agreement that would somehow pledge to keep Ukraine out of NATO and pledge to keep Western military infrastructure out of Ukraine and parts of the Black Sea.

michael barbaro

Well in that sense, Anton, Putin may be getting what he wants, right? Because as we speak, President Putin and President Biden have just wrapped up a very closely watched phone call about all of this. So is it possible that that call produces a breakthrough and perhaps a breakthrough that goes Putin’s way?

anton troianovski

Well, that’s very hard to imagine. And that’s really what makes this situation so volatile and so dangerous, which is that what Putin wants, the West and President Biden can’t really give.

michael barbaro

Why not?

anton troianovski

Well, for instance, pledging to keep Ukraine out of NATO would violate the Western concept that every country should have the right to decide for itself what its alliances are. President Biden obviously has spent years, going back to when he was vice president, really speaking in favor of Ukrainian sovereignty and self-determination and trying to help Ukraine take a more Western path. So Biden suddenly turning on all of that and giving Putin what he wants here is hard to imagine.

michael barbaro

Right, because that would create a very slippery slope when it comes to any country that Russia wants to have influence over. It would then know that the right playbook would be to mass troops on the border and wait for negotiation with the U.S. and hope that the U.S. would basically sell those countries out. That’s probably not something you’re saying that President Biden would willingly do.

anton troianovski

Right. And then, of course, the other question is, well, if Russia doesn’t get what it wants, if Putin doesn’t get what he wants, then what does he do?

michael barbaro

So Anton, it’s tempting to think that this could all be what you just described as a coercive diplomatic bluff by Putin to extract what he wants from President Biden and from the West. But it feels like history has taught us that Putin is willing to invade Ukraine. He did it in 2014. History has also taught us that he’s obsessed with Ukraine, dating back to 1991 and the end of the Soviet Union. And it feels like one of the ultimate lessons of history is that we have to judge leaders based on their actions. And his actions right now are putting 175,000 troops near the border with Ukraine. And so shouldn’t we conclude that it very much looks like Putin might carry out this invasion?

anton troianovski

Yes, that’s right. And of course, there are steps that Putin could take that would be short of a full-fledged invasion that could still be really destabilizing and damaging. Here in Moscow, I’ve heard analysts speculate about maybe pinpoint airstrikes against the Ukrainian targets, or a limited invasion perhaps just specifically in that area where Russian-backed separatists are fighting. But even such steps could have really grave consequences. And that’s why if you combine what we’re seeing on the ground in Russia, near the border, and what we’ve been hearing from President Putin and other officials here in Moscow, that all tells us that the stakes here are really high.

michael barbaro

Well, Anton, thank you very much. We appreciate your time.

anton troianovski

Thanks for having me.

On Tuesday afternoon, both the White House and the Kremlin released details about the call between Putin and Biden. The White House said that Biden warned Putin of severe economic sanctions if Russia invaded Ukraine. The Kremlin said that Putin repeated his demands that Ukraine not be allowed to join NATO and that Western weapons systems not be placed inside Ukraine. But Putin made no promises to remove Russian forces from the border.

The Russian oligarch and Chelsea owner fell ill along with Ukrainian peace negotiators earlier in the month, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The billionaire and at least two members of his Ukrainian counterparts fell ill shortly after a meeting in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv where he was looking to hold peace talks.

The alleged attack has been blamed on hardliners in Moscow who they say want to sabotage their talks to end the war.

It isn't known whether the suspected attack was caused by a biological or chemical agent or electromagnetic radiation.

However, President Zelensky - who has met with Abramovich in recent weeks - has reportedly been unaffected.

Sources claim symptoms of the poisoning include constant and painful tearing, red eyes and peeling skin on the face and hands.

The source also added the Chelsea owner and Ukrainian negotiators have since recovered and their lives are not in danger.

Ukraine’s foreign minister said a cease-fire was the most his country could hope for from the talks, due to be held in Istanbul on Tuesday after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Sunday.

“We are not trading people, land or sovereignty,” Dmytro Kuleba said.

A report that Russian billionaire and mediator Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators had suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv this month underlined the tension over the talks.

The Wall Street Journal and the investigative outlet Bellingcat cited people familiar with the matter for their reports but Ukraine poured cold water on them and a US official said the cause of the symptoms was environmental, not poison.

In besieged Ukrainian cities where conditions are desperate, the threat of Russian attacks blocked exit routes for civilians, two Ukrainian officials said, including the devastated port of Mariupol whose mayor said 160,000 people were still trapped.

But the United Nations said it had been able to bring food and medical supplies into Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-biggest city and one of its hardest hit.

A predawn missile blew out the wall of a Kharkiv school.

“They’ve not been able to take the city, so they’ve decided to destroy it,” said Oleksandr, sweeping rubble out of a third-story classroom after spending the night with his mother on a lower floor because their own neighborhood had been hit.

The mayor of Irpin, near Kyiv, said Ukrainian forces were back in full control and a US defense official said the Ukrainians had recaptured the eastern town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy and were continuing to try to take back ground.

Russia’s defense ministry, for its part, said its troops had destroyed ammunition depots in the Zhytomyr region west of Kyiv and had hit 41 Ukrainian military sites in the past 24 hours. Reuters could not immediately verify any of the reports.

“Change their goals”

Tuesday’s talks will be the first in person since an acrimonious meeting between foreign ministers on March 10, a sign of shifts behind the scenes as Russia’s invasion has stalled and sanctions have hit home.

“We have destroyed the myth of the invincible Russian army. We are resisting against the aggression of one of the strongest armies in the world and have succeeded in making them change their goals,” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

He said 100 people had been killed in the capital, including four children, and 82 multi-story buildings had been destroyed. It was not possible to verify the figures.

Russia’s military signalled last week it would concentrate on expanding territory held by separatists in eastern Ukraine, but Ukraine said it saw no sign Russia had given up a plan to surround the capital, which it targeted in its Feb. 24 invasion.

Ukrainian officials had suggested Russia could be more willing to compromise having seen stiff Ukrainian resistance and heavy Russian losses. But a senior US State Department official said Putin did not give that impression.

“Everything I have seen is he is not willing to compromise at this point,” the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, after Ukraine’s president sketched out a potential way to end the crisis over the weekend.

When the sides last met in person, Ukraine accused Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of ignoring pleas to discuss a cease-fire, while Lavrov said a halt to fighting was not even on the agenda.

Since then, they have held talks via video link and publicly discussed a formula under which Ukraine might accept some kind of formal neutral status. But neither side has budged over Russia’s territorial demands, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, and eastern territories known as the Donbas, which Moscow demands Kyiv cede to separatists.

“I don’t think there will be any breakthrough on the main issues,” Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said.

Turkey’s president Erdogan, however, was more upbeat, reporting progress in telephone calls with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Biden call “alarming”

The Kremlin said Biden’s surprise comment about Putin at the end of a speech in Warsaw at the weekend, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power” was “certainly alarming” after earlier saying it was up to Russians to choose their leader.

On Sunday Biden said he was not calling for regime change.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” to disarm and “denazify” its neighbor. Kyiv and the West consider this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion to try to topple the elected Ukrainian government.

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said talks should not end up “selling Ukraine out,” noting the “uneasy settlement” which left it vulnerable after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.

“We need to ensure that Putin can never act in this aggressive way again. Any long term settlement needs to include a clear sanctions snapback, which would be triggered automatically by any Russian aggression,” she told parliament.

Last week, Ukrainian forces pushed Russian troops back in areas around Kyiv, the northeast and the southwest, while Russia kept up pressure in the southeast near separatist areas, including its devastating siege of Mariupol.

Mayor Vadym Boichenko, speaking from an undisclosed location outside the city, said 26 buses were waiting to evacuate some of 160,000 trapped civilians but Russia was denying safe passage.

“People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe,” Boichenko said on national television. “We need to completely evacuate Mariupol.” A spokesperson for Boichenko said later that nearly 5,000 people had been killed and 90 percent of buildings damaged, of which 40 percent were destroyed.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said intelligence reports of possible Russian “provocations” along evacuation routes out of besieged cities meant there were no plans for such evacuations on Monday.

Elsewhere, Russia’s armored columns are bogged down, with trouble resupplying and making little or no progress.

Britain’s defense ministry said there had been no major change in Russia’s positions in the past 24 hours, with most Russian gains near Mariupol and heavy fighting underway there.

“As of today, the enemy is regrouping its forces, but they cannot advance anywhere in Ukraine,” Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar said.",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2051931/world

A 12-year-old boy who carved a wooden bowl to raffle for Ukrainians affected by the war has raised more than £200,000 for Save the Children's Ukraine appeal.

Gabriel Clark, from Cumbria, went viral last month after his father Richard issued a plea on social media for people to follow his son's woodwork Instagram account.

Within days, Gabriel's Instagram account, which shared picture's of the schoolboy's handcrafted creations, went from having six followers to 225,000.

The young boy soon decided to create one special bowl for Ukraine in an effort to raise funds for those affected by the ongoing war.

The Bowl For Ukraine appeal has now raised £215,822 and will end today when one winner will be chosen at random to win Gabriel's wooden bowl.

In a message on social media, Gabriel's father Richard wrote: ""How it ends is up to you. It's your story. Certainly we could all pat ourselves on the back for a job well done.

""Save the Children are already enormously grateful for the very real difference this money will make. But what if there was another ending?

""What if we threw caution to the wind and let go of our cynicism and really went for it?

""What if we blew this silly tale of a small boy and his bowl out of the water with a last swing shot around the moon?""",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-russia-war-latest-news-putin-zelenskyy-ceasefire-nato-visa-live-updates-12541713?postid=3513895
