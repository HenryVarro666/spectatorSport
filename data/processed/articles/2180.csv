Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv on Friday, with the government saying the city was hit by “horrific rocket strikes” in the early hours.

“Airborne assault troops of the Ukrainian armed forces are fighting in the areas of the settlements of Dymer and Invankiv,” Kyiv’s army said on its Facebook page.

Dymer is around 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Kyiv, while Ivankiv is about 60 kilometers northwest of the Ukrainian capital.

The military said it had stopped advancing Russian forces at the Teteriv River, a tributary of the Dnieper River that flows through Kyiv, adding that a bridge over it was destroyed.

The army also said it had retaken the Gostomel airfield, with reports that it had been captured by Russian forces the day before.

AFP was not able to immediately verify this.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that Moscow’s forces were also targeting civilian areas and praised his countrymen for their “heroism.”

“They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. But this is another lie of theirs. In reality, they do not distinguish between areas in which they operate,” Zelensky said in a video.

The United States announced a deal with European leaders on Friday to increase shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. And Germany set an ambitious goal of halving its imports of Russian oil and coal this year and freeing itself from its dependence on Russian natural gas by the middle of 2024.

Germany’s timelines, outlined by its vice chancellor, are a remarkable turnabout by Europe’s largest economy, which has long relied extensively on Russia for energy. Just a few months ago, Germany was still aiming to buy even more natural gas from Moscow through a new pipeline called Nord Stream 2.

But President Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has forced leaders in Germany and other European countries to rip up the energy playbook they had used for years, decades even, in just a month. The German vice chancellor, Robert Habeck, said at a briefing in Berlin that his country was shifting away from Russian energy at an “insane pace.”

President Biden is seeking to encourage similar moves by other European countries, in part by offering up the United States as an energy supplier.

The deal he announced, in Brussels earlier on Friday, lacked many details but contained some big goals: The United States would send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Europe this year — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. By 2030, the president said, the United States will aim to increase supplies by as much as 50 billion cubic meters a year.

The moves caught many in the U.S. energy industry by surprise. Oil and gas executives who have become accustomed to being pilloried for their contributions to climate change were suddenly being called up to help liberate European allies from Russian energy. While the industry was not certain how Europe would make such a giant pivot, executives clearly relished their new casting as saviors rather than villains.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them, because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, the executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Mr. Biden and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said many of the specifics would be worked out by a task force dedicated to reducing Europe’s dependency on Russian oil and gas in ways that would not undermine the climate policies of the two partners.

Among the things they did not address was the shortage of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic. The effort could also struggle because the Biden administration can’t simply order U.S. exporters to sell gas to European buyers or to set prices acceptable to those buyers.

“We’re going to have to make sure that families in Europe can get through this winter and the next while we’re building an infrastructure for a diversified, resilient and clean energy future,” Mr. Biden said.

The European Union is heavily reliant on energy imports from Russia, a big producer of oil, diesel, coal and, perhaps most important, natural gas. That dependence has become a growing problem as the European Union seeks to punish Mr. Putin. Russia provides about 40 percent of Europe’s natural gas, and a sizable chunk of it is shipped by pipeline through Ukraine.

Germany has long been one of Russia’s biggest customers. Having decided to shut down its nuclear plants, Germany has increasingly relied on natural gas. Because it got relatively affordable gas by pipeline from Russia — and some from the Netherlands, Norway and other suppliers — it declined to build any terminals where liquefied natural gas could be imported.

Germany also imports nearly a third of its crude oil from Russia. It has been trying to slash its consumption with generous subsidies for electric cars and greater investment in public transportation.

The Ukraine war has accelerated such German efforts under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who leads a coalition government made up of conservatives, liberals and environmentalists. Germany this year has revived plans to build gas importing terminals and has suspended final approvals of Nord Stream 2, an almost-complete pipeline that would have fed it a steady supply of Russian gas.

“Every supply contract that is terminated hurts Putin,” Mr. Habeck said on Friday.

Later in the day, E.U. countries agreed to jointly purchase and store natural gas. They set a target of filling 80 percent of their underground gas storage facilities by November as a buffer against supply disruptions during winter, when gas use increases for heating.

In the United States, gas exporters were already shifting sales to Europe from Asia in recent months, largely because prices in Europe have been higher than almost anywhere else in the world because of rising tensions with Russia and, more recently, the war in Ukraine. Nearly 75 percent of U.S. L.N.G. exports have gone to Europe so far this year, up from 34 percent in 2021. The Biden administration has encouraged that shift by relaxing export restrictions to certain European countries.

Charlie Riedl, the executive director at the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, a trade group, said he thought an extra 15 billion cubic feet of U.S. gas exports to Europe could be achieved relatively easily. He said two-thirds of that total could come from diverting shipments that otherwise would be bound for Asia, and the rest could come from recent federal approvals for additional production from existing American L.N.G. export terminals.

“Obviously it’s a positive sign that Europe is making attempts to wean itself off Russian gas,” Mr. Riedl said.

Energy executives say the Biden administration could help increase the flow of gas by streamlining permitting for new U.S. export terminals, where natural gas is chilled into a liquid and pumped into oceangoing tankers. Washington and the European Union could also provide loan guarantees for U.S. export terminals and European import terminals. There are roughly a dozen U.S. export terminals that have won regulatory approval but need financing to be built. About 10 European import terminals are being built.

Executives complain it can take more time to obtain permits for pipelines and export terminals than to build them.

Export terminals require investments of up to $10 billion, while import terminals cost about $1 billion to build. The United States has seven export terminals, and Europe has 28 large-scale import terminals.

Environmentalists criticized Mr. Biden’s announcement because they fear it will commit the United States and Europe to using fossil fuels for decades longer than they argue is sustainable given the growing toll of climate change.

“There is no way to ramp up U.S. L.N.G. exports and deliver on the imperative climate commitments that the U.S. and E.U. have pledged,” said Abigail Dillen, the president of Earthjustice, an environmental law organization. She warned that the buildup of L.N.G. infrastructure would “lock in expensive fossil dependence and dangerous pollution for decades to come.”

American and European officials also agreed to seek ways to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from L.N.G. infrastructure and pipelines and to reduce the release of methane from gas operations. They said they would ramp up energy efficiency initiatives, such as the deployment of heat pumps and the use of clean hydrogen technologies to displace fossil fuels, as well as expedite planning and approval of renewable energy projects such as offshore wind and solar power.

The Biden administration has banned Russian energy imports as part of a set of sanctions against Mr. Putin, a relatively easy step for the United States because it is a net exporter of energy. Some U.S. lawmakers would like the European Union to stop buying oil and gas from Russia altogether, but the prospect for that has been dismissed by several E.U. leaders, who see it as a financially disastrous step that would hurt Europe more than Russia.

Some energy experts said a further escalation of the war, such as a decision by Mr. Putin to use chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, could leave the European Union with little choice but to bar the purchase of Russian energy.

“We want as Europeans to diversify away from Russia, toward suppliers that we trust, that are friends and that are reliable,” Ms. von der Leyen of the European Commission said at the announcement with Mr. Biden. “Therefore the U.S. commitment to provide the European Union with an additional at least 15 billion cubic meters of L.N.G. this year is a big step in this direction, because this will replace the L.N.G. supply we currently receive from Russia.”

Still, oil and gas executives said Mr. Biden and Ms. von der Leyen would have to be patient and recognize that decisions on who sold gas to whom would be made across negotiating tables by private companies, not by politicians. Ultimately, exporters will seek to sell their gas to buyers willing to pay the highest price.

“This is a capitalist system,” Mr. Souki, the Tellurian executive, said. “It’s people like me who make those decisions. The government can’t tell us where to send the gas.”

Ukraine's army is also better trained and equipped than in 2014, when Russia captured the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine without a fight, and is widely seen as highly motivated to defend the country's heartland.

Here are some details of Ukraine's military:

How do the numbers look?

In terms of manpower and weapons, the arithmetic looks grim for Ukraine.

Most military experts' estimates put the number of Russian troops near Russia's border with Ukraine at more than 100,000. Russia has also moved some troops to Belarus, north of Ukraine, for military drills.

Russia's army has about 280,000 personnel and its combined armed forces total about 900,000, while its 2840 battle tanks outnumber Ukraine's by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

Ukraine's prime minister said a decree recently signed by Zelenskiy - on priority measures to strengthen the state's defence capabilities, increase the attractiveness of military service and the gradual transition to a professional army - would eventually bring Ukraine's armed forces to 361,000 personnel.

Although Ukraine trebled its defence budget in real terms from 2010 to 2020, its total defence expenditure in 2020 amounted to only $4.3 billion, or one-tenth of Russia's.

Military analysts say Ukraine's anti-aircraft and anti-missile defences are weak, leaving it highly vulnerable to Russian strikes on its critical infrastructure. They say Russia would also seek to use its superiority in electronic warfare to paralyse its adversary's command and control and cut off communications with units in the field.

How experienced are Ukraine's forces?

Ukraine's forces have gained combat experience in the Donbass region in the east of the country, where they have been fighting Russia-backed separatists since 2014, and are highly motivated.

They also have short-range air defences and anti-tank weaponry, including US-supplied Javelin missiles, which would help to slow any Russian advance.

Beyond the regular army, Ukraine has volunteer territorial defence units and about 900,000 reservists. Most adult males have at least basic military training, so Russia could find itself facing stubborn and protracted resistance if it tried to capture and hold onto territory.

The military challenge would be incomparably higher than in previous wars Russia has fought since the Soviet Union's collapse, including in breakaway Chechnya in the 1990s and against Georgia in 2008.

What is the West doing to help Ukraine's military?

Western countries have stepped up arms deliveries to Ukraine, but Kyiv says it needs more. The United States has ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine to fight.

The United States has provided more than $2.5 billion in military aid since 2014, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, coastal patrol boats, Humvees, sniper rifles, reconnaissance drones, radar systems, night vision and radio equipment. Further supplies could include Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, small arms and boats.

Turkey has sold Kyiv several batches of Bayraktar TB2 drones, which it deployed against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Britain supplied Ukraine with a reported 2000 short-range anti-tank missiles in January and sent British specialists to deliver training. It has also provided Saxon armoured vehicles.

Estonia said it was sending Javelin anti-armour missiles and Latvia and Lithuania are providing Stinger missiles. The Czech Republic has said it plans to donate 152mm artillery ammunition.

Germany has ruled out arms deliveries to Ukraine but is co-financing a $6m field hospital and providing training.

Could Russia stage a full-scale invasion?

Many military analysts say this would be unlikely because it would involve a long and messy war with unavoidably heavy casualties. They expect Russia to opt for crushing air strikes and/or limited land grabs rather than all-out war including battles for major cities.

One option would be for Russia to push south and west from the Donbass region of east Ukraine, already controlled by pro-Russian forces, to link up with annexed Crimea and the Black Sea. There is also a possibility that troops in Belarus could cross Ukraine's northern border as part of an attack.

Putin would be likely to face qualms from his own public about waging war on a fellow Slav nation, as well as intense anti-Russian sentiment within Ukraine. Russia has already been sanctioned over moving troops into separatist-controlled regions of Ukraine, and will most likely face much harsher ones for a full invasion.

UN increases humanitarian funds

The United Nations announced that it was immediately allocating $20 million (€17.8 million) to scale up UN humanitarian operations in Ukraine.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that U.N. and its humanitarian partners ""are committed to staying and delivering, to support people in Ukraine in their time of need ... regardless of who or where they are.''

""With deaths rising, we are seeing images of fear, anguish and terror in every corner of Ukraine,"" the Guterres said.

""People — everyday innocent people — always pay the highest price.""

UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said the funds will support emergency operations along the contact line in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions and in other areas of the country and ""help with health care, shelter, food, and water and sanitation to the most vulnerable people affected by the conflict.""

Ukraine requests human rights meeting

Ukraine has requested that an urgent debate on the humanitarian situation in the country be held at the UN human rights council.

The request was made in response ""the extremely grave deterioration"" of the situation in the country, Ukraine's UN envoy Yevheniia Filipenko said.

The EU delegation to the UN tweeted that it ""fully supports"" the request.

The council is made up of 47 countries, including Ukraine and all five permanent members of the UN security council.

The council is set to meet on Monday and is expected to be in session for five weeks.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken are scheduled to speak at the council on Tuesday.

Macron and Putin speak

French President Emmanuel Macron called Vladimir Putin on Thursday demanding Russia stop military operations in Ukraine.

The French president phoned his Russian counterpart after he spoke telephonically with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Macron undertook strenuous diplomacy in recent weeks to avert a Russian invasion of Ukraine, including holding direct talks with Putin.

The Kremlin says there was a ""serious and frank exchange of views"" during the Thursday call.

Putin explained ""in detail his reasons for the invasion, but Macron warned him of ""massive sanctions.""

Ukrainian men age 18-60 prohibited from leaving

Ukraine's border guard has said that males aged 18-60 are not allowed to leave the country in a statement posted on its Facebook account.

The border guard said that this restriction will last for the duration of the period of martial law in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law earlier on Thursday shortly after it was reported that Russia had attacked Ukraine.

UN says 100,000 have fled their homes.

An estimated 100,000 have fled their homes and are uprooted after Russia's invasion, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Thursday.

Shabia Mantoo, a spokesperson for the UNHCR, told the Reuters news agency several thousand Ukrainians have crossed into neighboring countries, mainly Moldova and Romania.

Poland said it would open nine reception centers to deal with the influx of refugees.

Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski said Poland will take in ""as many as there will be at our borders.""

The centers would offer arrival meals and medical care, and a place to rest and receive information.

IAEA calls for 'maximum restraint' as Russians take Chernobyl

Ukraine announced that is had lost control of the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, where radiation is still leaking from history's worst nuclear power disaster in 1986.

""After the absolutely senseless attack of the Russians in this direction, it is impossible to say that the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe. This is one of the most serious threats to Europe today,"" said Mykhailo Podolyak, advisor to the chief of the presidential administration.

The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that according to its information, ''there were no casualties or destruction at the industrial site.''

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi called for ''maximum restraint'' to avoid actions that could put Ukraine's nuclear facilities at risk.

''In line with its mandate, the IAEA is closely monitoring developments in Ukraine with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear power plants and other nuclear-related facilities,'' he said in a statement.

Read in-depth coverage from DW

Germany's Russian foreign policy famously focused on diplomacy instead of confrontation, given its own history with the Soviet Union during World War II. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine changes ties between the countries. What's next for Berlin?

Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to send troops across the border of a sovereign nation threatens European security, especially security of smaller eastern European states that aren't members of the EU or NATO. Here's how Russian invasion stands to shake up the geopolitical order as we know it.

Meanwhile, anti-war protests took place in numerous countries on Thursday, from Tokyo to Berlin to Madrid and even Moscow, until police intervened.

More than a thousand people detained in anti-war protests around Russia

Police have detained at least a thousand people at anti-war protests in cities across Russia, rights monitoring group OVD-Info said. The group has documented crackdowns on Russia's opposition for years.

The protesters staged small and single-person demonstrations against Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier Russian authorities warned anti-war sympathizers from gathering for protests. Russia outlawed demonstrations without a permit in 2014, though freedom of assembly is anchored in its constitution in theory.

US President Joe Biden declares 'Putin chose this war'

In a televised addressed, US President Joe Biden said that ""for weeks we have been warning that Russia was preparing an attack. We saw staged political theater in Moscow, that Ukraine was about to launch a war with Russia…that Ukraine committed a genocide. Without any evidence.""

""Putin declared his war,"" Biden continued, ""and within moments missiles began to fall on historic cities in Ukraine.""

""We’ve been transparent with the world, we’ve shared intelligence…so there could be no confusion about what Putin is doing. Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war.""

Biden then announced a new raft of sanctions, which targeted Russian banks and industry.

""We have purposely designed these sanctions to maximize the impact on Russia and minimize the impact on our allies…We are not acting alone. We have built a coalition representing half of world’s economy.""

The president said that the effects of global sanctions could already been seen, ""earlier today, the ruble hit its lowest level in history.""

He then made clear that US soldiers currently being moved to Europe were to defend NATO allies, and would not be mobilized inside Ukraine.

UN releases $20 million to aid Ukraine

Antonio Guterres said the UN was scaling up its humanitarian operations in Ukraine.

The UN Secretary-General spoke to reporters at the UN head office in New York, stressing, ""the protection of civilians must be priority number one.""

The UN was releasing $20 million (€17.9 million) for immediate aid, he said.

He repeated his call to President Vladimir Putin to stop the military operation and pull back troops.

""It is not too late to save this generation from the scourge of war. We need peace,"" Guterres said.

Boris Johnson announces a new set of sanctions on Russia

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the ""largest-ever"" set of economic sanctions against Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking to parliament, Johnson said the UK was sanctioning more than 100 individuals and entities and freezing assets of all major Russian banks, including VTB Bank.

""Furthermore, we are also banning [Russian commercial airline] Aeroflot from the UK,"" Johnson said.

The prime minister said some of the main restrictions would target Russian access to British banks, urging the EU to do the same with its SWIFT transaction system.

""These powers will enable us totally to exclude Russian banks from the UK financial system, which is of course by far the largest in Europe, stopping them from accessing sterling and clearing payments through the UK,"" Johnson told parliament.

In answer to questions from British lawmakers, Johnson said the West has learned ""a bitter lesson"" about how to deal with Putin.

""The whole of the West failed to respond in the way we should,"" he said.

Putin would be condemned by the world and by history for his invasion, never able to cleanse the ""blood of Ukraine"" from his hands, Johnson said.

India's Modi calls Putin, urging 'immediate cessation of violence'

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been friendly with Putin in the past, said he spoke with the Russian president on the phone, and called for ""an immediate cessation of violence"" as well as ""concerted efforts from all sides to return to the path of diplomatic negotiations and dialogue.""

Some 16,000 Indian nationals reside in Ukraine, and Modi's foreign minister said earlier on Thursday that their safety and security was the government's top priority. Around 4,000 Indians have been repatriated in recent weeks, he said.

German Chancellor Scholz warns Putin not to 'underestimate' NATO resolve

Chancellor Olaf Scholz appeared at the top of the hour in the 6 p.m. evening news in Germany, giving a short address in response to developments in Ukraine.

Scholz repeated his earlier comments in parliament when he had referred to the conflict as ""Putin's war.""

""He and not the Russian people decided on this war. He alone bears responsibility for it. This war is Putin's war,"" Scholz said.

Scholz said it was important to ensure that ""conflict does not spread to other countries in Europe."" He warned the Russian leader not to underestimate NATO's determination to protect its members, which do not include Ukraine.

The Social Democrat said that fresh sanctions were being prepared internationally to ""make Putin pay a high price for the attack.""

EU leaders including Scholz are meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue, and are expected to announce new measures after their talks.

G7 plans severe, coordinated response

Russian President Vladimir Putin has “re-introduced war to the European continent,"" the leaders of the G7 said in a joint statement following a virtual meeting on Thursday.

They strongly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine saying it was ""a serious threat to the rules-based international order, with ramifications well beyond Europe.""

They said Putin ""put himself on the wrong side of history,"" and called on Russia to ""stop the bloodshed, to immediately de-escalate and to withdraw its forces from Ukraine.""

The Group of Seven industrialized nations plans to bring forward severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions against Moscow.

The G7 leaders also said they were ""closely monitoring"" volatile oil and gas markets, and ""stand ready to act as needed to address potential disruptions.""

Markets take a hit, oil prices skyrocket

On Thursday morning, the price of Brent crude topped $100 (€89) per barrel. By the afternoon, Brent prices cruised past $105 per barrel for the first time since 2014.

Stock markets nosedived. Germany's DAX index plummeted by more than 5%, diving to around 13,870 points — its biggest daily dip in around two years.

""Our worst fears have been realized,"" said portfolio manager Thomas Altmann from QC Partners in Frankfurt. ""There is war raging in Europe.""

Gold, a classic ""safe haven"" investment, also rose in value, approaching $2,000 per troy ounce.

Shares in Russian gas giant Gazprom lost about a third of their value as investors anticipated further sanctions on Russia and its energy exports.

Opposition lawmaker says Germany should reconsider arms stance

The West failed to take President Vladimir Putin's threat against Ukraine ""seriously enough,"" Thomas Silberhorn, a German opposition lawmaker from the conservative CDU/CSU alliance told DW.

He said Germany should now consider sending defensive weapons to aid Ukraine.

""It's always legitimate to support a country which is under attack. This is the minimum we should deliver as Western, liberal democracies,"" Silberhorn said. Until now, Germany had opted not to send weaponry to Ukraine, on the basis that it almost never approves arms exports to active conflict zones in the era since World War II.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine should provide impetus for Germany and Europe to reconsider its foreign policy, Silberhorn added.

""Our Western foreign policy and, in particular, our German foreign policy has been focused on dialogue, which is not wrong, but which is not sufficient. We need dialogue and deterrence and we need to do much, much more in Germany and in Europe to establish reliable and effective deterrents.""

Macron: Sanctions will be 'proportionate' to Russia's action

French President Emmanuel Macron, who had held talks with Putin in recent weeks as intensive diplomatic efforts were underway, said Paris and its allies had done everything to try to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In a televised address on Thursday, Macron said Russia's assault on Ukraine represented a ""turning point in European history"" and, as a result, ""there will be profound consequences for our continent and changes in our lives.""

""We have tried everything to avoid this war but it is here and we are ready,"" Macron said.

The French leader said sanctions would be ""proportionate"" to Russia's military operations, targeting its economy and its energy sector.

""We will show no weakness,"" Macron said. ""We will take all measures necessary to defend the sovereignty and stability of our European allies.""

F1 champs Vettel, Verstappen cast doubt on Russian Grand Prix

Four-times Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel said he would not take part in the Russian Grand Prix in September under the current circumstances, even if it goes ahead as planned.

""My own opinion is I should not go,"" Vettel, who races for Aston Martin, told reporters during pre-season testing in Barcelona. ""I think it’s wrong to race in the country.""

""I’m sorry for the innocent people that are losing their lives, that are getting killed for stupid reasons and a very, very strange and mad leadership,"" the 34-year-old said.

Reigning world champion Max Verstappen agreed.

""When a country is at war, it’s not correct to race there, that's for sure,"" said the Red Bull driver.

Western sanctions against Russia are likely to include measures against more Russian banks including VTB, the title sponsor of the Russian Grand Prix.

Ex-German chancellor Schröder: Russia's interests don't justify 'military means'

Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who sits on the board of Russia's state-run energy company Gazprom, seemed to criticize the Kremlin's decision to launch a war in Ukraine.

""There were many mistakes — on both sides"" Schröder wrote in a social media post, commenting on the relationship between Russia and the West. ""But even Russia's security interests do not justify the use of military means.""

At the same time, Schröder called on the West not to sever ""the remaining political, economic and civil society links"" with Russia.

""Despite the current dramatic situation, these are the basis for a hope that we all have: that a dialogue on peace and security on our continent is possible again,"" he said.

The news comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he had unsuccessfully sought talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the escalating crisis in eastern Ukraine.

Zelensky rejected Moscow's claim that Ukraine was a threat to Russia.

""The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,"" Zelensky said, adding that a Russian invasion would cost tens of thousands of lives.

Zelensky added that there were now 200,000 Russian troops amassed near Ukraine's borders.

War in Eastern Ukraine: Protests in front of the Russian Embassy in Berlin Stand with Ukraine There were more people than expected in front of the Russian embassy in Berlin on Tuesday evening. Many waved Ukrainian flags in solidarity. The ""Stand with Ukraine"" demonstration was organized by ""Vitsche Berlin,"" a group of Ukrainians living in Germany. Loosely translated, the Ukrainian word ""viche"" means a general meeting of the citizens.

War in Eastern Ukraine: Protests in front of the Russian Embassy in Berlin Support from political spectrum One of the demonstrators was SPD leader Saskia Esken. Among the many other German politicians were Michael Roth, chair of the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee, Tilman Kuban, leader of the Junge Union, the conservative CDU's youth organization, Sarah-Lee Heinrich from Grüne Jugend, which is linked to the Greens, and Berlin Senator for Culture Klaus Lederer from the Left party.

War in Eastern Ukraine: Protests in front of the Russian Embassy in Berlin Concern and fear Many were unable to hold back their tears amid fears that the conflict in eastern Ukraine will escalate. The demonstration took place just after the Russian parliament had approved a request by the president to use the country's armed forces outside of Russia.

War in Eastern Ukraine: Protests in front of the Russian Embassy in Berlin Uncertainty and hope Covered from head to toe in Ukraine's national colors, this woman, like the other protesters, is full of uncertainty. Will Russian troops advance? Where will they stop? Or is there still hope of a deescalation?

According to Moscow, the leaders of the two Russian-held separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk have asked Putin for help to fend off Ukrainian ""aggression.""

The US has accused Russia of plotting so-called false flag incidents, provocations staged to create a pretext for action.

Earlier on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden has sanctioned the makers of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that connects Russia and Germany.

Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called EU sanctions approved Wednesday against Russia ""a first step"" and warned more could follow.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is now well into its second month, but President Vladimir Putin’s troops have failed to make significant military progress in the country.

Having failed to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and topple the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Kremlin’s forces are now set to focus their efforts on the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine - an area that includes the cities of Donetsk, Luhansk and Mariupol.

So, how big is Ukraine’s army - and how does it compare to Russia’s military?

Fighting has been concentrated in the North, South and East of Ukraine (graphic: Mark Hall)

How big is Ukraine’s army?

According to the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS), Ukraine had 196,600 active military personnel when the invasion began on 24 February.

This split into:

125,600 ground troops

35,000 air personnel

15,000 naval troops

Another 900,000 reservists

These numbers have been bolstered as men aged between 18 and 60 have been conscripted and other civilians have volunteered to bear arms.

The country also has paramilitary groups fighting Russia, such as the controversial far-right Azov Battalion which reported on Tuesday (12 April) that it has been subjected to a chemical weapons attack in Mariupol.

These reports have not been officially confirmed.

The latest official estimate from Ukraine (from 12 March) is that it’s lost 1,300 soldiers.

The Russian defence ministry put Ukraine’s troop losses at 14,000 killed and 16,000 wounded as of 25 March.

Russia also says it has downed 99 Ukrainian aircraft, 1,194 tanks and armoured vehicles, and 443 artillery guns since the invasion began, according to the Interfax news agency.

None of these claims have been independently verified.

Most of Ukraine’s firepower is land-based, with the country boasting more than 2,000 tanks, 1,960 artillery pieces and 2,870 armoured vehicles at the time of Russia’s invasion.

Troops also have around 400 surface-to-air missile launchers that could take out Russian aircraft and access to Nato lethal aid, including 4,000 anti-tank weapons donated by the UK and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles from Germany.

The UK has provided a further 6,000 missiles, 120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems, as well as £25 million in backing to the Ukrainian military in recent weeks, with Boris Johnson traveling Kyiv for face-to-face talks with President Zelensky on 9 April.

At a NATO summit on 24 March, US President Joe Biden revealed the US was sending an $800 million arms package to Ukraine.

Ukraine says its losses have been much lower than Russia’s - although it’s hard to verify this claim (image: AFP/Getty Images)

Ukraine’s air power consists of 146 attack aircraft and 42 attack helicopters.

Ukraine’s navy contains just two warships.

It remains the only country in the world to have given up its nuclear weapons, meaning it has no deterrent to threaten Russia with.

Given the country has been fighting so-called Russian backed separatists in the East of the country since 2014, its armed forces are well-versed in combat.

However, with a defence budget of between $2bn to $5bn, it does not boast the capabilities of its powerful neighbour.

How big is Russia’s army?

Russia’s military vastly outguns Ukraine’s, with a budget of between $40bn to $65bn.

These are its capabilities:

900,000 active military personnel across land, sea and air

280,000 soldiers

165,000 air personnel

150,000 naval troops

Around two million reservists.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4, Professor Michael Clarke - a security expert and former director of the Royal United Services Institute - estimated 40% of the active Russian army consists of conscripts.

Vladimir Putin previously denied conscripts were fighting in Ukraine, but his defence ministry has since admitted some have played a role in the invasion.

Russian men between the ages of 18 and 27-years-old have to serve for a 12-month period every year but are not supposed to see frontline action under Russian law.

A new draft took place on Friday (1 April).

The number of troops Russia had in and around Ukraine at the time of the invasion was estimated to be 190,000, as well as several hundred mercenaries from the Wagner Group.

It is thought Russia has called up more troops from Chechnya, Eastern Russia and Syria in recent weeks to further bolster its force - although the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) believes it is struggling to find more troops.

Having retreated from the Kyiv region in early April, a western official has said they now believe Russia is aiming to “double or perhaps treble” the number of troops it has in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine - although it’s believed this redeployment could take “some considerable time”.

Satellite images released on 10 April by Maxar Technologies and shared by CNN have already shown an eight-mile long military convoy moving south through the east Ukraine town of Velkyi Burluk.

Meanwhile, western intelligence assessments seen by Politico have shown Russia is moving dozens of military aircraft close to its border with Ukraine, including 30 Su-27 fighter jets.

These same assessments have found Russia is transporting military hardware initially targeted at Kyiv by train back through Belarus towards the eastern front.

Ukraine claims to have killed around 19,600 Russian personnel (more than 10% of the initial invasion force).

An unnamed NATO official quoted in the Wall Street Journal claims 40,000 Russian troops have either been killed, wounded, or have gone missing - more than a fifth of its fighting force.

Western leaders believe Russian losses sit between 7,000 and 15,000 troops.

Russia has only officially admitted to losing 1,351 soldiers - a figure given on 25 March.

It’s impossible to independently verify these claims,

Casualties are believed to include seven high-ranking Russian generals - potentially a third of Russia’s senior military leadership in Ukraine.

It’s thought they have been forced to move into more advanced positions due to a breakdown in communications with frontline troops and to bolster reported low morale among Russian troops, putting them at greater risk of being killed.

Russia’s land-based capabilities include more than 13,000 tanks, just under 6,000 artillery pieces and close to 20,000 armoured vehicles - although not all of this firepower is being thrown at Ukraine.

Ukraine claims to have destroyed 732 tanks and 349 artillery pieces.

Russia’s main advantage is its long-range weaponry, with the country possessing more than 500 land-based ballistic missile launchers.

It claims to have used air-launched Kinzhal hypersonic missiles for the first time - something US President Joe Biden confirmed on 21 March.

But the UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update that the weapon is still “developmental” and that its use was “highly likely intended to detract from a lack of progress in Russia’s ground campaign”.

Russia has used missiles to hit sites across Ukraine, including in the city of Lviv which is close to the border with NATO member Poland.

As well as key infrastructure, projectiles and artillery shells have also hit civilian areas, including flat blocks and railway stations.

When it comes to aircraft, the country has 1,328 attack planes and more than 470 attack helicopters.

Ukraine claims to have downed or captured 157 aircraft and 140 helicopters.

At sea, its 74 warships and 51 submarines dwarf Ukraine’s tiny fleet - although Ukraine says it has still been able to destroy seven Russian vessels.

Russia has had plenty of battlefield experience over the last decade as a result of its involvement in Syria’s civil war, where it has propped up the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

It has also sent forces to Libya and Kazakhstan.

However, this experience appears to have counted for little in Ukraine given the army has struggled with widely reported logistical issues and shoddy lines of communication.

Professor Michael Clarke told the BBC there is also “deep corruption” within the Russian ranks and said the fact that most of the army believed it was on exercise in the run up to the invasion meant it was not battle ready.

“When they’re on exercise, they agree to all sorts of things that aren’t really true - they tick the boxes for maintenance that [isn’t] really there and they sell their equipment because they’re paid so little. And so the forces that have gone over the border, actually, are extremely unprepared,” he said.

Russia’s biggest threat to Ukraine and the rest of the world is its stockpile of nuclear weapons, the mere existence of which acts as a deterrence to directly engaging in warfare with the country.

Vladimir Putin heightened the alert level for Russia’s nuclear forces at the beginning of March.

How big are the UK’s armed forces?

According to the latest publicly available assessment by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the UK’s full-time armed forces consist of more than 159,000 personnel.

This figure includes 76,300 ground soldiers, 29,960 air personnel and 29,136 naval troops.

Some of these troops are currently on deployment with Nato in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states amid fears Russia could be planning to invade other neighbours and former USSR states.

The UK actually has a target to reduce its land-based forces to 72,500 by 2025, meaning it would have 30,000 fewer troops than it did in 2010

At present, it has more than 32,000 reservists.

How big is the US army?

Few countries can match the might or technology of the US military machine.

According to the latest estimates from 2020, the country spends north of $700bn annually on its armed forces.

In 2020, this was 37% of the entire global defence budget.

There are believed to be more than one million active ground troops, more than 300,000 naval personnel and over 300,000 air troops.

How big is the NATO army?

The defence organisation Nato has around 3.5 million active and reserve personnel it can call upon should one of its members be attacked.

Russia invades

At around 4 a.m. local time on Feb. 24, Russian forces poured into Ukraine from four primary directions, according to an analysis by the research group Institute for the Study of War.

Russia crossed the eastern border near the city of Kharkiv and also launched attacks from the Donbas region, which since 2014 has been controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. To the north, Russian forces crossed the border from Belarus — a country with close military and defense ties to Russia — and took over the city of Chernobyl. Another attack originated from Russia-controlled Crimea in the south of Ukraine.

Since then, Russian troops have advanced and taken control of vast swaths of Ukrainian territory. Kherson was the first Ukrainian city to be captured. Other cities have been bombarded by shelling.

Ukrainians flee en masse

Since the beginning of the war, 4 million people have fled to neighboring countries — roughly 9.2% of Ukraine’s population. The vast majority have gone to Poland, according to U.N. data.

The history

The tensions in the region trace back decades to Ukraine’s decision in 1991 to declare independence from what was then the Soviet Union.

Ukraine has been an independent country ever since, but Russian President Vladimir insists it should be a part of Russia. “Ukraine is not just a neighboring country for us,” Putin said in a televised speech on Feb. 21. “It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space.”

Ukraine was among several Soviet republics that became independent countries as the Soviet Union collapsed. The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania eventually joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as did several former members of the Soviet-era Warsaw Pact.

Part of Putin’s stated rationale for war was to prevent NATO from expanding farther east. Putin has said he considers the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western alliance “a hostile act.”

After Ukraine’s pro-Russia president was ousted from office after mass protests in 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, a strategic Ukrainian peninsula on the Black Sea. That same year, Russia-backed separatists in the eastern region of Donbas launched an insurgency against Ukrainian troops, taking control of parts of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Putin’s critics contend that his invasion realizes a years-long desire to take control of Ukraine. Paving the way for such an action, they note, he has increased his crackdown on dissent within Russia in recent years. Many of his political opponents have been jailed or killed.

War met with sanctions from the West

In response to the invasion, President Biden and other Western leaders piled on economic sanctions against Russia’s financial institutions, causing the value of the Russian ruble to plummet.

Early on, Germany halted the authorization of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which would have carried Russian natural gas directly to the country. More than one-third of the gas consumed by the European Union is imported from Russia.

Biden and other NATO allies have expressed support for Ukraine, offering weapons assistance and financial aid. Because Ukraine is not a NATO member, however, they have made clear they will not intervene with military force.

“There’s no scenario — the president is not sending U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine against Russia,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in Feb. 23 briefing.

The White House also imposed sanctions directly against Russian President Vladimir Putin and more than a dozen oligarchs and their families, working through an expanding list of Russian elites to peel back the layers of Putin’s wealth.",https://www.latimes.com/projects/russia-ukraine-invasion-maps/

Russian air strikes hit military facilities across the country and ground forces moved in from the north, south and east, triggering condemnation from Western leaders and warnings of massive sanctions.
