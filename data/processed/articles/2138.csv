“They seized the city executive committee, removed all Ukrainian flags from buildings,"" Kovalenko said, according to an NBC News translation.

The city is the location of a hydroelectric power plant.

As Ukraine's forces battled troops on the ground, the U.S. along with the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada announced Saturday that select Russian banks would be removed from the SWIFT messaging system.

The option had been on the table, but some allies in Europe with economies more closely tied to Russia's had been reluctant to include SWIFT among sanctions because of the possible impact it could have.

The U.S. and other allies like Germany were also speeding badly needed weaponry and supplies to the outgunned Ukrainians, who were refusing to surrender.

Ukraine’s minister of defense, Oleksiy Reznikov, said early Sunday that forces fending off the Russian offensive in Kyiv have made history.

“Three days changed our country and the world forever,” he said on Facebook, praising those who have taken up arms and rescuers and medical personnel.

Restrictions were also set in motion to restrict Russian movement in the skies.

The United Kingdom, Romania and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have plans to close their airspace to Russian aircraft or have already done so.

Germany was also preparing to close its airspace to Russian aircraft and preparations were being made, the country’s transportation ministry tweeted Saturday.

Also Saturday, German airline Lufthansa said it will not use Russian airspace for the next seven days “due to the current and emerging regulatory situation.”

The former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, which is one of Russia’s closest allies, surprised Moscow-watchers by announcing that it will deny Putin’s request for Kazakh troops to help subjugate Ukraine.

Kazakhstan also said it would not join Putin in recognizing the breakaway pro-Russian Luhansk and Donetsk regions in eastern Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also asked United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres to strip Russia of its vote on the Security Council.

Russia was the only country to veto a U.N. resolution Friday that demanded Moscow end its attack on Ukraine. As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia holds veto power over all resolutions made by the international body. Three countries abstained.

On Friday, the United States and European Union took the rare step of imposing sanctions on a head of state by targeting Putin, as well as his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other members of Russia’s Security Council.

A Russian freighter loaded with cars bound for St. Petersburg was seized off the coast of France overnight under new sanctions imposed by the European Union, French maritime officials confirmed to NBC News.

Fight for Ukraine's cities

As Zelenskyy rallied his countrymen, Russian forces were less than 20 miles away from Kyiv but struggling to pierce the outer ring of the city's defenses, the U.S. official said.

Some of the heaviest fighting has been reported in and around the city of Kharkiv, the official said. And the Ukrainian Air Force was still challenging the Russians in the sky despite being barraged by some 250 short-range missile strikes.

Zelenskyy and his government have refused to leave the capital, though the Ukrainian president has said he believes he is the number-one target of the Russian attack. Instead, he has been posting videos from the streets, urging his people to join him in defiance.

The U.S. defense official declined to comment on reports that Zelenskyy rebuffed a U.S. offer to evacuate him from the country.

“We have withstood and successfully repelled enemy attacks,” Zelenskyy said in a speech Saturday morning to his countrymen. “The fighting continues in many cities and districts of our state, but we know that we are protecting the country, the land, the future of children.”

One of Zelenskyy's presidential predecessors was also staying in Kyiv to defend his homeland.

""Today in Kyiv, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will meet hell, and the Russian people and the Russian soldiers who come here to kill Ukrainians will pay the big price,"" former president Petro Poroshenko told Sky News.

Elsewhere, artillery and cruise missiles pounded cities across Ukraine, where Russian troops and armored vehicles have poured over the border. But American and British officials said their advance was slowed after meeting far greater Ukrainian resistance than expected.

Russia’s defense ministry claimed to have captured the southern city of Melitopol, with video posted to social media showing a Russian flag flying above a police station in the city. But the British government said it had failed to capture the city of 150,000 as well as achieve any of its major goals in the first days of the conflict.

“We can’t see anything to substantiate” the claim that Melitopol had fallen and it still appeared to be “in Ukrainian hands,” British armed forces minister James Heappey told the BBC early Saturday.

“The reality is that the armored columns that were coming down from Belarus and the north that were going to encircle Kyiv are still some way north because they’ve been held up by this incredible Ukrainian resistance,” he said.

Military, monetary reinforcements

Meanwhile, Moscow's unprovoked attack on its democratic neighbor has drawn widespread condemnation and turned Putin into an international pariah.

Tens of thousands of Ukrainians have fled the Russian advance, mostly to neighboring Poland and Romania.

Those who stayed were enduring an assault that Ukraine and international watchdogs said was increasingly hitting civilians.

The Russian attack has upended the West's sense of security, especially in countries on NATO's eastern flank with a long history of battling Moscow, including Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

NATO has moved to reinforce its eastern flank and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday authorized an additional $350 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-armor, small arms and other equipment.

“Today, as Ukraine fights with courage and pride against Russia’s brutal and unprovoked assault, I have authorized, pursuant to a delegation by the President, an unprecedented third Presidential Drawdown of up to $350 million for immediate support to Ukraine’s defense,” Blinken said in a statement.

Germany, which has been criticized for being slow to condemn the Russian invasion and for being reluctant to impose sanctions on Moscow, announced Saturday that it was sending the Ukrainians 500 ground-to-air ""Stinger"" missiles and 1,000 tank defense weapons.

""The Russian raid on Ukraine marks a turning point,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement. ""It threatens our entire post-war order. In this situation, it is our duty to support Ukraine.""

Military experts said Russia still has the overwhelming advantage, but it's not clear it has enough of an advantage to take over a Texas-sized country with 43 million people that has already found the weak spots in the Russian offensive.

“I just don’t believe that they have the capability, especially the further they go from Russian sovereign territory and from Belarus, that they will be able to maintain this,"" retired Gen. Ben Hodges, former commanding general, United States Army Europe and Pershing Chair in Strategic Studies at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said on MSNBC.

""And I think these convoys of big fuel trucks, for example, that have to follow the tanks — these things, they are very vulnerable, and I think we’re going to see more and more reports of these convoys being hit.”

'We won't put down our weapons'

Many Kyiv residents huddled in underground shelters and subway stations while officials imposed a strict curfew to root out the “enemy.” Armed with government-issued machine guns and homemade Molotov cocktails, Ukrainian civilians were helping to reinforce their army’s desperate but for now effective resistance against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion.

Zelenskyy said that Russia wanted to capture the city and install its own ""puppets"" to run Ukraine. His warnings have been echoed by Western officials who say Putin intends to decapitate Ukraine's pro-western government and possibly replace it with a Moscow-friendly regime.

In a video posted to social media earlier Saturday, Zelenskyy stood on a Kyiv street and rejected what he said was Russian disinformation that he had told his forces to surrender.

""We won’t put down our weapons,” Zelenskyy said. “We will protect our country because our weapon is our truth and it is our land, our country, our children and we will defend all of it.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed that Russian forces paused their advance Friday to offer negotiations to Ukraine — whose government Putin described as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,” repeating propaganda Russia uses to justify its actions.

Peskov said that Kyiv refused the offer, so the Russian attack had resumed Saturday afternoon.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-conflict-zelenskyy-kyiv-battle-putin-invasion-rcna17796

When explosions first rang out across Ukraine around 5 a.m. local time on Thursday, residents scrambled for cover and headed for the country’s borders to flee to safety. Moscow had officially launched a series of attacks on the country, which Russian President Vladimir Putin had been foreshadowing.



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was under attack “from the south, north, east and from the air.” Russian ground forces entered regions across the country, bombs fell on major cities, and cruise and ballistic missiles targeted military control centers in the area of the capital, Kyiv. On the second day of the advance, as the capital was rocked by explosions, residents and leaders braced for the city to be overrun.

By Thursday afternoon, Russian forces had taken control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant north of Kyiv where a 1986 reactor explosion caused the release of large amounts of radiation into the environment.

The invasion represents what could be the largest security threat to Europe since World War II. Ukrainian officials reported that more than 100 Ukrainian soldiers and Russian soldiers have died, along with at least several civilians. The Ukrainian government warned residents in Obolon, a district north of the capital, not to go outside early Friday.

2,11c31767-e222-47ab-9831-080c15029e91,"['Sebastien Roblin', 'Written By']",2022-02-24 20:02:28+00:00,"Russian Forces Close Around Kyiv, Break Out of Crimea—But Ukraine Holds the Line at Kharkiv and Mariupol – At 5 AM local time on February 24 Russia finally launched a long forecast full-scale invasion of Ukraine from multiple fronts—one with the objective of destroying the Ukrainian military and decapitating its government. Or in Russian President Putin’s Orwellian language, “a special military operation” to “disarm and de-Nazify” Ukraine.

It appears almost certain Moscow will seek to occupy at a minimum half of Ukraine, but more likely the entire country. That’s because Putin’s goal is not merely to grab additional territory, but to ensure that Ukraine remains cut off from Western military and economic partnership, and firmly under Moscow’s sway. That will involve installing a puppet regime to ensure that happens.

Putin also issued a thinly veiled threat of nuclear attack—“consequences greater than any you have faced in history” should NATO attempt to intervene in assistance to Ukraine.

This article seeks to assess the major developments in the first twelve hours of Russia’s assault on Ukraine.

‘Shock and awe’ bombardment

Moscow began its war with a massive missile and artillery bombardment targeting high-value military targets across the entire breadth (and nearly every major city) of Ukraine, particularly air defense radars, airbases, barracks, ammunition dumps, and port facilities, including Kyiv’s primary remaining naval bases at Mykolaiv and Odesa.

According to a Pentagon official, the bombardment was conducted by 75 medium and heavy bombers (presumably Su-34 and Tu-22M, Tu-95 or Tu-160 bombers) using land-attack cruise missiles, naval cruise missiles (likely Kalibr missiles), and “short and medium-range ballistic missiles”, likely referring to Iskander missiles.

So far attacks don’t appear to have been aimed at civilian power and water infrastructure, seemingly indicating Russian hopes of a swift victory with limited economic damage. However, some strikes have nonetheless landed on civilian targets, causing fatalities.

У Вугледарі російські окупаційні війська вбили 4 та поранили 10 цивільних – снаряди окупантів уразили місцеву лікарню. Серед поранених – 6 медиків. Обстріл стався близько 11-ї години.

Стан поранених різного ступеня важкості. pic.twitter.com/WMOxXfz7aQ — IgorGirkin (@GirkinGirkin) February 24, 2022

That said, Russia has not launched the massive, crippling cyberattacks long expected as part of its strategy—at least, not more than were already harrying Ukraine with on a daily basis before the commencement of kinetic operations.

Additionally, hundreds of rocket and howitzer artillery systems on Ukraine’s border unleashed massive barrages, particularly in the area around Kharkiv. Dud rockets can now be seen planted in the concrete of Ukrainian towns and cities.

Though some analysts speculated Russia might bombard Ukraine for several days before sending in ground forces, that didn’t prove to be the case. Armored columns began rolling into Ukraine just an hour or two after the barrage began.

It’s important to note that the tempo of missiles strikes on the opening day of the war is unlikely to be sustained indefinitely. Cruise and ballistic missiles are highly expensive weapons and Russia has a much smaller inventory of them than the United States does. That’s even true of shorter-range precision munitions released by aircraft. Though missile strikes will continue more sporadically against critical targets as they emerge, artillery and gravity bombs will increasingly do most of the damage, especially once air defenses are deemed sufficiently suppressed.

Belarus stabs Ukraine in back with thrust aimed at Kyiv

The deployment of 30,000 Russian troops to Belarus in January under the false pretext of a routine exercise is bearing its expected, terrible fruit: both Russian and Belarussian troops have advanced south towards the capital of Kyiv, overrunning the Chernobyl exclusion zone along the way. Moscow claims they have encountered little resistance so far. This thrust appears to be forming a pincer attack to encircle Kyiv.

While Belarus’s role in hosting the troops made Putin’s hold on its dictator Lukashenko clear, the actual participation of Belarussian forces in attacks on the border demonstrates how completely Minsk has become an appendage of Russian military power.

Were Ukraine’s air defenses destroyed?

Ukrainian forces claim to have downed seven Russian aircraft, including at least one Su-24 bomber. So far, the author has only seen photographic proof of destroyed helicopters, however.

Having devoted much of its first strike to suppressing Ukrainian air defenses, Russia now claims to have “destroyed” them.

I profiled means Russia might use for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) in an article in January. Since hostilities have commenced. Images reveal damage or destruction of at least three fixed air defense radars, as well as two of Ukraine’s newer-generation mobile L220 radars. Missile debris shows Russia has used its Kh-31P anti-radiation missile.

It’s still far from clear that Ukraine’s more mobile air defense radars and longer-range S-300P and Buk missiles are entirely destroyed yet, though they are surely engaged in a desperate fight for survival.

But even if Russia’s initial strikes really did knock those out, Ukraine’s numerous short-range air defense systems, which include Stinger missiles recently delivered from the Baltics, will remain. These already appear to be causing helicopter losses despite extensive use of heat-decoy flares.

As Russia has a limited inventory of precision weapons that can be used accurately from high altitude, its warplanes will eventually have to assume risks diving into the short-range air defense envelope to accurately strike ground targets.

It also appears likely (but not confirmed) that Russia’s initial bombardment destroyed most of the Ukrainian Air Force’s roughly 100 combat jets and roughly two dozen TB2 Bayraktar combat drones on the ground. Video does however show the UAF has flown sorties, though the author isn’t aware of any confirmed air-to-air engagement or Bayraktar strike footage so far.

One video billed as depicting an aerial engagement in fact shows two UAF MiG-29s in the air.

Airborne assault at Hostomel

The international cargo airport at Hostomel (or Gostomel), on the western outskirt of Kyiv, was heavily struck by Russian missiles in the initial bombardment. Then Russian paratroopers launched a helicopter-borne air assault, depositing troops in Mi-8 helicopters escorted by Ka-52 attack helicopters.

This was a risky operation as helicopters remain quite vulnerable to short-range air defenses. Indeed, at least two Ka-52s appear to have been downed near Hostomel.

However, the paratroopers reportedly secured the airport, which may now be converted into a logistical hub to land supplies and more airborne. Landing cargo aircraft there could still be risky, though, should Ukrainian air defense forces remain active in the area.

Kharkiv and Mariupol—Bombarded but Defiant

Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city is situated just 15 miles south of the border with Russia. During the preceding buildup, large Russian forces including armored units of the elite 1st Guards Tank Army massed in the city of Belgorod. In the opening hours of the war, a massive barrage of artillery rockets could be seen launching from Belgorod to come plummeting down on targets around Kharkiv.

But while Russian forces have advanced over the border towards Kharkiv, they reportedly have allegedly been stymied by effective Ukrainian resistance.

80 miles northwest of Kharkiv, though, Russian forces reportedly seized the road hub city of Sumy (population around 260,000), which can used as an additional corridor with which to advance towards Kyiv. However, Russian vehicle columns allegedly suffer substantial losses to U.S.-supplied Javelin missiles.

Far to the south, the long-besieged port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov has come under renewed attack. However, the defenses at Mariupol reportedly held against initial Russian attacks, with at least two Russian soldiers captured.

Unfortunately, Russian advances to the west appear certain to cut supply lines to both of these cities.

Russian forces break out of Crimean Peninsula, capture Kherson on Dnieper River

Troops from Russia’s 22nd Army Corps in Crimea, heavily reinforced by other armies, have broken through Ukrainian defenses along at least two axes and advanced dozens of miles north to reportedly capture the major Ukrainian city of Kherson (population 280,000), which lies on the Dnieper River. Russian forces are also reportedly advancing eastward in attempt to seize another Dnieper River bridge at Nova Kakhovka.

This is a heavy blow considering how an attack from this axis was relatively predictable and the terrain seemed defensible. Combined with Russian troops advancing south in the area around Kyiv, this could set the stage for Russian forces to cut off supply lines to all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper.

Waiting in the wings

Despite attacking Ukraine on every possible front, Russia has yet to deploy all of the forces it has amassed. Additional VDV airborne troops remain on standby for air landing operations, which could be delivered by helicopter, parachute, or by landing directly onto the runways of newly captured or undefended airports. It also has heavily reinforced naval infantry brigades in amphibious tank-landing ships in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov that has yet to be put into action.

Whether out of shock or possibly according to a defensive strategy, Ukrainian forces do not appear to have significantly impeded Russian mechanized forces rapidly advancing across open terrain towards Kyiv and Kherson. Likely, Ukrainian forces will have the most success combatting Russian troops in cities, where concealment is abundant, reducing the effectiveness of Russian airpower, surveillance assets, and ‘non-contact’ warfare tactics.

Moscow surely hopes to compel Kyiv’s surrender without having to storm particularly Kharkiv and Kyiv one block at a time. If Ukraine’s military insists on an urban fight, though, it could inflict heavy losses on Russia, but at the cost of massive urban destruction and loss of civilian life as occurred in Aleppo, Grozny (Chechnya) and Sarajevo.

“I can’t give you an exact geographic location of where they are, but they are not moving on Kyiv as fast as they anticipated they would be able to,” the official said.

The official added, Russians “continue to try to move on Kyiv,” even though they are meeting Ukrainian resistance.

The Russian invasion of the country is continuing in the Kharkiv area of Ukraine and from the south towards the Ukrainian city of Kherson on the river, the official added. These are still the three main advances on the country that Russia began yesterday, the official said.

There have been “no additional airborne drops over the last 24 hours” in the Kharkiv area, the official said.

The biggest change that the US is seeing is from the advance in the south, the official added. Russian forces are still moving towards Kherson on the river, but they are also splitting off some forces to go to the northeast “in the direction of Mariupol and the Donbas region,” the official said.

“The south towards Kherson on the river — we do assess that they continue to move in that direction. But we also think that — based on what we’re seeing in addition to moving from Crimea on an axis towards the northwest towards Kherson — they are also splitting off some forces to go to the northeast, sort of in the direction of Mariupol' and the Donbas region,” the official said.

(NewsNation Now) — Russia launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday, hitting key cities and military bases with airstrikes or shelling, causing 100,000 civilians to flee by trains and cars.

Russian military advanced from three sides Thursday — north from Crimea, south from Belarus and west from the Donetsk and Luhansk separatist regions — leading some to suggest the ultimate goal is to encircle the capital of Kyiv.

President Vladimir Putin ignored global condemnation and cascading new sanctions as he unleashed the largest ground war in Europe in decades, and chillingly referred to his country’s nuclear arsenal. He threatened any country trying to interfere with “consequences you have never seen.”

Some of the most intense fighting was outside of Kharkiv in the northeast, according to The New York Times. Russian forces have used more than 100 medium- and short-range ballistic missiles to strike Ukrainian military installations and air-defense targets, the Times reports, citing a senior defense official.

Simultaneously, Russia launched cyberattacks on Ukraine’s Parliament, banks and government offices. Experts say it is possible this online attack was planned months ago — but was timed to coincide with an invasion.

At least 137 Ukrainians have been killed so far in the invasion and 316 have been wounded, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In a video address released early Friday, Zelensky called them “heroes.”

Zelensky says that despite Russia’s claim it is attacking only military targets, civilian sites also have been struck. In his words: “They’re killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets. It’s foul and will never be forgiven.”

Report: Heavy explosions heArd in Kyiv

Heavy explosions were heard in Ukraine’s capital early Friday, according to a Reuters witness. The witness said the blasts were a series of sounds similar to artillery fire.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba confirmed the news.

“Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv. Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia. Severe [sic] all ties. Kick Russia out of everywhere.” Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba

Ukrainian males aged 18-60 are banned from leaving the country, Zelensky says

According to the AP, Male Ukrainian citizens aged 18 to 60 have been prohibited from leaving the country while martial law is in place.

In a statement posted on Facebook, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said “departure from Ukraine is restricted” temporarily.



“It is forbidden to travel outside the borders of Ukraine [for] citizens of Ukraine, male gender between 18 to 60 years old,” the statement said.

Russian sabotage groups enter Kyiv

President Volodymyr Zelensky said “enemy sabotage groups” have entered Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.

Zelensky, in a video statement Thursday, said “the enemy’s sabotage groups have entered Kyiv.” He also urged residents to be vigilant and to abide by the curfew rules.

His own family is hiding out due to threats on their lives, he said.

“The enemy has identified me as target No. 1 and my family as target No. 2. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,” Zelensky said.

Chernobyl nuclear plant taken by Russia

Among the most worrying developments on an already shocking day, Russian troops captured the Chernobyl nuclear plant, Ukrainian officials said. Radioactivity is still leaking from the scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, which took place in 1986.

Ukrainian officials said their forces were battling Russians on multiple fronts, and the condition of the plant’s facilities, a confinement shelter and a repository for nuclear waste is unknown.

The nuclear plant is located less than 100 miles north of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv.

An official familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository at Chernobyl, and an increase in radiation levels was reported. The increase could not be immediately corroborated.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it is following the situation in Ukraine “with grave concern” and appealed for maximum restraint to avoid any action that may put Ukraine’s nuclear facilities at risk.

In the videos shared by people, fighting can be witnessed near the military unit and around the airbase located near the city. Along with that, fighting was also reported from Kherson in southern Ukraine.

As reported by CNN, a massive Russian military convoy is said to be heading towards Ukraine's Nova Kakhovka region at a Dnieper River crossing. While the military vehicles are lined up on railroads near the Dnieper River crossing, it seems to be heading west.

Apart from that, missile attacks have been also reported from Kyiv. Concerning that, explosions have been reported from the outskirts of the southern parts of the city on Friday and Saturday. This comes as an effort made by the Russian troops to advance into the capital city in the early hours of Saturday morning. Witnesses of the incident have claimed the explosions took place near the military base in Kyiv as Russian forces flow into the capital from multiple sides. Apart from that, many have also claimed attacks on civilians.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stands strong for protecting Ukraine

Earlier on Friday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a video message assured the people that the government continues to fight and is protecting the country. ""We are here. We are in, We are defending our country, We are protecting Ukraine"", he said.

This came a day after his another message where he claimed that Russia is targeting him on priority followed by his family for taking over Ukraine. In a video in which he can be seen holding the camera himself, the President said, ""Our army is here, our civil society is here, we are all here. We are defending our independence, our state, and will continue to do so.""

As a part of the Ukrainian government's battle against Russia, the government has also handed out around 70,000 rifles to civilians for combating their enemies.

Russian forces’ main axes of advance in the last 24 hours focused on Kyiv, northeastern Ukraine, and southern Ukraine. Russian airborne and special forces troops are engaged in urban warfare in northwestern Kyiv, but Russian mechanized forces are not yet in the capital. Russian forces from Crimea have changed their primary axes of advance from a presumed drive toward Odesa to focus on pushing north toward Zaporizhie and the southeastern bend of the Dnipro River and east along the Azov Sea coast toward Mariupol. These advances risk cutting off the large concentrations of Ukrainian forces still defending the former line of contact between unoccupied Ukraine and occupied Donbas. Ukrainian leaders may soon face the painful decision of ordering the withdrawal of those forces and the ceding of more of eastern Ukraine or allowing much of Ukraine’s uncommitted conventional combat power to be encircled and destroyed. There are no indications as yet of whether the Ukrainian government is considering this decision point.

Ukrainian resistance remains remarkably effective and Russian operations especially on the Kyiv axis have been poorly coordinated and executed, leading to significant Russian failures on that axis and at Kharkiv. Russian forces remain much larger and more capable than Ukraine’s conventional military, however, and Russian advances in southern Ukraine may threaten to unhinge the defense of Kyiv and northeastern Ukraine if they continue unchecked.

Key Takeaways

Russia has failed to encircle and isolate Kyiv with the combination of mechanized and airborne attacks as it had clearly planned to do. Russian forces are now engaging in more straightforward mechanized drives into the capital along a narrow front along the west bank of the Dnipro River and toward Kyiv from a broad front to the northeast.

Russian forces have temporarily abandoned failed efforts to seize Chernihiv and Kharkiv to the northeast and east of Kyiv and are bypassing those cities to continue their drive on Kyiv. Russian attacks against both cities appear to have been poorly designed and executed and to have encountered more determined and effective Ukrainian resistance than they expected.

Russian movements in eastern Ukraine remain primarily focused on pinning the large concentration of Ukrainian conventional forces arrayed along the former line of contact in the east, likely to prevent them from interfering with Russian drives on Kyiv and to facilitate their encirclement and destruction.

Russian forces coming north from Crimea halted their drive westward toward Odesa, and Ukrainian forces have retaken the critical city of Kherson. Some Russian troops remain west of the Dnipro River and are advancing on Mikolayiv, but the main axes of advance have shifted to the north and east toward Zaporizhie and Mariupol respectively.

Russian forces have taken the critical city of Berdyansk from the west, threatening to encircle Mariupol even as Russian forces based in occupied Donbas attack Mariupol from the east, likely to pin defenders in the city as they are encircled.

Russian successes in southern Ukraine are the most dangerous and threaten to unhinge Ukraine’s successful defenses and rearguard actions to the north and northeast.

Russian troops are facing growing morale and logistics issues, predictable consequences of the poor planning, coordination, and execution of attacks along Ukraine’s northern border.

Russia has surprisingly failed to gain air superiority or ground the Ukrainian air force after three days of fighting. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at 11am local time that Ukrainian aircraft conducted 34 sorties in the past 24 hours.[1] Ukrainian air defenses remained active as of 6am local time, with the Ukrainian General Staff stating a S-300 downed a Russian Su-25 fighter and an unspecified helicopter over Donbas early on February 26.[2] Ukrainian forces likely shot down a Russian Il-76 transport aircraft over Kyiv the night of February 25.[3] Russian airstrikes concentrated on northern Kyiv, Mariupol, and unspecified Ukrainian airports on February 26.[4] Russian forces continue to refrain from using the full array of air and missile capabilities available to them. Moscow may seek to limit the informational and diplomatic effects of causing heavy Ukrainian civilian casualties, and may also seek to avoid creating rubble and other obstacles to movement into and through Ukrainian cities. Russian forces will likely increase their use of fires in coming days to overcome heavier-than-anticipated Ukrainian resistance, however.

Russian forces in northeast Ukraine face growing morale and supply issues, likely due to poor planning and ad hoc command structures, as ISW previously forecasted.[5] Several reports emerged on Ukrainian social media February 25-26 of Russian forces lost and running low on fuel in northeastern Ukraine.[6] A Russian riot police reportedly conducted an unsupported attack on eastern Kyiv and suffered heavy casualties late on February 25, likely symptomatic of wider Russian coordination issues.[7] Several US and European intelligence sources reportedly assess the Kremlin has had to adjust plans and commit more capabilities than anticipated at this point in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[8]

Russian ground forces are advancing on four primary axes, discussed in turn below:

Kyiv (NOTE: This is an alteration to our previous description of this axis, as we are now discussing Russian operations in Kyiv as a single line of effort); Northeast front (NOTE: Russian forces have now advanced on a broad axis between Chernihiv and Kharkiv, and this section will discuss the entire northeastern Russian advance); Donbas; and Crimea-Kherson.

1) Kyiv axis: Russia’s likely main effort to rapidly isolate Kyiv and force the Ukrainian government to capitulate has failed as of February 26. Russian forces entered downtown Kyiv along the western bank of the Dnipro River the night of February 25, but Russian forces have so far failed to enter the city from the east. Russian troops have not yet committed heavy armor and artillery forces to fighting in Kyiv and will likely need to do so to take the city. Ukrainian forces are unlikely to capitulate.

The Russian military’s main effort remains seizing Kyiv in an effort to force the Ukrainian government to capitulate. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at 11am local time February 26 that Ukrainian forces halted 14 Russian BTGs northeast of Kyiv and that Russia has committed its northern reserves – an additional 17 BTGs – along this operational direction.[9]

If the Russians have abandoned for now the attempt to encircle Kyiv and committed to frontal assaults from the northwest and east/northeast, then the Ukrainians would be in close to the optimal scenario for defending their capital. The Russians could change that situation either by getting forces from the northeast axis across the river south of Kyiv and encircling in that way, by using forces from Crimea to drive all the way to Kyiv from the south, or by re-attempting and finally succeeding in airlanding airborne troops to the southeast of the capital. Russia’s surprising failure to accomplish its initial planned objectives around Kyiv has given the Ukrainians an opportunity.

Russian forces entered downtown Kyiv on the west bank of the Dnipro River the night of February 25. Urban combat continued the night of February 25-26.[10] Only lighter Russian units – VDV (Airborne) and Special Forces – have entered Kyiv as of 7pm local time on February 26.[11] Russian forces have not yet committed heavy armor and artillery to urban fighting in Kyiv.

Russian forces have likely only entered Kyiv on a narrow band along the west bank of the Dnipro River. Russian forces have not completely isolated Kyiv and Ukrainian forces retain defensive positions in western Kyiv Oblast.[12] Ukrainian forces reported halted Russian armored advances on Kyiv at Borodyanka, Bucha, and Vyshhorod at 11am local time February 26.[13]

The Ukrainian military claimed to shoot down two Russian Il-76 transport planes (Russia’s equivalent of the US C-17) over Kyiv late on February 25.[14] These claims have not yet been confirmed by other sources.[15] If true, they may indicate Ukrainian troops have inflicted losses on a Russian airborne operation around Kyiv.

ISW cannot currently confirm the location or effectiveness of Russian sabotage groups reportedly active in downtown Kyiv as of February 25.[16]

Ukrainian forces and civilians continued preparations to fight for Kyiv block-by-block on February 25-26. Territorial defense units and armed civilians began establishing roadblocks and defensive positions throughout Kyiv overnight.[17] The Ukrainian government is distributing small arms and instructions to make Molotov Cocktails to civilians.[18]

2) Northeast axis: Russian forces advanced on a broad front between Chernihiv and Kharkiv on February 26 after Ukrainian forces halted direct Russian advances through both cities on February 24-25. Ukrainian forces continue to delay and inflict losses on the Russian advance but will likely not be able to halt further advances if the Kremlin commits additional reserves.

Ukrainian forces reported halting Russian advances on an axis roughly running through Nizhyn, Velyka Doroha, Obychiv, and Okhtyrka at 11am local time February 26.[19] Russian forces have likely penetrated northeastern Ukraine on a broad axis to the P67 highway, approximately 120km northeast of Kyiv.

Russian forces likely bypassed Kharkiv early on February 26 and may have enveloped it but have not yet entered the city center. Russian tank and motor rifle units are reportedly continuing direct assaults on the city and shelling residential areas.[20] Russian forces entered Volokhov Yar, 70km southeast of Kharkiv, at 11am local time on February 26.[21] Ukrainian forces took prisoners from the Russian 2nd Tank Division and 138th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade at unspecified locations around Kharkiv on February 26.[22]

Ukrainian forces confirmed that elements of Russia’s 1st Guards Tank Army and 20th Combined Arms Army comprise the main Russian force in northeast Ukraine.[23] Ukrainian forces additionally captured Russian troops from the 35th Motor Rifle Brigade of the 41st Combined Arms Army, including a battalion chief of staff, likely near Chernihiv.[24]

The Ukrainian General Staff reported at 6am local time that Russian forces retain an uncommitted reserve from the 35th Combined Arms Army around Mazyr, in southeastern Belarus.[25]

3) Donbas axis: Russian forces continued to deprioritize direct assaults in Donbas or an enveloping maneuver through Luhansk Oblast. Russian forces likely intend to pin Ukrainian forces in place on the line of contact to enable Russian forces breaking out of Crimea to isolate them. The Russians may be content to leave them there while concentrating on capturing Kyiv and imposing a new government on Ukraine. They may alternatively seek to encircle and destroy them or force them to surrender.

Russian forces made limited advances on February 26 in Donetsk and Luhansk, reportedly capturing Stanysia Luuhanska, Volnovakha, and Starohnativka.[26] Ukrainian forces remain largely in place on the line of contact in Donbas.

Russian forces attacking in northern Luhansk Oblast made little progress as of February 26. ISW’s initial assessment that Russian forces would likely attempt an envelopment through Luhansk Oblast was incorrect.[27] Russian forces likely seek to achieve a larger envelopment using forces breaking out from Crimea and currently advancing on Mariupol from the west.

Russian forces are continuing assaults on Mariupol from the northeast but have yet to enter outskirts of the city. Russian proxies claimed to capture Pishchevik and Pavlopol, 25km northeast of Mariupol, the morning of February 26. Russian forces carried out airstrikes on suburbs of Mariupol at 3pm local time on February 26.[28]

4) Crimea axis: Russian forces advancing north towards Zaprozhia and east towards Mariupol threaten to isolate Ukrainian forces on the line of contact in Donbas if they do not withdraw. Russian forces from the Southern Military District continue to make the greatest advances and demonstrate the highest capabilities of Russia’s multiple axes of advance. Ukrainian forces recaptured Kherson the night of February 25-26. However, Russian forces will likely counterattack within the next 24 hours and Russian forces remain west of the Dnipro River, threatening Mikolayiv.

Russian forces in Crimea are advancing directly north towards Zaprozhia, entering Velyka Bilozerka and Tokmak – approximately 80km south of Zaprozhia – as of 3pm local time on February 26.[29] These forces will likely enter Zaprozhia within the next 48 hours at current rates of advance. They may then either continue north to Dnipro City, or pivot east to isolate Ukrainian forces in Donbas.

Russian forces advancing east out of Crimea captured Berdyansk, 70km west of Mariupol, early on February 26.[30] Russian forces previously secured Melitopol late on February 25.[31] These Russian forces will likely encircle Mariupol within the next 48 hours. They may alternatively – or additionally – drive north, isolating Ukrainian forces on the line of contact in Donbas.

Western sources have inaccurately reported the unopposed deployment of Russian Naval Infantry in Russian-controlled Azovskoye, just north of Crimea, as an amphibious landing.[32] An anonymous US official told CNN on February 25 that “potentially thousands” of Russian troops conducted a landing west of Mariupol, which was inaccurately reported as an opposed landing.[33] These Naval Infantry forces will likely support Russian operations to isolate Mariupol. Russia has not yet conducted an opposed amphibious landing in southern Ukraine.

Ukrainian forces recaptured Kherson as of 9am local time on February 26.[34] Ukrainian forces additionally retained control of Nova Kakhovka as of 9am local time following heavy fighting overnight.[35] Russian forces will likely attempt a second assault on the city in the next 24 hours.

Russian forces entered the outskirts of Mikolaiyv early on February 26.[36] ISW cannot assess what strength of Russian forces have crossed the Dnipro River and their capability to threaten Odessa – or lack thereof – if cut off by the Ukrainian recapture of Kherson.

Ukrainian forces reported up to 3 BTGs of Russian second echelon troops from the 58th Combined Arms Army were committed to the advance on Tavriis'k, east of Kherson along the Dnipro River, early on February 26.[37]

Russian forces may additionally be preparing for an additional line of advance from Belarus into Western Ukraine. ISW previously reported a Russian armored column assembling in Stolin, Belarus on February 25 to support a possible advance into Rivne Oblast, in western Ukraine.[38] The Ukrainian Border Service reported cross-border shelling into Rivne Oblast from Belarus at 3pm local time on February 26.[39] Russian forces have not launched a ground attack as of publication. A Russian offensive in western Ukraine would likely seek to cut Ukraine off from ground shipments of Western aid through Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary.

Immediate items to watch

Russian forces advancing north and east from Crimea threaten to cut off Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine if Kyiv des not withdraw them in the coming days.

Russian forces face growing morale and supply issues but will likely be able to overcome these handicaps.

Russian Naval Infantry have not yet conducted opposed amphibious landings but retain the capability to do so against the Odesa or the Azov Sea coasts or both.

Russian forces continue to refrain from using their likely full spectrum of air and missile capabilities. The Ukrainian air force also remains active. Russian operations will likely steadily wear down Ukrainian air capabilities as well eventually taking the Ukrainian air force out of the fight.

Russia has sufficient conventional military power to reinforce each of its current axes of advance and overpower conventional Ukrainian forces defending them.
