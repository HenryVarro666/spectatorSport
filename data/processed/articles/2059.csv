1,2c4a569d-5018-4e43-b0d3-15ae9433b4f2,['Peter Beaumont'],2022-03-12,"Russia has said it will treat arms shipments to Ukraine from Nato countries as “legitimate targets” for military action in a dangerous new escalation of tensions.

The warning from the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, came as supporters of Ukraine, including the UK, Germany and the United States, have been urgently shipping thousands of anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Kyiv in response to Moscow’s aggression.

Ryabkov said that Russia had “warned the US that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn’t just a dangerous move, it’s an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets”.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, disclosed that at least 1,300 of his country’s troops have been killed in the conflict so far in the first estimate of Ukraine’s combat losses after almost three weeks of fighting. Ukraine has claimed to have killed some 12,000 Russian troops.

Heavy fighting continued across Ukraine. The French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz reported that Vladimir Putin showed no willingness to end the war after a phone call between the leaders in which they renewed a call for a ceasefire and negotiations. A statement from the office of the French president described the conversation with the Russian leader as “very frank and also difficult”.

Russian forces continued to pulverise the besieged port city of Mariupol, shelling a mosque sheltering more than 80 people, including children, the Ukrainian government said on Saturday, while fighting also raged on the outskirts of Kyiv.

In several areas around the capital artillery barrages sent residents scurrying for shelter and air raid sirens wailed. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said that Russian ground forces massed north of Kyiv had now edged to within 15 miles of the city centre as their attempt to encircle it ground on.

Columns of smoke were seen rising over the southwest of the city after a strike on an ammunition depot in the town of Vasylkiv.

In the south, Ukraine’s military said that Russian forces captured Mariupol’s eastern outskirts, tightening the armed squeeze on the strategic port. Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.

Zelenskiy encouraged his people to keep up their resistance, which many analysts said has prevented the rapid offensive and military victory the Kremlin had expected. “The fact that the whole Ukrainian people resist these invaders has already gone down in history, but we do not have the right to let up our defence, no matter how difficult it may be for us,” he said.

He accused Russia of employing “a new stage of terror” with the apparent kidnapping of the mayor of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, who was last seen being led away from his office on Friday by armed men, prompting a demonstration in the city.

Zelenskiy added that Russia would need to carpet-bomb the Ukrainian capital and kill its residents to take the city. “They will come here only if they kill us all,” he said. “If that is their goal, let them come.”

In a bleak coda that spoke of the continuing levels of destruction, Zelenskiy added that some small Ukrainian towns had ceased to exist.

Despite crippling economic sanctions imposed on Moscow and international isolation, Putin – who has imposed his own draconian crackdown on media freedom and free speech in Russia – has given no indication of being swayed to end the war.

In his 90-minute call with Macron and Scholz on Saturday, Putin spoke about “issues related to agreements under discussion to implement the Russian demands” for ending the war, the Kremlin said without providing details. Among other things, the Kremlin has previously demanded a promise by Nato never to accept Ukraine as a member and for the alliance to pull back from countries such as Poland, Romania and Bulgaria.

Ukrainian officials continued efforts to evacuate besieged cities, including the capital, as well as towns and villages in the regions of Kyiv, Sumy and some other areas.

The governor of the Kyiv region Oleksiy Kuleba said fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were continuing yesterday morning but later said some evacuations were proceeding. “We will try to get people out every day, as long as it’s possible to observe a ceasefire,” he said.

The governor of the Russian-controlled territory of Donetsk said constant shelling was complicating bringing aid into Mariupol.

“There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city,” the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. “Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply.”

People were boiling ground water for drinking, using wood to cook food and burying dead bodies near where they lay, a staff member for the international group Médecins Sans Frontières in the city said.

“We saw people who died because of lack of medication,” he said, adding that many people had also been wounded or killed. “Neighbours just dig a hole in the ground and put the dead bodies inside.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/arms-shipments-are-a-legitimate-military-target-kremlin-warns-west

The “message” was actually a direct warning to the United States.

According to Ryabkov, Russia will treat Western weapons that reach the Ukrainians as legitimate military targets.

“We warn [os EUA] of the consequences of the insane transfer to Ukraine of weapons such as mobile anti-aircraft systems, anti-tank missiles and so on,” Ryabkov said, in a statement quoted on Twitter by Max Seddon, head of the Financial Times’ Moscow bureau.

Since the beginning of the conflict on February 24, at least 29 countries have announced this type of support for the Ukrainian government. In addition to the 27 member countries of the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom also sent supplies.

They are rifles, missiles, anti-tank rockets, mortars, machine guns, pistols, rifles, anti-aircraft weapons, among other items.

See some donations:

Germany – 1 anti-tank guns

Sweden – 5 thousand rockets

Belgium – 3 thousand rifles

Czech Republic – 7,000 rifles, 3,000 machine guns and 30,000 pistols

Netherlands – 200 anti-aircraft rockets

Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov himself spoke about the matter. According to the Interfax news agency, he allegedly said that the shipment of weapons to Ukraine will cause “catastrophic escalation”.",https://playcrazygame.com/2022/03/12/russia-warns-of-result-of-insane-arms-shipment-to-ukraine/
5,2c4a569d-5018-4e43-b0d3-15ae9433b4f2,[],2022-03-12,"Washington is sending highly sensitive items such as portable air defence systems to Kyiv, senior US defence official says.

The United States and NATO are shipping weapons into Ukraine at breakneck speed, including highly sensitive items such as shoulder-fired missiles called man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS) that can take down aircraft.

The Western arms deliveries, another of which is expected to arrive in the coming hours, have been vital to enabling Ukrainians to fight the invading Russian forces far more effectively and fiercely than US intelligence expected.

But moving those amounts of weaponry into the largest conflict in Europe since World War II carries with it risks that some could fall into the wrong hands – a possibility the West has considered.

“Frankly, we believe that risk is worth taking right now because the Ukrainians are fighting so skillfully with the tools at their disposal and they’re using them so creatively,” a senior US defence official said on Friday when asked about that danger.

Highly portable missiles such as Stinger surface-to-air missiles, which are a type of MANPAD, can help win wars, but in the past, they have also been lost, sold, or wound up in the arsenals of armed groups.

For example, hundreds of Stingers supplied by the US were seen as key to helping mujahideen rebels drive Soviet forces out of Afghanistan in a conflict that spanned the 1980s and 1990s.

But the US subsequently spent years trying to recover unused MANPADS from that country and other conflict zones around the world.

In a Pentagon-financed study in 2019, the RAND Corporation think-tank estimated that upwards of 60 civilian aircraft have been hit by MANPADS since the 1970s, killing more than 1,000 civilians. As of 2019, 57 non-state armed groups were confirmed to possess or suspected to possess MANPADS.

Russia was “far and away the single largest exporter of MANPADS”, RAND Corp said, with more than 10,000 systems sold between 2010 and 2018 to countries including Iraq, Venezuela, Kazakhstan, Qatar and Libya.

The US and NATO have not disclosed how many MANPADS have been transferred to Ukraine since the start of the invasion, which is now in its third week.

So far, Russia has not targeted Western weapons convoys headed into Ukraine and the senior US defence official said Washington had not seen any Western-supplied inventory falling into Russian hands. But that could change.

‘A dangerous move’

Russia said on Saturday its troops could target supplies of Western weapons in Ukraine.

“We warned the United States that the orchestrated pumping of weapons from a number of countries is not just a dangerous move, it is a move that turns these convoys into legitimate targets,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told state television.

He said Moscow had warned “about the consequences of the thoughtless transfer to Ukraine of weapons like man-portable air defence systems, anti-tank missile systems and so on”.

Ryabkov said Washington had not taken Moscow’s warnings seriously, adding Russia and the US were not holding any “negotiation processes” on Ukraine.

At a Friday meeting of Russia’s Security Council, Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu talked about potential future seizures of Western-made Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stingers. They should be handed to Russian-backed forces in the breakaway Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly backed the idea.

“As to the delivery of arms, especially Western-made ones which have fallen into the hands of the Russian army – of course, I support the possibility of giving these to the military units of the Lugansk and Donetsk people’s republics,” Putin said.

“Please do this,” Putin told Shoigu.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/12/us-nato-allies-rush-weapons-shipment-to-ukraine

13 March

In the early hours of the morning Russian missiles struck a Ukrainian base in West Ukraine, just 10 miles from the Polish border. The attack on what is believed to be a training base reportedly killed 35. The attack follows Kremlin warnings thst Western aid will be considered a valid military target.

President Zelensky has said that nearly 125,000 people have been evacuated using humanitarian corridors. With the focus now on Mariupol. He said “our diplomatic effort is focused on aid to reach the city.”

Ukrainian forces are reported to be making localised counterattacks in northeastern Ukraine to relieve pressure on Kharkiv and threaten Russia’s extended supply lines. The besieged southern port of Mariupol continues to hold out and yesterday the Ukrainian military claimed it has rendered 31 Russian battalion tactical groups combat ineffective.

12 March

Russia continues to bombard the besieged Ukrainian cities of Mariupol, Kharkiv, Summy and Chernihiv but reports suggest they efforts to advance have largely been stalled. The Russian Ministry of Defense, however, claims small but significant advances. The situation on the southern front appears to have stabilised with Russian advances, from Crimea, toward Mykolayiv and Zaporizhya halted.

Yesterday the Kremlin announced plans on to deploy foreign fighters, including up to 16,000 Syrian fighters, to Ukraine. There have also been suggestions of ‘volunteers’ from the Central African Republic. This comes in response to the flow of foreign volunteers to Ukraine’s foreign legion.

Russia appears to be attempting to draw Belarus into an active role in the war. This would ease Russia’s problems with reserves and likely open up a fresh front in the north. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense claimed yesterday that Russian aircraft conducted an attempted false-flag attack on Belarusian territory. Belarus has not yet actively mobilised.
