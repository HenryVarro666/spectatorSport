“I told him to leave,” the man in his 30s said, sobbing next to the twisted ruins of a car.

Nearby, a woman screamed curses into the wintry sky.

A missile crater, 4-5 metres (13-16 feet) wide, was scoured into the earth between two devastated five-floor residential buildings.

Firefighters battled to extinguish the blaze in the remnants.

Russian forces are continuing to advance towards the capital city of Kyiv as Mr Putin’s military continues its invasion on multiple fronts. According to a US defence official, Russia launched 160 missiles against Ukraine as of Thursday night.

Airports and military bases have been targeted in Russian rocket and drone strikes, while tanks are being used to fight the country’s border forces.

Late on Thursday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ordered a “general mobilisation” of the country’s men into the military.

He said 137 people had been killed in the first day of fighting, with hundreds more wounded.

Some 15 miles from Kyiv, fierce fighting raged for control of an airport as Ukrainian forces tried to stop Russia’s advance on the capital. People living in the town of Hostomel spoke of an intense air assault operation nearby Antonov Airport.

A former Ukrainian Government official announced later on Thursday afternoon that twenty Russian KA-52 and Mi-8 helicopters had landed at the Hostomel airfield, and said that fighting was ongoing.

Further reports suggested Ivano-Frankivsk International Airport, a civilian airport in western Ukraine, had also been hit, while pictures have emerged of emergency workers at the site of a Ukrainian military plane crash south of Kyiv.

According to the AFP news agency, 14 people were aboard the plane and the emergency service said it was “still determining how many people died.” The incident occurred about 12 miles south of capital city. Russia said it has suppressed Ukraine’s air defence capabilities with its attacks.

Videos shared by reporters on the ground also showed smoke rising above a military airfield near Chuguev in Kharkiv, in the east of Ukraine, where bloodied civilians were earlier pictured following shelling on an apartment block.

According to Ukraine’s National Police, Russian forces have also managed to capture the island of Zmiinyi in the Black Sea, which plays a key role in delimiting Ukraine’s territorial waters.

But a briefing from the Government’s Ministry of Defence department said: “The Ukrainian Armed Forces have put up a staunch resistance and continue to hold key cities.”

The statement added: “Heavy casualties have been suffered on both sides, although exact numbers are currently unclear.”

Chernobyl nuclear power plant has been captured by Russian forces, according to an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office cited by Reuters.

There are growing concerns that the plant could be hit during fighting, releasing radioactive pollution across Europe.

President Zelensky had previously said that Russian forces were “trying to seize the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant” and indicated that Ukrainians had died today trying to defend it, saying: “Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated.”

“This is a declaration of war against the whole of Europe,” he said.

Mariana Bezuhla, a Ukrainian politician, also reported on Facebook that Russians were threatening to shell the nuclear plant Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.

US President Joe Biden announced sweeping export restrictions against Russia on Thursday in a fresh round of sanctions, hammering its access to global exports of everything from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts.

In a speech at the White House announcing the new controls, President Biden said they would “impose severe costs on the Russian economy both immediately and over time,” noting that allies including 27 members of the European union such as France, Germany and Italy as well as the UK Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand had joined in the response to maximise its impact. He also said targeting Mr Putin directly “was on the table”.

“This is a premeditated attack,” Mr Biden said, adding Mr Putin had refused efforts by the West to engage in dialogue and had violated international law.

“Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.” Mr Biden also said Nato is as united as ever while reiterating it had no intention of intervening in Ukraine.

He added he believes the invasion is “unlikely” to last a long time “as long as we are resolved on sanctions” against Russia, which Mr Biden said is trying to rebuild the Soviet Union.

The EU also announced a fresh set of sanctions, with the 27-member bloc agreeing to freeze Russian assets in the bloc and halt banks’ access to European financial markets as part of what its foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, described as “the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented”.

It will also target Russia’s trade, energy and transport, among other sectors, and impose export controls. The EU will also prepare a new aid package for Ukraine and new sanctions against Belarus.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US has claimed that one Russian platoon from Kemerovo, 74th Motorized Brigade, has surrendered to Ukrainian forces, saying they had not realised they were being sent to fight Ukrainians.

Ukraine’s military also said it had shot down five Russian jets and a helicopter, thought to have troops onboard, but Russia denied this.

Airport battle

Fierce fighting raged for control of an airport just 15 miles from Kyiv as Ukraine tried to stop Russia’s advance on the capital. People living in the town of Hostomel spoke of an intense air assault operation nearby Antonov Airport.

One resident said Ukrainian ground forces had been targeted by fighter jets, as video footage showed Russian Mi-8 helicopters flying towards the airport. A CNN camera crew captured the moment Russian airborne troops surrounded the airport, which is a key cargo and military base.

By Thursday afternoon, it was reported that Russian forces had gained control. But in a televised address, President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed Ukrainian forces would retake the airport and had been given an order to “destroy” Russian troops. Civilian Alexander Kovtonenko, 30, also living nearby, said two fighter jets had shot missiles at Ukrainian ground units as the assault got underway.

“Then there was shooting, it lasted three hours,” he told AFP. “Then three more jets flew in and they started shooting again.” The battle was still raging at 10.30pm local time.

Ukraine President issues calls to arms

Earlier on Thursday, Mr Zelensky issued a call to arms to the Ukrainian people and that weapons would be given to anyone willing to fight.

During a broadcast to the nation he also appealed for blood donations for wounded soldiers.

“We are defending our country, we fight for our country and we protect our country,” Mr Zelensky said.

“We will give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities,” he later tweeted.

Oleksiy Reznikov, Ukraine’s Defence Minister, has urged those willing to fight to join the ranks of the territorial defence forces.

On Wednesday, Ukraine said it was conscripting citizens aged 18-60 to its army reservists and gave permission for all civilians to carry firearms.

Mr Zelensky’s call to arms came as Ukrainians began fleeing the country with roads gridlocked, underground train stations packed and queues at bus stops, petrol stations and cash machines.

i correspondent David Parsley also reported seeing fires burning around Government buildings in what observers suspect is the destroying of documents.

Neighbouring Moldova and Lithuania have both declared states of emergency, with Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda warning that Russia’s “unprovoked military aggression” threatens “millions of innocent lives and undermines the foundations of international order.”

Meanwhile, the Czech Republic has closed two Russian consulates as well as the Czech consulate in Russia, Reuters reported.

Nato agrees action as civilian casualties confirmed

Nato envoys have agreed to strengthen air, land and sea forces on the alliance’s eastern flank near Ukraine and Russia.

The alliance said it had “increased the readiness of our forces to respond to all contingencies” and warned its members stood “united to defend each other.”

While some of Nato’s 30 member countries are supplying arms, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine, the alliance itself has so far said it will not launch any military action to support Ukraine.

Poland’s health ministry said the country was preparing a medical train to transport Ukrainians wounded in Russia’s assault on its neighbour, adding that Polish hospitals were ready to receive thousands of patients.

The young boy reported to have been killed is said to have died during shelling on an apartment block in Chuguev, Kharkiv.

Another civilian was pictured with a bloodied face and bandage wrapped around her head after the apartment complex was hit.

Three border guards are also among the casualties recorded in Ukraine, the country’s border force said.

Amnesty International said on Thursday afternoon that it had also verified a ballistic missile strike outside a hospital in Vuhledar, killing at least two civilians.

“Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law, ballistic missiles should never be used in populated areas,” the organisation said.

The Red Cross announced it was responding to severe water shortages after fighting left several water stations and pipelines, serving more than one million people, out of order.

Maksym Dotsenko, director general of the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, said the charity was “deeply concerned for the safety of communities” and had launched an emergency crisis appeal.

Explosions heard across Ukrainian cities

Mr Putin launched his attacks in a nationwide offensive in the early hours of Thursday using land, sea and air forces.

Explosions were heard in cities across the country, including in the capital Kyiv, in Kharkiv in the north-east, Odessa in the south, and eastern Donetsk Oblast.

At least 18 people were killed in a missile attack on the port city of Odessa, according to regional authorities, while the mayor of Brovary said that six people had been killed in the city.

Sightings of Russian troop landings were also reported in Mariupol and Odessa on the southern coast.

Air raid sirens echoed across Kyiv and the western city of Lviv on Thursday morning, as the threat of all-out war hung over Europe for the first time in decades.

i‘s David Parsley reported that schools, and many of the shops and restaurants, were shut, with martial law declared as sirens sounded at 7am.

Nikoli, a translator, said he had got his family packed up and 400 miles away, far into the countryside, two nights ago. “I could see what was going to happen,” he said. “If I hadn’t got my family away then I wouldn’t be here now.”

Shelling also began in the Ukrainian villages of Kopani and Kherson, where Ukrainian soldiers were engaged in battle.

Local news outlets reported a further attack in the Obolon area of Kyiv at around 10am GMT and Ukrainian armed forces could be seen rolling into the area.

Putin claims he will ‘demilitarise and de-Nazify’ Ukraine

In a speech to the Russian nation on Thursday morning, President Putin announced his intention to “demilitarise and de-Nazify” his former Soviet neighbour. Mr Zelensky, Ukraine’s President, is Jewish.

“I have made the decision of a military operation,” Mr Putin said in an unannounced television address shortly before 6am in Moscow.

He cited, with no evidence, a “genocide” orchestrated by Ukraine in the country’s eastern provinces as reason for the attack, as well as Nato’s aggressive policy towards Russia – claims that Western leaders have dismissed.

“For this, we will strive to achieve demilitarisation and de-Nazification of Ukraine,” said Mr Putin.

He urged Ukrainian servicemen to “immediately put down arms and go home” saying he aimed to “demilitarise not occupy” the country.

In a stark warning to the wider world, Mr Putin said there would be “consequences” never seen before for any countries that wished to intervene.

“To anyone who would consider interfering from outside: If you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history. All the relevant decisions have been taken. I hope you hear me,” he said.

Kyiv motorways gridlocked as residents flee

In the capital of Kyiv, the city’s motorways were gridlocked with people trying to flee.

Despite calls from the Ukrainian President to stay at home, people in Kyiv were scrambling to fill up their vehicles at petrol stations and stock up on supplies at supermarkets.

Residents were also seen withdrawing cash from ATMs and are understood to be purchasing firearms and ammunition.

But some sought shelter in basements and underground transport hubs as explosions rang out, with photographs showing people sitting together on the floor of metro stations.

Reporters have also filmed long queues of people waiting to give blood to treat Ukrainian soldiers in hospital, after Mr Zelensky called on the population to donate.

Flights in and out of Ukraine suspended

UK airlines have been instructed to avoid Ukrainian airspace until further notice, the Civil Aviation Authority said.

Airlines have suspended travel in and out of Ukraine this morning, with Ryanair halting all Ukrainian flights for the next fortnight.

“Due to the closure of Ukrainian airspace overnight and the apparent invasion by Russian forces, all Ryanair flights to/from Ukraine have been suspended for at least the next 14 days,” the airline said in a statement.

“All affected passengers will receive email notices later this morning and all flights to/from Ukraine have been removed from sale for at least the next four weeks until further information becomes available from EU safety agencies. ”

Wizz Air also announced it had “temporarily suspended” flight operations in Ukraine, adding: “The safety and security of our passengers and crew remains our number one priority and we hope normality will to return to Ukraine soon.”

Ukraine International Airlines, which links Gatwick Airport with Kyiv, also stopped flights to and from Ukraine, saying: “The UIA team takes all possible measures to ensure the safety of our passengers.”

Moldova announced it would close its airspace on Thursday and divert flights to other airports due to the security situation in the region.

World condemns attack and threatens further action

Ukraine has called on the rest of the world to support the country in the face of the Russian invasion, with the country’s official account tweeting: “Russia has started the new wave of aggression against Ukraine. Wherever you are and whatever you do, you can help Ukraine now.”

Boris Johnson said he was “appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine”, warning that “the UK and our allies will respond decisively”.

Mr Johnson confirmed he had spoken to President Zelensky to “discuss next steps”, while Foreign Secretary Liz Truss reportedly had a “heated” meeting with the Russia ambassador earlier today.

The Prime Minister made an address to the nation on the developments in Ukraine this morning and announced a raft of sanctions in the Commons that he said would “hobble” Russia’s economy.

Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said the body would present a package of “massive and targeted sanctions” to European leaders for approval, with the focus on hitting “strategic sectors of the Russian economy” by blocking access to key technologies and markets.

The sanctions are due to be discussed at an emergency EU summit at 7pm GMT.

Ireland promised “very direct and very hard-hitting” sanctions against Russia, but confirmed that “we are not going to go to war with Russia, militarily.”

Germany’s foreign minister said that “we woke up in a different world today”, while French President Emmanuel Macron, who had been trying to negotiate a diplomatic solution, said that “France firmly condemns Russia’s decision to wage war” and promised support for Ukraine.

But China’s customs agency approved imports of wheat from all regions of Russia on Thursday – a move that could help to reduce the impact of possible Western sanctions.

Russian TV defending invasion

Russian TV channels – which are predominantly state owned – have been quoting a Russian Defence Ministry stressing that only “high-precision weapons” were being used in Ukraine and insisting there were no threats to civilians – despite reports and images of civilian casualties.

Official state Rossiya 1 TV began a news bulletin by saying: “Today Russia has begun a special military operation aimed at protecting the people who for the last eight years have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the regime in Kyiv.”

But opposition leader Alexei Navalny used a court hearing to condemn the invasion, accusing the Russian state of using the war with Ukraine as a distraction from internal problems.

‘The war with Ukraine has been unleashed to cover up the robbery of Russian citizens and divert their attention away from the country’s internal problems, from the degradation of its economy,” he said, according to Daily Mail US journalist Rob Crilly.

Invasion ‘could bring UK war with Russia’

A retired army officer has warned that the invasion could bring the UK to war with Russia.

General Sir Richard Shirreff warned that if Russia puts “one bootstep” into Nato territory, the entire alliance will be at war.

Asked if the UK might be expected to get involved directly in the conflict, he said: “Absolutely there is a possibility that we as a nation could be at war with Russia, because if Russia puts one bootstep across Nato territory, we are all at war with Russia. Every single one, every single member of the Nato alliance.

“Article 5 (of the Nato alliance) says an attack on one is an attack on all, so we need to change our mindset fundamentally, and that is why I say our defence starts in the UK on the frontiers of Nato.”",https://inews.co.uk/news/russia-invades-ukraine-putin-launch-full-scale-invasion-latest-news-1479760

Russia’s defense ministry said it had neutralized Ukrainian military airbases and its air defense systems, hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a military offensive against his country’s neighbor.

“Military infrastructure at Ukrainian army air bases has been rendered out of action,” the defense ministry said in a statement carried by news agencies, which added that Kyiv’s air defense systems were “eliminated.”

The ministry denied reports that its aircraft had been downed over Ukraine. Earlier, Ukraine’s military had said five Russian planes and one helicopter were shot down over its Luhansk region.

Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine said they had captured the towns of Shchastia and Stanytsia Luhanska in Ukraine’s region of Luhansk, the RIA news agency reported. There was no immediate comment by authorities in Ukraine.

Ukraine is coming under artillery attack along its northern border with Russia and Belarus, the country’s border guard service said on Thursday, adding that Ukrainian forces were returning fire.

The statement was issued as a Ukrainian interior ministry official reported the Ukrainian government-held town of Shchastya had fallen to Russian-backed eastern insurgents.

Ukraine’s border guards service said an attack is also taking place from Crimea, Reuters reported.

In a video message posted on Facebook after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the launch of a military operation against Ukraine, Zelensky also introduced martial law across the country, adding that he had spoken by phone with US President Joe Biden.

Explosions rang out before dawn Thursday in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and several cities near the frontline and along the country’s coasts.

AFP correspondents also heard blasts in the Black Sea port city of Odessa, close to the frontline of a Russian-backed rebel enclave and just across the sea from Russian-occupied Crimea.

Explosions also rang out in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which lies 35 kilometres (20 miles) south of the Russian border and outside the eastern zone where Kyiv has been battling Moscow-backed insurgents since 2014.

Ukraine closed its airspace to civilian planes, and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that his country was facing a “full-scale invasion”.

Closer to the eastern war zone, four loud blasts rang out in Kramatorsk, which serves as the Ukrainian government’s effective capital for the eastern war zone.

More blasts also rang out in Mariupol, a port on the Sea of Azov which provide a land bridge between Russia and the Kremlin-annexed Crimea peninsula.

“Russia’s offensive military operation is to destroy the Ukrainian state,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.

“Our defenders are ready to repel the aggressor state and will do everything in their power to defend Ukrainian land,” it added, calling on Ukraine’s Western allies to “immediately” impose new sanctions on Russia.

Russia's ""military operation"" has triggered chaos and fear in several parts of Ukraine, as sounds of warplanes and explosions grow louder.

As Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the launching of a ""military operation"" in Donbass in eastern Ukraine on Thursday morning, several reports of military convoys, missile strikes, explosions and people packing up their belongings in a bid to leave the sensitive areas started making rounds on the Internet.

While many journalists and regional experts urged media organisations to verify the visuals coming out of the region to avoid war mongering and escalating panic, here are some credible images portraying the current situation in the region.

Explosions hit the cities of Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, Mariupol, Mykolaiv and Odessa at 04:50 local time. Ukrainians woke up to the sounds of bombings.

Black smoke that can be seen below rose from a military airport in Chuguev near Kharkiv, plunging Ukraine's morning into alarming darkness.

The Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordered defending Ukraine, calling all citizens who were ready to defend the country from Russian forces to come forward, saying Kiev would issue weapons to everyone who wants them.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian soldiers were seen getting into a military vehicle in Mariupol with worried faces as Zelenskyy declared martial law.

Ukrainians who had long braced for the possibility of a Russian operation were urged to stay home and not to panic, while citizens began to line up in front of ATMs and banks to withdraw money as the conflict expected to harshly damage the country’s vulnerable economy.

While multiple explosions took place in the following hours, civilians started to leave their houses, even cities within the sound of sirens and military jets.

Many were panicked at the escalation of hostilities, lamenting on not knowing where to go or what to do while blasts hit their houses.

While some civilians are trying to leave the city, others are trying to escape possible bombs by taking shelter in subway stations and basements of their houses.

""I woke up because of the sounds of bombing. I packed a bag and tried to escape,"" told Maria Kashkoska, one of the residents who sheltered inside the Kiev metro station told the AFP news agency.

Russia's defence ministry declared that it has neutralised Ukrainian military airbases and its air defence systems.

Ukraine, on the other hand, stated that it has killed ""around 50 Russian occupiers"" while repulsing an attack on a town on the frontline with Moscow-backed rebels.

In the midst of these conflicts, an apartment in the city of Kharkiv was damaged and injured many, causing bloodshed and tears.

It began before dawn. An assault on Ukraine. An assault on Europe.

After weeks of promising he meant this country no harm, Vladimir Putin finally gave the order to attack.

Within minutes targets had been hit all over. From airports in the west and south, to apartment blocks in the east. Rockets fired from inside Russia rained down on the outskirts of Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv.

Soon armoured columns crossed into the country from Crimea in the south and Belarus in the north. Moving swiftly, perhaps with the intention of cutting the country in two.

At an airport no more than 20 miles (32 km) from the centre of Kyiv, paratroopers arrived while it was still dark, quickly establishing a base that could be used to launch attacks on the capital.

Here in Kyiv, which has been so calm through recent weeks of this mounting crisis, there was shock, fear, and panic.

KYIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders on three sides on Thursday after Moscow unleashed the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, prompting tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.

After Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war in a pre-dawn televised address, explosions and gunfire were heard through the day in Ukraine's capital and elsewhere in the country, with at least 70 people reported killed.

The assault brought a calamitous end to weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by Western leaders to avert war over Russian demands for a redrawing of post-Cold War security arrangements in Europe.

After nightfall, a picture was emerging of fierce fighting across multiple fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy late on Thursday ordered a general mobilization, to be carried out within 90 days, ""to ensure the defence of the state"".

An adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office said Russian forces had captured the Chernobyl former nuclear power plant, just 90 km (60 miles) north of Kyiv. The plant is along the shortest route from the Ukrainian capital to Belarus, where Moscow has staged troops.

There was also fighting at Hostomel airport, just outside Kyiv, where Russian paratroopers landed. A Ukrainian official later said the airfield had been recaptured, while a senior U.S. defence official said Russian forces were advancing closer to Kyiv.

Heavy exchanges of fire were also reported in the regions of Sumy and Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south.

The highway heading west out of Kyiv, home to 3 million people, was choked with traffic across five lanes as residents sought to escape, fearful of bombardments while stuck in their cars.

The U.N. refugee agency said an estimated 100,000 Ukrainians had fled their homes. Thousands were crossing into neighbouring countries, including Romania, Moldova, Poland and Hungary. read more

Some 57 people were killed and 169 were wounded on Thursday, Ukraine's health minister said, while the interior ministry said 13 border guards died when a Russian vessel shelled Ukraine's Zmiinyi Island, south of the Black Sea port of Odessa.

'NEW IRON CURTAIN'

The day began with missiles raining down on targets across Ukraine and reports of troops and armour pouring across the borders from Russia and Belarus to the north and east.

Zelenskiy called on Ukrainians to defend their country and said arms would be given to anyone prepared to fight.

""What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft. This is the sound of a new Iron Curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world,"" Zelenskiy said.

Putin, after referring earlier in his speech to Russia's powerful nuclear arsenal, warned: ""Whoever tries to hinder us... should know that Russia's response will be immediate. And it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history.""

Asked whether that threat was tantamount to threatening Russian use of nuclear weapons, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was indeed understood as such, adding that Putin should also understand that NATO was a nuclear alliance.

Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to defend Ukraine, but Washington has reinforced its NATO allies in the region with extra troops and planes.

After consulting with the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, Biden announced measures to impede Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned enterprises.

Britain also targeted banks, as well as members of Putin's inner circle. European Union leaders said measures would include freezing Russian assets in the 27-nation bloc. read more

China remained out of step, however, rejecting the description of Russia's actions as an ""invasion"". read more

Russia is one of the world's biggest energy producers, and both it and Ukraine are among the top exporters of grain. War and sanctions will disrupt economies around the world already facing a crisis as they emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.

European stocks dived to nine-month lows, but U.S. stocks ended higher after Biden's sanctions announcement. Brent oil earlier surged past $100/barrel for the first time since 2014.

'HANG THEM FROM BRIDGES'

Putin said he did not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and purge it of nationalists, and his endgame remains unclear.

The senior U.S. defence official said Washington believed the invasion was intended to ""decapitate"" Zelenskiy's government. read more

But it is hard to see Ukrainians accepting leadership installed by Moscow.

""I think we must fight all those who invade our country so strongly,"" said one man stuck in traffic trying to leave Kyiv. ""I would hang every single one of them from bridges.""

A democratic nation of 44 million people, Ukraine is Europe's biggest country by area after Russia itself. It voted for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and has recently stepped up efforts to join NATO and the European Union, aspirations that infuriate Moscow. read more

Putin, who denied for months that he was planning an invasion, has called Ukraine an artificial construct carved from Russia by its enemies - a characterisation Ukrainians see as an attempt to erase their more than 1,000-year-old history.

While many Ukrainians, particularly in the east, speak Russian as a native language, virtually all identify themselves as Ukrainian.

There was also some dissent in Russia. Police detained more than 1,600 taking part in anti-war rallies in 53 cities and authorities threatened to block media reports carrying ""false information"". read more

In the southeastern port of Mariupol, near a frontline held by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, local authorities said 26 people were wounded in shelling.

Civilians packed bags. ""We are going into hiding,"" a woman said.

Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, said its forces had downed two Russian helicopters and seven other Russian aircraft and destroyed several Russian trucks, and a platoon from Russia's 74th Motor Rifles Brigade had surrendered. read more

Russia's defence ministry said it had destroyed 83 land-based Ukrainian targets and had achieved all its goals, according to Interfax news agency.

Protests against Russia's invasion were held in Europe and the United States. At a demonstration in New York's Time Square, Ivana Lotoshynski, who was born in Ukraine, urged solidarity with Ukrainians.

""People are losing their lives right now. Ukrainians are fighting against this regime from Russia and it's really devastating,"" she said. ""Today I think everybody is Ukrainian.""

A woman whose blood-covered face has become an iconic image of the invasion of Ukraine has vowed to 'do everything for my motherland' after she survived a Russian missile attack this morning.

Olena Kurilo, speaking with a heavily bandaged face outside her destroyed home in Chuguev in the region of Kharkiv, said she was 'very lucky' and admitted 'I must have a guardian angel' to have survived the attack.

The teacher, 53, said she 'never thought that this would truly happen in my lifetime' as, her voice catching in her throat, she described the damage to her 'completely destroyed' house.

Earlier Thursday Vladimir Putin had promised Ukrainians there was 'no threat to the population' because Russian forces are using 'precision weapons' but by midday Kiev claimed at least 40 civilians, among them a young boy in an apartment block in Kharkiv, had been killed.

Other civilians were also injured and some others are believed to have died in the attacks, Ukrainian security forces said around midday on Thursday as heartbreaking images of of bloodied civilians staggering through the streets emerged.

Russia on Thursday morning launched simultaneous attacks from the south, east and north, by land and by air, minutes after Putin gave an extraordinary address to the nation in which he declared a 'special military operation' to 'de-militarise' and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine in what amounted to a outright declaration of war.

Kurilo said she 'never thought' Russia would launch an invasion of Ukraine but promised to 'stand up and go' to the defence of Ukraine. 'I will do everything for Ukraine, as much as I can, with as much energy as I have. I will always only be on my motherland's side,' she said.

'I myself am a director, an educator, we studied the history, but we never thought that this would happen on our land,' she said, in apparent reference to Putin's bizarre and factually inaccurate claim that Ukraine was historically part of Russia.

She added that her home in Chuguev was 'completely destroyed' in the missile strike. 'There are no windows, no doors, one door ever flew out, even the floor has been completely ripped off,' she said.

Pictures today showed the true face of the war with blood-covered civilians being helped to safety by emergency services following shelling and others with injuries to their heads, faces and arms being patched up by medics.

In the eastern Ukrainian town of Chuguiv, a son wept over the body of his father among the wreckage of a missile strike in a residential district. 'I told him to leave,' the man sobbed repeatedly, next to the twisted ruins of a car.

Extraordinary footage of the invasion was documented online with video of what appeared to be a cruise missile slamming into Ivano-Frankivsk airport, in the west of Ukraine. Meanwhile Kiev's main international airport was hit in the first bombing of the city since World War II and air raid sirens sounded over the capital at the break of dawn.

'I woke up because of the sounds of bombing. I packed a bag and tried to escape,' said resident Maria Kashkoska, as she sheltered inside the Kyiv metro station.

Reports of explosions and air raid sirens came from as far west as Lviv and hundreds of casualties were reported by Ukraine's Interior Ministry as the country was placed under martial law.

Russia today launched simultaneous attacks from the south, east and north, by land and by air, killing at l east 40 civilians by midday including a young boy in an apartment block in Chuhuiv in Kharkiv, Ukrainian authorities said

An appalling video showed the moment a shell landed near a cyclist in Uman, Cherkassy region, central Ukraine.

Reports stated that at least one civilian was killed and five others wounded in the missile attack, which sparked an evacuation of the population within a 19 mile radius of the nearby military unit.

Another video shows Russian military vehicles marked 'Z' in Kherson. In recent days military vehicles with these markings have been seen in western Russia.

In his speech last night Putin said: 'In this regard, in accordance with Article 51 of Part 7 of the UN Charter, with the sanction of the Federation Council of Russia and in pursuance of the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance ratified by the Federal Assembly on February 22 this year with the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, I decided to conduct a special military operation .

'Its goal is to protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years. And for this we will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, as well as bringing to justice those who committed numerous, bloody crimes against civilians, including citizens of the Russian Federation.'

At an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council called by Ukraine because of the imminent threat of a Russian invasion, members still unaware of Putin's announcement appealed to him to stop an attack. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the meeting, just before the announcement, telling Putin: 'Stop your troops from attacking Ukraine. Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.'

NATO Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg issued a statement condemning 'Russia's reckless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, which puts at risk countless civilian lives. Once again, despite our repeated warnings and tireless efforts to engage in diplomacy, Russia has chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.'

Putin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine - a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion.

He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to 'demilitarize' it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.

Putin is also warning other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action will lead to 'consequences they have never seen.'

The attack has come to Ukraine on all fronts, with bombs and missiles striking targets across the country, ground forces rolling in from Belarus, Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk, and paratroopers dropping on Kharkiv

A video showed more evidence of intense fighting in the suburbs of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city.

Oleksiy Arestovych, of the Tripartite Contact Group for the Peaceful Settlement of the Situation in Eastern Ukraine, told President Zelensky: 'Russian troops have crossed the Crimean Isthmus and are developing an offensive in two directions - to Militopol and Kherson.

'The military take up defensive positions in these areas and are preparing to stop the offensive.

'The most successful situation is in the Joint Forces Operations zone. All attacks there were repulsed, the line of defence was not broken through.

'Shchastie was repulsed, a lot of enemy equipment was hit. Near Kharkiv, fighting is going on 4-5 km north of the city.

'They destroyed 4 enemy tanks. Shot down 6 Russian planes. In the Chernihiv region, they advanced 5-10 km, but Kiev is reliably protected, fierce battles will await them.

'From the Ukrainian side - there are more than 40 dead. Mariupil is under the control of the Ukrainian army.'

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said as of 10.30am local time: 'In the Chernihiv region, we managed to stop the enemy.

'Difficult battles are being fought in the Kharkiv direction and in the area of the Joint Forces Operation, where the enemy has suffered losses in manpower and equipment.

'With the help of our troops, the cities of MARIUPOL and SCHASTIA have been returned to full control.

'At least 6 aircrafts, 2 helicopters and dozens of enemy armored vehicles were destroyed.

'The difficult situation in the Kherson direction, however, the defence forces of Ukraine are rebuffing the aggressor.'

Russia has dismissed as a 'complete lie' claims that any of its warplanes were lost.

'Hundreds' of Ukrainian troops were killed in early clashes, sources said, as the fight came to them on all fronts at a moment's notice. Official figures put the death toll at 7, with 19 unaccounted for.

Cruise missiles, guided bombs and GRAD rockets took out targets from east to west - aimed at airfields, military bases, ammo dumps, and command posts including in the capital.

Six Russian jets were shot out of the sky over the eastern Donbass region with 50 Russian troops killed, Ukraine claimed, before Moscow boasted of taking full control of the skies.

Ukrainian border guards said they had come under attack by heavy artillery, tanks and troops from Russia and Belarus as Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko threw his forces into the fight - though he denied taking part.

European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised to hold the Kremlin accountable.

'In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,' they said on Twitter.

Even before Putin's announcement, dozens of nations imposed sanctions on Russia, further squeezing Russian oligarchs and banks out of international markets.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has shrugged off the sanctions, saying that 'Russia has proven that, with all the costs of the sanctions, it is able to minimize the damage.'

The threat of war has already shredded Ukraine's economy and raised the specter of massive casualties, energy shortages across Europe and global economic chaos.

Across Ukraine, cruise and ballistic missiles were destroying military infrastructure and strategically important facilities, according to unofficial Russian sources.

Mariupol, on the Black Sea 50 miles from the Russian border, appeared to be under fierce attack. Taking this strategic location would give the Donbas republics access to the sea.

The moment Ukraine and the rest of Europe had dreaded for months finally came shortly after 4.35am local time when huge explosions were heard in Kiev and other cities across the country.

Terrified citizens rushed to bomb shelters, though no air raid warnings sounded in the capital – only the frequent muffled crump of missile or air strikes breaking through the pre-dawn stillness.

In Kiev, people were sheltering in basements as the sounds of distant explosions became a constant backdrop.

Within an hour Russians special force and airborne troops were reported to be on the ground at Kiev's Boryspil Airport, amid fierce fighting.

A woman in the Ukrainian capital said: 'I was woken by a friend.

'I am in the centre of Kiev.

'I hear the sound of distant explosions and ambulance sirens.'

Vladimir Putin keeps moving his pieces in a very dangerous chess game that is putting Ukrainian lives in in mortal danger. During a what appears to be a previously recorded speech on Russian state television, the president of Russia announced that his country is set to undertake a special military operation to demilitarise the area. He also claimed that the Ukrainian government has been supporting nazis and he has a clear objective of eliminating all nazi sympathizers. Although Putin did say that Russia doesn't plan to occupy the country of Ukraine, he did call on all soldiers to lay down their weapons and head home if they don't want to suffer the consequences. Putin also sent a stern warning to all outside countries to not interfere in his decision or this could escalate to an even greater conflict.

I asked all the partners of the state if they are with us. They are with us, but they are not ready to take us into an alliance with them. No matter how many conversations I had with foreign leaders, I heard a few things. The first is that we are supported. I am grateful to each state that helps us concretely, not just in words. But there is a second - we are left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly - I do not see. Today I asked the 27 leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO, I asked directly. Everyone is afraid, does not answer. And we are not afraid, we are not afraid of anything.""

Furthermore, the USA has sold hundreds of anti-tank Javelin missiles to Ukraine in recent years and Turkey has supplied the Ukrainian army with armed drones. (Read more)

When did Ukraine separate from Russia?

Crimea was originally part of Russia from 1783 until 1954 when the Soviet government transferred the region to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

However no further information of the transfer was made available for the remainder of the Soviet Union, becoming available to the public in 1992 when the Union dissolved.

Since that time Crimea has become a disputed region in its own sense, peaking in interest between Ukraine and Russia in 2014 when Crimea declared itself independent before being annexed by Russia. (Read more)",https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2022/02/24/6216fca2ca4741a0458b4599.html

Big explosions have been heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odessa as world leaders condemned the invasion that could potentially lead to mass casualties and topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government, while threatening the post-Cold War balance.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky declared martial law after Russian troops began their offensive and called on citizens to take up arms against their invaders.

Mr Zelensky said Ukraine’s armed forces were successfully fighting back against Russian troops and had “derailed” Moscow’s plan to take Kyiv and install a puppet government.

“We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on,” Mr Zelensky said.

The Ukrainian preisdent declined an offer from the US to be evacuated as he wanted to support efforts in Kyiv, according to a US intelligence source.

Three children were among the 198 Ukrainians killed since Russia’s invasion began, the Ukraine government said.

Vladimir Putin announced what he called the invasion during a televised address on Thursday morning, saying the attack was intended to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine – a false claim the US had predicted would be made the pretext for an invasion.

Mr Putin accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia‘s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining Nato and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to “demilitarise” it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.

The European Union agreed the “strongest, the harshest package” of sanctions on Friday.

A senior Russian official has warned that Moscow could react to sanctions by opting out of the last remaining nuclear arms pact and freezing Western assets.

At the Medyka border crossing, the line of vehicles waiting to enter Poland stretched 9 miles into Ukraine.
