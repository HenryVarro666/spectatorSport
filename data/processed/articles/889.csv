The Czech Republic has become the first NATO country to send tanks to Ukraine, providing T-72 and armoured infantry vehicles following President Zelensky's plea for help.

Several BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, howitzer artillery pieces and more than a dozen T-72 tanks were yesterday loaded on a train bound for Slovakia where they are expected to head on to Ukraine, footage run by public broadcaster Czech Television showed.

The delivery is understood to be a gift agreed on by NATO allies, raising fears the trans-Atlantic bloc could be dragged into the Russian war in Ukraine despite remaining on the sidelines for more than a month.

NATO leaders have so far given Ukraine anti-tank and anti-craft missiles as well as small arms and protective equipment, but have not offered any heavy armour or fighter jets. Prague's decision to supply tanks to Kyiv will pile pressure on NATO allies to follow suit.

It comes as Russian artillery continued to pound the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv today as the West prepared more sanctions against Moscow in response to civilian killings that Kyiv and its allies have called war crimes.

What is the T-72 battle tank? First made in Russia, the T-72 is staple of eastern European militaries and is owned by the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria. Most of these are the T-72M standard model, which are slightly behind Russia's updated T-72B3 versions that have been used in Ukraine. The Czech Republic has ordered 35 tanks upgraded to T-72M4 CZ, giving the tank a comprehensive upgrade in every aspect and costing more than $5million per tank. It is understood the tanks Prague has sent to Ukraine are not the T-72M4 but have undergone some local modifications. Crew: Three people Main gun: 125 mm smoothbore Anti-tank guided missile: 9M119 Svir or 9M119M Refleks Machine guns: 1 x 7.62 mm, 1 x 12.7 mm Weight: 45 tons Length (including gun): 9.53 metres Width: 3.46 metres Height: 2.2 metres Top speed: 37 to 47mph Advertisement

Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova told parliament yesterday: 'I will only assure you that the Czech Republic is helping Ukraine as much as it can and will continue to help by [supplying] military equipment, both light and heavy.'

She declined to provide further details on the transfer but it comes after Ukraine's Vlodymyr Zelensky demanded NATO deliver armour, fighter jets and other military equipment during a summit in Brussels on March 24.

Ukraine burns through in a single day the same amount of weaponry it receives in a week, according to a senior Polish official, and Kyiv's eastern neighbours are concerned with keeping up with demand, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The Czech delivery has been funded by Prague as well as private donors who have contributed to a crowdsourced fundraising campaign to supply arms to Kyiv.

Prague, and neighbouring Slovakia which has no tanks to give, are also considering helping repair and refit damaged Ukrainian military equipment. Germany will send several dozen infantry fighting vehicles to Kyiv and the UK has approved the delivery of 20 ambulances.

The United States has agreed to provide an additional $100 million in assistance to Ukraine, including Javelin anti-armour systems, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. US chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) said it had suspended business operations in Russia, joining a growing list of companies leaving the country.

NATO is set to discuss the delivery of more weapons to Ukraine at a meeting today and tomorrow, according to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

But western officials on Monday suggested the Biden administration in Washington would act as a throttle on plans to supply more equipment to Ukraine, over fears that the war machines could breach rules allowing only defensive weapons to be supplied.

One said that the US was 'not minded' to support the supply of T-72 tanks of the type used by Ukraine from sympathetic neighbours, adding: 'They have this offensive dimension, they are not purely defensive. They would not be particularly relevant to the military activities the Ukrainians need to undertake.'

A proposal to transfer 28 MiG jets from Poland to Ukraine via the US last month was scrapped amid NATO concerns about getting drawn into conflict with Russia.

Finland and Sweden would be welcomed into NATO if they applied to join, Secretary-General Stoltenberg says – as Russia warns of retaliation Finland and Sweden would be welcomed into NATO if they applied to join, the head of the alliance has said today, in what would be a major blow for Russia amid Vladimir Putin's faltering invasion of Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO general secretary, told a news conference that the 30-member alliance would work to overcome 'security concerns' between the countries applying to join and being ratified - amid fears Russia would retaliate. He spoke after Finland's prime minister Sanna Marin said her country could take a decision on joining the alliance within weeks and polls in Sweden also showed a majority of people support membership. If either country opts to join the alliance, it would mark an historic reconstruction of European security architecture that has held since the end of the Second World War. Finland, which fought a short but bloody conflict with the Soviets in the build-up to World War Two, has been officially neutral since signing a pact in 1948. As part of the pact, Finland agreed never to join a military alliance viewed as hostile to Russia, never to allow its territory to be used for an attack against Russia, and to maintain an armed forces for self-defence purposes only. In return, the country - which shares an 830-mile border with Russia - was given guarantees by Moscow that it would not be attacked. Advertisement

NATO has already supplied fuel, ammunition, helmets, protective gear and medical supplies to Ukraine, Stoltenberg said yesterday. The discussions come despite the bloc's desperate efforts to avoid being dragged into Putin's war in Ukraine.

President Joe Biden has in recent weeks ordered more US troops to NATO's eastern flank to reassure edgy allies and pledged to protect the bloc's territory if Russian forces stray over more borders.

A visibly angry Zelensky on March 26 demanded that Western nations hand over military hardware that was 'gathering dust' in stockpiles, saying Ukraine needed just one per cent of NATO's aircraft and one per cent of its tanks.

Zelensky accused the West of holding back on supplies because of 'intimidation' from Moscow and suggested Russia is in charge of NATO.

And in a late night address on Saturday, Zelensky said: 'We need more ammunition. We've already been waiting 31 days. What is NATO doing?

'Who is in charge of the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it really still Moscow, because of intimidation? We are asking for one per cent of what NATO has, nothing more.'

'If only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to hand over dozens of jets and tanks had one per cent of their courage,' Zelensky said as he praised his troops' efforts.

Russia's constant artillery barrages and aerial bombing are reducing Ukrainian cities to rubble, killing thousands of people and driving millions to flee their homes.

Russian artillery pounded the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv today as the West prepared more sanctions against Moscow in response to civilian killings that Kyiv and its allies have called war crimes.

The besieged southern port of Mariupol has been under almost constant bombardment since the early days of the invasion that began on Feb. 24, trapping tens of thousands of residents without food, water or power.

'The humanitarian situation in the city is worsening,' British military intelligence said. 'Most of the 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender.'

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said authorities would try to evacuate trapped civilians through 11 humanitarian corridors today, though people trying to leave the besieged city of Mariupol would have to use their own vehicles.

Russian forces last week pulled back from positions outside Kyiv and shifted the focus of their assault away from the capital, and Ukraine's general staff said the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the country's second-largest, also remained under attack.

Authorities in the eastern region of Luhansk on Wednesday urged residents to get out 'while it is safe' from an area that Ukraine also expects to be the target of a new offensive.

Western sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, described as a 'special military operation' by Moscow and the biggest assault on a European nation since World War Two, gained new impetus this week when dead civilians shot at close range were found in the northern town of Bucha after it was retaken from Russian forces.

Moscow denied targeting civilians there and called the evidence presented a forgery staged by the West to discredit it.

Speaking a day after the European Union announced new sanctions, including a ban on Russian coal imports and denying Russian ships access to EU ports, the head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, said there was more to come.

'These sanctions will not be our last sanctions,' she told European Parliament on Wednesday. 'Now we have to look into oil and revenues Russia gets from fossil fuels.'

Europe gets about a third of its natural gas from Russia and has been wary of the economic impact of the total ban on Russian energy imports advocated by Ukraine, but Von der Leyen's remarks signal the bloc's strengthening resolve to take the step that Kyiv says is vital to securing a deal to end the war.

The White House said it would also unveil new sanctions today, in part in response to Bucha. The new sanctions, coordinated between Washington, the Group of Seven advanced economies and the EU, will target Russian banks and officials and ban new investment in Russia, the White House said.

After an impassioned address to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, Zelensky said new sanctions against Russia 'must be commensurate with the gravity of the occupiers' war crimes,' calling it a 'crucial moment' for Western leaders.

Ukrainian officials say between 150 and 300 bodies might be in a mass grave by a church in Bucha, north of the capital Kyiv. Satellite images taken weeks ago show bodies of civilians on a street in the town, a private US company said.

Reuters reporters saw at least four victims shot through the head in Bucha, one with their hands tied behind their back. Residents have recounted cases of several others slain, some shot through their eyes and one apparently beaten to death and mutilated.

Since launching an invasion that has uprooted a quarter of Ukraine's population, Russia has failed to capture a single major city.

Most NATO allies have prioritized arming Ukraine with defensive weapons such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, while some U.S. officials have worried that more advanced weaponry deliveries might provoke Russian retaliation.

The Czech government has been involved in that effort since the first week of the war, but Czech officials are more transparent about the provision of more advanced equipment, which Prague regards as essential to the continued defense of Ukraine.

“We have given everything, almost everything, that’s in the arsenal of the heavy mechanized land forces,” Czech Deputy Defense Minister Tomas Kopecny told the Washington Examiner. “We have been shipping basically all the equipment that is needed for heavy mechanized brigades [of] the Ukraine armed forces. And the Poles, they have been doing a lot as well.”

Kopecny demurred when asked about tank deliveries specifically, but two other sources said that some tanks from the Czech Republic have arrived in Ukraine. The Czech-made T-72s will add to the dozens of Russian tanks that Ukrainian forces have captured during the war.

BUCHA MASSACRE STOKES PRESSURE FOR MORE WEAPONS AND SANCTIONS

“It is clear that Ukraine has now more tanks than it had before the war, and it is clear that it has also other types of equipment in larger quantities than it did before the war,” he said. “And the reasons are first, of course, the capturing of Russian vehicles, but also getting it from abroad.”

The Czech Republic also has sent “a couple of dozen” infantry fighting vehicles, known as BMPs, according to a senior Ukrainian source. The Czech government is sending the mechanized equipment while emphasizing that Russia’s withdrawal from Kyiv portends a new and perhaps more dangerous phase of the war.

“It means that [Russian forces] will only focus on those areas where they have been more successful, and therefore, it will be more of a catastrophe,” he said. “It's quite probable that the main offensive will be regional and limited, but it could be all the more efficient. ... This is going to be very, very tough.”

Ukrainian officials have intensified their call for additional weaponry in recent days, reinforced by international outrage over the discovery of civilians killed en masse in Bucha, a town that was occupied by Russian forces during the battle around Kyiv.

“Ukraine must get all the necessary weapons to drive the occupiers out of our land as soon as possible, to liberate our cities,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday. “And if we had already got what we needed, all these planes, tanks, artillery, anti-missile, and anti-ship weapons, we could have saved thousands of people. I do not blame you — I blame only the Russian military — but you could have helped.”

Ukrainian and Russian officials have met for peace talks, but those talks have made little progress, and Zelensky emphasized Thursday that he will not agree to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s demand for the “demilitarization” of Ukraine. Rather, Ukrainian officials plan to follow the Israeli example in hardening its society against any future Russian invasions.

""We explained that the army must be in line with the army we have, which is able to defend our state,” Zelensky said. “We cannot talk about ‘Switzerland of the future’ — probably, our state will be able to be like this a long time after. But we will definitely become a ‘big Israel’ with its own face.”

Ukrainian and Western officials do not expect those dialogues to produce a ceasefire before an expected Russian effort to “destroy” the bulk of the Ukrainian military, which is deployed in eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces have had more success.

“They definitely need large, heavy land forces equipment — main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, artillery of all sorts, anti-aircraft, anti-missile air defense,” he said. “Heavy artillery is crucial, and I would even say more crucial than the tanks themselves, because we haven't really seen main battles fought between large numbers of tanks so far, but what we have seen was precision strikes, by artillery on both sides, being used as one of the most important parts of the warfare so far.”

The survival of those troops, Kopecny estimated, will depend on the speed with which U.S. and European governments provide new weaponry for this more difficult conflict. “There's no time [for us] to think for another three or four weeks before we send it. But there is enough time to make decisions right now that help Ukrainians,” he said. “It is just important to realize that we do not have much time, but we have enough time.”

A substantial percentage of the Czech military aid to Ukraine has been financed by an online fundraising campaign launched in coordination with the Ukrainian Embassy in Prague. Kopecny, while pleased by that initiative and the direct aid from the government, expressed hope that the United States and wealthier Western European countries would provide more military equipment and funding to buy more weapons.

“The U.S. has been one of the countries that has been most active since the beginning, if not the most, in helping Ukraine, in supporting them with weapons,” he said. “But still, compared to the other initiatives, compared to the other amounts of money they are spending on other initiatives that will help Ukraine, if the focus will be more on the military aid, or at least equal, this would be the biggest game-changer.”

A trans-Atlantic discussion of such support will take place this week, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterparts across NATO travel to Brussels for a major ministerial, in the shadow of the massacres discovered in the suburbs near Kyiv.

“What we’ve seen in Bucha is not the random act of a rogue unit. It’s a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities,” Blinken said Tuesday. “What’s vital is to sustain and build on the support for Ukraine, to sustain and build on the pressure against Russia to bring this war to an end, to stop the death and destruction that Russia’s perpetrating in Ukraine.”

Ukraine’s biggest supporters in NATO, thus far, have been the U.S., the United Kingdom, Poland, the Czech Republic, and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, according to Kopecny. This week’s meeting will occur against a backdrop of intensified pressure for major Western European countries such as France and Germany to increase their aid.

“The French are not actually promoting any particular system, like even the [U.S.] or the Brits that would be helping Ukraine militarily,” Kopecny said. “They are the presiding country of the council of the European Union, and there is no coordination — there is no big appeal [to the effect that] this is the most important thing we should all be thinking about and working [on] when it comes to the EU.”

7,bcb9bcba-612c-4625-8572-c40dad3ec08a,[],,"Incredible video footage has emerged showing the moment a lone Ukrainian tank single-handedly destroyed several Russian armoured vehicles less than 50 miles from Kyiv.

The footage, collected by a drone and published by a Ukrainian volunteer unit on Telegram, shows what appears to be a single well-positioned Ukrainian T-64 tank ambushing a convoy of Russian BTR-82A armoured vehicles on a road in Nova Basan, west of the capital.

Thanks to brilliant positioning, the lion-hearted tank operator was able to fire several rounds at the invaders’ convoy, threading the gap between other structures from a concealed location behind a house.

One BTR was quickly set ablaze in the attack, prompting the remaining armoured vehicles to fire back, seemingly aiming at other targets off-camera as yellow flashes of fire were seen streaking across the fields surrounding the road.

But the T-64 appeared unsighted and continued to pound the convoy with shells as it outsmarted the Russian troops until further artillery reinforcements arrived.

The second half of the video cuts to later footage of Ukrainian artillery strikes raining down on the convoy as it attempts to flee, before zooming in on the wreckage of a Russian tank still on fire alongside several corpses.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian soldiers have used one of Moscow’s captured thermobaric weapons against Russian troops.

They fired the feared ‘blazing sun’ TOS-1A rocket launcher near Izyum in eastern Ukraine. The ‘vacuum bombs’ suck in oxygen from the target area, creating a blast that can destroy internal organs. They are illegal to use against civilians, but are lawful against military targets

Despite the heroics of the Ukrainian army, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg today warned the war in Ukraine could last ‘months, even years’ as there is no sign Vladimir Putin has lost ‘his ambition to control the whole country’.

Ukrainian authorities urged civilians in the country’s east to flee ‘now’ or ‘risk death’ as Russian forces regroup ahead of what is expected to be a fresh offensive in the Donbas region.

Stoltenberg, speaking ahead of a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, said the international community should be ‘realistic’ about Moscow’s intentions and ‘realise that this may last for a long time’ as the war entered its 41st day.

‘We need also to be prepared for the long haul, both when it comes to supporting Ukraine, sustaining sanctions and strengthening our defences,’ he added.

Victims ‘blown up with a grenade’, a father shot dead in front of his 14-year-old son and troops who ‘executed all men under 50’: Horrifying details emerge of Russian atrocities in Bucha By Jack Newman and Chris Pleasance for MailOnline Charred body parts lay scattered over the streets of Bucha for days after a man was killed with a grenade, while men were stripped naked, tied up and summarily executed by Russians, traumatised civilians have revealed as vile stories emerge from the Ukrainian town. Survivors from the month-long occupation of the town in Kyiv oblast have started to describe their gruesome treatment at the hands of Putin’s invading troops after area was liberated. Mykola, a 53-year-old resident, spent a month hiding in the cold and dark cellar of his apartment building with his wife after witnessing callous executions on the streets of his hometown. He told ABC that when the Russians arrived, they killed all men aged under 50 and then ordered him to bury his friends within 20 minutes. Two of his friends were shot in front of him and another was hit by a grenade, blowing his body to pieces, which lay untouched for days until Mykola was allowed to quickly gather his parts in a bag and bury them in a shallow grave to ward off the dogs. Vanya Skyba told The Economist how Russians rounded up a group of builders, ordered them to strip naked and lie face down on the floor while their bodies and phones were searched for evidence of military tattoos or anti-Russian sentiment. One of the men was killed as an example to make the group talk, forcing one of the men to admit he had been a member of Ukraine’s territorial defence who had served in the Donbas, prompting the Kremlin thugs to execute him too. The others were beaten and tortured until an order to kill was issued by a Russian saying: ‘F***ing do them in.’ They were led to the side of the building and each shot, and Skyba took a bullet in the side which went through his body. He played dead on the concrete floor until he heard silence when he fled over a fence to a nearby home. He was later found there by Russians from a different unit who believed his cover story he was the owner of the home, but they led him back to the cellar where he had been shot where he sheltered with a dozens woman and children until they were freed. After the savage killings, locals said Putin’s army occupied the dead civilians’ homes, drinking their alcohol, partying and stealing their belongings.

The date of the ambush was not given, but it is thought to have taken place last week, given that the majority of Russian forces retreated from towns and villages around Kyiv late last week and over the weekend.

Geolocation shows the ambush took place along the HO7 highway which runs through Nova Basan, connecting Kyiv with the Western cities of Sumy and Kharkiv.

Meanwhile, images published on April 1 showed Ukrainian soldiers inspecting a series of burnt-out Russian tanks and BTRs in Nova Basan, which may well have been the remnants of the effective ambush.

The Ukrainian tank managed to operate incredibly effectively against the Russian armour, despite the considerable discrepancy in their technology.

The T-64 is a Soviet-era machine, first deployed as early as the 1960s, and Ukraine inherited thousands of the vehicles when the Soviet Union collapsed.

Armoured vehicle technology has since moved on massively – the Russian BTRs that were destroyed in the clip only entered service a decade ago – but Ukraine still relies heavily on the ageing tanks as the bulk of its military might.

Images published in January less than a month prior to the Russian invasion showed scores of T-64 tanks left out in the snow, waiting to be retrofitted with upgraded armour and weapons at a tank repair plant in Kharkiv.

The footage of the daring ambush emerged as Ukrainian authorities claim Russia’s death toll in the war is nearing 20,000.

Ukraine’s armed forces are continuing to push back invading Kremlin troops and retake ‘key terrain’ around the capital and other eastern cities, while Putin’s forces retreat to refocus their efforts on the Donbas.

In an intelligence update posted yesterday, Britain’s MoD said that due to the scale of the damage, many of Russian units ‘are likely to require significant re-equipping and refurbishment before being available to redeploy for operations in eastern Ukraine.’

However, Russian forces are continuing to conduct brutal bombing campaigns in cities like Mariupol where the civilian death toll has risen to 5,000.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said that even though Ukraine is taking back the capital, he urged civilians not to return for ‘at least another week’, with explosives left around the city, and described the situation in east of Ukraine as ‘critical’.

Elsewhere, Ukraine’s general staff said Russia has again used banned cluster munitions in Mykolaiv, targeting civilian buildings including a children hospital in a horrific attack which has killed 11 and wounded 61.

As the Czech Republic became the first bloc member to send tanks and armoured infantry vehicles to Kyiv on Thursday, NATO’s foreign ministers met today to discuss sending more arms to Ukraine after it emerged the EU had sent just £1bn in aid to President Zelensky’s troops since the invasion began on February 24.

Members of the trans-Atlantic alliance had until today given Ukraine only anti-tank and anti-craft missiles, small arms and protective equipment, but not offered heavy armour or fighter jets.

Today’s delivery is understood to be a gift agreed on by NATO allies, raising fears the bloc could be dragged into the Russian war in Ukraine despite remaining on the sidelines for more than a month.

Stoltenberg also confirmed that some members of the alliance had sent heavy weaponry to Ukraine following reports the Czech Republic had supplied Soviet-era tanks to Kyiv.

‘Since the invasion allies have stepped up their support. I also expect that ministers when they meet today and tomorrow will discuss how they can further support Ukraine,’ he said, declining to give details.

‘I can say that the totality of what allies are doing is significant and that includes also some heavier systems combined with lighter systems.’

President Joe Biden has in recent weeks ordered more US troops to NATO’s eastern flank to reassure edgy allies and pledged to protect the bloc’s territory if Russian forces stray over more borders.

Ukraine’s deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk today said in a message on Telegram that residents of the country’s eastern regions should evacuate ‘now’ or ‘risk death’ due to a feared Russian attack.

‘The governors of the Kharkiv, Lugansk and Donetsk regions are calling on the population to leave these territories and are doing everything to ensure that the evacuations take place in an organised manner,’ she said.

The call for urgent evacuations comes as Ukraine says Russian forces are regrouping to launch a fresh offensive in the country’s east after retreating from the Kyiv region.

Vereshchuk asked residents to cooperate with authorities, saying Kyiv will ‘not be able to help’ them after an attack.

‘It has to be done now because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it, nor will we be able to help,’ she said.

‘It is necessary to evacuate as long as this possibility exists. For now, it still exists,’ she added.

Russian forces last week pulled back from positions outside Kyiv and shifted the focus of their assault away from the capital, and Ukraine’s general staff said the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest, also remained under attack.

Authorities in the eastern region of Luhansk on Wednesday urged residents to get out ‘while it is safe’ from an area that Ukraine also expects to be the target of a new offensive.

The Kremlin has declared that Ukraine’s Donbas is now a priority for the Russian army. NATO believes Moscow aims to take control of the whole Donbas region in eastern Ukraine with the aim of creating a corridor from Russia to annexed Crimea.

Russian artillery pounded the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv today as the West prepared more sanctions against Moscow in response to civilian killings that Kyiv and its allies have called war crimes.

First NATO country sends tanks to Ukraine: Czech Republic provides T-72 tanks and armoured infantry vehicles following Zelensky’s plea for help

By Lauren Lewis for MailOnline

The Czech Republic has become the first NATO country to send tanks to Ukraine, providing T-72 and armoured infantry vehicles following President Zelensky’s plea for help.

Several BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, howitzer artillery pieces and more than a dozen T-72 tanks were yesterday loaded on a train bound for Slovakia where they are expected to head on to Ukraine, footage run by public broadcaster Czech Television showed.

The delivery is understood to be a gift agreed on by NATO allies, raising fears the trans-Atlantic bloc could be dragged into the Russian war in Ukraine despite remaining on the sidelines for more than a month.

NATO leaders have so far given Ukraine anti-tank and anti-craft missiles as well as small arms and protective equipment, but have not offered any heavy armour or fighter jets. Prague’s decision to supply tanks to Kyiv will pile pressure on NATO allies to follow suit.

It comes as Russian artillery continued to pound the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv today as the West prepared more sanctions against Moscow in response to civilian killings that Kyiv and its allies have called war crimes.

The Czech Republic has ordered 35 tanks upgraded to T-72M4 CZ, giving the tank a comprehensive upgrade in every aspect and costing more than $5million per tank.

The United States has agreed to provide an additional $100 million in assistance to Ukraine, including Javelin anti-armour systems, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. US chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) said it had suspended business operations in Russia, joining a growing list of companies leaving the country.

NATO is set to discuss the delivery of more weapons to Ukraine at a meeting today and tomorrow, according to Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

But western officials on Monday suggested the Biden administration in Washington would act as a throttle on plans to supply more equipment to Ukraine, over fears that the war machines could breach rules allowing only defensive weapons to be supplied.

One said that the US was ‘not minded’ to support the supply of T-72 tanks of the type used by Ukraine from sympathetic neighbours, adding: ‘They have this offensive dimension, they are not purely defensive. They would not be particularly relevant to the military activities the Ukrainians need to undertake.’

A proposal to transfer 28 MiG jets from Poland to Ukraine via the US last month was scrapped amid NATO concerns about getting drawn into conflict with Russia.

Finland and Sweden would be welcomed into NATO if they applied to join, Secretary-General Stoltenberg says – as Russia warns of retaliation Finland and Sweden would be welcomed into NATO if they applied to join, the head of the alliance has said today, in what would be a major blow for Russia amid Vladimir Putin’s faltering invasion of Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO general secretary, told a news conference that the 30-member alliance would work to overcome ‘security concerns’ between the countries applying to join and being ratified – amid fears Russia would retaliate. He spoke after Finland’s prime minister Sanna Marin said her country could take a decision on joining the alliance within weeks and polls in Sweden also showed a majority of people support membership. If either country opts to join the alliance, it would mark an historic reconstruction of European security architecture that has held since the end of the Second World War. Finland, which fought a short but bloody conflict with the Soviets in the build-up to World War Two, has been officially neutral since signing a pact in 1948. As part of the pact, Finland agreed never to join a military alliance viewed as hostile to Russia, never to allow its territory to be used for an attack against Russia, and to maintain an armed forces for self-defence purposes only. In return, the country – which shares an 830-mile border with Russia – was given guarantees by Moscow that it would not be attacked.

NATO has already supplied fuel, ammunition, helmets, protective gear and medical supplies to Ukraine, Stoltenberg said yesterday. The discussions come despite the bloc’s desperate efforts to avoid being dragged into Putin’s war in Ukraine.

President Joe Biden has in recent weeks ordered more US troops to NATO’s eastern flank to reassure edgy allies and pledged to protect the bloc’s territory if Russian forces stray over more borders.

A visibly angry Zelensky on March 26 demanded that Western nations hand over military hardware that was ‘gathering dust’ in stockpiles, saying Ukraine needed just one per cent of NATO’s aircraft and one per cent of its tanks.

Zelensky accused the West of holding back on supplies because of ‘intimidation’ from Moscow and suggested Russia is in charge of NATO.

And in a late night address on Saturday, Zelensky said: ‘We need more ammunition. We’ve already been waiting 31 days. What is NATO doing?

‘Who is in charge of the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it really still Moscow, because of intimidation? We are asking for one per cent of what NATO has, nothing more.’

‘If only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to hand over dozens of jets and tanks had one per cent of their courage,’ Zelensky said as he praised his troops’ efforts.

Russia’s constant artillery barrages and aerial bombing are reducing Ukrainian cities to rubble, killing thousands of people and driving millions to flee their homes.

Russian artillery pounded the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv today as the West prepared more sanctions against Moscow in response to civilian killings that Kyiv and its allies have called war crimes.

The besieged southern port of Mariupol has been under almost constant bombardment since the early days of the invasion that began on Feb. 24, trapping tens of thousands of residents without food, water or power.

‘The humanitarian situation in the city is worsening,’ British military intelligence said. ‘Most of the 160,000 remaining residents have no light, communication, medicine, heat or water. Russian forces have prevented humanitarian access, likely to pressure defenders to surrender.’

Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said authorities would try to evacuate trapped civilians through 11 humanitarian corridors today, though people trying to leave the besieged city of Mariupol would have to use their own vehicles.

Russian forces last week pulled back from positions outside Kyiv and shifted the focus of their assault away from the capital, and Ukraine’s general staff said the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest, also remained under attack.

Authorities in the eastern region of Luhansk on Wednesday urged residents to get out ‘while it is safe’ from an area that Ukraine also expects to be the target of a new offensive.

Western sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, described as a ‘special military operation’ by Moscow and the biggest assault on a European nation since World War Two, gained new impetus this week when dead civilians shot at close range were found in the northern town of Bucha after it was retaken from Russian forces.

Moscow denied targeting civilians there and called the evidence presented a forgery staged by the West to discredit it.

Speaking a day after the European Union announced new sanctions, including a ban on Russian coal imports and denying Russian ships access to EU ports, the head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, said there was more to come.

‘These sanctions will not be our last sanctions,’ she told European Parliament on Wednesday. ‘Now we have to look into oil and revenues Russia gets from fossil fuels.’

Europe gets about a third of its natural gas from Russia and has been wary of the economic impact of the total ban on Russian energy imports advocated by Ukraine, but Von der Leyen’s remarks signal the bloc’s strengthening resolve to take the step that Kyiv says is vital to securing a deal to end the war.

The White House said it would also unveil new sanctions today, in part in response to Bucha. The new sanctions, coordinated between Washington, the Group of Seven advanced economies and the EU, will target Russian banks and officials and ban new investment in Russia, the White House said.

After an impassioned address to the UN Security Council on Tuesday, Zelensky said new sanctions against Russia ‘must be commensurate with the gravity of the occupiers’ war crimes,’ calling it a ‘crucial moment’ for Western leaders.

Ukrainian officials say between 150 and 300 bodies might be in a mass grave by a church in Bucha, north of the capital Kyiv. Satellite images taken weeks ago show bodies of civilians on a street in the town, a private US company said.

Reuters reporters saw at least four victims shot through the head in Bucha, one with their hands tied behind their back.
