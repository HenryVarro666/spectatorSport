Ms Truss said Europe needed a new security strategy based on “defence, deterrence and resilence” and that the 1997 Nato-Russia Founding Act represented an out-dated approach to relations with the Kremlin. This comes as Mr Macron — as well as Germany and Turkey — is maintaining conversation with Putin, despite other European countries severing the relationship. The revelations came as global NATO ministers meet in Brussels to discuss the ongoing bloody war in Ukraine. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki slammed the French leader by saying: ""nobody negotiated with Hitler"". He continued: ""Mr President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin, what have you achieved? Have you stopped any of the actions that have taken place?"" Others think it is too little too late and there is no longer room for dialogue. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's secretary-general, said: ""Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine.

The Prime Minister was hosting Olaf Scholz at Downing Street on Friday, with a press conference planned for later in the afternoon.

Mr Johnson is expected to offer assistance to Berlin, which is still heavily reliant on Russian gas, to reduce its dependence on Moscow’s energy exports in a bid to starve Vladimir Putin’s war machine of funds.

In a tweet, Mr Johnson said: “Looking forward to welcoming @BundesKanzler Scholz to the UK today.

“I welcome his principled determination to end dependence on Russian energy. How we respond to Russia’s invasion will define the international order for years to come. We cannot let Putin’s crimes go unpunished.”

It comes as the Foreign Office targeted the daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov with sanctions.

A statement said it was aiming to hit the “lavish lifestyles of the Kremlin’s inner circle”.

It said: “Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova and Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova, the daughters of President Putin, and Yekaterina Sergeyevna Vinokurova, daughter of foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, will be subject to travel bans and asset freezes.”

Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss joined international condemnation of the rocket strike on a railway station in Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, that president Volodymyr Zelensky said killed around 30 people and injured 100 more.

“Appalled by the horrific reports of Russian rocket attacks on civilians at Kramatorsk railway station in Eastern Ukraine,” she tweeted.

“The targeting of civilians is a war crime. We will hold Russia and Putin to account.”

Earlier, Ms Truss, after a meeting of Nato counterparts in Brussels on Thursday, said she hoped to see “more countries” commit to banning Russian energy imports.

The UK has pledged to end all imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of 2022, with gas to follow as soon as possible.

Also on Thursday, the European Union said members had agreed to new sanctions that included an embargo on Russian coal imports.

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has pushed for foreign leaders to go further on cutting ties with the Kremlin.

“As long as the West continues buying Russian gas and oil it is supporting Ukraine with one hand while supporting the Russian war machine with another hand,” he said in Brussels.

He took particular umbrage with Germany, urging it to cut red tape and speed up support to Ukraine.

“While Berlin has time, Kyiv doesn’t,” Mr Kuleba said.

Positive momentum at @NATO. We agreed to step up support for Ukraine as they respond to a new, more concentrated Russian offensive.

Germany has faced criticism from Ukraine and other European nations, including Poland, with claims it has been too slow to phase out Russian energy.

Robert Habeck, the German economy and energy minister, has announced plans to stop importing oil and coal from Russia this year, and gas by mid-2024.

Meanwhile, UK and Nato allies have agreed to supply “new and heavier” weapons to Ukraine in an acknowledgement that the conflict has entered a “new and different phase”.

After withdrawing from Kyiv, Mr Putin’s troops look to have regrouped as they eye gains in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

Ms Truss said allies “agreed to help Ukrainian forces move from their Soviet era equipment to Nato standard equipment on a bilateral basis” in response to Kyiv’s calls for advanced weapons.

Mr Kuleba has urged the West to hand over the weapons swiftly or else Ukraine risks losing territory to the invading forces.

“Either you help us now, and I’m speaking about days, not weeks, or your help will come too late,” he warned.

Defence minister Jeremy Quin, in a video posted on Twitter, said he had hosted a delegation from the Ukrainian government to consider further military support.

Dmitry Peskov, press secretary to Russian president Mr Putin, confirmed Russia had sustained “significant losses of troops” in the war, calling the deaths a “huge tragedy”.

Speaking to Sky News, Mr Peskov denied Russian forces were behind the deaths of Ukrainian civilians in places such as Bucha, which is situated on the outskirts of the capital, instead calling the photos a “bold fake”.

It comes as the World Health Organisation (WHO) said a “grim milestone” had been reached, saying it had verified more than 100 attacks on health care in Ukraine since the start of the war on February 24.

The attacks so far have claimed 73 lives and injured 51, WHO said.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that in northern Ukraine Russian forces have “fully withdrawn” to Belarus and Russia.

“At least some of these forces will be transferred to East Ukraine to fight in the Donbas,” it said early on Friday morning.",https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/national/20053733.pm-german-chancellor-hold-talks-reducing-dependence-russian-gas/

#FAC | 🔜 Press conference with @JosepBorrellF – Foreign Affairs Council ➡️ Watch here 👇 — EU Council Press (@EUCouncilPress) March 21, 2022

The Compass gives the European Union an ambitious plan of action for strengthening the EU’s security and defence policy by 2030.

🇪🇺 @EUCouncil approves the #StrategicCompass🧭: an ambitious plan of action, that sets out a clear path towards strengthening the EU's security and defence policy by 2030. Find out more: https://t.co/3T9raJJymv pic.twitter.com/o7YoxBCEjO — EU Council Press (@EUCouncilPress) March 21, 2022

The more hostile security environment requires us to make a quantum leap forward and increase our capacity and willingness to act, strengthen our resilience, and invest more and better in our defence capabilities.

EU foreign policy chief Borrell announces completion of “Strategic Compass” as @jacopobarigazzi @CamGijs predicted last week. Borrell calls it a “historic” moment & culmination of process that began long before Russia’s war in Ukraine https://t.co/w68bz4UTdt — David M. Herszenhorn (@herszenhorn) March 21, 2022

The strength of our Union lies in unity, solidarity and determination. The objective of the Strategic Compass is to make the EU a stronger and more capable security provider. The EU needs to be able to protect its citizens and to contribute to international peace and security. This is all the more important at a time when war has returned to Europe, following the unjustified and unprovoked Russian aggression against Ukraine, as well as of major geopolitical shifts. This Strategic Compass will enhance the EU’s strategic autonomy and its ability to work with partners to safeguard its values and interests.

A stronger and more capable EU in security and defence will contribute positively to global and transatlantic security and is complementary to NATO, which remains the foundation of collective defence for its members. It will also intensify support for the global rules-based order, with the United Nations at its core.

The threats are rising and the cost of inaction is clear. The Strategic Compass is a guide for action. It sets out an ambitious way forward for our security and defence policy for the next decade. It will help us face our security responsibilities, in front of our citizens and the rest of the world. If not now, then when?

“The Strategic Compass provides a shared assessment of the strategic environment in which the EU is operating and of the threats and challenges the Union faces. The document makes concrete and actionable proposals, with a very precise timetable for implementation, in order to improve the EU’s ability to act decisively in crises and to defend its security and its citizens” said Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

The Compass covers all the aspects of the security and defence policy and is structured around four pillars: act, invest, partner and secure.

The @EUCouncil has approved the #StrategicCompass, an ambitious plan of action to strengthen the EU's security and defence policy. The Compass covers all aspects of our security & defence policy, based on 4 pillars:

1⃣ Act

3⃣ Partner
