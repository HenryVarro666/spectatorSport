Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 28:

Russian troops face major setback east of Kyiv and moving into defensive positions

In a significant movement, Ukraine's military forces have pushed back Russian forces east of Kyiv to 55 kilometers from the city center, according to a senior defense official.

For weeks, and as recently as Tuesday, Russian forces have been kept at bay approximately 20 to 30 kilometers from the center of the capital city.

The official said that Ukrainian forces near Bovary ""have been able to push the Russians back to about 55 kilometers east and northeast of Kyiv.""

The ability to push back Russian forces nearly twice as far as where they had been for weeks is in line with what the official had said on Tuesday were indications that in some areas Ukrainian forces were attempting to retake territory taken by Russia. ""Ukrainians are not only in some of these places up sufficiently defending they're going on the offense in some of these places and actually pushing the Russians backwards, or in the case of Kiev, they're, they're basically forcing them into a defensive position,"" the official said Wednesday.

The U.S. now assesses that Russian troops that have been stalled 12 to 15 kilometers north of the city are ""digging in"" and establishing defensive positions according to the official. ""They're forcing them into a defensive position"" the official told reporters on Wednesday. ""So it's not that they're not advancing, they're actually not trying to advance right now,"" said the official. ""They're taking more defensive positions.""

""We're starting to see him sort of dig in around Kyiv but really trying to go more on the offense than they have been, more energy applied, in that eastern part of Ukraine"" said the official.

Ukrainians pushing back Russian troops in Cherniviv

Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops in the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, have also succeeded in slightly pushing back some of the Russian forces that have surrounded the city for weeks. The official described Ukrainians forces there as continuing to fight ""very hard"" against Russian forces to keep them out of the city and in some cases Russian troops have been ""ceding ground."" ""They are actually moving in the opposite direction, but not by much,"" the official said of Russian forces around the city.

Russian troops now prioritizing operations in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region

The official said Russia appears to be ""starting to prioritize"" their operations in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, particularly around Luhansk, to cut off Ukraine's military that has been fighting there against Russian separatists for the past eight years. ""We still believe that the Russians are trying to basically cut it off and therefore pin down Ukrainian forces that are that are in the Luhansk, Donetsk area,"" said the official.

""What we're seeing now is indications that the Russians are really starting to prioritize that part of eastern Ukraine,"" said the official. ""We believe that they are now going to start to apply, actually, they have applied a lot more energy in the Luhansk, Donetsk area, particularly around Luhansk. You're seeing them really put more energy and effort into that part of Ukraine.""

The official has previously said that it appears that the Russian forces fighting to take over the southern port city of Mariupol so they can then push north into the Donbass to cut off the Ukrainian military. Meanwhile, the fighting in that city remains ""very very contested"" according to the official who also described the fighting there between Russian and Ukrainian troops as being ""hardcore."" The official noted that Russian forces continue to heavily bombard the city with artillery and long range missile fire.

Meanwhile, it appears that recent Russian military activity around the western port city of Odessa that led to speculation of an attack on the city may have been a feint intended to ""pin down Ukrainian forces."" ""It's not entirely it's not entirely obvious that they actually will make a move on Odessa,"" said the official. ""So we're just we're just kind of watching that to see to see where it goes.""

More US troops going forward to eastern Europe?

The official said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is always assessing the U.S. military presence in eastern Europe and has not ""taken off the table"" the possibility ""that he will flow more forces in from the United States or reposition from elsewhere in Europe.""

But for now there are no announcements to make said the official who added that it's unclear what the U.S. military posture in eastern Europe will look like going forward. ""Certainly, the security environment in Europe is different now. And it will be different that it will be different no matter what the outcome is of this war,"" said the official.

""I think it's safe to say that the United States as well as other NATO nations will be taken a hard look at what it whether we have the footprint right and whether the posture is appropriate to the new security environment that results from all this,"" the official said.

Russia has lots of missiles left to use

According to the official, Russia has now launched more than 1,200 missiles into Ukraine, but ""we still assess that they have the vast majority of their of their assembled available inventory of surface to air missiles and cruise missiles available to them."" Though the Russian military has expended a lot of the missile inventory readied for operations in Ukraine the official noted that ""they still have an awful lot left.""

The official said that Russia's military is ""running the lowest on our air launched cruise missiles"" but that they still have ""over 50% of what they had assembled prior to the invasion. But they still have a significant number of ground launched cruise missiles, short range ballistic missiles, and medium range ballistic missiles.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukraines-military-forces-russian-troops-east-kyiv-back/story?id=83631494

“We saw the Russian infantry on the security camera of our building,” he said. “From that moment, the Russians stayed.”

They made around 200 residents stay too, holding many of them hostage in the basements of their own buildings, forcing them to hand over their phones and taking over their apartments. Others were able to avoid detection but still were essentially prisoners in their own homes as Russian forces moved into the buildings, which had housed 560 families, and took up sniping positions.

The Times interviewed seven residents of the Pokrovsky apartment complex in the town of Hostomel, about 10 miles northwest of Kyiv. All experienced the assault and the captivity firsthand before finding ways to flee. Using their accounts, along with footage from security cameras and cellphones, The Times was able to piece together what it looked and felt like as Russian forces closed in.

The images emerging from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are reminders of what wars often prove: cities are both key strategic targets and the places that bear the greatest costs of conflict.

Towns and villages in the path of the Russian advance have also been devastated. But it is the cities, which were home to about two-thirds of Ukraine’s 44 million people before the invasion, that are the focus of the Russian assault.

Now, from Kharkiv and Kyiv in the north to Mariupol in the south, many women and children have fled, and urban neighborhoods are becoming battlegrounds. Businesses, homes, schools, cultural institutions and historical buildings are all threatened with destruction, and as of late March, at least 1,500 civilian targets have been damaged or destroyed. At the same time, Ukrainian fighters have so far mounted a stiffer-than-expected opposition to a superior force.",https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-cities.html

The crump of incoming missiles could be heard intermittently throughout the city on Monday night, some close enough to rattle the windows of the apartment in which I am staying. The population has been ordered to remain in their homes so the Ukrainian army can sweep the streets clear of infiltrators, and the city is eerily empty.

It’s certainly not safe here, but from a perspective of personal risk, I don’t feel reckless in staying. Despite media reports on Tuesday morning that the Russian army is only 15 miles from the center of Kyiv, there is no indication that they have broken through Ukrainian lines. And although my presence here has sparked understandable concern among family and friends, I feel quite comfortable making the decision to remain – at least for the time being. I am confident that the Russians will not be able to take Kyiv, no matter how hard they try – so confident that I would literally stake my life on it. This is by no means blind faith. Even if the city was undefended, the Russians lack the manpower in their battalion tactical groups to secure a city of over 300 square miles and half a million structures, a city that housed a pre-war population of four million.

Urban combat consumes a massive amount of manpower, even before casualties. A good rule of thumb is that an infantry battalion can seize three to four city blocks of two to three-story structures at a time. The Iraqi city of Fallujah was, in 2004, less than a tenth the size of modern Kyiv. And still, even with the full weight of U.S. firepower behind them, it took almost 14,000 troops and two months to cordon and clear the city of insurgent defenders numbered in the low thousands. During the battle for Mosul in 2017, it took Iraqi security forces, backed by U.S. and coalition fire support, nine months to wrest a city with a population one quarter that of Kyiv.

As the Russians move into the city, they will have to strongpoint every block – leaving units behind in order to prevent Ukrainians from infiltrating back into the area. The only other alternative will be to force corridors into the center of the city to seize key objectives — a tactic used to good effect by the Israelis in Gaza and by U.S. forces in seizing Baghdad. But such an approach exposes the attacker’s flanks and is only likely to succeed if they have numerical superiority and limited objectives. The Ukrainians will continue to launch distributed small unit counterattacks, a tactic ideally suited for a city this large.

Even if the Russians were top-notch soldiers without the problems of logistics and command and control that have plagued them since the war began, this would be a long and bloody fight. Russian tactics, however, have not been impressive, with mechanized infantry appearing reluctant to leave the false safety of their vehicles — a practice that will equate to collective self-immolation in a city offering endless sanctuary for anti-tank rocketeers.

Aside from the physical scale, significant human factors come into play during urban combat which imposes a particularly heavy toll on the psyche. At the outset of the battle of Fallujah, I felt confident and well prepared – and yet within a week, I was close to exhaustion. I was by no means alone in this regard, and we had to rotate U.S. advisors on my team to the rear for a break every few days. Russian morale, by all accounts, is already abysmally low — no state in which to begin a prolonged urban battle. Awaiting them now are tens of thousands of locally recruited Ukrainian soldiers, fighting on their home turf with their homes at their backs, defending a city that is iconic to their national identity.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is faced with two unenviable choices: To cordon the city and starve it out, or to attack into Kyiv itself, thus beginning an urban brawl the scale of which hasn’t been seen since the Second World War. Both options will inflict misery on the civilian population, and exact a heavy toll on both sides. But that ascetic phrase doesn’t do justice to the scale of devastation that this battle is likely to cause. The Russian attack on the Chechen city of Grozny resulted in an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 deaths, roughly 6% of the city’s population.

Putin’s military commanders will likely be advising him not to attack Kyiv, but instead to surround the city and then seek to pummel and starve it into submission. Even this, however, won’t be easy. Kyiv has the most capable air defense system in the country and has been shooting down most incoming missiles faster than the Russians can replace them. The capital is ten times the size of Mariupol – the port city that the Russians have besieged and devastated now for two weeks. It has a fresh water supply in the Dnieper river that runs through its center, and there are wells interspersed throughout the city. Even if the Russians are successful in cutting off the corridor that leads to Lviv in western Ukraine and thus to the outside world — current food stocks are sufficient to last, I am told, several months.

As always in war, fortunes can change dramatically. The Russians might, as the Ukrainians warn, launch an attack from Belarus directly toward the capital, destroy key nodes in the Ukrainian air defense system, or, as the U.S. fears, use chemical or biological weapons. But barring these contingencies, the Ukrainian defenders in Kyiv can hold out indefinitely. The question is at what cost — and that’s a question that only Putin can answer.

Correction: A previous version of this article mistakenly estimated the size of Kyiv using kilometers instead of miles.

Britain sending thousands more missiles to Ukraine LONDON — Britain will send thousands more missiles to Ukraine’s government as Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Western allies to boost the supply of military aid to Ukraine. Johnson is traveling to Brussels on Thursday for talks with NATO and leaders of the Group of Seven. He is expected to provide further details of the new British aid during the visit, including the donation of 6,000 more missiles comprising anti-tank and high-explosive weaponry. “The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defenses as they turn the tide in this fight,” Johnson said. Britain has already sent more than 4,000 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine. The U.K. government also says it is providing some 4 million pounds ($5.3 million) in emergency funding to the BBC World Service to counter disinformation in Russia and Ukraine. Share this -







NATO secretary general: Russia must stop nuclear saber-rattling, nuclear war cannot be won NATO's secretary general on Wednesday called on Russia to ""stop its nuclear saber-rattling,"" calling the rhetoric dangerous and irresponsible and saying a nuclear war cannot be won. ""Any use of nuclear weapons will fundamentally change the nature of the conflict, and Russia must understand that a nuclear war should never been fought and they can never win a nuclear war,"" Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at a news conference. Russian President Vladimir Putin said days after the invasion of Ukraine that he had ordered his nuclear deterrent forces to be on alert. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov refused in an interview with CNN on Tuesday to rule out the use of nuclear weapons, saying only that nuclear weapons could be used ""if it is an existential threat for our country."" Defense Department press secretary John Kirby said Tuesday that potential uses of nuclear weapons or changes in nuclear posture are dangerous. ""It's not the way a responsible nuclear power should act. So we've been very clear about that,"" he said. Share this -







Almost 1,000 civilian deaths recorded in Ukraine, but real numbers considerably higher, U.N. says The United Nations has recorded 977 civilians killed in Ukraine since Russia attacked almost a month ago, its human rights office said Wednesday — but it said the real figures are likely to be much higher. Of the dead, 81 were children. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded 2,571 civilian casualties in all, which includes 1,594 injured. Those are numbers that have been recorded by the office, but it noted that reports of casualties in some areas — including besieged Mariupol — have been delayed by intense fighting and that other reports must be corroborated. The human rights office ""believes that the actual figures are considerably higher,"" it said in an update. Most of the recorded casualties are being caused by weapons that affect large areas, like artillery, rockets and airstrikes. The U.S. said it has assessed that members of Russia's armed forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Wednesday's announcement cited what he called credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians. Blinken said officials in Mariupol said that more than 2,400 civilians had been killed in the city alone. The U.N. said that there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties in Mariupol, as well as several other cities, and that those figures are being further corroborated and are not included in its numbers.

Russia moves to expel U.S. diplomats and staff in latest tit-for-tat Russia declared some U.S. diplomats and staff ""persona non grata"" and moved to expel them from the country, in the latest in a back-and-forth between the two nations. A State Department spokesperson confirmed that the U.S. Embassy received a list of diplomats, and the spokesperson called on the Russian government to end its “unjustified expulsions” of U.S. diplomats and staff. The move is the latest in a series of tit-for-tats that has left both nuclear powers with a skeletal diplomatic presence at a high point of tension between Washington and Moscow over Russia’s war on Ukraine. “This is Russia’s latest unhelpful and unproductive step in our bilateral relationship,” the State Department spokesperson said. “Now more than ever, it is critical that our countries have the necessary diplomatic personnel in place to facilitate communication between our governments."" Russia on Wednesday said the deportation was in response to Washington’s expulsion of 11 Russian diplomats from their Mission to the UN in New York, as well as one Russian employee in the UN Secretariat. The U.S. said the Russians were intelligence operatives “who have abused their privileges of residency in the U.S. by engaging in espionage activities that are adverse to our national security.” Share this -







Ukrainian forces push back Russian forces near Kyiv, U.S. official says Russia intensifies attacks in Kyiv but is losing territory, according to Ukraine officials March 23, 2022 01:55 Ukrainian forces have pushed back Russian forces east of the capital of Kyiv by at least 15 miles and have stymied Russian forces to the northwest of the city, a U.S. defense official said Wednesday. Russian forces to the east of Kyiv are about 34 miles from the city after the counterattack, the senior defense official said. But east of Ukraine, in the Donbas area, Russian forces ""have applied a lot more energy, particularly around Luhansk,"" the official said. There are indications that Russian troops may be trying to prioritize that part of eastern Ukraine, the official said. Russia attacked and invaded Ukraine almost a month ago in what has been condemned as an unprovoked and unjustified attack. Since the invasion began, Russia has launched more than 1,200 missiles, the U.S. official said. Share this -







Doctors treat patients by candlelight in basement of Mariupol's last hospital Medical staff in the last functioning hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol are treating patients in the basement largely by candlelight, officials said Wednesday. In an effort to save fuel for diesel generators, doctors and nurses at City Hospital No. 1 are only using the machines for complex operations and hemodialysis for cleaning blood, the City Council said. “Right now it is no longer possible to provide the necessary medical procedures for blood purification in renal failure,” the council said. The officials added that, in addition to medical staff and patients, roughly 600 to 700 residents from nearby neighborhoods are sheltering in the facility. “Despite the extremely difficult situation, doctors continue to heroically fulfill their mission — saving lives,” the council said. Earlier Wednesday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said nearly 3,000 people evacuated the city after weeks of Russian bombardment and allegations Tuesday that civilians were captured while trying to flee. Vereshchuk said buses and other vehicles that successfully left Mariupol were blocked on the outskirts of their destination, Zaporizhia, and unable to enter the city. They would try again Thursday, she said. On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said roughly 100,000 people remained in a city that once had a population of nearly half a million.

U.S., allies discussing Russia's removal from G-20 The Biden administration and U.S. allies are discussing whether Russia should be removed from the G-20 group of countries that tackles global economic issues, three people familiar with the matter told NBC News. While the U.S. isn’t actively pushing for it, Russia’s removal probably won’t happen in part because China and India, which are Group of 20 members, would likely block the efforts, the three sources said. The G-20 is made up of 19 countries and the European Union. Still, the issue has been discussed at the National Security Council and at a meeting that U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo held last week with Polish Economy Minister Piotr Nowak. Poland has publicly pushed for Russia’s ouster, but a Commerce Department spokesperson said Raimondo “did not express a position on behalf of the U.S. Government” regarding Poland’s proposal to kick Russia out. Calls to remove Russia have grown amid concerns that Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend the G-20 summit in November in Indonesia. Russia was kicked out of the Group of Eight, which mainly focuses on politics, in 2014 after it invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea. The group became the Group of Seven. Share this -







Ukrainians find warm refuge in Spanish town GUISSONA, Spain — As Ukrainian refugees fleeing bombs and bullets at home fan out across Western Europe, few places they arrive feel as welcoming as a Spanish town known for years as “Little Ukraine.” Even before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine last month, one in seven residents of Guissona was originally from there. Guissona’s population more than doubled to around 7,500 residents, and drew in a lot of immigrant labor, including the Ukrainians, after a regional supermarket chain opened a distribution center nearby two decades ago. More than 3.5 million people have already fled Russia’s war in Ukraine. The refugees are finding safe havens in small communities on the continent where family and friends who went to find work have put down roots. Read the full story. Share this -

Belarus tells Ukrainian diplomats to leave, closes Ukraine's consulate Belarus told Ukraine to cut its diplomatic presence and closed the Ukrainian consulate in Brest on Wednesday, citing “numerous unfriendly actions” by Ukraine. The statement by the Belarus foreign ministry, which also accused Ukrainian officials of interfering in the country’s internal affairs, did not specify how many diplomats it asked to leave. The Ukrainian ambassador and four other diplomats would be allowed to stay, according to Reuters. The consulate was closed due to what Belarus said was a ""lack of staff."" Ukrainians and other people fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine will be allowed to enter Belarus visa free until April 15, the statement said.

Russian foreign minister calls sanctions against Moscow 'unimaginable' Punishing sanctions on Moscow imposed by the U.S. and its allies were “unimaginable,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday. In remarks to staff and students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Lavrov appeared to admit that the strength of the measures taken in response to Russia's war in Ukraine took officials by surprise. “The current scale is very unimaginable, and I didn’t know that the West would even consider this,” he said of the sanctions. He said that “nobody could have foreseen” the freezing of central bank reserves and called it “theft.” He also accused the U.S. of implementing the sanctions because it finds Moscow a barrier to its efforts to create a “unipolar world.” Share this -

Biden heads to Europe amid pressure to ramp up support for Ukraine BRUSSELS — President Joe Biden heads to Europe Wednesday under increasing pressure at home and abroad to do more to aid Ukraine, as he tries to walk a fine line between providing support and deterring Russia while avoiding further escalation. The trip will provide a high-profile leadership moment on the world stage for Biden in one of the greatest periods of European conflict since World War II. But it will also come with pressure to respond to calls to do more for Ukraine from Democrats and Republicans at home, European allies, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. White House officials say a key purpose of the trip, along with discussing how to coordinate their assistance for Ukraine, will be to reassure NATO countries of the U.S.’s support and act as a show of unity against Russia that could deter a potential invasion into NATO territory.

Nine corridors to evacuate residents of besieged cities set to open Nine humanitarian corridors to evacuate Ukrainians trapped in besieged cities and towns will open on Wednesday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. The encircled southern port city of Mariupol, where a devastating humanitarian crisis is unfolding, was included in the list of areas slated for evacuations. Buses left earlier in the day from the nearby city of Berdyansk and headed to Mariupol to pick up evacuees. Several times in past weeks evacuation efforts have been marred by shelling, though thousands have made it out in recent days. Ukrainian and Russian officials agreed to ceasefires in the Luhansk region in the east of the country to evacuate residents from four areas. Around 80 people were evacuated early Wednesday from the city of Rubizhne there, Serhiy Haidai, the region’s governor, wrote on Telegram. “We have agreed on a ‘silence mode’ from 9:00, but be careful,” Haidai said in a separate post. “The shelling of the Russian army during these hours subsides only on the routes of evacuation of people, and not always.” Several towns around the capital Kyiv were also among the areas listed for evacuation.

Putin plans to attend G-20 summit, envoy says Putin intends to attend a G-20 summit in Indonesia later this year, Russia’s ambassador to Indonesia said Wednesday, dismissing suggestions by some G-20 members that Russia could be barred from the group of major economies. Lyudmila Vorobieva, Russia’s ambassador to Indonesia, which holds the rotating G-20 chair, said Putin intended to travel to the Indonesian resort island of Bali for the summit in November. Asked about suggestions Russia could be excluded from the G-20, she said it was a forum to discuss economic issues and not a crisis like Ukraine. “Of course expulsion of Russia from this kind of forum will not help these economic problems to be resolved,” she told a news conference. “On the contrary, without Russia it would be difficult to do so.” U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, asked if Biden would move to push Russia out of the G-20 when he meets allies in Brussels this week, told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: “We believe that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in international institutions and in the international community.” However, the United States plans to consult allies before any other pronouncements, he said.

Russian forces seized Mariupol humanitarian convoy, Zelenskyy says Russian forces captured humanitarian workers near Mariupol after agreeing on a safe route for aid into the besieged city, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday night. Zelenskyy said in a speech that emergency services employees and bus drivers were taken prisoner near the town of Manhush, 12 miles west of Mariupol. It wasn’t clear what happened to them. NBC News couldn’t independently verify Zelenskyy’s account. “For more than a week now we have been trying to organize stable humanitarian corridors for Mariupol residents,” Zelenskyy said. “And almost all our attempts, unfortunately, are disrupted by the Russian occupiers. By shelling or deliberate terror.” Zelenskyy made the comments a day after he refused to surrender the strategically important city, which has seen relentless attacks. He said just over 7,000 residents were rescued from the city Tuesday but that about 100,000 were still trapped ""in inhumane conditions, under full blockade, without food, without water, without medicine, under constant gunfire, constant airstrikes.""

",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/blog/ukraine-russia-war-live-updates-biden-heads-europe-west-plans-n1292727
6,a79094b4-ca9b-492a-b5ad-48c0f65b08e5,"['Nebi Qena', 'Cara Anna Ap']",,"(KYIV, Ukraine) — NATO estimated on Wednesday that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in four weeks of war in Ukraine, where fierce resistance from the country’s defenders has denied Moscow the lightning victory it sought.

By way of comparison, Russia lost about 15,000 troops over 10 years in Afghanistan.

A senior NATO military official said the alliance’s estimate was based on information from Ukrainian authorities, what Russia has released—intentionally or not—and intelligence gathered from open sources. The official spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by NATO.

Ukraine has released little information about its own military losses, and the West has not given an estimate, but President Volodymr Zelenskyy said nearly two weeks ago that about 1,300 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed.

When Russia unleashed its invasion Feb. 24 in Europe’s biggest offensive since World War II, a swift toppling of Ukraine’s government seemed likely. But with Wednesday marking four full weeks of fighting, Moscow is bogged down in a grinding military campaign.

Zelenskyy—who has riveted the world’s attention with ad hoc videos and speeches to legislatures seeking military aid for his country—seized on the anniversary to plead for people around the world to gather in public Thursday to show support for Ukraine, saying the war breaks the heart of “every free person on the planet.”

“Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard,” Zelenskyy said in English during an emotional video address to the nation, recorded in the dark near the presidential offices in Kyiv. “Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters.”

Speaking in Russian, Zelenskyy appealed to Russians “to leave Russia so as not to give your tax money to the war.” Tens of thousands of Russians already have fled their country since the war began, fearing an intensifying crackdown on dissent that has included the arrest of thousands of antiwar protesters and suppression of the media.

Zelenskyy, who will speak to NATO members by video on Thursday, also said he is asking the alliance to provide “effective and unrestricted” support to Ukraine, including any weapons the country needs to fend off the Russian invasion.

With its ground forces slowed or stopped by hit-and-run Ukrainian units armed with Western-supplied weapons, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s troops are bombarding targets from afar, falling back on the tactics they used in reducing cities to rubble in Syria and Chechnya.

A senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday that Russian ground forces appear to be digging in and setting up defensive positions 15 to 20 kilometers (9 to 12 miles) outside Kyiv, the capital, as they make little to no progress toward the city center.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments, said it appears the forces are no longer trying to advance into the city, and in some areas east of Kyiv, Ukrainian troops have pushed Russian soldiers farther away.

Instead, Russian troops appear to be prioritizing the fight in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the Donbas, in what could be an effort to cut off Ukrainian troops and prevent them from moving west to defend other cities, the official said. The U.S. also has seen activity from Russian ships in the Sea of Azov, including what appear to be efforts to send landing ships ashore with supplies, including vehicles, the official said.

In an ominous sign that Moscow might consider using nuclear weapons, a senior Russian official said the country’s nuclear arsenal would help deter the West from intervening in Ukraine.

“The Russian Federation is capable of physically destroying any aggressor or any aggressor group within minutes at any distance,” Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the state aerospace corporation, Roscosmos, said in televised remarks. He noted that Moscow’s nuclear stockpiles include tactical nuclear weapons, designed for use on battlefields, along with far more powerful nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles. Roscosmos oversees missile-building facilities.

U.S. officials long have warned that Russia’s military doctrine envisages an “escalate to deescalate” option of using battlefield nuclear weapons to force the enemy to back down in a situation when Russian forces face imminent defeat. Moscow has denied having such plans.

Rogozin is known for his bluster, and he did not make clear what actions by the West would be seen as meddling, but his comments almost certainly reflect thinking inside the Kremlin. Putin has warned the West that an attempt to introduce a no-fly zone over Ukraine would draw it into a conflict with Russia. Western nations have said they would not create a no-fly zone to protect Ukraine.

As U.S. President Joe Biden left for Europe to meet with key allies about new sanctions against Moscow and more military aid to Ukraine, he warned there is a “real threat” Russia could use chemical weapons.

On the eve of a meeting with Biden, European Union nations signed off on another 500 million euros ($550 million) in military aid for Ukraine.

Zelenskyy appealed to Western countries to stay united in the face of Russia’s efforts to “lobby its interests” with “some partners” to bring them over to its side, and noted during his national address that Ukraine has not received the fighter jets or modern air-defense systems it requested. He said Ukraine also needs tanks and anti-ship systems.

“It has been a month of defending ourselves from attempts to destroy us, wipe us off the face of the earth,” he said.

The U.S. has determined that Russian troops have committed war crimes in Ukraine, and it will work to prosecute the offenders, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. He cited evidence of indiscriminate or deliberate attacks against civilians and the destruction of apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, shopping centers and other sites.

Still, major Russian objectives remain unfulfilled, including in Kyiv, where near-constant shelling and gunfire shook the city Wednesday as the two sides battled for control of multiple suburbs. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said at least 264 civilians have been killed in the capital since the war broke out.

The shelling also claimed the life of another journalist Wednesday. The independent Russian news outlet The Insider said Russian journalist Oksana Baulina had been killed in a Kyiv neighborhood.

In the south, the encircled port city of Mariupol has seen the worst devastation of the war, enduring weeks of bombardment and, now, street-by-street fighting. But Ukrainian forces have prevented its fall, thwarting an apparent bid by Moscow to fully secure a land bridge from Russia to Crimea, seized from Ukraine in 2014.

Zelenskyy said 100,000 civilians remain in the city, which had 430,000 people before the war. Efforts to get desperately needed food and other supplies to those trapped have often failed.

Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the Russians were holding captive 11 bus drivers and four rescue workers along with their vehicles.

In their last update, over a week ago, Mariupol officials said at least 2,300 people had died, but the true toll is probably much higher. Airstrikes in the past week destroyed a theater and an art school where civilians were sheltering.

In the besieged northern city of Chernihiv, Russian forces bombed and destroyed a bridge that was used for aid deliveries and civilian evacuations, regional governor Viacheslav Chaus said.

Kateryna Mytkevich, who arrived in Poland after fleeing Chernihiv, wiped away tears as she spoke about what she had seen. The city is without gas, electricity or running water, said Mytkevich, 39, and entire neighborhoods have been destroyed.

“I don’t understand why we have such a curse,” she said.

Despite plenty of evidence to the contrary, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted the military operation is going “strictly in accordance” with plans.

The NATO official said 30,000 to 40,000 Russian soldiers are estimated to have been killed or wounded. In its last update, Russia said March 2 that nearly 500 soldiers had been killed and almost 1,600 wounded.

Ukraine also claims to have killed six Russian generals. Russia acknowledges just one dead general.

The figures from NATO represent the alliance’s first public estimate of Russian casualties since the war began. The U.S. government has largely declined to provide estimates of Russian or Ukrainian casualties, saying available information is of questionable reliability.

US sees Russia focusing on eastern Ukraine: Official

The United States assesses that Russia is prioritising eastern Ukraine’s Donbas, as opposed to Kyiv, in what could be an effort to build leverage in negotiations and cut off Ukrainian forces in the east from the rest of the country, a senior US defence official has said.

Biden has suggested that he wanted to visit Ukraine but was unable to because of the security situation there.

Ukraine, Russia voice pessimism over talks

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says negotiations with Russia aimed at ending the conflict are “very difficult” and vowed Kyiv would not back down on its demands.

“The Ukrainian delegation has taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands. We insist, first of all, on a ceasefire, security guarantees, and [the] territorial integrity of Ukraine,” Kuleba said.

Meanwhile, Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky as saying the two sides were making little progress on key issues.

Medinsky also said Moscow believed Kyiv was trying to stretch out the negotiations.

Earlier, Turkish broadcaster NTV and others cited President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as saying progress had been made on several key points. Ankara, which enjoys good relations with both Moscow and Kyiv, has been attempting to position itself as a mediator between the two sides.

France summons Russian envoy over controversial cartoon

Russia’s ambassador to France has been summoned to the French Foreign Ministry over a controversial Twitter post.

The Russian embassy in Paris on Thursday posted a picture depicting a body lying on a table called “Europe” with characters representing the US and EU jabbing needles into it. It later deleted the tweet, but also appeared to have liked other tweets highlighting its original post.

“These posts are unacceptable. We made that clear today to the Russian Ambassador,” France’s foreign ministry said in a statement sent to the Reuters news agency.

“We are trying to maintain a demanding channel of dialogue with Russia and these actions are completely inappropriate.”

Switzerland’s government says it has adopted more EU sanctions against Russia after pledging to act in step with the bloc as it moves to financially punish Moscow.

“This means that all measures contained in the EU’s fourth package of sanctions have been implemented,” the country’s cabinet said in a statement.

However, the cabinet said it had decided not to implement the EU measure of March 1 suspending the broadcasting of Russian media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today.

“Despite the fact that these outlets are used to spread targeted propaganda and disinformation by the Russian Federation, the Federal Council is of the opinion that it is more effective to counter untrue and harmful statements with facts instead of preventing them from being broadcast,” it added.

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists detained, disappeared: UN

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or forcibly disappeared by invading Russian forces, the UN has warned, saying that some cases resembled “hostage-taking”.

The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR) said it had documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 22 local Ukrainian officials, 13 of whom had subsequently been released, since Moscow launched its attack.

At least 15 journalists and civil society activists “who vocally opposed the invasion” in several regions had also been taken, Matilda Bogner, OHCHR’s representative in Ukraine, said in a statement.

“This does seem to be a pattern that is occurring in areas that are occupied by the Russian Federation,” she said.

“Forces of the Russian Federation are going specifically to detain, and do not inform relatives and others where they are taking people … That does in some cases appear to be a form of hostage-taking.”

Moscow updates troop death toll, says 1,351 killed

Russia’s army has updated its troop death toll, saying 1,351 soldiers have been killed and 3,825 others wounded since the start of its offensive in Ukraine.

The new toll, announced at a Moscow briefing delivered by senior military officials, came several weeks after Moscow gave its first assessment of losses in the conflict on March 2.

At the time, Russia put the number of its forces killed at 498.

Kyiv says more than 16,000 Russian troops have been killed, while NATO officials have told Al Jazeera they believe the death toll on the Russian side amounts to between 7,000-15,000 personnel.

Russia says first phase of Ukraine ‘operation’ mostly complete

Russia has said the first phase of its “military operation” in Ukraine is mostly complete and that it will now focus on completely “liberating” eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

The Russian defence ministry said Russian-backed separatists now controlled 93 percent of Ukraine’s Luhansk region and 54 percent of the Donetsk region – the two areas that jointly make up the Donbas.

“The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which … makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,” Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, said.

The defence ministry added that it did not rule out storming Ukrainian cities that had been blockaded and said that Russia would react immediately to any attempt to close the airspace over Ukraine – something Kyiv has asked NATO to do, but NATO has resisted.

It said that Moscow’s offensive would continue until Russian forces had completed the tasks that had been set by Russian President Vladimir Putin, without saying what those tasks were.

Russia’s military had considered two options for its operation in Ukraine, one confined to the Donbas and the other on the whole territory of Ukraine, before opting for the latter, according to Rudskoi.

The US and EU have announced a new deal on liquefied natural gas (LNG) aimed at reducing Europe’s reliance on Russian energy imports.

The agreement, unveiled by Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a news conference in Brussels, will see the US supply the bloc with at least 15 billion additional cubic metres of the fuel this year.

“This will replace the LNG supply we currently receive from Russia,” von der Leyen said.

She added the EU will work with member states to also ensure they can receive at least 50 bcm of additional LNG until 2030.

About 10 percent of the EU’s gas needs are met by production within the bloc. Russia typically supplies about 41 percent of the rest of the LNG used by its member states.

The Pentagon official also said an upcoming Pentagon defence strategy document would declare Russia an “acute threat”.

But Russia cannot pose a long-term system challenge to the US, unlike China, he said.

US assesses up to 60% failure rate for some Russian missiles: Report

Three US officials have told the Reuters news agency that Russia is suffering failure rates as high as 60 percent for some of the precision-guided missiles it is using to attack Ukraine.

Reuters said the US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not provide evidence to support the assessment and did not disclose what precisely was driving high missile failure rates.

If true, the agency said, it could help explain why Russia has failed to achieve what most could consider basic objectives since its invasion a month ago, such as neutralizing Ukraine’s air force, despite the apparent strength of its military against Ukraine’s much smaller armed forces.

Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the figures.

Chechen forces ‘liberated’ Mariupol city hall: Kadyrov

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov says that his forces have taken control of the city hall in besieged Mariupol and hoisted the Russian flag.

“The guys are radioing to say that they liberated the building of the Mariupol authorities and put up our flag over it,” Kadyrov said on Telegram.

He also released a video later saying Moscow’s forces “have completely cleared the residential areas in the eastern part of the city”.

The footage showed a group of soldiers raising a flag bearing Kadyrov’s image over a damaged building.

“Soldiers raised a flag over the building of the Levoberejny district prosecutor’s office, the last one to be liberated,” he said.

Al Jazeera could not confirm the claims independently.

‘Catastrophe’ in Chernihiv as Russian troops accused of shelling food stores

A government official in the northern city of Chernihiv has told The Associated Press news agency that a “catastrophe” is unfolding for the local population with Russian troops deliberately targeting food stores in a near-month-long siege.

An air attack this week destroyed a bridge over the Desna River, which was a crucial route to bring in food and other aid from Ukraine-controlled territory further south.

“Humanitarian help, medicines and food used to be delivered into the city via this bridge,” City Council Secretary Olexander Lomako told AP in an audio message.

He estimated that more than 130,000 people are left in the city out of a pre-war population of 285,000, but that Ukraine remains in full control.

Ukraine forces striking ‘high value’ Russian targets: UK

The UK’s defence ministry says Ukrainian forces have launched raids against “high-value targets in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, including a landing ship and ammunition storage depots at Berdyansk”.

In its latest intelligence update, the ministry said such attacks will force the Russian military to “prioritise the defence of their supply chain and deprive them of much-needed resupply for forces”.

“This will reduce Russia’s ability to conduct offensive operations and further damage already dwindling morale,” it added.

Ukraine says Moscow forcibly taking civilians to Russia

Ukraine says Moscow has forcibly taken 402,000 civilians from shattered Ukrainian cities to Russia, where some may be used as “hostages” to pressure Kyiv to give up.

Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine’s ombudsperson, said the figure included 84,000 children.

She said they were being held in primitive conditions with little food and water.

The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated but said they wanted to go to Russia.

Ukraine’s rebel-controlled eastern regions are predominantly Russian-speaking, and many people there have supported close ties to Moscow.

IAEA concerned over shelling of Chernobyl staff town

The UN’s atomic watchdog (IAEA) has expressed “concern” after Ukraine warned of Russian bombardment of the town where the staff working at the Chernobyl nuclear site live.

“Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that Russian forces were shelling Ukrainian checkpoints in the city of Slavutych where many people working at the nearby Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant live, putting them at risk,” the Vienna-based UN agency said in a statement.

Its director-general, Rafael Grossi, said the incident came “just a few days after technical staff at the Chornobyl (plant) were finally able to rotate and go to their homes in Slavutych and rest after working for nearly four weeks without a change of shift”.

Canada to increase oil, gas exports

Canada plans to increase oil and gas exports this year by up to 300,000 barrels per day, the country’s natural resources minister has said, as nations seek to wean themselves off Russian energy supplies.

Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said in a statement that the move – which would amount to an increase of about 5 percent – aims to help Canada’s allies respond to “an energy security crisis” caused by Russia’s ongoing invasion.

“Our European friends and allies need Canada and others to step up,” said Wilkinson.

US Senate delays vote to revoke ‘most-favoured-nation’ trade status for Russia

Legislation removing “most-favoured-nation” trade status for Russia has been delayed in the US Senate at least until next week, after some Republicans raised concerns that its human rights provisions might be too broad.

The bill was blocked despite legislators’ insistence that they wanted to show a united front in supporting the government in Kyiv, a month after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine.

It is expected to pass next week, although the delay stymied efforts by Biden’s fellow Democrats to pass it in time for his meetings on Thursday with allies in Europe.

Russia’s Daniil Medvedev shrugs off Wimbledon ban threat

Tennis star Daniil Medvedev has shrugged off the possibility of being barred from this year’s Wimbledon after the status of Russian players at the tournament was called into question by the UK government.

British Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston told a parliamentary hearing last week the government could require Medvedev to provide assurances he did not support Putin before being allowed to compete at Wimbledon.

“Don’t have any response to Wimbledon,” Medvedev said. “I will need to see what happens next. I try to take it tournament by tournament. I mean, there are always different rules, regulations in order to play or not to play.”

G7 backs ICC probe into war crimes in Ukraine

The G7 countries – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US – have backed the International Criminal Court’s probe into possible war crimes in Ukraine, saying they are “appalled” by Russian attacks on Ukrainian towns and cities.

“We will work together to support the gathering of evidence of war crimes,” the G7 said in a joint statement.

“The siege of Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities, and the denial of humanitarian access by Russian military forces are unacceptable. Russian forces must immediately provide for safe pathways to other parts of Ukraine, as well as humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and other besieged cities.”

Biden renews warnings to China against aiding Russia in Ukraine

Biden has reiterated his warnings to China against coming to Russia’s aid in Ukraine, saying he made clear “the consequences” of such assistance to Chinese President Xi Jinping during a phone call last week.

The US president said Xi understand that China’s economic interests are with the West, not Russia, he said.

“I made no threats, but I pointed out the number of American and foreign corporations who left Russia as a consequence of their barbaric behaviour,” Biden told reporters of his conversation with Xi.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.
