Zelensky has been on a tour of Western governing bodies. He invoked Winston Churchill in a virtual address to the UK parliament. His translator choked up with emotion when he addressed the European Union parliament. Zelensky used the Canadian prime minister’s first name, Justin, to plead for more direct help before the Canadian parliament .

As NATO member countries refuse to get directly involved in the conflict, Zelensky proposed a new international security organization and asked President Joe Biden to be the leader not only of the US, but also of the world. Watch key moments of the speech .

Under siege in Kyiv, his country invaded by Russia and in desperate need of help, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky implored American lawmakers for more — more lethal aid, a no-fly zone over his country and more sanctions on Russians.

As delivered via interpreter

Thank you very much. Madam Speaker, members of the Congress, ladies and gentlemen, Americans, friends, I’m proud to greet you from Ukraine, from our capital city of Kyiv, a city that is under missile and airstrikes from Russian troops every day. But it doesn’t give up, and we have not even thought about it for a second.

Zelensky is speaking to the US Congress from a war zone. Rather than convene in the ornate and formal House chamber, senators and congressional members are gathered in an auditorium in the Capitol complex.

Just like many other cities and communities in our beautiful country which found themselves in the worst war since World War II. I have the honor to greet you on behalf of the Ukrainian people, brave and freedom-loving people who for eight years have been resisting the Russian aggression.

Russia annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014 and fomented a separatist rebellion in the east of the country. Ukraine’s then-President Petro Poroshenko addressed a joint session of Congress in person and asked US lawmakers for more direct aid to stand up to Russia. The Obama administration granted security assistance but not lethal aid. The conflict simmered on, leaving some 14,000 people dead in the years leading up to Russia’s full invasion of Ukraine in February.

Those who give their best sons and daughters to stop this full-scale Russian invasion. Right now the destiny of our country is being decided. The destiny of our people, whether Ukrainians will be free, whether they will be able to preserve their democracy. Russia has attacked not just us, not just our land, not just our cities; it went on a brutal offensive against our values, basic human values. It threw tanks and planes against our freedom, against our right to live freely in our own country choosing our own future.

These words speak directly to the fundamentals of American government — life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the ability of people to choose their government.

Against our desire for happiness, against our national dreams, just like the same dreams you have, you Americans. Just like anyone else in the United States. I remember your national memorial in [Mount] Rushmore, the faces of your prominent presidents, those who laid the foundation of the United States of America as it is today — democracy, independence, freedom and care for everyone, for every person, for everyone who works diligently, who lives honestly, who respects the law.

We in Ukraine want the same for our people. All that is a normal part of your own life. Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Americans, in your great history, you have pages that would allow you to understand Ukrainians, understand us now when you need it right now. When we need you right now.

Here, Zelensky is essentially saying, “Help us and our democracy. Help us emulate you.”

Remember Pearl Harbor. Terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember it. Remember September 11th, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories in battlefields. When innocent people were attacked from air, yes. Just like nobody else expected it, you could not stop it.

December 7, a day that President Franklin D. Roosevelt said would “live in infamy” in an address to Congress. September 11, a day that led the US to ask NATO allies for help. These are also days in which the US was attacked from the sky. Today, Zelensky wants a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Our country experienced the same every day. Right now, at this moment, every night for three weeks now, various Ukrainian cities: Odesa … [names long list of Ukrainian cities], Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people. Russian troops have already fired nearly 1,000 missiles at Ukraine, countless bombs, they use drones to kill us with precision. This is a terror that Europe has not seen for 80 years and we are asking for our life for an answer to this terror from the whole world.

Is this a lot to ask for, to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people? Is this too much to ask? Humanitary, no-fly zone, something that Russia will not be able to terrorize our free cities.

The Biden administration has repeatedly rejected Zelensky’s calls for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine — or transfer fighter jets to Ukraine — arguing it would draw the US into an active war with Russia and is a recipe for World War III. Military experts have questioned whether a no-fly zone would stop the attacks.

If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative. You know what kind of defense systems we need, S-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the battlefield, on the ability to use aircraft, powerful, strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom, our land. Aircrafts that can help Ukraine, help Europe and you know that they exist and you have them but they are on Earth, not in Ukraine — in the Ukrainian sky. They do not defend our people.

Zelensky asks for alternative types of help — direct help that is less than a no-fly zone, including Soviet-made S-300 air defense missile systems, which could be provided by other countries. But Biden has also rejected proposals to give Ukraine US fighter jets and also to give Poland American jets so that country could offload its Soviet-era jets to Ukraine.

I have a dream, these words are known to each of you today. I can say, I have a need. I need to protect our sky. I need your decision, your help, which means exactly the same, the same you feel when you hear the words, “I have a dream.”

Zelensky has spoken to the EU parliament, the UK parliament and the Canadian parliament, each time with a tailored message. Here he invokes statements made by American civil rights hero Martin Luther King Jr., much as he did with famous statements by Churchill before the UK parliament.

Ladies and gentlemen, friends, Ukraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support, for everything that your government and your people have done for us, for weapons and ammunition for training, for finances, for leadership in the free world, which helps us to pressure the aggressor economically.

The US approved $13.6 billion for Ukraine as part of a massive spending bill that was signed into law this week.

I’m grateful to President Biden for his personal involvement, for his sincere commitment to the defense of Ukraine and democracy all over the world. I am grateful to you for the resolution which recognizes all those who commit crimes against Ukraine, against the Ukrainian people as war criminals. However, now, it is true in the darkest time for our country, for the whole Europe, I call on you to do more. New packages of sanctions are needed, constantly, every week until the Russian military machine stops.

Zelensky has repeatedly expressed his gratitude for US and NATO support, while repeatedly calling on the West to supply more aid and apply more pressure on Russia.

Restrictions are needed for everyone on whom this unjust regime is based. We propose that the United States sanctions all politicians in the Russian Federation who remain in their offices and do not cut ties with those who are responsible for the aggression against Ukraine, from state Dumas members to the last official who has lack of moral to break this state terror. All [American companies] must leave Russia from their market, leave their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood. Ladies and gentlemen, members of Congress, please take the lead if you have companies in your district who finance the Russian military machine leaving business in Russia, you should put pressure. I’m asking to make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny that they use to destroy people in Ukraine. The destruction of our country, the destruction of Europe. All American ports should be closed for Russian goods. We’re — peace is more important than income and we have to defend this principle in the whole world.

The severity of sanctions by the US and the West has been nothing short of remarkable. Russia is set to default on foreign loans as soon as this week. But Zelensky wants more to be done. Sanction all Russian politicians, not just specific ones, he argues. Require US companies to leave Russian markets. By saying “peace is more important than income,” Zelensky is suggesting that some things — the defense of democracy and the international rules-based order — are more important than the damage that sanctions will do to the global economy.

We already became part of the anti-war coalition, a big anti-war coalition that unites many countries, dozens of countries, those who reacted in principle to President Putin’s decision to invade our country, but we need to move on and do more. We need to create new tools to respond quickly and stop the war, the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24th. And it would be fair if it ended in a day, that in 24 hours, that evil would be punished immediately. Today the world does not have such tools. The war of the past have prompted our predecessors to create institutions that should protect us from war, but they unfortunately don’t work. We see it, you see it, so we need new ones, new institutions, new alliances and we offer them.

If Russia were to attack a NATO member, NATO allies would be compelled to come to that country’s defense under Article 5 of the organization’s charter. But Ukraine is not a member of the alliance, and Biden and other NATO leaders have said they have no plans to send troops into the country.

We propose to create an association U-24 united for peace, a union of responsible countries that have the strength and consciousness to stop conflicts immediately, provide all the necessary assistance in 24 hours, if necessary, even weapons if necessary, sanctions, humanitarian support, political support, finances, everything you need to keep the peace and quickly save the world, save lives.

This is an interesting idea — a new international agreement that sounds like an alternative to NATO, of which Ukraine is not a member, and the United Nations, where Russia has the ability to veto most things as a permanent member of the Security Council. Zelensky may also be seeking to signal less of a desire for Ukraine to join NATO, a red line for Putin.

In addition, such association, such union would provide assistance to those who are experiencing natural disasters, man-made disasters, who fell victims to humanitarian crisis or epidemic. Remember how difficult it was for the world to do the simplest things, just to give vaccines, vaccines against Covid to save lives, to prevent new strains. The world spent months, years doing things like that much faster, to make sure there are no human losses, no victims.

The world is still very far behind in giving access to Covid-19 vaccines to developing nations. Zelensky also seems to nod to climate change here, which experts say will become the major worldwide threat.

Ladies and gentlemen, Americans, if such alliance would exist today, that is U-24, we would be able to save thousands of lives in our country. In many countries of the world, those who need peace, those who suffer inhumane destruction. I ask you to watch one video, video of what the Russian troops did in our country, in our land. We have to stop it. We must prevent it, preventably destroy every single aggressor who seeks to subjugate other nations.

Please watch the video.

The video is graphic and hard to watch. It shows children killed and wounded. Russian forces have increasingly targeted civilian areas, a violation of international law.

[IN ENGLISH] And in the end, to sum it up, today, today it is not enough to be the leader of the nation. Today takes to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace. Peace in your country doesn’t depend anymore only on you and your people. It depends on those next to you, on those who are strong. Strong doesn’t mean weak. Strong is brave and ready to fight for the life of his citizens and citizens of the world. For human rights, for freedom, for the right to live decently, and to die when your time comes. And not when it’s wanted by someone else. By your neighbor.

Zelensky switches to English here and delivers a direct plea to Biden, the US President who also aspires to be the leader of the free world. What’s happening to people in Ukraine, Zelensky says, affects every democracy.

[IN ENGLISH] Today the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, [inaudible] in the name of the future. That’s why today the American people are helping not just Ukraine, but Europe and the world, to keep the planet alive, to keep justice in history. Now I’m almost 45 years old. Today my age stopped when the heart of more than 100 children stopped beating.

I see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths. And this is my main issue as the leader of my people, great Ukrainians, and as the leader of my nation, I am addressing the President Biden, you are the leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you to be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace.

This is a direct message to Biden, who has tried to make his presidency about defending democracy from autocracies, but has also refused to tempt World War III by doing more for Ukraine.

Thank you.

[IN UKRAINIAN] Glory to Ukraine.

Lawmakers of both parties have said they are wary of a no-fly zone at this time because they think it could pit the US directly against Russia in the skies over Ukraine.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki, meanwhile, told reporters on Tuesday that, despite requests from Zelensky, the White House does not support instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine or supplying the Ukrainian Air Force with new fighter aircraft.

What is a no-fly zone? A no-fly zone is an area where certain aircraft cannot fly for any number of reasons. In the context of a conflict such as the one in Ukraine, it would probably mean a zone in which Russian planes were not allowed to fly, to prevent them from carrying out airstrikes against Ukraine.

NATO has imposed no-fly zones in non-member countries before, including Bosnia and Libya. However, it is always a controversial move because it means getting semi-involved in a conflict without fully committing ground forces.

What would happen if NATO imposed a no-fly zone? The problem with military no-fly zones is that they have to be enforced by military power. If a Russian aircraft flew into a NATO no-fly zone, then NATO forces would have to take action against that aircraft. Those measures could include shooting the plane from the sky. That would, in Russia's eyes, be an act of war by NATO and would likely escalate the conflict.

Why hasn't NATO imposed a no-fly zone? Neither Ukraine nor Russia is a member of NATO. Russia President Vladimir Putin clearly sees NATO as a direct threat to his authority and has recently criticized its expansion toward Russia, using it as justification for his invasion of Ukraine.

As a result, NATO is extremely reluctant to become directly involved in the Ukraine conflict with a rival nuclear power. While it supports Ukraine's resistance and recognizes Putin's actions as an invasion of a sovereign nation, the alliance is simply not prepared to do anything that could be interpreted as a direct act of war on Russia and risk an escalation that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons.

(Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)

US President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""pure thug"" while speaking at a St. Patrick's Day event Thursday.

At the annual Friends of Ireland Luncheon on Capitol Hill, Biden said Putin is a “murderous dictator, a pure thug who is waging an immoral war against the people of Ukraine.”

Biden also said Ireland has “stepped up” in the face of Russian aggression against Ukraine. He said the relationship between Ireland and the United States was “taking on an even more intense and cooperative forum than it ever has because of Ireland's neutrality.”

“Putin is paying a big price for his aggression, and they are part of the reason the cost is going so high,” Biden said.

In their support for sanctions against Russia and for Ukraine, Biden said Ireland was also “paying a big price” for a contribution he called “not minor.”

“Everybody talks about how Germany have stepped up and changed their notions about being more leaning forward, and they have,” Biden said, “and so has Ireland. A neutral country, Ireland has stepped up, and they’re taking the hit for what they're doing.”

The President also referenced his upcoming call with Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday, joking that Xi “remembers everything I’ve said.”

“All kidding aside,” Biden continued, “he does not believe in democracy can be sustained in the 21st century.”

Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin was scheduled to attend the event, but was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Wednesday. Biden, who had just attended a virtual meeting with Martin before heading to Capitol Hill, said the Taoiseach was “really sorry he can’t be here” and that he “feels well” despite the diagnosis.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-17-22/h_27fb721b601fbd0c4abcb15df4fc0811

The $800 million in security assistance comes from the massive spending bill the President signed into law on Tuesday, which includes $13.6 billion total in new aid to Ukraine.

The amount of money the legislation includes for Ukraine increased during last-minute negotiations, growing from the $10 billion the White House had asked for earlier in the month.

The Ukraine aid is attached to an appropriations law that sets spending limits for the federal government for fiscal year 2022, which started in October. Lawmakers have haggled over the full-year appropriations bill for months and have passed three stopgap funding bills to keep the government operating in the meantime.

The text of the 2,741-page bill was released last week and Congress passed the legislation before a Friday deadline, avoiding a government shutdown.

How it's going to be spent:

Military aid: About $6.5 billion, roughly half of the aid package, will go to the US Department of Defense so it can deploy troops to the region and send defense equipment to Ukraine, according to a summary of the bill provided by the House Appropriations Committee.

The US has deployed thousands of troops throughout Europe, both before and during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But putting troops on the ground in Ukraine, which is not a member of NATO, is a line that the US and its Western allies have not been willing to cross.

Humanitarian aid: More than $4 billion will provide humanitarian support for refugees fleeing Ukraine and people displaced within Ukraine, as well as provide emergency food assistance, health care and urgent support for vulnerable communities inside the region, according to a fact sheet provided by the House Appropriations Committee.

Economic aid: The package will provide nearly $1.8 billion to help respond to the economic needs in Ukraine and neighboring countries, such as cybersecurity and energy issues.

The law also calls for $25 million for the US Agency for Global Media, an independent federal agency, to combat disinformation in news broadcasts abroad. Another $120 million will help support local Ukraine activists and journalists and promote accountability for Russian human rights violations.

4,6f71b3d8-ac7e-4074-9e8e-e29ea15f9376,['Kevin Liptak'],2022-03-16 00:00:00,"Washington (CNN) A war-weary Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking from his office in Kyiv, called on the United States to do more to protect his country and people in a dramatic address to American lawmakers Wednesday.

It was an extraordinary appeal to the world's largest military and financial power at a critical moment. Russian forces are intensifying their assault on Ukraine, including its capital, and the future of the conflict could depend on rushing additional American aid to Ukraine's beleaguered troops.

Zelensky, wearing stubble and an army-green T-shirt, was speaking as his team is working to negotiate an end to the violence with Russia, talks that haven't yet produced peace but have shown recent signs of progress.

His speech had an audience well beyond the congressional auditorium, where senators and representatives have been largely united in wanting to do more for Ukraine. It was also aimed squarely at the White House, where President Joe Biden unveiled new assistance later Wednesday.

Speaking directly to the President, in English, Zelensky said as his speech concluded: ""Being the leader of the world means being the leader of peace.""

When it was his time to speak, Biden thanked Zelensky for his speech, calling it a ""convincing and significant"" address.

Here are six takeaways from Zelensky's address to Congress and Biden's response:

A request to close the skies over Ukraine

While Zelensky said he was grateful to Biden for his ""personal involvement"" in confronting Russia, he made clear that Ukraine needs more help from Washington to keep up the fight.

He asked the United States to step up its sanctions against Russia. But the centerpiece of his address was a dramatic appeal for help defending Ukraine from Russian aerial bombardments, including calling for a no-fly zone.

""Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death, for thousands of people,"" he said. ""I need to protect our sky. I need your help.""

Fully aware that a no-fly zone is something neither Biden nor most members of Congress support, he also offered an ""alternative"" — new air defense systems that would protect against strikes and new aircraft for his pilots to use in defending its airspace.

""Aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe, you know that they exist, and you have them. But they are on Earth, not in Ukrainian sky. They do not defend our people,"" Zelensky said.

Biden announces new assistance as he defends US response

Biden inched no closer to agreeing to Zelensky's biggest requests in his remarks. But he did seek to underscore what the United States has done and announced almost $1 billion in new military assistance, which he called ""unprecedented.""

It was an attempt to convey how he was working to help Ukraine defend itself, even as Zelensky and certain US lawmakers press for him to do more.

""Together with our allies and partners, we're going to stay the course,"" Biden said. ""We'll do everything we can to push for and end this tragic, unnecessary war. This is the struggle that pits the appetites of an autocrat against humankind's desire to be free.""

Biden announced new shipments of anti-aircraft and anti-armor systems, small arms and ammunition, along with drones that Ukraine has also been requesting. As Biden was listing each type of equipment and technology, it was evident he wanted to demonstrate exactly what the US was willing to provide short of planes or a no-fly zone.

""The American people are answering President Zelensky's call for more help, more weapons for Ukraine, more tools to fight Russian aggression,"" he said.

Biden ended his speech without making any specific mention of Zelensky's request for a no-fly zone or fighter jets.

Zelensky appeals to Americans with references to Pearl Harbor and 9/11

Appealing for help for his besieged country, Zelensky harkened to two seismic events in American history: the attack on Pearl Harbor that thrust the US into World War II, and the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, which began a new War on Terror.

""Remember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you. Just remember it. Remember September 11th, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories, into battlefields. When innocent people were attacked, attacked from air, just like nobody else expected it, you could not stop it. Our country experiences the same every day. Right now, at this moment, every night for three weeks now,"" he said.

Elsewhere in his address, Zelensky also evoked Mount Rushmore and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I have a dream"" — harkening to a patriotic American vision of democracy at work that appeared designed to appeal to lawmakers' sense of country.

Zelensky has been on a virtual world tour of western legislatures and used similar tactics in each of those speeches as well. When he addressed Britain's Parliament, he referenced both the wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill and William Shakespeare, appealing to the United Kingdom's past to appeal for more help.

When he spoke to Canada's Parliament, he asked his audience to imagine what it would feel like to hear missile strikes at Ottawa's airport.

Zelensky uses his personal connection to US lawmakers to make his case

Zelensky has already spoken to groups of lawmakers in smaller, private settings, and is fully aware there is broader backing there for some of his asks than in the administration.

Many members of Congress have voiced support for providing Ukraine with Soviet-era fighter jets — a proposition the Biden administration has written off for now, citing logistical challenges and the potential of escalation.

In his speech, Zelensky appealed for the lawmakers to step up, aware the direct and dramatic appeal would be difficult to deny.

""In the darkest time for our country, for the whole Europe, I call on you to do more, new packages of sanctions are needed, constantly, every week until the Russian military machine stops,"" he said.

Zelensky has already proven to be effective at swaying American lawmakers. After a Zoom meeting earlier this month in which he appealed for help obtaining MiG fighter jets, Democrats and Republicans both rallied behind the cause — only to see it rejected a few days later by the Pentagon.

Dramatic video shows stark differences in Ukrainian life

Zelensky is a relative newcomer on the political stage; he began as a comedian and television actor. A knowledge of stagecraft is critical in how he addresses the world as his country comes under siege.

A video played toward the end of his speech sought to amplify the emotion of the war, showing images of normal life in Ukraine before the war followed by the stark reality of life there now: bombings, death and fear.

It was the latest example of Zelensky using the power of recorded images to make a global appeal for help. His selfie videos walking through the streets of Kyiv have caused the world to rally around his leadership, and helped to unify a western response in punishing Russia.

Graphic images like the one in his video are rarely shown in public settings on Capitol Hill, further jolting the gathering to attention. The room was completely silent as it played.

Switching into English as he concluded his address, Zelensky punctuated an emotional appeal with words appealing to American global preeminence.

""Today it is not enough to be the leader of the nation. What it takes to be the leader of the world, being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace,"" he said.

Biden warns of 'long and difficult' battle ahead

Biden's short speech could not come close to the emotional impact of Zelensky's, which the US President said he watched from the private White House residence.

But he did attempt to claim a world leader stature after Zelensky directly challenged him to step into the role.

""What's at stake here are the principles that the United States and the united nations across the world stand for,"" Biden said. ""It's about freedom. It's about the right of people to determine their own future.""

Biden underscored the brutality of what is happening on the ground, which was starkly illustrated Wednesday when a theater in Mariupol -- inside of which hundreds of people had been taking shelter -- sustained heavy damage in a bombing.

""These are atrocities,"" the US President said. ""They're an outrage to the world.""

At the same time, even Biden could not say with any certainty that the military assistance he announced to Ukraine would help bring the conflict to a swift end. Instead, he warned the fighting could persist into the future.

""I want to be honest with you,"" he said, ""this could be a long and difficult battle.""

While it supports Ukraine's resistance and recognizes Putin's actions as an invasion of a sovereign nation, the alliance is simply not prepared to do anything that could be interpreted as a direct act of war on Russia and risk an escalation that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons.

Attempts to pull survivors out of the rubble of a destroyed theater in Mariupol, Ukraine, are being hindered by the complete breakdown of social services in the city and the dangers of further Russian attacks, according to the former head of the Donetsk regional administration.

“People are doing everything themselves. My friends went to help, but due to constant shelling, it was not safe. People are clearing away the rubble themselves. There is no rescue operation, because all the services that are supposed to rescue people, to treat them, to bury them, these services no longer exist,"" Sergiy Taruta told Ukrainian television.

Few reports on rescue efforts have emerged since the theater, which was being used as a shelter, was attacked early Wednesday evening.

Taruta said it was his understanding there were about 1,300 people sheltering in the theatre, of whom 130 people had been rescued so far, according to the latest information he had.

Earlier, Taruta said on Facebook that the building’s bomb shelter had remained intact.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-17-22/h_26144c0d3a054eb11a78c1308fee927c

US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's remarks to lawmakers was ""quite remarkable"" and that they're ""grateful"" he was thankful for aid.

She acknowledged his repeated calls for the West to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine but didn't elaborate.

""(We're) grateful that he was grateful to United States for all that we have done and what President Biden has done,"" she said. ""The call for the no-fly zone, but if you can't do that, then some other opportunities and identifying with our own challenges to our democracy. I thought it was quite remarkable, but the film was overwhelming with the children and the brutality of the Russians, it's their war crimes right before our very eyes,"" she added, referencing a video he played of attacks in Ukraine.

She said the House of Representatives is working on legislation in the next couple of days, but she did not elaborate and didn't answer any more questions.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called Zelensky’s address to Congress an “incredibly effective speech” and said “the message to President Biden is that he needs to step up his game.” This largely mirrored reaction from GOP senators after the speech and differed from Democrats who defended Biden’s handling as effective and forward leaning.

GOP Rep. Mike McCaul, a ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, got very emotional about the video that was played during Zelensky’s address, saying, “We need to help Ukraine, give them everything they need to fight this war, and the video we saw was very reminiscent of Nazi Germany. ... And history will judge us. What did you do? What did you do when the bombing started? When the maternity hospitals were bombed and the pregnant women were taken out — blood, children, what did you do?”

“History will judge us if we don't act now and if we don't act strongly,” McCaul said. “This is not a time for partisan rhetoric; this is a time to unify the nation behind Ukraine against one of the most evil forces we have seen since my father's war — and that's World War II, Adolf Hitler.”

Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of GOP leadership, told CNN he is concerned about setting up a no-fly zone.

“I mean, any time you put American pilots and American planes in the sky, with Russian pilots and planes in the sky, you're really taking a chance that we may engage at a level that I don’t think we’re prepared to,” Blunt said.

Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly also raised concerns about imposing a no-fly zone — and he was skeptical of the idea of transferring aircrafts to Ukraine, suggesting it would not be an effective use of resources. He’s open to more sanctions and providing more defense systems such as surface to air missiles. Kelly, who is up for reelection, also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is a “war criminal” and said that US President Joe Biden should “absolutely” call him that. “Call it what is,"" he said.

Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said “much more effective tools” are anti-tanks, anti-aircraft missiles and Stinger missiles.

GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus who stationed in Kyiv during his time as an FBI agent, supports a limited no-fly zone. He said there are other ways to enforce it besides shooting down planes, such as through technology like electro-magnetic pulse and sonar radar.

“We’ve got to support a humanitarian no-fly zone,” said Fitzpatrick. “Otherwise, the only other outcome is slaughtering innocent people.”

GOP Sen. Rick Scott, a member of leadership, went further on a no-fly zone than most in his party, saying in a statement: ""President Biden needs to make a decision TODAY: either give Ukraine access to the planes and anti-aircraft defense systems it needs to defend itself, or enforce a no-fly zone to close Ukrainian skies to Russian attacks.""",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-16-22/h_ba43e1a0241e20cb5ed7a2197c86dacb

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu met his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Lviv on Thursday, one day after his visit to Moscow where he met Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov.

In taped remarks, Çavuşoğlu said: “If an agreement is achieved about the issues that we see a rapprochement about, there is a possibility that two leaders can come together,"" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelensky.

Çavuşoğlu also said his hopes for a ceasefire increased after meeting with both parties, although “it is hard to talk about it when it comes to war.”

He said Ukraine had suggested Turkey and Germany as guarantor countries in a proposed “collective security agreement.""

“In my talks yesterday in Moscow, I saw that the Russian Federation did not have an objection to this and that they could accept such a proposal,” Çavuşoğlu said. He stressed an agreement has to be acceptable for both sides and their people.

Çavuşoğlu also said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke to Putin on Thursday.

According to a statement by Turkey's Directorate of Communications, “Erdoğan reiterated his offer to host Putin and Zelensky in Istanbul or Ankara” during his phone conversation with Putin, saying “consensus on some issues may require talks at leadership level.”

The Turkish president also stressed the need of “assessing the humanitarian situation on ground” and of “humanitarian corridors to operate effectively in both directions.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-17-22/h_b405ba7e7bf6b12e385d5806bf7ce590
