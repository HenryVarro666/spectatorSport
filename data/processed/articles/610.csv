He was released on Wednesday in exchange for nine captured Russian conscripts, according to the head of Ukraine's presidential office.

But the Russian military later conceded some conscripts had been involved in warfare - before being captured by Ukrainian forces.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the alleged kidnapping of the mayor was a ""new stage of terror"" and a bid to bring Melitopol ""to its knees"".

He confirmed Mr Fedorov had been freed in an address on Wednesday night: ""We have finally managed to release the mayor of Melitopol from captivity.

""Our Ukrainian Melitopol, which did not submit and will not submit to the occupiers. Ivan Fedorov is free.

""I talked to him today. The Russian military abducted him on March 11, trying to persuade him to collaborate. But our man withstood. He did not give up. Just as we all endure. You all. Just as we all do not give up. Because we are Ukrainians. And we always protect our own.""

Mr Zelenskyy appealed ""specifically to the conscripts who were thrown into furnace of this war"", telling them: ""Not your war.""

He urged rival forces to ""lay down your weapons"", adding: ""It's better than dying on the battlefield, on our land.

""Every Russian soldier who lays down weapons will get a chance, a chance to survive.""

Reports of Mr Fedorov's alleged kidnapping prompted thousands to protest in the streets of Melitopol, which was seized in Vladimir Putin's invasion.

Melitopol's new mayor, Galina Danilchenko - believed to have been installed by Moscow - on Sunday urged residents to ""adapt to the new reality"".

The city is around 120 miles (190km) west of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine - where a theatre sheltering around 1,000 people was bombed on Wednesday despite the Russian word for ""children"" having been written in giant letters on the ground outside.

Russian troops abducted Mayor Ivan Fedorov five days ago and let him go today.

He was released in exchange for nine Russian conscript soldiers, all 18 or 19 years old, a Ukrainian government spokesperson says, according to the Kyiv Independent.

Speaking on Ukrainian television, a press secretary to Ukraine's president said the Russian conscripts were between 18 and 19 years old.

Following Fedorov's abduction five days ago, residents of Melitopol came out to protest against his abduction.

""Ivan Fedorov was released from Russian captivity...For him, Russia received nine captured soldiers who were born in 2002 and 2003. These are actually children,"" Darya Zarivnaya, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s press aide, said in a televised speech.

The head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, said Wednesday that Fedorov, who was kidnapped by the Russian army on March 11, has been released.

Zelenskyy had requested assistance from the heads of state of various countries for the release of Fedorov.

The Russia-Ukraine war, which started on Feb. 24, has drawn international condemnation, led to financial restrictions on Moscow and spurred an exodus of global firms from Russia.

At least 726 civilians have been killed and 1,174 injured in Ukraine since the beginning of the war, according to the UN, while noting that conditions on the ground make it difficult to verify the true number.

More than 3 million people have also fled to neighboring countries, said the UN refugee agency.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video posted on Telegram early Thursday that he spoke to Mayor Ivan Fedorov after he was freed by Russian forces. Fedorov was released five days after video showed him being kidnapped by Russian soldiers.

“We have finally managed to release the mayor of Melitopol from captivity,” Zelenskyy said, according to the translation included in the video. “Our Ukrainian city of Melitopol, which did not submit and will not submit to the occupiers. Ivan Fedorov is free. I talked to him today. The Russian military abducted him on March 11, trying to persuade him to collaborate. But our man withstood. He did not give up. Just as we all endure.”

Video published in The Guardian showed Russian soldiers taking Fedorov away on Friday.

Ukraine negotiated the mayor’s release by exchanging him for nine captured Russian soldiers, said Daria Zarivna, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s president’s office, according to The Associated Press.

Russia “got nine of its captive soldiers, born in 2002-2003 — practically children — conscripts Russia’s Defense Ministry said weren’t there,” Zarivna said.

Citizens of Melitopol had taken to the streets after the kidnapping to protest.

Russia installed its own “mayor” in Melitopol following Fedorov’s capture. That official, Galina Dalinichenko, called the protests “extremist” and said people should “adjust to the new reality,” according to the Financial Times.

WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING TODAY:

UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council will meet Thursday at the request of six Western nations that sought an open session on Ukraine ahead of an expected vote on a Russian humanitarian resolution that they have sharply criticized for making no mention of Moscow’s war against its smaller neighbor.

“Russia is committing war crimes and targeting civilians. Russia’s illegal war on Ukraine is a threat to us all,” tweeted the U.N. mission of the United Kingdom, one of the six countries that requested the meeting.

Russia circulated a proposed Security Council resolution Tuesday that would demand protection for civilians “in vulnerable situations” in Ukraine and safe passage for humanitarian aid and people seeking to leave the country but without mentioning the war or the parties concerned.

The resolution is expected to be voted on by the council Friday.

LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian and Russian delegations held talks again Wednesday by video.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s adviser Mikhailo Podolyak said Ukraine demanded a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and legal security guarantees for Ukraine from a number of countries.

“This is possible only through direct dialogue” between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, he said on Twitter.

An official in Zelenskyy’s office told The Associated Press the main subject under discussion was whether Russian troops would remain in separatist regions in eastern Ukraine after the war and where the borders would be.

Just before the war, Russia recognized the independence of two regions controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. It also extended the borders of those regions to areas Ukraine had continued to hold, including Mariupol, a port city now under siege.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks, said Ukraine was insisting on the inclusion of one or more Western nuclear powers in the negotiations and on the signing of a legally binding document with security guarantees for Ukraine. In exchange, the official said, Ukraine was ready to discuss a neutral status.

Russia has demanded that NATO pledge never to admit Ukraine to the alliance or station forces there.

PANAMA CITY — Three Panama-flagged ships have been hit by Russian missiles in the Black Sea during Russia's war in Ukraine and one sank, Panamanian authorities said Wednesday.

The crews of the ships “are safe,” Maritime Authority Director Noriel Araúz said.

The ship that sank was the Helt, but Araúz did not say when that occurred. The others hit were the Lord Nelson and Namura Queen. Panamanian officials previously said the Namura Queen, owned by a Japanese company and operated by a firm in the Philippines, was hit in February.

Araúz said 10 Panama-flagged ships were in the Black Sea, including the three hit. Combined they have about 150 crew members of various nationalities who have not been allowed to leave, he said.

“We are in constant communication with the ships ... because we know that the Russian navy is not letting them leave the Black Sea,”Araúz said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said evacuation corridors did not work Wednesday as the Russian military did not stop shelling.

“We are ready to take people out and send humanitarian aid. But we can't expose people to shelling on the road,” he said in a video message posted to Facebook early Thursday.

Zelenksy said residents who previously escaped from the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol are being moved to safer areas.

“We are taking away Mariupol residents who managed to escape to Berdyansk. We are taking them to Zaporizhzhia. In total, more than 6,000 Mariupol residents were transported in one day, more than 2,000 of them are children,"" he said.

However, Zelensky said the Russian military tried to disrupt that movement too, firing on the section of road between Vasylivka and Kamyanske in the Zaporizhzhia region. Five Ukrainians were injured, two of them children, he said.

In the northern city of Chernihiv, Russian forces fired at civilians who were standing in line for bread, killing 10 people, Zelensky added.

Talks continue: The President said if Russia’s war against Ukraine continues, “the mothers of Russia will lose more children than in the Afghan and Chechen wars combined.”

Zelensky said negotiations with Russia are ongoing and that his priorities in the talks are clear: “the end of the war, security guarantees, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country.”

Germany speech: Zelensky is due to address the German Parliament Thursday and said he will “continue to fight for even greater support for Ukraine, for even greater pressure on Russia.” It comes after he told the US Congress ""we need you right now"" in a historic speech that invoked tragedies in American history like the Pearl Harbor attack and 9/11.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-16-22/index.html
