As of early Friday, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense claimed on Twitter that Russia had suffered losses of a total of seven aircraft, six helicopters, more than 30 tanks, and 800 troops. Russia has not announced a figure on the number of casualties it has suffered.

With few exceptions, that’s not because power supplies have been damaged, but because Ukrainian officials have purposely turned out the lights in response to increased Russian air raids. Russia may not have the night vision goggles and infrared systems that allow its infantry to make major advances at night, but it does have both sophisticated aircraft and missile systems that gain an advantage from operating in darkness.

So, like London during the Blitz, Ukrainians are finding their way around a darkened city. Street lights are off, so are the lights on most high rise and public buildings. Cars and pedestrians are both making their way through the darkness, trying to not become targets for Russian forces that are growing ever more frustrated. Ukrainian officials have even asked news crews not to turn on lights when filming broadcasts from Ukrainian cities, so anyone tuning into CNN, MSNBC, or BBC broadcasts in the last few hours has seen … not a whole lot, as broadcasters speak to them out of shadow.

But at least two areas of Ukraine got an early sunrise. Near Kharkiv, a gas pipeline and storage tanks were the target of multiple Russian shells, resulting in a massive eruption of flames. Soon after, an oil depot near Kyiv was turning into a throbbing expanse of flames that could be seen on the horizon in many images and broadcasts overnight. The sound of the explosions at the oil depot rattled windows across the city. It is currently about three hours until dawn in Kyiv, but the fire is still burning at the location of the explosion in nearby Vasilkiv, providing an eerie backdrop for much of the city.

In terms of actual military engagements, it’s unclear that Russia claimed any new territory in the last hours. More fighting is taking place near Kherson, but most of the action appears to be on the south side of the river, leaving the control of that much-traded bridge in doubt. There are also reports of fighting in Starobilsk, north of Luhansk, which could represent more Russian forces pressing in from the East. Official word from the Ukrainian defense ministry is that Russian forces have not advanced, but it’s unclear if that represents ground truth. Meanwhile, leaked intelligence seems to indicate that Russian generals have set a deadline for taking Kyiv by Monday.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/2/26/2082627/-Ukraine-update-It-will-be-hellish-tonight

The reports say that the Kremlin considers the “demilitarisation” of Ukraine as critical to Ukraine being “neutral”. Of course, critics will view that as Putin achieving his goal of bringing Ukraine back under Russian control, in effect making it a satellite state like Belarus.
