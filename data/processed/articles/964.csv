Russia's war in Ukraine is approaching the one-month mark, and its troops' advancement on some key cities, including the capital of Kyiv, appears to have slowed.

So where is this war going? Here are five things to watch out for in coming weeks.

1. Russia could intensify its bombing campaign

Experts are warning that the more Russia takes a hit on the ground, the more likely it is to intensify its aerial bombing campaign and the use of other ""standoff"" weapons that put Russian soldiers in less danger.

There is little reliable information coming out of either Ukraine or Russia on death tolls, but a report in a Russian tabloid on Monday suggested that the Russian side had lost nearly 10,000 soldiers and that another 16,000 had been injured.

The Komsomolskaya Pravda website removed the numbers later in the day, claiming the numbers only appeared in the first place because it had been hacked. CNN could not verify the numbers, but the death toll is closer to what US intelligence agencies have been reporting.

Such losses, if proven to be true, would explain both the stall in ground movement and the uptick in aerial bombing of key cities and other standoff attacks.

2. While there's focus on Kyiv, Russia may try to encircle Ukrainian fighters in the east

There is much talk about the Russian war effort stalling, but whether or not that's true comes down to what Moscow's objectives were in the first place.

It's likely that Russia is, at the very least, trying to absorb parts of eastern Ukraine. Areas like Donetsk and Luhansk, which make up the Donbas region, have been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, and while Russia's ambitions may stretch beyond Donbas, it's still likely a central focus, experts say.

""The Southern Military District -- in Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol, Berdyansk, Melitopol -- these are the best troops in the Russian army. And they always work. They're designed to fight NATO,"" Sam Cranny-Evans, a research analyst with the Royal United Services Institute, told CNN.

3. There will be more talk about talks

One scenario is that the Ukraine war could become a protracted conflict. It's likely that Russia has lost a significant number of soldiers, weapons and equipment in the war, and while it has engaged in long-running conflicts in the past, it won't want to leave this one with its military totally destroyed.

""The negotiations are the one area where things are looking a little promising because both Russia and Ukraine have said in the last week that they're moving towards an actual substantive discussion, instead of Russia just laying down an ultimatum,"" Keir Giles, a Russian expert at the UK-based think tank Chatham House, told CNN.

Russian officials have said that their demands include Ukraine dropping its pitch to join NATO and to demilitarize and adopt a ""neutral"" status, like Austria and Sweden have. But the conditions for what that means for Ukraine would have to be negotiated.

4. There could be wholesale ""deportations"" of Ukrainians into Russia. That's worrying

Russia has been telling residents of the southern city of Mariupol to leave as it carries on an aggressive aerial bombardment that has torn the city to pieces. Its forces have opened what they call ""humanitarian corridors"" to allow civilians to flee, but tens of thousands of them have been transported to Russia.

Russian state media organization RIA Novosti reported that nearly 60,000 residents of Mariupol had reached Russian territory ""in complete safety."" Russian media has shown lines of vehicles apparently heading east to the border, some 25 miles (40 kilometers) from Mariupol.

But Mariupol council accused Russia of forcing residents to go to Russia against their will.

Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko has said that ""what the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people.""

5. Millions more Ukrainians could flee, leaving a nation in pieces

The fate of the war is one thing, but the fate of Ukraine is another.

Already, more than 3.5 million Ukrainians have left the country. Most are women and children, meaning families are also being torn apart. The war has triggered the biggest movement of refugees Europe has seen since World War II. Those numbers are increasing at a rate of around 100,000 people a day.

If you include the number of people internally displaced, 10 million Ukrainians have now left their homes. That's nearly a quarter of the country's population.

1,a25f830b-814d-4a47-b06d-3b73878a73fa,[],,"LVIV, Ukraine — Speaking on the eve of the NATO summit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy callson the alliance to provide “effective and unrestricted” support to Ukraine, including any weapons the country needs to fend off the Russian invasion.

“We ask that the alliance declare that it will fully assist Ukraine to win this war, clear our territory of the invaders and restore peace in Ukraine,” he says during his nightly video address to the nation.

Zelenskyy will speak to the NATO summit by video, the president’s office says.

He appeals to Western countries to stay united in the face what he says are Russia’s efforts to “lobby its interests” with “some partners” to bring them over to its side.

“We will see who is a friend, who is a partner and who has sold out and betrayed us,” he says in an emotional speech. “Together we should not allow Russia to break anyone in NATO, the EU or G-7, to break them and drag them to the side of war.”

Zelenskyy notes that Ukrainian skies are still not closed to Russian aircraft and missiles and that Ukraine hasn’t received the fighter jets or modern air-defense systems it requested. He says Ukraine also needs tanks and anti-ship systems.

“It has been a month of defending ourselves from attempts to destroy us, wipe us off the face of the earth,” he said. “We have lasted six times longer than the enemy had planned … but the Russian troops are destroying our cities, killing civilians indiscriminately, raping women, kidnapping children, shooting refugees, capturing aid columns and looting.”

Switching to Russian, Zelenskyy appealed to Russians “to leave Russia so as not to give your tax money to the war.” Tens of thousands of Russians already have fled Russia since the war began, fearing the intensifying crackdown at home.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-23-2022/

Follow our live news updates on the Russia-Ukraine war.

BRUSSELS — President Biden and leaders of more than 30 nations convened Thursday to demonstrate united opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, announcing new economic sanctions, aid for refugees, deployment of additional forces to Eastern Europe and grim preparations in case Russia uses chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.

But the historic gathering of world leaders in a series of three summits on Thursday underscored how the United States and its allies have in some ways reached their self-imposed limits in crafting a united global response to the largest European conflict in more than a half-century. While they are sharpening the tools they are using against Russia, they appear to have few new ones to reach for.

Mr. Biden and the allies have moved with unexpected speed and authority over the past four weeks, rallying much of the world against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

And yet, the sense of stalemate on the battlefield is now also felt in the halls of diplomacy, where taking dramatic new steps to counter Mr. Putin’s aggression is proving difficult. Europeans have said they are not willing to bear the consequences of new limits on the Russian energy that they depend on. And Mr. Biden has said he is not willing to commit troops to Ukraine and risk going to war against Russia.

As the allied leaders met in Brussels, the Ukrainian military, entering the second week of a counteroffensive, claimed on Thursday to have destroyed a Russian military landing ship in the southern port of Berdyansk. In the embattled towns around the capital, Kyiv, intense fighting had set so many fires on Thursday that the city was shrouded in a ghostly haze of white smoke.

Mr. Biden said the United States would accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and he and his counterparts announced a new round of weapons shipments for Ukraine, but not the fighter jets that President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for.

They expressed in one voice their “resolve to counter Russia’s attempts to destroy the foundations of international security and stability.” But they again declined to enforce a no-fly zone in the skies over Ukraine, which would mean readiness to shoot down Russian planes.

They vowed to tighten sanctions on Russia, but the Europeans stopped short of blocking imports of Russian oil and gas, as the United States has done. Europe is hugely dependent on Russian energy, paying Mr. Putin the vast revenues needed to support his military — and giving him the power to wreak havoc on Europe by disrupting supplies.

“I think we’re seeing a coordinated divergence between the European Union and the United States,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group. “There’s no rupture or even a split. Rather, there is an agreement that the U.S. will go more aggressively than the E.U. because they can afford to do so.”

Speaking to reporters Thursday evening, Mr. Biden said that he had requested the emergency meetings — with leaders of NATO, the European Union and the Group of 7 industrialized nations — to show Mr. Putin that the allies will not “crack” in their determination to keep economic pressure on Russia over days, weeks, months and more.

“We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united,” he said, adding that he favors ejecting Russia from the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations.

For Mr. Zelensky, though, none of it was enough. He has become more pointed in his criticism of Western restraint on military aid as Russian forces have savaged Ukrainian cities and towns, especially in the south.

Speaking by video to NATO leaders behind closed doors, Mr. Zelensky thanked them for their support but chided them for not doing more. He described his battered country, which is not a NATO member, as trapped “in the ‘gray zone’ between the West and Russia,” according to a transcript released by the Ukrainian government.

“On Feb. 24, I addressed you with a perfectly clear, logical request to help close our skies,” he said of his request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to keep Russian planes away. “In any format. Protect our people from Russian bombs and missiles. We did not hear a clear answer.”

“And you see the consequences today,” he added a moment later. “How many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed?”

He repeated his appeal for warplanes, though the White House and the Pentagon have said that supplying them could give Russia a pretext for drawing NATO into a direct conflict. “You have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven’t been given any yet,” Mr. Zelensky said. “To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance — without restrictions.”

For NATO leaders, the high stakes of their meeting were evident in the joint statement issued at its conclusion. The 72-year-old alliance warned Russia against deploying “chemical, biological and nuclear weapons” in Ukraine, signaling a growing concern that Mr. Putin is willing to use them to advance his aggression or to falsely implicate Ukraine’s government.

Mr. Biden was cautious Thursday in his response to questions about the warning. He declined to say whether the United States or NATO would respond militarily if Russia used chemical weapons, which are banned by international treaty.

“We would respond if he uses it,” Mr. Biden said. “The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.”

But in warning about the threat from weapons of mass destruction, NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the organization was “enhancing allies’ preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological and nuclear threats.” It will provide detection equipment, protection and medical support to Ukraine, he said, along with training for decontamination and crisis management to deal with the impact of any use of weapons of mass destruction.

The alliance’s top military commander, Gen. Tod D. Wolters, “has activated NATO’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense elements,” Mr. Stoltenberg added, placing on increased alert NATO teams that specialize in detecting and responding to contamination after a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack. Member nations are taking similar steps.

Mr. Stoltenberg noted that the use of such weapons inside Ukraine could contaminate neighboring NATO countries.

“Many people fear that Russia will use such weapons and accuse Ukraine of doing it, so it is important to precisely determine who, where and when did it so there’s no ambiguity,” said Gustav Gressel, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The United States hit Russia with a new round of sanctions on Thursday, targeting more than 300 members of its Parliament and dozens of defense companies, while moving to restrict Russia’s ability to use gold reserves to prop up its currency. It also imposed sanctions on Herman Gref, a Putin ally and the president and chairman of Sberbank, one of Russia’s largest banks; the bank itself was sanctioned last month.

The economic actions, which came in conjunction with new sanctions from Western allies, were the latest attempt to inflict economic pain on Mr. Putin. The United States also moved to curtail Russia’s ability to evade existing restrictions on its central bank and major financial institutions, responding to concerns that Russia was finding ways to stabilize the ruble and rebuild its foreign currency reserves.

The Treasury Department is taking aim at alternative assets that Russia could use to support its economy. It issued new guidance on Thursday to make clear that transactions involving Russia’s $130 billion of gold reserves were also subject to U.S. sanctions. Russia built up its gold war chest in recent years to help blunt the impact of earlier sanctions by using the precious metal to buy currency or secure loans.

The U.S. is working to close that loophole by threatening penalties for anyone who facilitates such transactions.

Mr. Biden and European Union leaders are expected to announce an agreement to provide significant amounts of American liquefied natural gas to Europe this year, according to two European diplomats. They said the shipments could limit Europe’s reliance on Russian energy in the near term, and boost confidence in its ability to become less dependent over time.

“The question of course isn’t whether Europe has enough oil and gas for right now, but what happens next winter,” said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

In addition to accepting 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, Mr. Biden announced that the United States would donate $1 billion to help European countries deal with the surge of people fleeing Russia’s invasion, White House officials said on Thursday.

A senior administration official said special efforts were being made to welcome Ukrainians who have family members in the United States.

An estimated four million Ukrainians have poured into Poland and other countries as Mr. Putin’s forces have bombarded civilian areas across Ukraine. Mr. Biden’s commitment would significantly increase the United States’ role in dealing with the unfolding humanitarian crisis.

On the battlefields, Ukrainian fighters have had some success this week in pushing Moscow’s much larger forces farther away from Kyiv and other cities, according to Western intelligence agencies, even as the bloody siege gripping the port of Mariupol has tightened. But many Ukrainian claims of gains have been impossible to verify, and brutal street fighting still echoes through some towns that Ukrainian forces claim to have recaptured.

Russia did not immediately comment on Ukraine’s claim to have destroyed a warship in Berdyansk, whose port Moscow has used to funnel reinforcements to Mariupol and across Ukraine’s eastern front. But British and U.S. officials confirmed that it was a strike by Ukrainian forces, and videos and photos reviewed by The New York Times confirmed that a Russian ship was ablaze in the port, and showed smoke rising from others.

“The destroyed ship in Berdyansk could carry up to 20 tanks, 45 armored personnel carriers and 400 paratroopers,” the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, Anna Malyar, said in a statement on Thursday. “This is a huge target that was hit by our military.”

The United Nations says that the war has forced more than 10 million Ukrainians, about one-fourth of the population, from their homes, including the “internally displaced” who have fled to safer parts of the country — Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II. The U.N. children’s agency reported on Thursday that they include 4.3 million children, more than half the children in Ukraine.

On Friday, Mr. Biden is expected to travel to Poland, in part to witness the surge of people taking refuge there. In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Biden hinted that he might travel to the border with Ukraine — something that officials have been unwilling to confirm.

“I’m not supposed to say, but anyway,” he said. “I hope I get to see a lot of people.”

IMI is aware of at least six cases of Ukrainian journalists being taken hostage and ill-treated by Russian forces. The occupiers fired into 10 TV towers, which are civilian targets, causing the complete or temporary disappearance of television and radio broadcasting in eight regions of Ukraine. In addition, at least 70 regional media outlets were forced to shut down due to threats from the Russian occupiers, seizure of newsrooms, inability to work under temporary occupation, lack of opportunities for printing and distribution, and so on.

During the month since Russia's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, five journalists in Kyiv and its suburbs have been killed in the line of duty. In particular, these are:

Journalists came under Russian fire mainly in Kyiv and Zaporizhzhya. Hromadske journalist Victoria Roshchina came under Russian fire in Zaporizhzhya. Two Czech Voxpot journalists, Maida Slamova and Vojtech Bogach, were also shelled by Russian troops. In addition, TSN, ICTV's Fakty and Nastoyaschego Vremya TV crews came under Russian fire in the Kyiv region.

IMI has recorded at least six attacks with the capture and abduction of journalists by the Russian occupiers. Four of these cases took place in the temporarily occupied territories - in Melitopol, Zaporizhzhya Oblast (kidnapping of journalists and the publisher of the newspaper Melitopolski Vedomosti, hostage-taking of the father of RIA-Melitopol journalist) and Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson Region (Oleg Baturyn). Also in Zaporizhzhya region, Hromadske journalist Victoria Roshchyna was taken prisoner by Russian FSB.

The occupiers fired on 10 TV towers in eight regions of Ukraine: in Melitopol (Zaporizhzhya region), Kyiv and the village of Vynarivka (Kyiv region), Kharkiv (twice hit the TV tower), Rivne, Vinnytsia, Korosten (Zhytomyr region), Lysychansk (Luhansk region), Bilopillya (Sumy region). As a result of Russian air strikes, Ukrainian broadcasting has completely or partially disappeared in these regions.

In addition, the occupiers seized Ukrainian media outlets and switched on Russian channels. In particular, the Russian occupiers forcibly shut down Kherson and Melitopol from Ukrainian broadcasting, and the occupiers mined the UA:Public broadcasting corporation building in Kherson.

IMI has also recorded numerous DDoS attacks on Ukrainian online media and NGOS sites covering Russia's war against Ukraine. Media sites were hacked, their news changed, there were posted Russian symbols or calls to surrender. In particular, the sites of the UA:Suspilne, NV, Channel 5, Babel, Lutsk's Konkurent website, Poltava Wave publication, Kherson newspaper Novyi Den, the financial publication Minfin.com.ua, Kherson edition MOST, the website Espresso TV channel, etc., were under attack. In addition, IMI recorded fishing attacks on Ukrainian newsrooms and journalists.

Russian crimes against journalists and media have been recorded in 14 regions of Ukraine. Most crimes were committed by Russia in Kyiv and the Kyiv region (murders, injuries, disappearances, abductions, shelling of journalists, threats, cybercrimes). On the second place - Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions, where some cities are temporary occupied by the Russian army - there were cases of abductions, attacks on journalists, threats, cybercrimes, seizure of media outlets and shutdowns of Ukrainian broadcasting.

Extractions and abductions of journalists – 6

1/ Russian troops abducted and tortured fixeur for French Radio France

05.03.2022

On 5 March, Russian troops abducted Nikita (his name is changed for his safety) in a village in central Ukraine, tortured him and held in captivity for nine days.

The Reporters without Borders (RSF) reported it on 21st of March, after having communicated to fixer as he was set free.

ON March 8th, RSF was alerted by Radio France about disappearance and mobilized to search for him.

As Nikita told, he was beaten, he felt pieces of his teeth in his mouth, he was tortured with electric shocks, they held him in a cave with floor filled with freezing water, he was interrogated, deprived of food for 48 hours. Also they threw him into a ditch, next to a dead dog, and subjected him to a mock execution: a soldier pretended that he wanted to check that his gun worked and fired a shot that grazed Nikita's head. Then they took him to the forest, tied him to a tree and interrogated for five days long like that. Then they set him freee. The doctor who examined him found hematomas on his head and body, a swelling of the right leg, and numbness of the limbs that could be the result of electric shocks. Noting that Nikita’s injuries were inflicted by the Russian army, the doctor went so far as to conclude that he had sustained “criminal trauma.” Nikita is now recovering. His family was able to escape.

RSF noted the fixer’s testimony was checked in conversation to other captive who was set free together wth Nikita, his relatives, journalists for Radio France, whom Nikita worked for. RSF is going to pass this account to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) , as a follow-up to the two complaints that it has already filed the prosecutor on 4 and 16 March.

“Nikita has given us a chilling testimony that confirms the intensity of the war crimes perpetrated by the Russian army against journalists,” RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire said. “Passing his testimony on to the ICC prosecutor is the least we can do for this courageous young fixer.”

RSF cited the testimony Nikita gave:

On 5 March, Nikita accompanied a visiting Radio France crew on a reporting trip in the centre of the country, not far from the village where his family had sought refuge. At the hotel where they stayed, he learned that the road to his family’s village was open. As the bombardments were intense in the region, he decided to make a quick trip to see if his family was still there and to evacuate them. He borrowed the crew’s car after removing all the equipment. He had to cross three villages to reach his destination.

Nikita was ambushed by a Russian reconnaissance unit on the edge of a roadside forest while driving with a “Press” sign displayed on the front of the car. He recounts between 30 and 40 shots being fired to his car by automatic weapons. Lying on his side, he accelerated with the aim of getting away but hit a tree. Saved by his airbag, he shouted that he was a civilian, showed his hands to prove that he was unarmed and got out of the car. The soldiers – he counted six of them, each with a white band fixed around a leg – seized him, threw him to the ground, searched him and beat him. He kept shouting that he was a civilian but they seemed to think he was a soldier acting as a scout to guide artillery fire.

After pulling his cap over his eyes, the soldiers took Nikita to a house a few minutes’ walk away. Searching his phone, they found information related to his work as a fixer – about looking for bulletproof vests and plotting routes – that made them suspicious. They pulled him from the house, slammed him up against an outside wall, pulled up his cap, brushed his eye with a knife blade, ran it down his cheek, and threatened to cut his face. He explained that he was a fixer and interpreter for foreign journalists, but they hit him repeatedly with automatic rifle butts, on the face and body. Nikita felt pieces of teeth in his mouth and coughed up blood. The soldiers threw him into a ditch, next to a dead dog, and subjected him to a mock execution : a soldier pretended that he wanted to check that his gun worked and fired a shot that grazed Nikita's head.

The soldiers then took him to their camp in the forest about ten minutes' walk away. With his cap pulled over his eyes again, Nikita could not see but from what he heard the camp seemed to consist of more than 100 soldiers, armoured vehicles and artillery. They tied him to a tree, stole his wedding ring, and removed his shoes. That afternoon, the soldiers beat Nikita again with rifle butts and steel bars on his legs. He lost consciousness several times. He said the soldiers seemed to be doing this for amusement.

Blindfolded, half-stunned, Nikita was moved and tied to another tree, and later to yet another one. He spent nearly three days in the forest, tied with his hands behind his back to trees. On 6 March, he was interrogated by a soldier he understands to be a Colonel. Nikita was asked about his activities. He spent another two days tied up in the forest. They stopped beating him, and other civilians were tied next to him. One of them, who was later released at the same time as Nikita, was contacted by RSF and helped to corroborate his account.

Nikita, this other prisoner and a third one were taken in an armoured car on 8 March to a place about 40 minutes away. On arrival, soldiers pulled him out of the vehicle, threw him to the ground, a soldier sat on his back and he was asked the same questions as in the forest. The soldiers thought he was a spy who was using his job as a fixer as a cover.

A soldier rolled Nikita’s right trouser up to the knee and another gave him electric shocks. With his face pressed to the ground, Nikita was unable to see what instrument was used to administer the electric shocks, but he counted three or four shocks, each lasting five to ten seconds. The pain was such that every second felt like an eternity. The other two civilians were also tortured. The one RSF contacted said that a bag was put over his head to prevent him from breathing, and that he was beaten very violently.

The soldiers forced Nikita to write and sign a letter in which he declared his support for the Russian army and the invasion of Ukraine. He and the other two civilians were then taken – tied and blindfolded – to the basement of a house whose floor was filled with water. They were left there for two days until, after begging their guards to take them to a less cold place, they were finally moved. On 10 March, they were taken to the basement of another house, where they were joined by another prisoner, a former senior Ukrainian civil servant.

In this house, the four prisoners are interrogated by a different kind of soldier. Nikita was only able to see their legs and boots but this was enough for him to realise they were not members of combat units. Their clean, polished boots and ironed trousers suggested they might be FSB or GRU members.

On 12 March, the prisoners were told they would be released the next day. And on the 13th they were indeed driven away. Nikita was released in a forest after an hour’s drive. He thought they were going to execute him and he ran. But he heard no shots and reached a road. After being stopped by other Russian soldiers on the road, he feared he was going to be kidnapped again. But he managed to get into a car of Ukrainian civilians. “If you don't take him,” a soldier told the reluctant civilians, “we'll shoot him on the spot.""

Nikita still has bruises all over his body, a swollen leg and difficulty moving his hands as a result of the electric shocks. The doctor who examined him found hematomas on his head and body, a swelling of the right leg, and numbness of the limbs that could be the result of electric shocks. Noting that Nikita’s injuries were inflicted by the Russian army, the doctor went so far as to conclude that he had sustained “criminal trauma.” Nikita is now recovering. His family was able to escape.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Informational Defence of Ukraine provides a daily review of the military-political situation in Ukraine, morning of March 22nd, based on an analysis of open sources.

1. The russian occupiers have not achieved success in any of the operational areas and have sustained heavy losses as a result of counterattacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

According to the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, the situation is stable in most operational areas, and there are fights of local significance. The enemy is concentrating forces and means in certain areas to resume an attempt to carry out inadequate actions and attacks.

In the Donetsk direction, the enemy is shelling and trying to attack Mariupol. The invaders conduct fire raids along the entire line. The enemy tried to break through the defences of the positions of our troops in the Avdiivka direction. They were unsuccessful, sustained heavy losses and retreated.

Defenders of Mariupol destroyed the patrol boat “Raptor” and the electronic warfare complex “Leer-3”.

During the day, the servicemen of the Allied Forces successfully repulsed 13 enemy attacks. Ukrainian defenders destroyed: 300 servicemen, 14 tanks, 8 infantry fighting vehicles, 2 MT-LB, 3 artillery systems, and 4 cars.

Near Kyiv, thanks to the heroic actions of our defenders, the state flag of Ukraine was raised over the city of Makarov, the enemy was repulsed. Trying to attack in the direction of Brovary, the enemy sustained heavy losses and was stopped.

The occupiers continue to make significant efforts to establish control over the city of Izium, and troops are being dispersed in the area. The enemy is trying to strengthen the group, forming a line of fortifications.

Over the past 24 hours, the units of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Air Defence of the Land Forces have hit more than nine enemy air targets. These are 1 plane, 6 UAVs and 2 helicopters, the number of missiles shot down is being assessed/verified.

Since the beginning of russia's full-scale war, The Armed Forces of Ukraine have killed about 15,000 russian servicemen (you can see on the diagram: 52,9% BTRs, 41,5% tanks, 15% artillery, 50,4% helicopters, 29,4% aircrafts, 4% ships).

According to the Minister of Defence of Ukraine Oleksii Reznikov, “the Kremlin no longer knows how to explain what is happening. After all, during these days they buried more soldiers in the regions of russia than officially admitted losses. Lies no longer help them, but the truth scares them.”

russian soldiers are demoralized and surrendered en masse. The Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrskyi, in particular, reported cases of captured of russian units and equipment – all under security guarantees.

The General Staff reports a reduction in the intensity of the use of enemy manned aircraft to assess the effectiveness of the results of missile and bomb strikes. On the eve of March 20th, the Air Forces of Ukraine reported that the main prey of Ukraine 's air defence was the UAV.

According to some US officials (source - WSJ), russian president putin has adjusted his tactics regarding the war in Ukraine, as the fighting has lasted more than three weeks: he no longer aims to take the capital and wants to force Kyiv to surrender southern and eastern territories.

russia wants to secure a “land bridge” between the western part of Russia and the Crimean peninsula, as well as expand its control over the Donbas area. The russian army will also continue shelling Ukrainian cities, hoping that this will force Volodymyr Zelenskyy to agree to russia's demands, including Ukraine's neutral status.

If putin's demands for territory and neutrality are rejected, he is expected to try to keep all the occupied territories and continue the war. He appears to use siege tactics. This means weeks, and possibly months, of missile and artillery attacks by the russian armed forces.

However, the UK Ministry of Defence claims that Kyiv remains a priority for russia, and they expect that russia will resume attempts to surround the city in the coming weeks.

Another wave of mobilization is taking place in the temporarily occupied territories. In particular, in the Donetsk region, in order to increase the number of potential ""conscripts"", the occupiers increase the age limit for “conscripts - from 55 to 65 years.” In the occupied territories of the Luhansk region, the students are actively involved in the ranks of the occupying army.

2. The russian occupiers continue to violate international humanitarian law.

The enemy continues to insidiously destroy the infrastructure in the captured cities, launch missile and bomb attacks on peaceful neighborhoods in Ukrainian cities and villages, rob, kidnap and take hostage Ukrainian civilians. This is a depletion tactic designed to break the resistance and spirit of the Ukrainian people and its Armed Forces.

According to Roman Prymush, Deputy Head of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, the vast majority (90%) of enemy shelling falls on civilian infrastructure.

According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), russia's war against Ukraine has forced 3.5 million people to leave the country in less than 25 days of war in search of security, protection, and assistance.

115 children were killed and more than 148 were injured in the armed aggression of the russian federation in Ukraine.

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, on March 19th, the russian forces illegally removed 2,389 children from the temporarily occupied territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to the territory of russia. The forcible transfer of civilians to the territory of the aggressor, including children, demonstrates the signs of abduction. Such actions are a gross violation of international law, in particular international humanitarian law.

According to the State Emergency Service, 21 rescuers have been killed and 47 injured since the beginning of the war in Ukraine due to shelling by russian troops. The shelling of Ukrainian rescuers during their rescue operations is a violation of the Geneva Convention and will be the subject of international courts.

The enemy continues to attack the capital of Ukraine - Kyiv. On the evening of March 20th, 2022, the armed forces of the russian federation, using weapons of war prohibited by international law, launched a rocket attack on the Podilskyi district of the capital, killing 8 people. As a result of night rocket fire by russian troops in the Podilskyi district of Kyiv, a shopping center burned down, 6 residential buildings were damaged, three of them are now uninhabitable.

In general, according to the Kyiv City Military Administration, the russians and the occupiers damaged more than 70 residential buildings in the capital with rockets and shelling.

In the afternoon on March 21st, the russian invaders again fired at residential quarters of Mykolaiiv.

Because of shelling by the russian invaders for the last days in the Donetsk region, 3 people were lost and 5 wounded.

In the Luhansk region, invaders damaged 25 buildings on March 21st, including a children's hospital in Severodonetsk, and caused 14 fires.

Avdiivka and its territories were damaged as a result of russian air and artillery strikes, at least one person was killed and two civilians were injured.

Morning of March 21st, Odesa was shelled by naval artillery. According to the speaker of the operational headquarters of the Odesa regional military administration, Serhii Bratchuk, the russian troops are affecting psychological stress on Ukrainian soldiers. However, in response, the Ukrainian military lined up an enemy ship.

A former prisoner of several concentration camps, Borys Romanchenko, who survived in the Nazi camps of Buchenwald, Peenemuende, Dora and Bergen-Belsen, died as a result of a shell that hit his building in Kharkiv.

The russian occupiers continue to kidnap local community leaders - on March 21st, the head of the village of Tsyrkuni, near Kharkiv, Mykola Sikalenko, was abducted from his home.

In the Kherson region, the russian occupiers kidnapped Beryslav Mayor Oleksandr Shapovalov and another local activist. They have been in captivity for three days.
