General Assembly on the situation between Russia and Ukraine, at the United Nations Headquarters in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., February 23, 2022. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri

UNITED NATIONS, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine appealed to the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday to stop Russia's ""aggressive plans,"" while Russia said it could not ignore ""the blatant genocide"" of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine and disparaged U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

Guterres and the United States have dismissed Moscow's claims of genocide.

The General Assembly held its annual meeting on Ukraine, which coincided with increasing tensions over U.S. accusations that Russia has deployed more than 150,000 troops near Ukraine's borders and is ready to invade. Russia has denied it wants to invade Ukraine and accuses Washington and allies of hysteria.

Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of two Moscow-backed separatist regions of eastern Ukraine this week and has ordered the deployment of Russian troops there to ""keep the peace."" read more Washington and its allies responded with a series of sanctions.

Guterres told the 193-member General Assembly that an expanded conflict in Ukraine ""could see a scale and severity of need unseen for many years."" He called for a ceasefire and return to dialogue.

While the General Assembly will not take any action on Wednesday, the meeting offers dozens of countries a chance to air their views, a move the United States and others hope will show that Russia is internationally isolated over its moves on Ukraine.

""Now is the time to get off the sidelines. Let us together, show Russia that it is isolated and alone in its aggressive actions,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the General Assembly.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said ""no one will be able to sit out this crisis"" if Putin makes the situation worse.

""Active diplomacy, strong political messages, tough economic sanctions and strengthening Ukraine can still force Moscow to abandon aggressive plans,"" he said.

'WAR OF CHOICE'

Washington has dismissed Russia's justification for deploying troops to the separatist regions as ""nonsense,"" and Guterres said they would not be ""peacekeepers.""

""Given the blatant genocide and the trampling on the most important human rights of all - the right to life - our country could not remain indifferent to the fate of the 4 million people of Donbass,"" Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the General Assembly, referring to eastern Ukraine.

He also criticized Guterres for his remarks on eastern Ukraine as ""not in line with his status and his mandate under the U.N. Charter,"" the founding document of the world body.

China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said Beijing's position ""on safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states has been consistent and the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter should be jointly upheld.""

He called for continued dialogue and for all parties to exercise restraint and avoid aggravating tensions.

Britain's minister of state for South Asia and the Commonwealth, Tariq Ahmad, urged other countries to also impose sanctions on Russia: ""The Kremlin must understand the strength of the world's condemnation of President Putin's war of choice.""

Germany's Minister of State Tobias Lindner called on U.N. states to reject Russia's action, warning: ""If not, then what has hit Ukraine today could happen to other U.N. member states tomorrow.""

""If the conflict in Ukraine expands, the world could see a scale and severity of need unseen for many years,"" he said.

Guterres was speaking at the start of a General Assembly session on Ukraine.

""No one will be able to sit out this crisis if [Russian President Vladimir] Putin decides that he can move forward,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the UN meeting.

""Active diplomacy, strong political messages, tough economic sanctions and strengthening Ukraine can still force Moscow to abandon aggressive plans,"" he said.

European leaders will hold an emergency summit on Thursday to discuss the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

""It is important that we continue to be united and determined and jointly define our collective approach and actions,"" EU Council chief Charles Michel said in a letter inviting EU leaders to Brussels.

""The use of force and coercion to change borders has no place in the 21st century,"" he added.

Europe has adopted its first sanctions package of financial penalties targeting top Russian government officials, several companies and hundreds of lawmakers who voted in favor of recognizing the independence of separatist-controlled parts of southeast Ukraine. It also banned trade with the two regions.

Petraeus: Russian threat 'has unified NATO'

Former director of the CIA and retired general David Petraeus told DW that Russian President Vladimir Putin is the ""greatest gift to NATO since the end of the Cold War.""

""He set out to make Russia great again. What he's really done is make NATO great again by his actions. That threat has unified NATO in a way that it hasn't been again since the Wall came down, the Warsaw Pact in the Soviet Union dissolved.""

He said the US could impose much stronger sanctions, including to ""cut-off of Russia from the Swift financial transaction system,"" blocking critical high-technology exports, and penalizing more Russian elites and their family members.

He praised Germany for halting certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Petraeus said it was done ""very prompt, very swift (and) very significant in particular for Chancellor Scholz to be the first one to announce this.""

Russia evacuates diplomats from Kyiv

Russia has undertaken evacuations of its embassy in Kyiv, Russian state news agency Tass reported.

Previous evacuations of embassy personnel have been reported. On Wednesday, though, the Russian flag outside the embassy and the consulate in Odessa came down and police surrounded the embassy building.

On Tuesday, Russia's Foreign Ministry announced it planned to evacuate all diplomatic staff from Ukraine.

Last week, video circulated online that showed smoke rising from the Russian Embassy but only on Wednesday did Tass quote an embassy employee saying staff had burnt documents prior to their departure.

Erdogan tells Putin it does not recognize Donbas regions as 'independent'

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin that Turkey did not recognize the two regions of eastern Ukraine Russia has tried to claim as ""independent,"" in violation of international law.

Turkey, a NATO member state that shares the Black Sea region with Russia and Ukraine, maintains ties with both nations and has offered to mediate in the past while warning against any intensified military conflict.

In a statement, the Turkish presidential administration said, ""President Erdogan, who renewed his call for the matter to be resolved through dialogue, stated that it was important to bring diplomacy to the forefront, and that (Turkey) continued its constructive stance in NATO as well.""

Zelenskyy joined in Kyiv by presidents of Lithuania and Poland

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was joined in Kyiv by Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda and Polish President Andrzej Duda who signed a joint declaration in support of Ukraine's EU member candidate status, which is currently not on offer.

The three leaders presented a united front with all three nations previously under Moscow's thumb during the Cold War. They vowed to never recognize Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia or its proxies.

Zelenskyy said, ""The future of European security is being decided right now.""

He added Ukraine should receive security guarantees from Moscow.

""I believe that Russia should be among those countries that provide clear security guarantees. I have many times suggested that the president of Russia sit down at the negotiating table and speak,"" Zelenskyy said.

Duda said he hopes that current tensions with Russia will not lead to the outbreak of war, noting, ""We believe that they pose a threat not only to Ukraine but to our entire region, to NATO's eastern flank and the EU as a whole.""

Kyiv pushes for more sanctions on Russia

Earlier Wednesday, Kyiv urged Western nations to impose more sanctions on Russia following a sweeping round of restrictions from the US and other Western nations targeting the economy and Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote in a tweet that more sanctions were necessary ""to stop Putin from further aggression."" Kuleba added: ""Now the pressure needs to step up to stop Putin. Hit his economy and cronies.""

The European Union foreign ministers agreed on a package of sanctions targeting individuals and entities that ""undermine Ukrainian integrity,"" the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Tuesday.

Those sanctions moved one step closer to being finalized Wednesday as EU ambassadors agreed to the package. The full sanctions package is expected to be announced later Wednesday after final approval from foreign ministers.

In a preview of what form those sanctions may take, The Wall Street Journal reports EU sanctions will target Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm. Bloomberg adds the EU is also set to ban the purchase of Russian government bonds as well.

On Wednesday, US deputy treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo said the US is prepared to cut Putin's Russia off ""from Western technology that's critical to advancing the military, cut him off from Western financial resources that will be critical for feeding his economy and also to enriching himself.""

Western nations are using sanctions in part in response to a speech given by Putin on Monday that declared Russia had the right to seize Ukraine as part of the nation's ""spiritual continuum"" while also violating international law by declaring the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk ""independent.""

DW's Russia affairs analyst Konstantin Eggert said, ""Eventually Putin will say that the newly recognized states need to have their full territory under control and then that means we will have a real confrontation, a real battle between Russian and Ukrainian forces is very much possible.""

Zelenskyy calls up reservists

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree Wednesday calling up reservists between the ages of 18 and 60, Ukraine's armed forces said in a statement.

The border guard in Ukraine also issued new restrictions prohibiting foreigners from accessing the border area at any time as well as restrictions on video and photo recordings of border guard installations amid fears an invasion could be imminent.

With nearly 200,000 Russian troops massed on Ukraine's borders, Western countries are poised to throw down further sanctions should the US, UK and NATO warnings about an imminent invasion prove accurate.

DW's Nick Connolly in Kyiv said, ""Definitely things are getting more nervous here.""

In a video statement released to coincide with the annual Defender of the Fatherland Day, Putin said Russia would always put its national security first.

""Russia's interests and the security of our people are unconditional,"" he said. ""We will continue to strengthen and modernize our army and navy.""

Markus Ziener, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, told DW that Putin's speech earlier this week was ""very disturbing.""

Ziener said, ""It looked like he is in a bubble. He is in a mindset that is not really allowing much more room to maneuver.""

Blinken calls off meeting with Lavrov

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday evening that he called off a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov planned for Thursday, in another sign that an immediate diplomatic solution to the tensions in Ukraine is becoming less likely.

Speaking at a press conference alongside Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Blinken said he agreed to meet Lavrov on the condition that Russia not send troops into Ukrainian territory.

""Now that we see the invasion is beginning, and Russia has made clear its wholesale rejection of diplomacy, it does not make sense to go forward with that meeting at this time,"" Blinken said.

However, Blinken said the US remains committed to diplomacy ""if Moscow's approach changes.""

He added that he would do anything to prevent ""an even worse-case scenario, an all-out assault on all of Ukraine, including its capital.""

""But we will not allow Russia to claim the pretense of diplomacy at the same time it accelerates its march down the path of conflict and war,"" Blinken said.

Blinken condemned Putin's speech on the recognition of eastern Ukraine's two separatist regions, calling it ""deeply disturbing"" and contending that Putin was ""undoing more than 30 years' worth of painstaking diplomacy.""

The White House on Tuesday said plans for a meeting between US President Joe Biden and Putin are currently off the table but added,

""We're never going to completely close the door to diplomacy.""

UN calls Russian troop deployment 'perversion of peacekeeping'

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the deployment of Russian troops to eastern Ukraine, and rejected Russia's characterization of the troops as ""peacekeepers.""

""When troops of one country enter the territory of another country without its consent, they are not impartial peacekeepers, they are not peacekeepers at all,"" Guterres said on Tuesday while calling Russia's characterization a ""perversion of the concept of peacekeeping.""

The UN chief added that the world is facing ""the biggest global peace and security crisis in recent years'' and called for de-escalation.

According to Maxar, the images also showed a new field hospital had been added to a military garrison in western Russia.

Japan, Australia, Canada impose sanctions

Japan said Wednesday it will impose sanctions on Russia and individuals linked to eastern Ukraine's two self-proclaimed ""people's republics.""

Japan's measures include a ban on issuing visas to individuals linked to the two regions, as well as freezing their assets and barring trade. The sanctions also ban the issuing and trade of Russian government bonds in Japan.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that Australia would impose sanctions on eight of Putin's top security advisors, including travel bans. Morrison said that this was ""only the start of this process"" and that subsequent rounds of sanctions are expected.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Tuesday a first round of sanctions on Russia. Trudeau said that his government will ban Canadians from financial dealings with Ukraine's separatist regions and ban Canadians from purchasing Russian sovereign debt.

Recent developments in the Ukraine crisis

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Tuesday that Germany has taken steps to suspend the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia in response to the developments in Ukraine.

The move was made in consultation with the US, as part of a previous agreement the pipeline would not be activated if Russia ""invaded"" Ukraine.

Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden announced a ""first tranche"" of sanctions against Russia.

The sanctions target Russia's VEB and Promsvyazbank banks. Biden added that sanctions targeting Russia's sovereign debt are aimed at cutting off Russia's government from Western financing.

Also on Tuesday, Russian parliamentarians gave Putin permission to use military force outside the country, after Putin had sent a letter formally asking for approval for the use of military force.

The move formalizes a Russian military deployment to separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk, a day after Putin recognized the independence of the two self-proclaimed ""people's republics.""

At the UN, Global Leaders Speak Out on Russia’s Aggression Against Ukraine

Today, as the United Nations General Assembly convened for an annual meeting on Ukraine, leaders from around the world joined together to speak out against Russia’s unprovoked aggression toward Ukraine and to stand up for the UN Charter. Below are excerpts of speeches in the UN General Assembly from leaders spanning the globe:

U.S. Representative to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield: “Together, with our partners and allies, President Biden has taken decisive actions to make the costs of Russia’s actions crystal clear. But as much as we all want Russia to de-escalate, and choose the path of peace, that is not our decision to make. This is President Putin’s war of choice. If he chooses to escalate further, Russia and Russia alone will bear full responsibility for what is to come. What we can do together is make clear that Russia will pay an even steeper price if it continues its aggression. That responsible countries do not bully their neighbors into submission. That former empires cannot lay claim to sovereign and independent nations. The very first line of the UN Charter states that we are uniting together, ‘determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.’ This, right here, right now, is a moment when we can save this generation, and the next, from that terrible fate.”

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres: “The Minsk agreements – approved by the Security Council and that I strongly supported from the beginning – were surviving in an intensive care unit thanks to a number of life support devices. But now those devices have been disconnected. We must also be concerned about preserving the integrity of peacekeeping. The United Nations has a long and recognized experience deploying peacekeeping operations – which only take place with the consent of the host country. It is time for restraint, reason and de-escalation. There is no place for actions and statements that would take this dangerous situation over the abyss.”

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba: “No one will be able to sit out this crisis if President Putin decides that he can move forward with this aggression against Ukraine. Your governments and your people will face painful consequences together with our government and our people. This is why we need to use this last chance for action and stop Russia where it is. It is clear that President Putin will not stop by himself. The beginning of large-scale war in Ukraine will be end of world order as we know it. If Russia does not get a severe, swift, and decisive response now, this will mean a total bankruptcy of the international security system and international institutions which are tasked with maintaining the global security order. This is a grim scenario which will throw us back to the darkest times of the 20th Century.”

Albania Permanent Representative to the UN Ferit Hoxha: “Today we find ourselves before a choice: either we defend our shared principles; stand by the UN Charter which is our International Constitution; respect International Law which governs a rules-based world order of a community of nations; or yield to aggression, international bullying and the rule according to which ‘what is yours is mine.’ We should stand firm now, not to have to regret what may further happen tomorrow. The General Assembly has continuously condemned, in clear and unequivocal terms, the annexation of Crimea. It should condemn this new form of aggression by proliferation of phantom republics, which redraw international borders at one person’s will. …Albania strongly condemns Russia’s decision to recognize non-government-controlled areas of Ukraine as independent entities as well as any attempts, ideas, or hints to export it elsewhere in Russia’s vicinity, in Europe or beyond. It should ring the alarm bell to every UN Member State, and we call on the General Assembly to reject and condemn it firmly.”

Australia Permanent Representative to the UN Mitch Fifield: “We remind Russia of its obligations under the UN Charter. We call upon Russia to uphold core Charter principles, including to refrain from threatening or using force against another State. Australia welcomes the significant efforts undertaken by our close partners, including the United States, the European Union, and NATO in urging Russia to find a diplomatic solution.”

Bulgarian Permanent Representative to the UN Lachezara Stoeva: “Non-compliance with the UN Charter should be of concern to all of us. ‘We’re too far to get involved’ is not a valid argument, as it is our common responsibility to uphold the UN Charter in its entirety…Therefore, it is our duty to join efforts and reject this illegal action by the Kremlin…I would like to commend Ukraine for its resilience and to once again call for de-escalation, dialogue, and diplomacy for overcoming the current security crisis. Ukraine, you’re not alone.”

Canada Permanent Representative to the UN Robert Rae: “There are no second-class states in this organization. There’s no ‘back-of-the-bus’ in the United Nations. There’s no nation that’s less integral, or less sovereign, than any other nation, and no nation has the right to undermine the integrity of any other nation…That’s what the sovereign equality means…In recent years Russia has continued to destabilize Ukraine and regional security, and that is why Canada firmly condemns supporting Russia and the formation of weapons in Donbas…We condemn the recognition by Russia of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, and its decision to move troops into Ukraine under what they call ‘peacekeeping,’ but anyone else who understands the meaning of language would call ‘war marking.’ They’re not peacekeepers. They are soldiers who are there to invade.”

Chile Permanent Representative to the UN Milenko Skoknic Tapia: “Whatever the concerns are about what can be considered a danger to the security of a state, nothing can justify a violation of the principles of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations. These concerns must be dealt with through dialogue and negotiation between the various stakeholders.”

China Permanent Representative to the UN Zhang Jun: “China has been paying attention to the evolving situation in Ukraine. China’s position on safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states has been consistent. The purposes and principles of the UN charter should be jointly upheld…We welcome and encourage all efforts aimed at facilitating a diplomatic solution.”

Czech Republic Permanent Representative to the UN Jakub Kulhanek: “I can think of no more fitting setting than the UN General Assembly in which to reiterate, loud and clear, that the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against territorial integrity and political independence of any state. This is a fundamental principle of international law that all states must abide by, and we should all strive to uphold. Moreover, we fully subscribe to stern words of the Secretary-General’s warning against the perversion of the concept of peacekeeping, as well as his clear warning and that the UN Charter principles are not an à la carte menu…The situation needs to stay high on the UN agenda and deserves the full attention of the UN Security Council, the General Assembly, and the Human Rights Council and other relevant bodies.”

European Union Permanent Representative to the UN Olof Skoog: “Russia’s past and present actions against Ukraine are not a matter just for Ukraine or for Europe. They have severe global implications. Violations of the fundamental principles of international law, the UN Charter and basic principles of international relations directed towards another state is of serious global concern. These rules apply to all. And permanent members of the Security Council have particular responsibility in upholding the Charter…What is happening in Ukraine affects the security of each and every UN Member State. We therefore call on Russia to respect the principles of the Charter, to de-escalate, and to engage in the kind of meaningful diplomacy that we have offered, and that the Secretary-General has reiterated and supported.”

France Permanent Representative to the UN Nicolas De Riviere: “France firmly condemns the unilateral recognition by Russia of the independence of the separatist regions of the east of Ukraine. France also condemns the decision to deploy the Russian army in these territories. This is a violation of international law; it is a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and it is incompatible with the United Nations Charter, as the Secretary-General declared. This is a unilateral renunciation by Russia of the Minsk Agreements, that it nonetheless signed, and which are endorsed by Resolution 2202 of the Security Council. This is also a clear violation of the fundamental principles of the OSCE, enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter, which are the basis for stability in Europe. It is, finally, a questioning of the commitments taken by President Putin over the last few days.”

Georgia Permanent Representative to the UN Kaha Imnadze: “It is deeply alarming that the international norms and principles that we all committed to uphold are repeatedly violated by the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the Security Council whose primary responsibility is to do the exact opposite – act as the guardian of peace and security. Unfortunately, breaching the international law and undermining international rules-based order has long been a marking of Russia’s aggressive policy toward its neighboring states aimed at forcefully redrawing their borders and trying to curb their sovereign choices. My country, Georgia, is no exception here.”

Germany Minister of State Tobias Lindner: “Do we respect the territorial integrity and sovereign equality of UN Member States? Do we stand by the UN Charter? I call on all UN Member States to reaffirm our commitment to these principles – over Ukraine and beyond. With our allies and partners, Germany will spare no effort to find a diplomatic way forward. We will be steadfast in our support for Ukraine, in support of the UN Charter. It is our common duty to remain committed to a rules-based order, to trustful co-operation, to bringing forward our common goal of lasting peace and stability. We invite every member of this organization to join these efforts. Now is the moment to speak up and defend the international order of the UN Charter against unilateral aggression – jointly and decisively.”

Ireland Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Jim Kelly: “Ireland’s support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, and its right to choose its own foreign and security policy path, is unwavering. The decision on Monday by the Russian Federation to proceed with the recognition as independent entities of the non-government-controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine contravenes international law. It is a blatant violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and marks a clear and unilateral breach of the Minsk Agreements. We urge the Russian Federation to reverse this recognition decision immediately and to refrain from further escalatory, unilateral actions which serve only to raise further tensions. The world is watching, and what is needed now is calm de-escalation and the pursuit of diplomacy.”

Japan Permanent Representative to the UN Ishikane Kimihiro: “What is happening in and around Ukraine is not an isolated problem in Europe, but a problem for the entire international community and a challenge to the international order. It goes totally against the purposes and the principles of the UN Charter…Prime Minister Kishida, acting in lockstep with the international community, has announced sanction measures, including the suspension of the issuance of entry visas and asset freezes to individuals concerned…Japan expresses its solidarity with the people of Ukraine…and supports the efforts of all countries for a serious diplomatic solution to the present crisis…No Member State can afford to be a bystander.”

Kenya Deputy Permanent Representative Njambi Kinyungu: “The imperative to respect and uphold the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of all states no matter their size, population, wealth, or military might is what stands between a peaceful global order and escalating, widening crisis. As such, Kenya registers its strong concern and opposition to the recognition by the Russian Federation of Dontesk and Luhansk as independent states. We call on de-escalation to ensure that there are no military confrontations and for a return to diplomatic negotiation whose result respects the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.”

Liberia Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Cecilia Forgbe Wreh-McGill: “Liberia calls on Russia not to attack Ukraine. We further urge Russia to use diplomacy and dialogue to resolve its stated security concerns, and to reverse Russia’s military buildup along the borders of Ukraine and in occupied Crimea. Liberia hereby reaffirms its commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity since Ukraine currently poses no threat to Russia. In this 21st Century when our world body, the United Nations, is promoting peace and security, war is certainly not the answer.”

Lithuania Permanent Representative to the UN Rytis Paulauskas (on behalf of eight Baltic and Nordic Countries): “We strongly condemn the decision by President Putin to recognize the non-government-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine as independent entities and the ensuing decision to send Russian troops into these areas under the pretext of so-called ‘peacekeeping’…We underline that Russian forces in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine would be nothing else but an invasion of a sovereign state. Calling them peacekeepers, to quote the Secretary-General, ‘is the perversion of the concept of peacekeeping.’”

Marshall Islands Permanent Representative to the UN Amatlain Elizabeth Kabua: “The Republic of the Marshall Islands joins the overwhelming chorus of voices today. We have condemned the intentions of the Russian Federation to invade Ukraine, to violate its sovereignty, and to disrupt fragile efforts at diplomacy. These Russian military forces amassed at Ukraine’s borders are not peacekeepers in any sense of the word. And no other nation recognizes these Ukraine areas as some other sovereign. That is a complete farce used to justify an invasion…Through Crimea and now Donbas and Luhansk region, Ukraine is being dismantled piece by piece by threat and by the use of force. This has got to stop…If we do not speak up collectively, then who will?…Speaking out against forceful threats is inconvenient, but it is very much necessary at this very dangerous time. In the long term, what will silence win any of us?…Today, we seem to be near the edge of the very type of international conflict which our predecessors swore would never again arise when they forged the UN Charter. As an institution, the United Nations risks irrelevance if we cannot take clear and meaningful action on this issue.”

Moldova Permanent Representative to the UN Gheorghe Leucă: “In a region fraught with insecurity and instability, where norms of behavior are falling like dominoes, states must follow a set of fundamental rules which regulate relations between them and underpin a regional order. Today, it is more important than ever to reaffirm the principles of international law, order, justice, and peaceful resolution of disputes. We cannot allow historical revisionist policies, undisguised use of force, and disregard for human rights to become the new normal.”

Republic of Korea Permanent Representative to the UN Cho Hyun: “We condemn any act that seriously undermines the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of any state. In this regard, we are seriously concerned with Russia’s decision to recognize the independence of certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. This undermines the fundamental principle of international norm, including the UN Charter. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected. We urge Russia to de-escalate the tensions and reverse its military buildup in the region. The Republic of Korea reaffirms its unwavering support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.”

Turkey Permanent Representative to the UN Feridun H. Sinirlioğlu: “It has been eight years since the occupation of Crimea. Since the first day, the entire international community has maintained a resolute position. We never recognized the illegal annexation. And we have always supported Ukraine’s independence, territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political unity within its internationally recognized borders. This is our legal and moral obligation…We do not need, nor do we want, a new war in our region.”

United Kingdom Minister of State Tariq Ahmad: “As the Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has made clear, Russia’s unilateral measures conflict directly with the principles of the UN Charter. Their actions are a fundamental challenge to global peace and security, and a challenge to the international order on which we all rely – and equally important, it is for all of us to protect. We must condemn unequivocally this aggression together and stop President Putin’s expansionist ambitions. We must hold Russia to its commitments under the UN Charter, and say to Russia pull back – choose peace, not war – whilst also sending a clear message to the people of Ukraine that in your hour of need, we the international community, we the United Nations, stand with you.”

It would also condemn Moscow’s “aggression” against Ukraine as a violation of the U.N. Charter.

The resolution is certain to be blocked by Russia, one of five permanent members of the Security Council with veto power. But passage is not really the point. The ultimate goal is to shine a bright light on Moscow’s violent breach of international law.

“Of course, we expect that Russia will use its veto,” a senior administration official told reporters Thursday. “And in doing so, they will underscore their isolation.”

But Putin appears impervious to public shaming. He ordered military troops into Ukraine even as the U.N. Security Council met to discuss Russia’s decision to recognize the independence of two separatist enclaves in eastern Ukraine. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’s call for Putin to “stop your troops from attacking Ukraine” had no impact.

The United States had hoped Russia’s invasion would drive a wedge between Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. But previous efforts to turn Beijing against Moscow over Russian interventions in Syria, Georgia, eastern Ukraine, and Crimea yielded little more than the occasional Chinese abstention on U.N. resolutions criticizing Russia. Direct diplomatic appeals to China to get Russia to stand down went nowhere, according to the New York Times.

In the end, China’s U.N. envoy, Zhang Jun, may or may not cast a dissenting veto alongside Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia. Regardless, few expect Beijing to join the United States in denouncing an increasingly important ally. China would most likely repeat its response to Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea by abstaining on a vote to condemn Russia’s action. But a double veto can’t be ruled out. China’s bond with Russia has only strengthened in the years since.

The best-case scenario for the United States, according to diplomats, would be a vote of 13-1-1. But even that may be out of reach. Council diplomats said India and the United Arab Emirates, two countries with close ties to the United States, have expressed deep misgivings about the U.N. draft and appear reluctant to be drawn into a big-power standoff at the United Nations.

It remains unclear what specific concerns the UAE has over the U.S. text, but the Persian Gulf state has yet to make a formal decision on how it will vote, leaving open the possibility it could abstain or vote in favor.

Concerns about India’s vote have only grown since Putin spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday. On Friday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba phoned Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar to ask that he pressure Russia to “cease military aggression against Ukraine” and support the Security Council resolution. India also appears reluctant to clash with Russia at a time when it is seeking to evacuate thousands of Indian nationals, mostly students, from Ukraine to neighboring Poland, Hungary, and Romania. Jaishankar highlighted the need for “dialogue and diplomacy” following a conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday.

That leaves the United States with two unfavorable outcomes. It could force India and the UAE into abstaining, weakening the condemnation of one of the greatest threats to a U.N. member state’s sovereignty in a generation. Or the United States could soften the tone of its resolution in an effort to bring the two countries on board.

In any case, the Security Council vote won’t end the debate. Once Russia casts its veto, the United States and its partners are expected to put the resolution to a vote before the 193-member U.N. General Assembly, hoping they can persuade the rest of the world to censure Russia.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/25/biden-to-force-russian-veto-of-u-n-resolution-on-ukraine/

Kenyan Ambassador to the United Nations Martin Kimani delivered a powerful critique of Russian escalation in Ukraine in an address to the U.N. Security Council on Monday night that has gone viral.

Drawing parallels between the Ukrainian situation and Africa’s own experience with borders drawn by outside powers in the aftermath of empire collapse, Kimani emphasized that despite understandable desires “for integration with peoples in neighboring states,” integration by force and expansionism are unacceptable. He called on all U.N. member states to rally in support of multilateralism to find a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

Ghana and Gabon, the other two non-permanent African members of the Security Council, echoed Kenya in emphasizing their support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and expressing concerns over the global ramifications of Russian escalation of the conflict.

Yet a South African government statement, blaming neither Russia nor Ukraine, called for “inclusive talks led by the UNSC” and “enhanced diplomacy.” Nigerian press accounts have underscored the plight of Nigerian and other foreign students in Ukraine. Reportedly, Morocco, Nigeria and Egypt are in the top 10 list for countries whose students are studying in Ukraine, accounting for 8,000, 4,000 and 3,500 students respectively.

Key future ramifications of the invasion include increasing uncertainty in diplomatic and economic relations between African countries and Russia, in a context of increasing Russian influence and engagement on the continent over recent years and a potential dampening impact on the BRICS Summit to be hosted by China later this year, and South Africa’s engagement in it.

Arctic

Marisol Maddox, Senior Arctic Analyst, Mike Sfraga, Chair and Distinguished Scholar, Evan Bloom, Senior Fellow

President Joe Biden's statement on February 24th that there is a “complete rupture right now in U.S.-Russian relations” has stark implications for the Arctic. Long portrayed as a region of peace, cooperation, and engagement, the Arctic is now inextricably linked to the unfolding and further invasion of Ukraine by Russia. All bilateral and multilateral efforts within the Arctic region involving Russia, from the Arctic Council to the Arctic Coast Guard Forum to regional scientific and maritime transportation agreements may be in jeopardy. This is especially evident in the context of the on-going Russian chairmanship of the Arctic Council, which will continue into next year. Arctic nations navigated the headwinds of the Russian Federation’s initial invasion of Ukraine and subsequent annexation of Crimea and ensured, for the most part, but after some delay, that Arctic engagement and cooperation was maintained – and in some areas enhanced. The largescale invasion of Ukraine is such a serious step for all States active in the Arctic that normal modes of cooperation, including those focused on climate change, will likely be reassessed.

Security Implications

The Arctic is a strategic landscape for Russia; the Kola Peninsula is home to Russia’s Northern Fleet, and an important hub for their strategic submarine and second-strike capability. Moreover, Russia uses the Arctic to test and demonstrate its military capabilities, such as in the recent nuclear strategic forces exercise GROM 2022, when the nuclear triad was tested alongside hypersonic and ballistic missiles. If, as some fear, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine spills into other areas, due to a miscalculation, misstep, miscommunication, or purposeful action— to include NATO member or partner states— Russia’s Arctic-based military assets will undoubtedly be drawn into the conflict. The Arctic has strong NATO representation, including the United States, Norway, Denmark, Canada, and Iceland, as well as partner countries Finland and Sweden. The latter two nations have navigated a difficult balance between deterrence and reassurance to maintain practical relations, though Russia’s actions in Ukraine may bring about a re-evaluation of such policies. Two previously planned defensive NATO exercises will commence in the Arctic this week, coinciding with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, asserting alliance unity as a deterrence against further aggression at a critical moment in history. BRILLIANT JUMP 2022 is scheduled to begin in Norway on February 28th and the Norwegian-led bi-annual COLD RESPONSE 2022, which includes NATO partner nations Finland and Sweden, is scheduled to begin on March 14th.

Diplomatic Implications

“Arctic exceptionalism,” and the qualities that have enabled cooperation to endure in the region despite external tensions, is at risk more today than at any other time in recent history. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is in direct conflict with the spirit of the Arctic Council (the premier intergovernmental forum for regional cooperation) as outlined in the Ottawa Declaration, and the foundation upon which the Council’s work has been developed and effectuated. Arctic diplomats have a significant challenge before them as they seek to navigate political realities and constraints in their objectives to continue progress in areas of meaningful mutual interest, such as action on climate change, while recognizing and addressing Russia’s norm-breaking invasion of a sovereign nation.

Economic Implications

Ever-evolving sanctions will impact economic development in the region – the full effects are yet to be seen - and could potentially expand to include Russian energy projects. This will likely push Russia closer to China as it seeks non-Western sources of financing for critical Arctic development projects. Chinese reception to such Russian overtures should be analyzed carefully as the Chinese government has its own regional and global interests to consider. Sanctions may also create a surge in illicit trade opportunities for transnational criminal organizations, as Russia seeks alternative means of acquiring certain goods, technologies, or services the country may no longer have access to.

Canada

Christopher Sands, Director, Canada Institute

Canadian PM Justin Trudeau made the following statement last night:

“Canada condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia’s egregious attack on Ukraine. These unprovoked actions are a clear further violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. They are also in violation of Russia’s obligations under international law and the Charter of the United Nations.

“Canada calls on Russia to immediately cease all hostile and provocative actions against Ukraine and withdraw all military and proxy forces from the country. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected, and the Ukrainian people must be free to determine their own future.

“Russia’s actions will be met with severe consequences. Tomorrow morning, I will be meeting with G7 partners, and we will continue working closely and quickly with NATO and our allies to collectively respond to these reckless and dangerous acts, including by imposing significant sanctions in addition to those already announced.

“In the face of these attacks on Ukraine, Canada will take additional action to stop Russia’s unwarranted aggression. We continue to stand with Ukraine, its people, and the Ukrainian Canadian community here in Canada. Russia’s brazen acts will not go unpunished.”

Canada this morning evacuated its diplomats in Ukraine to Poland. A great round-up of comments by Canadian officials including former PM Stephen Harper is here: Trudeau promises severe consequences for Russia, Harper says Putin must be punished | National Post

China

Robert Daly, Director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the U.S.

The first thing to notice about China’s official response to the invasion of Ukraine is that Xi Jinping himself has said nothing. The leaders of most other Western and northeast Asia countries have made personal statements condemning Russia’s actions, but Xi has let his Foreign Ministry do the talking.

This is because silence preserves the illusion of wisdom and keeps options open, but also because Xi has already made his position clear. On February 4, on the eve of the Olympics, Xi and Vladimir Putin announced an “unlimited” quasi alliance that would “oppose further enlargement of NATO” and “remain highly vigilant about the negative impact of the United States' Indo-Pacific strategy.” China is not yet guilty by association in Ukraine but, after February 4, it cannot deny all association with Putin’s invasion, which it neither desired nor foresaw. That linkage, and that error, will call Xi’s judgment into question as he heads into the annual Two Sessions meetings soon to convene in Beijing.

China’s Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, is trying to convince Chinese audiences that the war is the fault of the United States and NATO. Spokesperson Hua Chunying states that NATO owes China a “debt of blood” for the bombing of its embassy to Yugoslavia in 1999—a phrase intended to reignite the ire of the Chinese people against the West—and insists that “a key question here is what role the U.S., the culprit of current tensions surrounding Ukraine, has played.”

It is striking that China views an invasion that clearly violates its sacred diplomatic principles through the lens of Sino-U.S. competition, principles be damned. Striking too that, despite Xi’s quest for global leadership, China has not yet attempted to broker peace between two nations with which it has good relations. Expect China to continue its accusations against the West, its equivocation regarding Russia, and its aversion to the risky pursuit of peace.

France and Europe/EU

Jim Hollifield, Global Fellow

France currently holds the six-month, rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, and France President Emmanuel Macron tried to use all his skills of persuasion to defuse the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, with multiple meetings and telephone calls with President Vladimir Putin—all to no avail.

The principal lesson to be drawn from this is that President Putin pays little heed to European leaders or the EU, preferring to deal directly with the U.S., while shoring up his flank with China. President Macron has the ambition to create a common European foreign and security policy, but this now looks more difficult than ever. France and Europe find themselves once again caught between two nuclear-armed super powers, as Europe slides back into a new cold war.

That said, President Putin and the Russians have succeeded in uniting the Europeans in ways that one could only have imagined a few weeks ago—witness how quickly the Germans suspended Nordstream2, something they were reluctant to do for many years. The Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrates the vital role of NATO in European security, and the dream of a common European defense policy is as far away as ever.

Assuming that President Putin and the Russians succeed in subjugating Ukraine—although a protracted war with many casualties and guerilla resistance in Ukraine is a distinct possibility—the conflict will play out on an economic stage.

The Russians hold a trump card in that they can cut off energy (gas and oil) supplies to Europe, leading to major economic disruptions and another inflationary spike in energy prices. In the longer term, economic sanctions against the Russian government, banks, and other corporations will do major damage to the Russian economy, but this is a price that President Putin and his regime are willing to pay. It will be interesting to see if the Russian people will follow him down this path with great loss of blood and treasure.

The immediate fallout from the invasion of Ukraine will be a humanitarian crisis and a flood of refugees heading east. I hope the EU is preparing for this eventuality.

As President Putin said today, he hopes everyone now is paying attention to him and to Russian demands. He certainly got the attention of the EU, including the U.K. The front-line states of NATO, the Baltics in particular, will be watching developments in Ukraine nervously, looking over their shoulders to the U.S. and NATO for reassurance.

One quick anecdote comes to mind. A few years ago, circa 2018, I was giving a lecture at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and I was hosted by the 98-year-old, former Secretary of State George P. Shultz. I asked Secretary Shultz what he thought of the U.S. ‘pivot to Asia,’ to which he replied sarcastically—great move. “We pivoted to Asia and the Russians invaded Ukraine.”

The moral is that, as a global power, the U.S. does not have the luxury to focus all of our attention and resources on one region/country (China), and that our security and economic interests in Europe remain paramount.

Japan

Shihoko Goto, Acting Director, Asia Program

Japan imposed sanctions against Russia Wednesday, by prohibiting the issuance of Russian bonds in Japan, freezing assets of certain Russian nations, and restricting travel to Japan.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida stated that ""Russia's actions very clearly damage Ukraine's sovereignty and go against international law. We once again criticize these moves and strongly urge Russia to return to diplomatic discussions…should the situation worsen, we'll move quickly to take further action.”

This will hamper Tokyo’s efforts to negotiate the return of the Kuril Islands that have been held by Russia since 1945. Japan and Russia have yet to sign a formal peace treaty after World War II.

Japan imports about 10 percent of its LNG and 12 percent of thermal coal from Russia.

Mexico

Andrew Rudman, Director, Mexico Institute

Mexican President Lopez Obrador (AMLO), during his morning press conference, called for peace, noting that Mexico does not want war anywhere, does not want people to suffer, and doesn’t want civilians harmed. Mexico’s position is in opposition to armed confrontation. He then shifted gears to add that if the price of imported gas rises, we will shift to using non-gas fired electric plants to provide needed electricity.

Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard tweeted that he was in contact with the current president of the UNSC (Mexico is a non-permanent member at present) and with the Mexican ambassador to Kyiv. He added that Mexico rejects the use of force and reiterated its call for a political solution to the conflict in Ukraine. He reiterated that Mexico supports the UN Secretary General. Mexico will work with other countries to find a space for dialogue.

AMLO’s comments reflect classic Mexican non-interventionist policies and are certainly not a ringing condemnation of Russia’s actions. This reflects his general lack of interest in foreign affairs, (note his immediate shift to how this might impact Mexico), and his long-standing aversion to foreign intervention of any sort (except when he wants to criticize, for example, the US trade embargo on Cuba).

In late January, AMLO linked the Russia-US dispute over Ukraine to neo-liberalism, implying somehow that neoliberalism was the cause. Other officials, such as the Foreign Minister and Mexico’s UN ambassador have hewed more closely to the international consensus in opposition to Russian actions. AMLO dominates the Mexican news cycle and does not respond well to criticism from outside his government or dissent from within. As a result, and despite its current UNSC seat, Mexico is not likely to play a particularly active or influential role on this issue.

Middle East

James F. Jeffrey, Chair, Middle East Program

The enormity of the Russian attack, not just on Ukraine but on the long-term global security order, is increasingly clear among states in the Middle East region, and puts pressure on the ‘hedging’ between the U.S. on one hand and Russia and China on the other, commonplace in recent years. Some hedging can still be seen in reluctance to call out Moscow by some capitals, but the dangers to the region of an entire world in limbo are immense. Thus if the U.S. maintains its so-far smart policies to make Russia pay economically and diplomatically for its aggression, regional states will eventually rally behind Washington. Turkey is most affected by this Russian move and thus its reaction is clear and strong. Iran has clearly sided with Russia, which will have repercussions in the U.S. and particularly Europe.

Russia’s FSU Neighbors

F. Joesph Dresen, Senior Program Associate, Kennan Institute

The condemnation of Russia’s actions have been swift and decisive from several, but far from all, of Russia’s neighbors who were once part of the Soviet Union.

The Foreign Ministers of the three Baltic nations of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia issued a joint statement condemning Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

Individually, the president of Latvia and Lithuania, and the Prime Minister of Estonia, each issued their own condemnations of the attack, employing the hashtag #StandWithUkraine.

The presidents of Georgia and Moldova likewise condemned the Russian attack, and the president of Moldova committed to accepting refugees from Ukraine. Over 4,000 crossings have occurred already.

There has been no official statement yet from the governments of Armenia, Azerbaijan, or Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, or Turkmenistan).

Belarus is actively supporting the Russian invasion.

South Korea

Sue Mi Terry, Director, Hyundai Motor-Korea Foundation Center for Korean History and Public Policy

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said that South Korea would join international sanctions against Russia and expressed regrets over Russia’s attack on Ukraine, noting that “the use of armed forces causing human casualties cannot be justified under any circumstances.” South Korea, however, said it is not considering adopting unilateral measures. From Seoul’s perspective, the Ukraine crisis has created troubling new realities for its economic and strategic security.

South Korea is cognizant of how North Korean leaders will view the Ukraine crisis. To the North, the lessons of Saddam Hussein or Iraq or Muammar al-Qaddafi of Libya couldn’t be clearer: Leaders who give up nuclear weapons programs are at serious risk of being overthrown and killed. That lesson is only reinforced by the current crisis between Ukraine and Russia. Watching the attack on Ukraine, Kim Jong Un can only calculate that if Ukraine still had its nuclear weapons, Russia would not dare to attack it, which will make him all the more determined to hold onto, and even expand, his arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles.

In the short-term, it is quite possible, even probable, that the North will take advantage of the U.S. being distracted in Ukraine to launch provocations or aggressions on their own. The North could even be further emboldened to conduct an ICBM or nuclear test, knowing that Russia is less willing to cooperate with further action against North Korea at the UN. South Korea also will be concerned that, with Russia-Ukraine conflict taking all the bandwidth in Washington, the Biden administration will not be able to prioritize the North Korean challenge in the coming months.

South Korea has other causes for concern, including the impact on the global economy of the sanctions that will now be imposed on Russia. Supply chain disruptions and price spikes in international markets will be passed onto South Korea. Russia is South Korea’s 12th largest trading partner; South Korean exports containing advanced U.S.-developed technological components could be banned for sale in Russia. South Korea will also face rising energy and food prices due to the possibility that flows of Russian oil and natural gas may be interrupted or curtailed.

If the U.S. cuts Russia from the SWIFT financial network, this could also devastate Russia-South Korea trade, especially Russian energy sales. It could also undermine the South Korean automotive industry’s presence in Russia and jeopardize South Korea’s ambitions to sign a free trade agreement with the Eurasian Economic Union. South Korea has roughly 13 companies active in Ukraine and 40 companies in Russia.

Beyond the short-term economic impact, South Korea will be concerned about the long-term implications for its security. South Korea understands that it is a treaty ally of the United States and Ukraine is not, but it will nevertheless be watching carefully how the U.S. and NATO respond to the Russian aggression. South Korea will be reassured if they see the West mobilizing a massive response to send a signal that aggression does not pay. If, however, Putin wins a swift victory and the West does not manage to impose heavy costs on Russia, that will be of great concern to South Korea, and debate about the credibility of the United States as a security guarantor will increase.

If U.S. power is revealed as hollow and the international rule of law erodes, South Korea will be tempted to build its own nuclear arsenal. It might even lean more toward Beijing in the complicated calibration it tries to achieve between China (its largest trade partner) and the United States (its primary security partner). But any realignment is unlikely in the short term, with Korean public opinion turning more anti-China and particularly if a conservative candidate who is critical of China wins the presidential election on March 9th. Nevertheless, the stakes are high in the Ukraine crisis—and South Korea is watching closely.

South Asia

Michael Kugelman, Deputy Director, Asia Program

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan happened to be in Moscow when the invasion was launched. He met with Putin today for a prescheduled meeting on bilateral relations. The Prime Minister’s Office then released a statement that included this:

“The Prime Minister regretted the latest situation between Russia and Ukraine and said that Pakistan had hoped diplomacy could avert a military conflict. The Prime Minister stressed that conflict was not in anyone’s interest and that the developing countries were always hit the hardest economically in case of conflict. He underlined Pakistan’s belief that disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy.”

A statement made by India’s UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti last night included this: “The situation is in danger of spiraling into a major crisis. We express our deep concern over the developments, which if not handled carefully, may well undermine the peace and security of the region…We call for immediate de-escalation and refraining from any further action that could contribute to a worsening of the situation.”

Both Pakistan and India are in a difficult diplomatic spot. Pakistan has deepened partnership with Russia in recent years, while India has a longstanding relationship with Moscow going back to the early Cold War days. They will hesitate to criticize Russia, though we can expect some light criticism if the invasion is expanded.

India is in a worse bind than Pakistan given that it has a close and growing partnership with Washington. Indian silence won’t damage relations with Washington, but it does mean India will likely face increased pressure from Washington to reduce its arms imports from Russia (India has already reduced these imports in recent years).

India’s interests could be negatively impacted by the Ukraine crisis because it may lead to stronger relations between Russia and India’s rival China, and because it could distract Washington and its Western partners from focusing on an Indo Pacific policy that is strongly supported by India because of its focus on countering China.",https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/world-reaction-invasion-ukraine
5,05504494-f23c-434d-8422-0d99bfdb9c8e,[],,"US President Joe Biden will nominate federal appeals court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, according to a person familiar with the matter, making her the first Black woman selected to serve on a court that once declared her race unworthy of citizenship and endorsed segregation.

In Jackson, Biden delivers on a campaign promise to make the historic appointment and to further diversify a court that was made up entirely of white men for almost two centuries. He has chosen an attorney who would be the high court’s first former public defender, though she also possesses the elite legal background of other justices.

Jackson would be the current court’s second Black justice — Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, is the other — and just the third in history.

The news was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it before the president’s official announcement later today.

She would also be only the sixth woman to serve on the court, and her confirmation would mean that for the first time four women would sit together on the nine-member court.

The current court includes three women, one of whom is the court’s first Latina, Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Jackson would join the liberal minority of a conservative-dominated court that is weighing cutbacks to abortion rights and will be considering ending affirmative action in college admissions and restricting voting rights efforts to increase minority representation.

Biden is filling the seat that will be vacated by Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, who is retiring at the end of the term this summer.

Jackson, 51, once worked as one of Breyer’s law clerks early in her legal career. She attended Harvard as an undergraduate and for law school, and served on the US Sentencing Commission, the agency that develops federal sentencing policy, before becoming a federal judge in 2013.

Her nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority by a razor-thin 50-50 margin with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaker. Party leaders have promised swift but deliberate consideration of the president’s nominee.

The next justice will replace one of the more liberal justices, so she would not tip the balance of the court, which now leans 6-3 in favor of conservatives.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-february-25-2022/

CANBERRA, Australia — Australia has announced additional sanctions on Russia and is warning businesses to prepare for retaliation through Russian cyberattacks.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Wednesday that targeted financial sanctions and travel bans will be a first batch of measures in response to Russian aggression toward Ukraine.

Australia and Russia have imposed sanctions on each other since 2014. The sanctions were initiated by Australia in protest of Russian involvement in the Ukraine conflict.

The National Security Committee of Morrison’s Cabinet approved sanctions and travel bans that target eight members of the Russian Security Council. They also agreed to expand previous sanctions and to align with the United States and Britain by targeting two Russian banks.

TOKYO — Japan’s prime minister has announced sanctions targeting Russia and two separatist Ukrainian regions recognized as independent by Russian President Vladimir Putin, joining an international effort seeking to pressure Russia to return to diplomatic solutions.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Wednesday that his government will ban new issuance and distribution of Russian government bonds in Japan in response to the “actions Russia has been taking in Ukraine.”

He said Japan will also suspend visa issuance to the people linked to the two Ukrainian rebel regions and freeze their assets in Japan, and will ban trade with the two areas.

Kishida repeated his “strong condemnation” of Russia for violating Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as international law.

He added: “We strongly urge Russia to return to diplomatic process in resolving the development.”

UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations chief says the world is facing “the biggest global peace and security crisis in recent years” and is calling Russia’s declaration of the “so-called `independence’” of separatist areas in eastern Ukraine a violation of its territorial integrity and accusing Moscow of “the perversion of the concept of peacekeeping.”

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Tuesday he is proud of the achievements of the U.N.’s far-flung peacekeepers, but when troops of one country enter the territory of another country without its consent, as Russian forces have done, “they are not impartial peacekeepers -- they are not peacekeepers at all” as Moscow has called them.

Guterres said Russia’s unilateral actions also “conflict” with the U.N. Charter and are “a death blow to the Minsk Agreements” aimed at restoring peace to eastern Ukraine.

OTTAWA, Ontario — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada is sending hundreds more troops to eastern Europe and imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the deployment of forces into Ukraine.

The prime minister says up to 460 additional Canadian Armed Forces members are being sent to Latvia and the surrounding region to bolster NATO in the face of Russian aggression.

He also says Canada is taking a number of steps alongside its allies to isolate Russia financially.

WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken says he has cancelled plans to meet his Russian counterpart in Geneva later this week as Russia presses ahead with recognition of separatist regions of Ukraine.

Blinken told reporters on Tuesday that Russia’s actions indicated Moscow was not serious about a diplomatic path to resolving the crisis. As a result, he said he had called off his Thursday meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Echoing President Joe Biden, Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognize the independence of Ukraine’s Donbass region was a violation of international law. And, he said the placement of Russian troops there constituted the beginning of an invasion.

Although he held out hope for a peaceful resolution through diplomacy, he said he did not believe a meeting with Lavrov would be productive at this time.

KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine’s president has called up some of the country’s military reservists as the threat of a Russian invasion grows, but says there is no need for a full military mobilization.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address to the nation Tuesday night that he had signed a decree to that effect.

“Today there is no need for a full mobilization. We need to quickly add additional staff to the Ukrainian army and other military formations,” Zelenskyy said.

He said the decree only applies to those assigned to the so-called operational reserve, which is typically activated during ongoing hostilities, and covers “a special period of time,” without clarifying what that means.

“Ukrainians are a peaceful nation, we want silence, but if we keep silent today, we will disappear tomorrow,” Zelenskyy said.

There are about 250,000 troops in Ukraine’s armed forces.

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden says the U.S. will be sanctioning Russian oligarchs and their families, as well as Russian sovereign debt in retaliation for the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Biden said those sanctions were just the “first tranche” of what the U.S. and its allies stand ready to put in place if Russia launches a larger invasion of Ukraine.

“He’s setting up a rationale to take more territory by force,” Biden said of recent comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin. “This is the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.”

Biden added that he was authorizing the movement of some U.S. troops in Europe to NATO’s Baltic allies as a show of support and solidarity amid the Russian threat.

BERLIN — Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has chaired a call of the G-7 nations in which ministers strongly condemned Russia’s recognition of the separatist-controlled areas of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine and the decision to deploy Russian troops there.

Those involved included the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., along with the European Union.

The German foreign ministry said Tuesday night that the G-7 foreign ministers agreed to step up restrictive measures responding to Russia’s actions and reiterated their unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.

BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Germany continues to rule out the delivery of arms to Ukraine despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s order to deploy troops to separatist regions of eastern Ukraine.

Scholz told German public broadcaster ARD on Tuesday night that Germany had made a decision to not export weapons to crisis regions a long time ago, “and we stick to that.”

Scholz also pointed out that “Ukraine has a lot of weapons ... and the point is that we have to protect Ukraine not by giving more weapons, but by standing together as an international community and saying that we will not simply accept such a breach of international law.” He stressed that Germany has been the biggest financial supporter of Ukraine since 2014.

The chancellor added “we must insist that the peace order in Europe is again based on the fact that borders are not moved and that the state sovereignty of countries is not questioned.”

BERLIN — Protesters have flocked to the Russian embassy in Berlin to decry Russian President Vladimir Putin’s order to deploy troops to separatist regions of eastern Ukraine.

People were waving yellow-blue Ukrainian flags and chanting “We stand united with Ukraine!” as they assembled in front of the building near the German capital’s landmark Brandenburg Gate on Tuesday evening.

Some held up banners saying “Ukraine will resist,” “Say no to Putin” or “Implement sanctions immediately,” while others wrapped themselves into huge Ukrainian flags.

“I’m here to protest against Russia invading our independent Ukrainian territory,” said Victoria Baron, 27, who moved from Odesa in Ukraine to Berlin last summer to work for a data science company.

“It’s very important that we support our people even though we’re abroad,” she said adding that she talked to her family back home almost every day and spends hours on social media following the latest developments.

CAIRO -- The interim government in chaos-stricken Libya says it rejects Russia’s decision to recognize two separatist regions in southeast Ukraine.

In a statement Tuesday, the Government of National Unity has urged Russia to de-escalated and resort to diplomacy to find a solution to the Ukraine crisis. It also called for Russia to withdraw Wagner mercenaries from Libya that fought along with forces of military commander Khalifa Hifter when he unsuccessfully attempted in 2019 to capture the capital of Tripoli..

MOSCOW — The Russian Foreign Ministry said that it has decided to evacuate Russian diplomatic personnel from Ukraine, pointing at threats.

The ministry said Tuesday that Russian diplomats in Ukraine have received multiple threats, adding that they will be evacuated “in the nearest time.” It did not elaborate.

The move follows Russia’s recognition of Ukraine’s rebel regions and the Russian parliament’s vote to grant President Vladimir Putin a permission to use military force in Ukraine.

The Ukrainian capital of Kyiv is only a three hour drive from the border of Belarus, where Russia has stationed troops for earlier war games.

BRUSSELS — French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says the European Union’s 27 members have unanimously agreed on an initial set of sanctions targeting Russian officials involved in Ukraine.

EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said Tuesday this first package of sanctions “will hurt Russia and it will hurt a lot.”

He said the sanctions would affect members of Russia’s duma who voted against the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine as well as another 27 people and “entities” which are often companies, banks or agencies.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said sanctions will directly target individuals and companies, as well as banks financing “the Russian military apparatus” and contributing to the destabilization of Ukraine.

In addition, von der Leyen said the EU will limit the Russian government’s ability to raise capital on the bloc’s financial markets.

“We will make it as difficult as possible for the Kremlin to pursue its aggressive actions,” she said.

BERLIN — Germany’s top security official says authorities are preparing for possible cyberattacks in response to the crisis with Russia.

The Interior Ministry said Tuesday that security agencies have taken protective measures to avert such attacks and Germany’s national cyber defense center is monitoring developments.

BUCHAREST, Romania — Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said Tuesday after a phone call with his Polish counterpart that they have agreed to hold an “extraordinary summit” Friday in Warsaw between the Bucharest Nine members to “coordinate our response and demonstrate our unity” amid Russia’s moves against Ukraine.

“Today I discussed with the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda, the serious security situation in the Black Sea region, following Russian actions, which flagrantly violates international law,” Iohannis wrote online. “We stand with Ukraine!”

The Bucharest Nine, which Romania and Poland launched in 2015, is a group comprised of NATO’s easternmost members and also includes Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.

BELVOIR CASTLE, England — Defense ministers from the Baltic states urged world leaders to move swiftly and impose harsh sanctions on Russia, saying their countries know firsthand the dangers of trying to appease a bully.

The Baltic countries’ position on NATO’s eastern flank was at the forefront of discussions Tuesday as defense ministers from the Joint Expeditionary Force met in central England. The U.K.-led force is a group of 10 nations designed to react more quickly in the event of threats like those now posed by Russia.

Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks said in an interview with the Associated Press that world leaders must act swiftly to impose punishing sanctions or it will be too late to stand up for freedom and democracy.

He said failure to stop the Russian president’s “aggression” now would send the message that Moscow can “play around with the Europeans” and the U.S.

LONDON — Sanctions experts say Western measures against Russia will have to go much further to have a chance of deterring President Vladimir Putin from further military intervention in Ukraine.

Tyler Kustra, a University of Nottingham politics professor, said sanctions announced Tuesday by Britain on five Russian banks and three wealthy individuals were “a paper cut.”

He said “the U.K. could be doing a lot more. There are certainly far more oil oligarchs in London that could be sanctioned. They could have their assets frozen, they could be kicked out of the country.”

Thomas Mayne, a corruption expert and visiting fellow at the Chatham House think-tank, also said Britain’s status as a hub for no-questions-asked Russian money was a major problem.

“For at least 20 years, we’ve been welcoming Russian money,” he said. “We’ve been allowing people with very dubious sources of wealth to gain Tier 1 investor visas in the U.K., to buy property, to list their companies on the London Stock Exchange, far more so than American stock exchanges. And we’ve created a situation where now we’re wondering whether that was such a good idea.”

MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for international recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, an end to Ukraine’s NATO membership bid and a halt to weapons shipments there.

Putin claimed Tuesday that Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula should be internationally recognized as a legitimate reflection of the local population’s choice, likening it to a vote for Kosovo independence.

The annexation has been widely condemned by Western powers as a breach of international law.

To end the current crisis, he also called for the renunciation of Ukraine’s NATO bid, saying it should assume a “neutral status,” and said that the West should stop sending weapons there.

BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says Russia is taking military action against Ukraine and has condemned Moscow’s decision to recognize separatist areas of southeast Ukraine as independent.

Stoltenberg called the move Tuesday a “serious escalation by Russia and a flagrant violation of international law.” The NATO chief called the military action a “further invasion” of Ukraine by Russia which had already invaded its neighbor in 2014.

He added that there’s “every indication” Russia continues to plan for a full-scale attack on Ukraine.

Stoltenberg said that NATO allies have more than 100 warplanes on high alert and more than 120 warships ready at sea from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean Sea.

He said that the NATO response force remains on high readiness but is not yet being deployed, although some allies are moving troops, ships and planes into the Baltic states and near the Black Sea to defend other NATO members.

MOSCOW — Russian lawmakers have given President Vladimir Putin permission to use military force outside the country.

The unanimous vote in Russia’s upper house on Tuesday could presage a broader attack on Ukraine after the U.S. said an invasion was already underway there.

The vote formalizes a Russian military deployment to the rebel regions, where an eight-year conflict has killed nearly 14,000 people.

MOSCOW — Russia’s closest allies appeared reluctant to immediately back Moscow’s decision to recognize the independence of rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine.

The Foreign Ministry of Belarus said Tuesday it saw Russian President Vladimir Putin’s move “with respect and understanding,” but refrained from saying whether Minsk would follow suit and recognize the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics.

Officials in Kazakhstan, whose president last month asked for a Russia-led security alliance to send troops to quell violent unrest, said the issue of recognizing the separatist regions was not on the country’s agenda.

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who’s in Moscow for talks with Putin, made no mention of Moscow’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk in his publicly broadcast remarks, but focused instead on bilateral relations.

Another Russian ally, Armenia, has so far issued no message of support for the Russian move.

Meanwhile, Putin sought to reassure Russia’s ex-Soviet allies that he doesn’t envision resurrecting the Soviet Union. He told the Azerbaijani president that speculation that Russia would attempt to restore its empire “is absolutely not true.”

WASHINGTON — The White House has begun referring to Russian troop deployments in eastern Ukraine as an “invasion” after initially hesitating to use the term — a red line that President Joe Biden has said would result in the U.S. levying severe sanctions against Moscow.

Jon Finer, the principal deputy national security adviser, said Tuesday: “We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia’s latest invasion into Ukraine.” He said “latest” was important — “an invasion is an invasion and that is what is under way.”

The White House decided to begin referring to Russia’s actions as an “invasion” because of the situation on the ground, according to a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

The administration resisted initially calling the deployment of troops because the White House wanted to see what Russia was actually going to do. The official added that, after assessing Russian troop movements, it became clear it was a new invasion.

LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Britain is slapping sanctions on five Russian banks and three wealthy individuals over Russia’s latest military moves on Ukraine.

Johnson told lawmakers that sanctions would hit Rossiya Bank, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank and the Black Sea Bank. He said three Russian oligarchs with interests in energy and infrastructure -- Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg -- will have their assets frozen and be banned from traveling to the U.K.

All three have already been sanctioned by the United States.

Johnson accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of “establishing the pretext for a full-scale offensive” against Ukraine and said “further powerful sanctions” would follow if that happened.

“This the first tranche, the first barrage of what we are prepared to do and we hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed,” Johnson told British lawmakers.

He also said Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers have been spotted in the separatist Ukrainian regions recognized as independent by Putin. He said that amounts to “a renewed invasion” of Ukraine.

BERLIN — Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Germany has taken steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia.

Scholz told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that his government was taking the measure in response to Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.

The pipeline bringing natural gas from Russia to Germany has long been criticized by the United States and some European countries who argue that it increases Europe’s reliance on Russian energy supplies.

Scholz said that the government had decided to “reassess” the certification of the pipeline, which hasn’t begun operating yet.

“That will certainly take time, if I may say so,” he said.

MOSCOW — Russia says its recognition of independence for areas in eastern Ukraine extends to territory currently held by Ukrainian forces.

The statement Tuesday further raises the stakes amid Western fears that Moscow could follow up on Monday’s recognition of rebel regions with a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia has recognized the rebel regions’ independence “in borders that existed when they proclaimed” their independence in 2014.

Ukrainian forces later reclaimed control of large part of both regions during a nearly eight-year conflict that has killed over 14,000 people.
