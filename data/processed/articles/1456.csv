The ""dire"" situation in the besieged city of Mariupol may be a ""red line"" in the path of negotiations, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has said.

In an interview with CBS News, Mr Kuleba also said there had not been any recent diplomatic communications between Russia and Ukraine at the level of their foreign ministries.

The foreign minister went on to say he was expecting ""intensification of heavy fighting in eastern Ukraine"" in the coming weeks.



Mr Kuleba said: ""We didn't really have any contacts with Russian diplomats in recent weeks at the level of foreign ministries.

""The only level of contact is the negotiating team that consists of the representatives of various institutions and members of parliament.

""They continue their consultations at the expert level but no high level talks are taking place.""

Civilian casualties in Ukraine are set to soar as Russia steps up its “reckless and indiscriminate” attacks, a top British general has warned.

Chief of Defence Intelligence Jim Hockenhull said Russian forces had been “bedevilled” by problems since last month’s invasion and were now pursuing a “strategy of attrition”.

He warned this meant increased civilian casualties and an even worse humanitarian crisis.

Lieutenant General Hockenhull added: “The Kremlin has so far failed to achieve its original objectives.

“It has been surprised by the scale and ferocity of Ukrainian resistance and has been bedevilled with problems of its own making.

“Russian operations have changed. Russia is now pursuing a strategy of attrition.

“This will involve the reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower. This will result in increased civilian casualties, destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure and intensify the humanitarian crisis.

“Putin has reinforced his control over Russian domestic media, the Kremlin is attempting to control the narrative, hide operational problems, and obscure high Russian casualty numbers from the Russian people.”

It is understood Western officials are now concerned that Russia might use unguided aerial dumb bombs, which risk causing significant casualties among civilians even if initially aimed at military targets.

It comes after Boris Johnson spoke to Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy again today, in which he discussed stepping up military support.

Some three million people have fled the country since the conflict began, with the majority of Ukrainians seeking refuge in Poland.

Air strikes continued last night as sirens were heard in the western city of Lviv, followed by the sound of explosions and a column of smoke, a few miles from the city centre.

However, little activity by Russian forces has been reported over last 24 hours, according to US official.

The UK's Ministry of Defence has said Putin's invasion is ""faltering"" due to logistical problems as Russian troops were forced to divert to defend supply lines.

The West is prepared, she says, for all eventualities, including the use of chemical or nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

She said: “It’s very clear to us that what has already happened in Ukraine crosses the threshold on war crimes. We’re collecting the evidence for that to be able to hold Putin to account.”

However, she agrees that the West needs to learn the lesson of failing to do enough to curb Russia since the Cold War.

She said: “It goes right back to the end of the Cold War, when we reduced our defence spending.

“I think the West took its eye off the ball during the Blair years and right through.

“There were a series of pivotal moments.
