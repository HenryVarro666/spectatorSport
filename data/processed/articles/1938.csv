0,54e7fed2-5900-4434-93e2-3d09f1a6d363,"['Nathan Hodge', 'Daria Markina', 'Tim Lister', 'Niamh Kennedy', 'Lindsay Isaac']",2022-03-29 00:00:00,"(CNN) Russia said it would ""drastically reduce"" its military assault on the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv after talks took place between representatives of the two nations on Tuesday that appeared to show signs of progress towards an off ramp to the conflict.

The Russian defense ministry has decided to ""radically, at times, reduce military activity"" in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv, deputy defense minister Alexander Fomin said, state media RIA reported. The ministry's Telegram channel also said that Moscow would ""drastically reduce military activity"" in the cities.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian and Western intelligence assessments suggested in recent days that Russia's advance on Kyiv was stalling.

Talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul, Turkey on Tuesday covered an array of important issues, including the future of the eastern Donbas region, the fate of Crimea, a broad alliance of security guarantors and a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Fomin told reporters that the ongoing discussions regarding the ""neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine"" had contributed to the decision. More details on the steps to reduce hostilities will follow after the Russian delegation returns from Istanbul, Fomin said in remarks carried by Russian state news agency TASS.

Despite the announcement, intense fighting continued around the suburbs of Kyiv on Tuesday afternoon, especially in the northwest and northeast of the city.

Ukraine echoed the announcement regarding the reduction in military action, saying some Russian troops were pulling back from Kyiv and Chernihiv.

""The Russian enemy did not meet the goal of its offensive operation,"" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in an official Facebook update Tuesday, adding that ""certain units"" of Russia's military were withdrawing from battlefronts in the cities.

However it warned of a ""high risk"" of Russian troops attacking military and civilian infrastructure. The Russian military, it claimed, was struggling to reinforce and rotate in new soldiers, due to the ""refusal of personnel to participate in the so-called special operation,"" and are ""not able to staff even one battalion-tactical group.""

Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency, said Russia's operations around Kyiv had failed and it was now impossible for the Russian army to overthrow the Ukrainian government. Putin's war is now focused on the south and the east of the country, he said.

""There is reason to believe that he is considering a 'Korean' scenario for Ukraine,"" said Budanov. ""That is, [Russian forces] will try to impose a dividing line between the unoccupied and occupied regions of our country. In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine.""

Still, enough progress was made during Tuesday's talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations to allow Putin and Zelensky to meet, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said.

Speaking in Istanbul after the talks between the two sides ended, Podolyak said there was now a ""likelihood"" that the two presidents may meet. ""We have documents prepared now which allow the presidents to meet on a bilateral basis,"" he said.

Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti, citing the Russian delegation, also reported the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Zelensky. The head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, called the negotiations ""constructive,"" RIA reported.

Podolyak also said that talks between the two parties will ""continue online 24/7,"" adding that Ukraine needs ""clear legal wording.""

He referred to talks about the status of Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014.

""It was agreed in bilateral format to take a pause for 15 years and conduct bilateral talks on the status of these territories (Crimea and Sevastopol),"" he said.

Ukraine and the West have refused to recognize the Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula, and the pause could be a formula for taking the issue off the table for now.

Podolyak added that they had separately discussed that ""no military hostilities"" take place over those 15 years.

The issue of security guarantees was also discussed. Another member of the Ukrainian team, Davyd Arakhamia said, ""We insist that this be an international treaty, signing all the guarantors of security, which will be ratified."" This would be comparable to NATO's Article 5, which enshrines the principle of collective defense, he said.

Podolyak also said that both sides are still ""discussing a humanitarian ceasefire,"" stressing there are ""many places where humanitarian corridors are needed.""

Over 3.9 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the start of the war, according to UNHCR.

Chernihiv, which lies about halfway between Kyiv and the Russian border, has endured intense shelling in recent weeks. Videos geolocated by CNN show heavy damage in civilian areas.

On Saturday, Chernihiv Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko announced the city was surrounded by Russian forces, leaving no safe pathways in or out.

He told CNN on Tuesday that between 300 and 400 people, mostly civilians, had been killed in the last three weeks.

""We don't have the exact figure because we can only count those who died in a hospital, but if people die from an explosion, we cannot always identify them,"" Atroshenko said.

Shifting strategies

The United States also believes Russia is executing a major strategy shift and withdrawing some forces from the area around Kyiv, two senior US officials told CNN on Tuesday.

The Russian forces are now pulling back in some areas of the north to focus on gains in the south and east, the US believes. The US has already observed these movements underway, including Russian Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) leaving the surrounding areas around Kyiv, according to the US intelligence.

In the US view, this is not a short-term adjustment to regroup, but a longer-term move as Russia comes to grips with failure to advance in the north.

The US assesses Russia will cover their retreat with air and artillery bombardment of the capital, one of the officials said. US officials caution that Russia could always reverse again if the battle conditions allow.

Russia's suggestion of a reduction in its military action was met with cynicism in the West.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had not seen signs the talks between the two sides were ""moving forward in an effective way.""

""There is what Russia says, and there is what Russia does. We're focused on the latter,"" Blinken said.

The UK agreed with those sentiments, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman saying on Tuesday that Britain will judge Russia by its actions rather than words and that they do not want to see anything less than a ""complete withdrawal"" of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.

Meanwhile, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu said ""consensus and common understanding"" was reached between the opposing delegations on some issues, hailing progress made in particular on the ""top priority of achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible to pave the way for a permanent political solution.""

The ""trickier"" issues are now to be discussed at higher levels, with a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian Foreign Ministers to ""make final adjustments to the common approach,"" he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/russia-reduce-assault-kyiv-plan-intl/index.html

RUSSIA HAS PLEDGED to scale down fighting around two Ukrainian cities including Kyiv following peace talks, but the United States led a chorus of sharp scepticism over Moscow’s intentions.

The talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul raised hopes after more than a month of war that has left thousands dead, and prompted negotiators to suggest a meeting between the two presidents.

On the ground, however, the violence is still having a devastating impact, as Ukraine said at least nine people were killed and 28 wounded today by a Russian airstrike on a government building in the southern city of Mykolaiv.

Following the talks in Turkey, Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said there were “sufficient” conditions for President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to meet in a bid to end Europe’s worst conflict in decades.

Zelenskyy said today he sees “positive” signals from thepeace talks held today, but vowed that Kyiv will not “decrease our defence efforts”.

“We can say that the signals that we hear from the negotiations are positive, but those signals do not drown out the explosions or Russian shells,” Zelenskyy said in a video address this evening.

Zelenskyy also expressed skepticism about Moscow’s stated plan of a military scaleback, saying: “We will not decrease our defense efforts.”

Russian Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said there had been progress in talks on “the neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine”.

“A decision has been made to radically, by several times reduce the military activity” around the capital Kyiv and the city of Chernigiv, he said.

Russia’s chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said there had been a “meaningful discussion” at the talks.

But the United States immediately cast doubt on Moscow’s words, and Western leaders vowed to keep “raising the costs” on Russia for its invasion.

Offensive planned elsewhere?

US officials said that while a small number of Russian forces were stepping back from Kyiv, the vast majority of its positions remained.

“We’re not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.

“We all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine … It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over.”

A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined in the distrust, saying: “We will judge Putin and his regime by his actions and not by his words.”

US President Joe Biden meanwhile spoke with Johnson and the leaders of France, Germany and Italy as they sought to harden their unified stance against Moscow.

“The leaders affirmed their determination to continue raising costs on Russia for its brutal attacks in Ukraine as well as to continue supplying Ukraine with security assistance,” the White House said in a readout of the call.

Following today’s announcements, European and US stock markets lifted and oil prices fell by 5% as supply fears eased, while the ruble surged 10% against the dollar.

Hours earlier a Russian strike against the regional government headquarters in Mykolaiv left nine dead, officials said, adding to a toll estimated by Zelenskyy at 20,000 so far.

Ukraine’s fighters pushed back Russian forces from around the city in recent days and have recaptured territory in other parts of the country, including the suburban town of Irpin outside Kyiv – an important gateway to the capital.

‘Crime against humanity’

In response to the invasion, the West has imposed crushing economic sanctions and many companies have exited Russia.

There have also been several rounds of diplomatic expulsions, which continued today with Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands announcing a total of 42 diplomats would be expelled.

Russia has hit back against Western sanctions, saying its gas deliveries to the European Union must now be paid for in rubles.

“Nobody will supply gas for free. This is just impossible. And it can only be paid in rubles,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Russia also said it was expelling 10 diplomats from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in a tit-for-tat move.

While Ukraine’s forces are counterattacking in the north, they are struggling to retain control of the devastated southern port city of Mariupol.

Russian forces have encircled the city and are conducting steady and indiscriminate bombardment, trapping an estimated 160,000 people with little food, water or medicine.

At least 5,000 people there have already died, according to one senior Ukrainian official who estimated the real toll may be closer to 10,000.

Zelenskyy said the Russian siege constituted a “crime against humanity, which is happening in front of the eyes of the whole planet in real time”.

As he opened the Russia-Ukraine talks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged the delegations to “put an end to this tragedy”.

Russian oligarch and Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, who has been hit by Western sanctions, was also in attendance.

The Kremlin said he was acting as an intermediary and denied reports he had been poisoned during previous talks in Ukraine.

UN nuclear visit

Ukraine’s foreign ministry called the Mariupol situation “catastrophic,” saying Russia’s assault from land, sea and air had turned a city once home to 450,000 people “into dust”.

France, Greece and Turkey are hoping to launch a mass evacuation of civilians from Mariupol within days, according to Macron.

But the French president, after speaking with Putin today, said conditions for such an operation were not yet met.

Biden has expressed his “moral outrage” at the conduct of the war, and ruffled feathers recently by suggesting Putin could not remain in power. He has since denied seeking regime change in Russia as US policy.

The conflict has raised fears over nuclear safety after Russia seized several facilities, including Chernobyl, site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster.

The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN atomic watchdog, was visiting Ukraine today.

“We must act now to help prevent the danger of a nuclear accident,” IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said on Twitter.

Western and Ukrainian officials believe that Moscow now hopes to move more troops to the Donbas area to encircle Ukrainian forces there.

“The Russian General Staff seems to have decided to send the forces ... to the east to surround and defeat the most capable Ukrainian defence grouping in the Donetsk and Luhansk region,” explained Ukraine’s Centre for Strategic Studies in a recent briefing note.

“If successful, it will cut off Ukraine from the Black and Azov Seas and return to the siege of Kyiv,” added the centre, which is led by Andriy Zahorodniuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister.

‘Bombs fly anywhere’

Vlada, the young student who spoke to The Telegraph, was reluctant to provide identifying information.

But she did say the intensity of the fighting now was far worse than that of 2014 and 2015. “Now everything is scarier and louder ... bombs fly anywhere,” she said.

“These can hit schools, houses, kindergartens, factories, public places such as parks. It can be just in the middle of the street,” she said.

She added that “they are specifically targeting civilians”, but seemed to be unsure as to whether the attacks were carried out by Russian or Ukrainian forces. However, Russia’s previous use of false flag attacks to stoke up anti-Ukrainian sentiment points to the former.

And she warned that like many Ukrainian cities caught up in the war, essential supplies were running out.

“There has been no hot water in the whole city for a month now and, until recently, cold water was turned on once a day for two hours, then turned off,” she said. “Now, water supplies are running low and water is now turned on once every two days.
