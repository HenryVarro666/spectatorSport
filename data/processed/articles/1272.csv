The horror inflicted on civilians sheltering inside a Mariupol theatre that was bombed by Russian jets last week has been laid bare as the first footage from inside the destroyed building emerged today.

Never-before-seen video shows injured civilians covered with dust filing out of the Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre after it was near-totally destroyed in Russian bombs aimed at building on March 16 despite a large inscription saying 'children' being clearly visible on the pavement outside.

It came as city councillors said accounts they had been given from survivors of the bombing suggested that at least 300 people had died in the attack. If confirmed, it would mark the single largest losses of innocent life during the month-long war to date.

'From eyewitnesses, information is emerging that about 300 people died in the Drama Theatre of Mariupol following strikes by a Russian aircraft,' Mariupol city hall wrote on Telegram.

'I do not want to believe in this horror. Until the last moment I want to believe that everyone managed to escape. But the words of those who were inside the building at the time of this terrorist act say the opposite,' officials said.

Petr Andryuschenko, advisor to deputy mayor of Mariupol, said in a separate interview with the BBC that 600 people had been sheltering in the theatre at the time it was struck and that the 300 who are now presumed dead were in a bomb shelter underneath it which got buried in the rubble.

The exact death toll is still uncertain because rescuers have not yet been able to get into the shelter because Russia continues shelling the area. However, it is presumed that all those inside have now died.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week following the strike that hundreds of people, believed mostly to be women and children, had taken in the building at the time of the attack.

Mariupol city hall said Friday the theatre was destroyed in a 'cynical' attack and claimed that Russia knew civilians were taking refuge in the building.

Zelensky says nearly 100,000 people are trapped without food, water or power in the besieged city and enduring fierce shelling by Russian forces.

The leader of Russia's southern republic of Chechnya said Thursday that forces from his region had taken control of Mariupol city hall and hoisted the Russian flag.

Mariupol has been the scene of some of the worst devastation of the war, which has seen Russia relentlessly besiege and pummel Ukraine's cities.

The misery inside them is such that nearly anyone who can is trying to leave and those left behind face desperate food shortages in a country once known as the breadbasket for the world.

In the shelled city of Kharkiv, mostly elderly women came to collect food and other urgent supplies. In the capital of Kyiv, ashes of the dead are piling up at the main crematorium because so many relatives have left, leaving urns unclaimed.

For civilians unable to join the flood of refugees from Ukraine, the days of plenty in the country are becoming just a fading memory, as the war grinds into a second month.

With Ukrainian soldiers battling Russia's invasion force to a near stalemate in many places and the president urging people to remain steadfast, the U.S. and the European Union announced a move to further squeeze Russia: a new partnership to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian energy and slowly squeeze off the billions of dollars the Kremlin gets from sales of fossil fuels.

In Ukraine, the war for hungry civilians is increasingly being counted in precious portions of food, and block of cheese now goes a very long way.

Fidgeting with anticipation, a young girl in Kharkiv watched intently this week as a volunteer's knife cut through a giant slab of cheese, carving out thick slices - one for each hungry person waiting stoically in line.

Hanna Spitsyna took charge of divvying up the delivery of food aid from the Ukrainian Red Cross, handing it out to her neighbors. Each got a lump of the cheese that was cut under the child's watchful gaze, dropped chunk by chunk into plastic bags that people in line held open like hungry mouths.

Rescuers have been trying to excavate the remains of the theatre for more than a week, but say they cannot get close to the ruins because Russia continues to shell it

If the death toll from the theatre bombing is confirmed, it would mark the single-largest loss of civilian life to date and provide more evidence that Russia is committing war crimes (pictured, the destroyed building)

Mariupol has been surrounded by Russian forces for more than a month - starved of food, water, and reinforcements in an effort to soften up defences, before troops moved into the city. Chechen special forces now claim to have caputred the city hall, amid fierce fighting close to the centre

UN identifies mass grave in besieged city of Mariupol The United Nations said today it was looking into reports of mass graves inside Mariupol, including one with at least 200 corpses. The head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Matilda Bogner, said her investigative team was working to determine the full scale of civilian casualties. 'One mass grave we've been able to get satellite information on, and we estimate that one of those mass graves holds about 200 people,' she said. However, 'that does not mean all those people are civilian casualties', she added. The UN's figures do not include the deaths of military personnel, or those who have died from other causes during a war. Bogner noted that council leaders in Mariupol have estimated more than 2,000 civilian deaths in the city following Russia's military invasion on Feb. 24. Overall, the rights office has counted at least 1,035 civilians killed in Ukraine and 1,650 injured but Bogner said it doesn't have a 'the full picture of locations that have seen intense fighting, in particular Mariupol and Volnovakha.' The office has acknowledged that its tally is likely to underestimate the actual toll. She went on to say that the Mission's strict methodology in counting casualties in Ukraine's conflict has yielded 'very few' confirmed casualties in Mariupol, largely because of difficulties getting access in and information out of the besieged port city. The cities of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy in the east have also endured devastating bombardment. Chernihiv was effectively surrounded by Russian forces, its governor said. In Kharkiv, officials said six people had been killed by the shelling of an aid distribution site. Video showed a blast striking a car park where scores of people were queuing. Reuters was able to confirm it was filmed outside a supermarket in Kharkiv. Advertisement

'They brought us aid, brought us aid for the elderly women that stayed here,' Spitsyna said. 'All these people need diapers, swaddle blankets and food.'

Unable to sweep with lightning-quick speed into Kyiv, their apparent aim on Feb. 24 when the Kremlin launched the war, Russian forces are instead raining down shells and missiles on cities from afar.

The outskirts of Kharkiv were shrouded by foggy smoke Friday, with shelling constant since early in the morning. In a city hospital, several wounded soldiers arrived, with bullet and shrapnel wounds, a day after doctors treated a dozen civilians. Even as doctors stabilized the direst case, the sound of shelling could be heard in the surgery ward.

Russia's military claimed Friday that it destroyed a massive Ukrainian fuel base used to supply the Kyiv region's defenses, with ships firing a salvo of cruise missiles, according to the Interfax news agency. Videos on social media showed an enormous fireball explosion near the capital.

For civilians, the misery has become unrelenting. Kyiv, like other cities, has seen its population dramatically reduced in the vast refugee crisis that has seen more than 10 million displaced and at least 3.5 million fleeing the country entirely. In the capital, over 260 civilians have died and more than 80 buildings been destroyed since the start of the war.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged his country to keep up its military defense and not stop 'even for a minute.' Zelenskyy used his nightly video address on Thursday to rally Ukrainians to 'move toward peace, move forward.'

'With every day of our defense, we are getting closer to the peace that we need so much. . We can't stop even for a minute, for every minute determines our fate, our future, whether we will live.' He said thousands of people, including 128 children, died in the first month of the war. Across the country, 230 schools and 155 kindergartens have been destroyed. Cities and villages 'lie in ashes,' he said.

At an emergency NATO summit in Brussels Thursday, Zelenskyy pleaded with the Western allies via video for planes, tanks, rockets, air defense systems and other weapons, saying his country is 'defending our common values.'

In a video address to EU leaders, meanwhile, Zelenskyy thanked them for working together to support Ukraine and impose sanctions on Russia, including Germany's decision to block Russia from delivering natural gas to Europe through the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline. But he lamented that these steps were not taken earlier, saying there was a chance Russia would have thought twice about invading.

While millions of Ukrainians have fled west, Ukraine accused Moscow of forcibly removing hundreds of thousands of civilians from shattered cities to Russia to pressure Kyiv to give up. Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine's ombudsperson, said 402,000 people, including 84,000 children, had been taken against their will into Russia, where some may be used as 'hostages' to pressure Kyiv to surrender.

The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated, but said they were from predominantly Russian-speaking regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine and wanted to go to Russia. Pro-Moscow separatists have been fighting for control for nearly eight years in those regions, where many people have supported close ties to Russia.

In Chernihiv, where an airstrike this week destroyed a crucial bridge, a city official, Olexander Lomako, said a 'humanitarian catastrophe' is unfolding as Russian forces target food storage places. He said about 130,000 people are left in the besieged city, about half its prewar population.

Russia said it will offer safe passage starting Friday to 67 ships from 15 foreign countries that are stranded in Ukrainian ports because of the danger of shelling and mines.

Russian forces fired two missiles late Thursday at a Ukrainian military unit on the outskirts of Dnipro, the fourth-largest city in the country, the regional emergency services said. The strikes destroyed buildings and set off two fires, it said. The number of dead and wounded was unclear.

With the U.S. and others expanding sanctions on Russia, Moscow sent a signal that the measures have not brought it to its knees, reopening its stock market but only allowing limited trading to prevent mass sell-offs. Foreigners were barred from selling, and traders were prohibited from short selling, or betting prices would fall.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it has been told by Ukrainian authorities that Russian shelling is preventing worker rotations in and out of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. It said Russian forces have shelled Ukrainian checkpoints in the city of Slavutych, home to many Chernobyl nuclear workers, 'putting them at risk and preventing further rotation of personnel to and from the site.'

Meanwhile, Kyiv and Moscow gave conflicting accounts about the people being relocated to Russia and whether they were going willingly - as Russia claimed - or were being coerced or lied to.

Russian Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev said the roughly 400,000 people evacuated to Russia were being provided with accommodations and payments and had voluntarily left eastern Ukraine.

But Donetsk Region Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said that 'people are being forcibly moved into the territory of the aggressor state.'

Among those taken, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry charged, were 6,000 residents of Mariupol, the devastated port city in the country's east.

Kyrylenko said that Mariupol's residents have been long deprived of information and that the Russians feed them false claims about Ukraine's defeats to persuade them to move to Russia.

'Russian lies may influence those who have been under the siege,' he said.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10651503/Ukraine-war-video-shows-inside-Mariupol-theatre.html

KYIV: About 300 people were killed in the Russian airstrike last week on a Mariupol theater that was being used as a shelter, Ukrainian authorities said Friday in what would make it the war's deadliest known attack on civilians yet.

Meanwhile, in what could signal an important narrowing of Moscow's military objectives, the US said Russian forces appear to have halted, at least for now, their ground offensive aimed at capturing the capital, Kyiv, and are concentrating more on the fighting for control of the Donbas region in the country's southeast, a shift the Kremlin seemed to confirm.

Col-Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, said the main objective of the first stage of the operation, reducing Ukraine's fighting capacity, has ""generally been accomplished"", allowing Russian forces to focus on ""the main goal, liberation of Donbas"".

The seeming shift in Moscow's stated war aims -- after weeks in which Vladimir Putin denied Ukraine's right to exist as an sovereign country and appeared bent on capturing many of its cities and toppling its government, could point to a possible exit strategy for Russia, which has suffered fiercer resistance and heavier losses than anticipated.

The Donbas is the largely Russian-speaking eastern part of the country where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014 and where many residents have expressed support for Moscow.

In Mariupol, the bloodshed at the theatre fueled allegations Moscow is committing war crimes by killing civilians, whether deliberately or by indiscriminate fire.

For days, the government in the besieged and ruined port city was unable to give a casualty count for the March 16 bombardment of the grand, columned Mariupol Drama Theater, where hundreds of people were said to be taking cover, the word ""CHILDREN"" printed in Russian in huge white letters on the ground outside to ward off the aerial attack.

In announcing the death toll on its Telegram channel Friday, the city government cited eyewitnesses.

But it was not immediately clear how witnesses arrived at the figure or whether emergency workers had finished excavating the ruins.

US President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Friday the theatre bombing was an ""absolute shock, particularly given the fact that it was so clearly a civilian target"".

He said it showed ""a brazen disregard for the lives of innocent people"".

The scale of devastation in Mariupol, where bodies have been left unburied amid bomb craters and hollowed-out buildings, has made information difficult to obtain.

But soon after the attack, the Ukrainian Parliament's human rights commissioner said more than 1,300 people had taken shelter in the theatre, many of them because their homes had been destroyed.

The building had a basement bomb shelter, and some survivors did emerge from the rubble after the attack.

""This is a barbaric war, and according to international conventions, deliberate attacks on civilians are war crimes,"" said Mircea Geoana, NATO's deputy secretary-general.

He said Putin's efforts to break Ukraine's will to resist are having the opposite effect: ""What he's getting in response is an even more determined Ukrainian army and an ever more united West in supporting Ukraine.""

While the Russians continue to pound the capital from the air, they appear to have gone into a ""defensive crouch"" outside Kyiv and are focused more on the Donbas, a senior US defense official said.

""They don't show any signs of being willing to move on Kyiv from the ground,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe an internal US military assessment of the war.

The official also said the US has seen indications that Russia is beginning to draw on Russian soldiers in Georgia for deployment to Ukraine.

The official offered no numbers and no timeline for the move.

Britain's Ministry of Defence said Ukrainian forces have been counterattacking and have been able to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 km (22 miles) east of Kyiv as Russian troops fall back on their overextended supply lines.

In the south, logistical problems and Ukrainian resistance are slowing the Russians as they look to drive west toward the port of Odesa, the ministry said.

The Russian military said 1,351 of its soldiers have died in Ukraine and 3,825 have been wounded, though it was not immediately clear if that included pro-Moscow separatist forces fighting in the east or others not part of the Defence Ministry, such as the National Guard.

Earlier this week, NATO estimated that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in four weeks of fighting.

Moscow is bristling at the tightening noose of sanctions around Russia's economy.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Western pressure amounts to total war.

""And the goals are not hidden,"" he said.

""They are declared publicly, to destroy, break, annihilate, strangle the Russian economy and Russia on the whole.""

For civilians, the misery is growing more severe in Ukrainian towns and cities, which increasingly resemble the ruins that Russian forces left behind in their campaigns in Syria and Chechnya.

In the village of Yasnohorodka, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) west of Kyiv, Russian troops who were there earlier in the week appeared to have been pushed out as part of a counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces.

The tower of the village church was damaged by a blast, and houses on the main crossroads lay in ruins.

Loud explosions and bursts of gunfire could be heard.

""You can see for yourself what happened here. People were killed here. Our soldiers were killed here. There was fighting,"" said Yasnohorodka resident Valeriy Puzakov.

Tens of thousands of people have left Mariupol in the past week, most of them driving out in private cars through dozens of Russian checkpoints.

""Unfortunately, nothing remains of Mariupol,"" said Evgeniy Sokyrko, who was among those waiting for an evacuation train in Zaporizhzhia, the closest urban center to Mariupol and a way station for refugees.

""In the last week, there have been explosions like I've never heard before.""

Oksana Abramova, 42, said she ached for those left behind in the city, who have been cut off from communication with the shelling of cell, radio and TV towers and do not have the means to escape.

""All the time I think about how they are, where they are. Are still hiding, are they alive? Or maybe they are no longer there,"" she said.

In Kyiv, ashes of the dead are piling up at the main crematorium in the capital because so many relatives have left, leaving urns unclaimed.

And the northern city of Chernihiv is all but cut off.

Chernihiv lost its main road bridge over the Desna River to a Russian airstrike this week.

Follow-up shelling then damaged a pedestrian bridge, trapping remaining inhabitants inside the city without power, water and heat, authorities said.

More than half of Chernihiv's prewar population of 285,000 is thought to have fled.

In other developments: ""The US and the European Union announced a move to further squeeze Russia economically: a partnership to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian energy and dry up the billions of dollars the Kremlin gets from the sale of fuel.""

Russia said it would offer safe passage starting Friday to 67 ships from 15 foreign countries that are stranded in Ukrainian ports because of the danger of shelling and mines.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it has been told by Ukrainian authorities that Russian shelling is preventing workers from being rotated in and out of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, which requires constant monitoring of its spent fuel.

Russia's military claimed it destroyed a massive Ukrainian fuel base used to supply the Kyiv region's defences, with ships firing a salvo of cruise missiles, according to the Interfax news agency.

Videos on social media showed an enormous fireball near the capital.

For the vulnerable, the elderly, children and others unable to join millions heading westward, food shortages are mounting in a country once known as the breadbasket for the world.

In relentlessly shelled Kharkiv, hundreds of panicked people took shelter in the subway, and a hospital emergency room filled with wounded soldiers and civilians.

Mostly elderly women lined up stoically to collect food and other urgent supplies this week, as explosions thudded in the distance.

Fidgeting with anticipation, a young girl watched as a volunteer's knife cut through a giant slab of cheese, carving out thick slices, one for each hungry person.

Hanna Spitsyna took charge of divvying up the delivery of food aid from the Ukrainian Red Cross.

Those waiting each got a lump of the cheese, dropped into plastic bags that people in line held open.

""Among those who stayed, there are people who can walk on their own, but many who cannot walk, the elderly,"" Hanna said.

""All these people need diapers, swaddle blankets and food. For a month now, Russian forces have repeatedly attacked Ukrainian medical facilities, striking at hospitals, ambulances, medics, patients and even newborns,"" with at least 34 assaults independently documented by The Associated Press.

With every new attack, the public outcry for war crimes prosecutions against Russian President Vladimir Putin, his generals and top Kremlin advisers grows louder.

To convict, prosecutors will need to show that the attacks are not merely accidents or collateral damage.

The emerging pattern, tracked day by day by the AP, shows evidence of a consistent and relentless onslaught against the very civilian infrastructure designed to save lives and provide safe haven to Ukraine's most vulnerable.

AP journalists in Ukraine have seen the deadly results of Russian strikes on civilian targets first hand: the final moments of children whose tiny bodies were shredded by shrapnel or had limbs blown off; dozens of corpses, including those of children, heaped into mass graves.

""The pattern of attacks will help prosecutors build the case that these are deliberate attacks,"" said Ryan Goodman, professor of law at New York University and former special counsel at the US Department of Defence.

""Prosecutors will draw inferences from how many medical facilities were targeted, how many times individual facilities were repeatedly struck and in what span of time.""

Deliberate attacks on hospitals will likely be a top priority for war crimes prosecutors.

This accounting of attacks on medical facilities is part of a larger effort by the AP and the PBS series Frontline to track evidence of potential war crimes committed during one of the largest conflicts in Europe since the end of World War II.

The War Crimes Watch Ukraine project launched by AP and Frontline includes details of apparent targeted attacks as well as indiscriminate destruction of civilian buildings and infrastructure.

The AP/Frontline online database will continue to be updated as long as the conflict lasts.

The goal is to provide an independent accounting of events, apart from potentially inflated claims by advocates or misinformation spread by state-backed propaganda.

The AP's own reports include strong visual evidence such as photos and videos, along with witness accounts of alleged atrocities.

AP journalists outside Ukraine have confirmed the details of other attacks by interviewing survivors and independently verifying the authenticity of videos and photos from the war zone posted online by local officials and residents.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights confirms at least 1,035 civilians, including 90 children, have died in the four weeks since the start of the war.

Another 1,650 civilians have been wounded.

Those numbers are certainly an undercount since scores of bodies now lie under the rubble of demolished buildings or were hurriedly buried in mass graves, or the deaths occurred in areas now under Russian control.

Still, Russian officials have denied hitting civilian targets, deriding the mounting documentation of atrocities as ""Fake News"" and claiming without evidence that dead and wounded civilians photographed were ""crisis actors.""

Speaking at talks in Turkey about a potential cease-fire, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed concerns about civilian casualties as ""pathetic shrieks"" from Russia's enemies and denied Ukraine has even been invaded.

Military attacks on civilian populations and their property are generally forbidden under international laws governing armed conflicts going back more than a century.

Efforts are already underway by the International Criminal Court in the Hague and Ukrainian prosecutors to compile evidence for future criminal indictments.

Chief ICC prosecutor Karim AA Khan announced last month that his agency had opened an investigation after receiving referrals from 39 nations over potential evidence of war crimes committed in Ukraine.

President Joe Biden has said he believes Putin is a war criminal, and the US government has assessed that members of Russia's armed forces have committed war crimes.

Attacks on medical facilities and staff are considered particularly heinous under international law, which stipulates they must be protected.

Still, bombing a hospital is not necessarily a war crime.

Prosecutors must show that the destruction is intentional or reckless.

But the evidence of such attacks in Ukraine verified by AP and Frontline is both mounting and horrendous, and belies Russian claims that they were staged, self-inflicted or militarily justified.

Russia is bombing ""medical infrastructure on purpose, fighting sick people as if they were military,"" said Pavlo Kovtoniuk, a former deputy minister of health and WHO consultant who co-founded the Ukrainian Healthcare Center, a think tank based in Kyiv that has been documenting attacks on hospitals.

""Bombing hospitals is especially cruel because it shows civilian people that there is no safe place for them on earth,"" he said.

Among the most thoroughly documented strikes was the March 9 bombing of a children's and maternity hospital in Mariupol.

Two AP journalists, the last international media to remain in the city after it was encircled by Russian forces, arrived at the hospital minutes after the explosion.

They saw a smoldering two-story deep crater in the interior courtyard, surrounded by the twisted and burned remains of several cars.

The force of the explosion tore the facades off three surrounding buildings, blowing out the windows and wrecking rooms inside.

The AP journalists took photos and videos of stunned survivors coming out of the hospital.

A pregnant woman being carried on a stretcher held her belly, blood staining her sweatpants, her face pale.

She later died following an emergency cesarean section at another nearby hospital, according to Dr.

Timur Marin, one of the surgeons who tried to save her.

The woman's baby also did not survive.

Another pregnant woman, Mariana Vishegirskaya, her face bloodied, clutched her belongings in a plastic bag and made her way down a set of debris-strewn stairs and out of the ruined hospital.

Vishegirskaya was taken to another nearby hospital, Mariupol Regional Intensive Care, where she gave birth the following day to a baby girl she named Veronika.

""We were lying in wards when glass, frames, windows and walls flew apart,"" she told AP, lying next to her newborn.

Ukrainian authorities say three were killed by the airstrike, including a child.

Another 17 were wounded.

Kremlin officials admitted Russian aircraft had struck the hospital but insisted all patients and staff had been evacuated prior to the bombing.

State media claimed without providing any evidence that the hospital was being used as a base for the Azov Battalion, a small far-right nationalist group often used as casus belli by Putin for false claims that the Ukrainian government is rife with Nazis.

At a UN Security Council meeting the day after the strike, Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia claimed the wounded pregnant women documented by AP journalists were ""crisis actors,"" playing the part of victims in an elaborate plot to frame Russia.

On Twitter, the Russian embassy in London posted two AP photos side-by-side, one depicting Vishegirskaya and another of the pregnant woman who died.

Each was branded in red as ""FAKE"".

Twitter removed the tweet for violating its rules against denying violent events.

Vishegirskaya is a blogger in Mariupol who before the war posted about skin care, makeup and cosmetics; there is no evidence that she was anything but a patient at the hospital.

She posted multiple photos and videos on Instagram documenting her pregnancy in the past few months.

The AP journalists also saw no evidence that the facility was being used as anything other than a hospital.

They saw no military hardware or vehicles among the burned-out wrecks in the courtyard.

Hospitals rooms were filled with beds and medical equipment.

The contention that the victims were actors and the hospitals were military targets ""is preposterous, and no court of law would give it any credence,"" said David Scheffer, who served as US Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues during the Clinton administration.

""Imagine them trying to say it in front of a seasoned panel of judges as if it can be credibly believed.""

Scheffer and Goodman both said prosecutors in any future trial are likely to argue multiple strikes against medical facilities are evidence of an intentional strategy to break the morale of the enemy population.

Russian commanders used similar airstrikes during the Syrian war.

Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group that tracked attacks on medical workers in Syria, documented more than 250 attacks on medical facilities and staff after Russia intervened in the conflict in 2015.

The assaults on medical facilities in Ukraine began with at least two attacks on the very first day of the war.

On Feb 24, a local media organisation posted a photo on Twitter of City Children's Hospital No.1 in Donetsk, struck by an artillery shell that damaged its top floor.

AP found that the photo matches the pictures of the hospital from before the war; the building is clearly marked as a medical facility on maps of the area.

Another photo posted on Twitter showed a large explosion and fire at Central City Hospital in Vuhledar.

AP matched the building in the photo to pre-war images of the hospital in Vuhledar, which is clearly marked as a medical facility on maps.

The advocacy group Human Rights Watch obtained additional photos from the hospital's chief doctor, Natalia Sosyura, who provided the names of the four civilians who died in the strike.

Ten others were reported to have been wounded.

Additional photos published by a Ukrainian media organization showed two burned out vehicles in the hospital's driveway with two bodies covered by blue sheets.

Another photo showed the crumpled nose cone of a rocket.

Chris Weakley, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician and private intelligence analyst, identified the cone as coming from a Russian Tochka ballistic missile, used to carry cluster munitions.

As a former Soviet republic, Ukraine's military also has access to some Russian weapons systems, but there is no evidence Ukraine has been attacking its own hospitals.

In a statement issued March 12, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva, Liz Throssell, said the agency had received ""credible reports of several cases of Russian forces using cluster munitions"" and specifically cited the attack on the Vuhledar.

The stockpiling and use of cluster munitions is banned under an international convention signed by 110 countries, but Russia and Ukraine are not among them.

However, their use in civilian areas is by definition indiscriminate, a violation of international humanitarian law, since the munition scatters small grenade-sized bomblets over a wide area.

On the second day of the war, three more Ukrainian medical facilities were reported to have been hit, including a children's hospital and cancer centre.

Kharkiv Regional Children's Clinical Hospital No.1 also was struck by a cluster bomb munition, wounding one staff member.

Photos posted on the hospital's social media accounts show numerous impact craters on the hospital campus, including one that fell in a playground.

One of the photos shows an unexploded bomblet about the size of a soda bottle on the ground near the front entrance.

Weakley identified it as a Russian-made 9N235 cluster submunition.

A different video verified by AP shows a series of explosions in a building identified on maps as the oncology department of Melitopol City Hospital No.1.

The building in the video matches pre-war imagery of the hospital, which features a large red cross on the facade.

Statistics for the number of Ukrainian medical facilities damaged since Russia invaded vary widely.

The Ukrainian Health Ministry says 248 medical facilities have been damaged, with 13 completely destroyed.

The World Health Organisation, by contrast, said 57 Ukrainian medical facilities have been damaged, some more than once.

The AP and Frontline have only counted those they could independently confirm.

Russian shelling in Lysychansk caused extensive damage to Luhansk Regional Children's Clinical Hospital in early March.

Sergei Haidai, a local government official, said the hospital was hit by at least 10 shells over a two-day period, wounding a surgeon.

AP video from March 11 shows damage to ambulances and buildings at Dergachi Central Hospital, which Mayor Vyacheslav Zadorenko says resulted from a Russian attack on his town.

That video also shows expended cluster rocket canisters impaled in the ground.

Weakley identified them as Russian-made 9M27K cargo rockets, which carry the same bomblets found at the children's hospital in Kharkiv.

Okhmatdyt Children's Hospital in Kyiv, which houses Ukraine's primary pediatric cancer centre, has repeatedly been rocked by explosions since the war began.

Dr Serhii Chernyshuk, the hospital's medical director, said the blasts and shrapnel from Russian missiles and rockets landing nearby have blown-out windows and doors.

To try to keep their patients from the ongoing bombardment, Ohmatdyt's staff moved them into the basement.

An AP journalist who visited the facility on Feb.28 photographed three young cancer patients, their heads bald from chemotherapy.

Two held up sheets of notebook paper with a handwritten message in English: ""Stop War"".

Chernyshuk said he and his staff have been largely living at the hospital, working long hours on little sleep.

""We must support our patients because, in Kyiv and Ukraine, it's terrible for everybody,"" he said.

""But our patients have a different problem, they cannot help themselves. We must do it.""

Yulia Ablamskaya was one of 17 employees inside the Mediland Clinic Kyiv when she says a loud ""boom"" rocked the building in the early morning hours of March 16.

As the chaos unfolded, she hurried to get the three remaining patients at the center to a safer place.

The patients, she said, are all awaiting operations and unable to travel.

""We felt the walls of the building shivering,"" Ablamskaya, an administrator at the clinic, recounted.

""So, we of course jumped up and went to take the patients.""

Once they were safe, she returned to take photos and videos of the damage, which she provided to AP.

They show cracked walls and shattered windows.

There's also evidence Russian forces have intentionally targeted ambulances and medics, including multiple photos posted by Ukrainian health officials showing ambulances riddled with bullet holes.

Video posted online Feb 26 shows an ambulance is engulfed in flames on a rural road outside Kherson after Ukrainian officials say it was struck by Russian heavy weapons fire.

Medics from a second ambulance work feverishly to save a wounded man wearing a red paramedic's uniform who is on the ground, bleeding from his head.

Ukrainian media and government authorities reported the ambulance's driver, Volodymyr Vasyliovych Kovalchuk, and a patient died in the attack, which appears to match a confirmed incident in the WHO database.

Ukrainian Health Minister Viktor Liashko said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that Russian forces have hit 58 emergency vehicles and killed six medics, forcing the government to outfit emergency medical workers with body armor.

What is happening in Ukraine, he said, is worthy of prosecution.

""The bottom line is this is medieval warfare in the Ukraine,"" Crane said.

Russian forces dropped a bomb on the theatre where more than 1,000 civilians – including women and children – were said to be sheltering in the besieged city on March 16, local officials said.

Ukraine officials announced they fear around 300 people were killed in the attack.

Thousands remained trapped in the southern port city with little food, water or power, and repeated attempts to arrange safe passage out of Mariupol, which is surrounded by Russian forces, have failed.

“We have got increasing information on mass graves that are there,” the UN’s Matilda Bogner told journalists by video link from Ukraine, saying some of the evidence came from satellite images. At least one mass grave appeared to hold 200 bodies.

The UN human rights office, which has about 50 staff remaining in Ukraine, has so far counted 1,081 civilian deaths in the war. But verification difficulties meant that toll included “very few” from Mariupol, Bogner said.

“The extent of civilian casualties and the destruction of civilian objects strongly suggests that the principles of distinction, of proportionality, the rule on feasible precautions and the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks have been violated,” she said.

Bogner’s team is investigating alleged human rights violations, including reports Russian forces had shot and killed civilians in their cars as they were fleeing, the disappearances of Ukrainian officials and journalists, and the forced movement of civilians into Russian-held territory.

On Thursday, Mariupol officials claimed about 15,000 civilians had been illegally deported to Russia since the war began on Feb. 24.

Those who manage to flee would find buses awaiting in the nearby city of Berdiansk that would take them to the city of Zaporizhzhia, Vereshchuk said.

“We will do everything in our power so that buses filled with Mariupol residents reach Zaporizhzhia today,” she said Friday.

Ukraine rejects Russia’s demand to surrender decimated Mariupol



Mariupol, which was home to about 400,000 people before the war, has seen heavy Russian bombardment since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into the country one month ago.

The city made international headlines on March 16 when a drama theatre sheltering thousands of residents in its basement was bombed. Satellite photos taken before the attack showed an enormous inscription reading “children” in Russian posted outside the building.

Local officials, citing witness accounts, said on Friday as many as 300 people may have been killed in the strike. It was not immediately clear whether emergency workers had finished excavating the theatre ruins, or how witnesses arrived at those figures.

The city council made clear it was still not possible to determine the exact death toll, and the Ukrainian government has said it’s almost impossible to tell how many have been killed because Mariupol is in chaos and under almost constant bombardment.

Ukrainian officials have said that roughly 130 people were rescued from the rubble, and that the theatre basement had withstood the attack.

Russia has denied bombing the theatre. The Kremlin claims Russian forces have not targeted civilians in the war.

Putin’s war on Ukraine has stalled on most fronts. Russia has failed to capture a single major Ukrainian city, seize the capital Kyiv or swiftly topple President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government.

Russia calls the war, which is the biggest attack on a European state since the Second World War, a “special military operation” to disarm Ukraine and protect it from “Nazis.”

The West describes it as a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression to subdue a country Putin describes as illegitimate.

Peace talks have been ongoing throughout the war, but have yet to produce any breakthroughs.
