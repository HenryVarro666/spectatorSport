0,381daa76-ba22-41a6-8af7-051d9b7aee6b,[],2022-03-17 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — Russia is still struggling to supply its forces in Ukraine with the most basic requirements three weeks after its troops invaded the neighboring country on Feb. 24, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday.

“They clearly were not prepared for them to be in the position they are three weeks in, basically frozen around the country on multiple lines of axes, struggling to fuel themselves and to feed their troops and to supply them with arms and ammunition [while] meeting a very determined Ukrainian resistance,” the official said.

Since their war on Ukraine began, Russia’s advance through the country and toward its capital city has gone slower than the U.S. believes Russian President Vladimir Putin expected, according to the official.

The initial advance of Russian forces into Ukraine was quickly stalled when they first suffered supply shortages within the invasion’s first week, the official said.

""We talked back in week one about how they hadn't planned properly for logistics and sustainment, how they were struggling with fueling and even feeding their troops,” the official said. “We've seen them try to overcome some of those … issues, but they're still struggling to sustain their troops in the field.""

The U.S. has also seen “anecdotal indications” that Russian morale is lagging due to “poor leadership, lack of information that the troops are getting about their mission and objectives"" and their surprise at ""being resisted as fiercely as they have been,” the official said.

The Ukraine Foreign Affairs Ministry on Thursday said Ukrainians had killed about 14,000 Russian troops and destroyed 86 jets, 108 helicopters, 444 tanks and 1,435 armored vehicles. The U.S. to date has been unable to verify the loss counts of either military.

So far, Putin has not tried to move additional supplies, equipment or forces into Ukraine since sending in the more than 170,000 troops and equipment he spent months stacking along the country’s borders with Belarus and Russia, the official said.

However, the U.S. has seen some indications that Russia might be considering options to do so, the official said, calling it “noteworthy” to see a need for resupply three weeks into a war.

“We absolutely think that while [the Russians] still have the majority of their combat power available, [the fact that] they're talking about resupply and resourcing tells you that they are beginning to get concerned about longevity here,” the official said.

As of Thursday, Russian forces still had not made progress toward Kyiv and remained about 18 miles east of the capital city’s center, the official said. Ukrainian forces continue to control the nearby city of Brovary despite Russian assaults.

Chernihiv, about 88 miles north of Kyiv, remains isolated, as well as Mariupol in the south, where Russian forces have been launching long-range missiles for more than a week.

In southwest Ukraine, the U.S. has seen some Russian navy surface ships in the Black Sea, including a frigate, two amphibious ships and a mine-warfare ship, the official said. However, there have been no indications that an imminent amphibious assault is expected.

Though Russians remain stalled, the official said Ukraine is not a ""static environment — there's a lot of fighting going on.”

“The reason why they haven't been able to move forward is because [Ukrainians] are very actively resisting any movement by the Russians, so it's not like a stalemate where both sides are just going to camp out,” the official said. “They are actively resisting any movement by the Russians.”

Since the start of the war, Russia has launched more than 1,000 missiles at Ukraine, the official said. In recent days, the invading forces have been relying more and more on non-precision-guided munitions, known as “dumb bombs,” which tend to cause more civilian casualties due to their lower target-accuracy rate.

Russia’s supply problems might also have contributed to their increased use of dumb bombs, the official said.

""We think it's possible that they might be either conserving their precision-guided munitions or beginning to experience shortages,” the official said.

Many civilians have already died in Ukraine as Russian forces continue to attack the country, often striking civilian infrastructure including hospitals, schools and apartment complexes.",https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2022-03-17/ukraine-russia-war-pentagon-invasion-food-fuel-5380323.html
1,381daa76-ba22-41a6-8af7-051d9b7aee6b,['Al Jazeera Staff'],2022-03-17 00:00:00,"Washington has announced an additional $800m in security aid including drones and anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems.

US President Joe Biden has earmarked an additional $800m in military equipment that will be directly transferred to Ukraine.

The announcement on Wednesday came the same day Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to the US Congress for more security aid to repel the Russian invasion, which has killed at least 1,834 civilians since it began on February 24.

The package includes a surge in US-provided anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons, as well as drones. The aid demonstrates Washington’s “commitment to sending our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defence”, Biden said.

He later told a reporter he thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin is a “war criminal”, although White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki later said Biden was “speaking from his heart”, and the State Department was still in the process of determining if Putin has indeed committed war crimes.

The latest pledge does not include any reference to fighter jets that Zelenskyy has called for during the ongoing Russian attacks. The United States and other NATO allies have so far resisted Zelenskyy’s appeal to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine over fears it would lead to a larger confrontation between the bloc and Russia.

The White House also said Washington is “helping the Ukrainians acquire additional, longer-range” air-defence systems, but did not provide further details.

The most recent package brings the total US security aid to Ukraine announced since the Russian invasion began to $1bn. The Biden administration previously approved another $1bn in aid before the invasion began.

What’s in the latest package?

The Pentagon will send 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems in the latest round of security aid. The systems can be used to defend against helicopters and low-flying aircraft using infrared sensors to find a target.

The package will also include thousands of anti-tank weapons, including 2,000 Javelin systems, a shoulder-mounted weapon that is guided by a computer for deadly accuracy.

The US will also transfer 100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems, or drones, as well as an array of lighter weapons – 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 shotguns – and additional body armour, helmets and ammunition.

What has the US previously given Ukraine?

Washington previously provided Ukraine with more than 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems and about 2,600 Javelin weapons.

In addition, the Pentagon gave Ukraine five Mi-17 helicopters, three patrol boats, an array of smaller arms, and several radar systems to track artillery, mortar, and drone attacks.

At least 30 countries have upped military assistance to Ukraine since the Russian attack, including Germany, which reversed a longstanding policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/17/whats-in-the-new-us-military-aid-package-to-ukraine

A senior defense official says the U.S., in consultation with allies, is looking into helping Ukraine with long-range air defense systems.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

As Ukraine continues to fight against Russia, the U.S. and its allies are sending thousands of shoulder-fired antitank and antiaircraft weapons to the besieged nation. Now there is talk about sending an even more formidable weapon - the S-300, a mobile air defense system that can target aircraft more than 30,000 feet in the air. To that end, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met today with officials from Slovakia, a NATO ally. Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad' talked about the sophisticated air defense system.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAROSLAV NAD': We've been in discussion with United States, with Ukraine and also with other allies on possibility to deploy or to send or to give ground assistance to Ukrainians. And we are willing to do so. We're willing to do so immediately when we have a proper replacement.

CHANG: All right. Joining us now to talk about the equipment the U.S. and NATO allies are providing is NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Hi, Tom.

TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.

CHANG: All right. So tell us more about this S-300. Like, how important will this be to Ukraine's arsenal if they get it?

BOWMAN: Well, it's very sophisticated and a powerful missile defense system, Ailsa. Ukraine already uses these long-range systems, and some of them have been destroyed by Russian forces. Ukraine has been asking for these for weeks. And - but this is the first indication something could happen. And, of course, it would allow Ukraine to target Russian aircraft at a much higher altitude. The Slovak defense minister wants some sort of backfill or replacement if he provides this air defense system, as he just mentioned. Secretary Austin was asked about the U.S. maybe providing the Slovaks with Patriot missile defense systems. He'd only say we're, you know, in discussions. And a senior defense official told reporters later after this meeting that the U.S. is working hard to get Ukraine some of these long-range systems.

CHANG: OK. Well, these talks come as the U.S., I know, is already providing other weaponry. Can you just talk about that? Like, what else has the U.S. supplied up to this point?

BOWMAN: Well, thousands of shoulder-fired weapons - there's the javelin, the antitank weapon, which is very effective. There've been videos of them destroying Russian tanks - also Stingers, which target helicopters at lower levels. The U.S., you may remember, gave these to the Afghan insurgents back in the 1980s. And they devastated the Soviet military. Also, there's a drone called, get this, the Switchblade. It's just six pounds and can be carried...

CHANG: Wow.

BOWMAN: ...In a backpack. And it can fire a grenade - very useful against armored vehicles and troops. All of these will continue to stall the Russians, who haven't really moved much toward Kyiv. They're still about 15 kilometers from the city center.

CHANG: Yeah. Russian forces have not made much headway in certain parts of the country. Do U.S. officials know exactly why that is?

BOWMAN: Well, a number of reasons - heavy resistance from Ukrainian forces, a lack of Russian coordination with their attacks - with airstrikes, armor and troops - also, mushy ground, which is bad for tanks and other armor. They have to stay on the roads, where Ukrainians are using these shoulder-fired munitions to hit them quite hard, sometimes darting between houses, I'm told, and firing at the armored vehicles on the road. But officials say the Russians still have a lot of firepower, missiles fired from inside Russia and also from the Black Sea. Also, outside Kyiv, U.S. intelligence is picking up more Russian artillery pieces moving up. And they could be used to pound Kyiv - really create kind of a siege, which, of course, would be much more deadly for civilians.

CHANG: Well, as this invasion wears on, I mean, in many ways, Tom, it feels like this whole invasion is more of an attempt to just break the will of the Ukrainian people. And I'm wondering, if it is that, could that mean more targeting of civilian sites?

BOWMAN: No, absolutely - just like we heard from Tim at Mariupol - that theater. They're also hitting apartment buildings. And this is why you're hearing President Biden and others starting to use the term war crimes.

CHANG: That is NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Thank you, Tom.

BOWMAN: You're welcome.

One official said Russia had also asked for economic aid to help blunt the harsh sanctions imposed on the country by the United States and its European and Asian allies.

The State Department sent cables to allies saying that China had given positive signals on military aid, a European official said on Monday. The official added that Russia had requested five types of equipment: surface-to-air missiles, drones, armored vehicles, logistics vehicles and intelligence-related equipment.

A senior Pentagon official gave some different details this week, saying the request from Russia included drones, secure radios and even meals ready to eat, rations for troops commonly known as M.R.E.s. The official said the United States had received indications before the Rome meeting that China was inclined to oblige the Russian request.

The officials spoke to The Times on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of diplomatic, military and intelligence matters.

Pentagon officials have detected that the Russian military is having problems with the performance of air-to-ground and ground-to-ground missiles in the war. The Russian ground offensive has stalled in parts of Ukraine, with columns of tanks and other armored vehicles sitting for days on roads. U.S. officials have given a conservative estimate that more than 7,000 Russian troops have been killed, more than the number of American troops killed in over 20 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.

The Russian military has turned to a tactic it used in wars in Chechnya and Syria: firing barrages of missiles, rockets and shells at cities to kill civilians, including many women and children, to try to force a surrender. Although the United Nations has estimated the civilian death toll in Ukraine at 726, it is likely to be much higher; the official toll of civilians killed in the city of Mariupol alone was at least 2,400 earlier this week.

Even with the slaughter, Chinese officials have persisted in supporting Russia. They have blamed the United States for the war and echoed Mr. Putin in criticizing NATO.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The signs are abundant of how Ukraine frustrated Vladimir Putin’s hopes for a swift victory and how Russia's military proved far from ready for the fight.

A truck carrying Russian troops crashes, its doors blown open by a rocket-propelled grenade. Foreign-supplied drones target Russian command posts. Orthodox priests in trailing vestments parade Ukraine’s blue and yellow flag in defiance of their Russian captors in the occupied city of Berdyansk.

Russia has lost hundreds of tanks, many left charred or abandoned along the roads, and its death toll is on a pace to outstrip that of the country’s previous military campaigns in recent years.

Yet more than three weeks into the war, with Putin's initial aim of an easy change in government in Kyiv long gone, Russia’s military still has a strong hand. With their greater might and stockpile of city-flattening munitions, Russian forces can fight on for whatever the Russian president may plan next, whether leveraging a negotiated settlement or brute destruction, military analysts say.

Despite all the determination of Ukraine’s people, all the losses among Russia’s forces and all the errors of Kremlin leaders, there is no sign that the war will soon be over. Even if Putin fails to take control of his neighbor, he can keep up the punishing attacks on its cities and people. Ukraine’s president said Russia is trying to starve Ukraine’s cities into submission and that Putin is deliberately creating “a humanitarian catastrophe.""

“His instinct will be always to double down because he’s got himself into a dreadful mess, a huge strategic blunder,” said Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank.

“And I don’t think it’s in his character to try to retrieve that, except by carrying on, going forward,” he said.

Putin’s forces are waging Russia’s largest, most complex combined military campaign since taking Berlin in 1945. His initial objective, which he announced in a television address on Feb. 24 as the invasion began, was to “demilitarize” Ukraine and save its people from “neo-Nazis"" — a false description of Ukraine’s government, which is led by a Jewish president.

Fatefully, Putin underestimated the national pride and battlefield skills that Ukrainians have built up over the past eight years of battling Russian-backed separatists in the country's east.

At the start, Russians thought “they would install, you know, some pro-Russian government and call it a day and declare victory,” said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia’s security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. “That was sort of Plan A, and as near as we can tell, they didn’t really have a Plan B.”

Russia’s first apparent plan — attack key Ukrainian military targets, and make a quick run to Kyiv, the capital — failed immediately. It was foiled by Ukraine’s defenses along with the countless mistakes and organizational failures by a Russian force that had been told it was only mobilized for military drills.

Clarke, the British researcher, related accounts of Russian troops selling communication equipment and fuel out of military vehicles to locals during the weeks they waited on Ukraine’s borders.

With no friendly population to welcome them, Russian forces reverted to tactics from their past offensives in Syria and Chechnya — dropping bombs and lobbing missiles into cities and towns, sending millions of men, women and children fleeing.

Putin’s forces are in position to capture the besieged port city of Mariupol. Overall, Russians appear to be fighting with three objectives now: to surround Kyiv, to encircle spread-out Ukrainian fighters in the east and to break through to the major port city of Odessa in the west, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military and program director at CNA.

Kofman cautions that much of the information on the war is coming from Ukrainians or from their American or other allies. That makes the partial picture skewed and a full picture impossible.

A senior U.S. defense official on Friday said the Russians have launched more than 1,080 missiles since the start of the war and that they retain about 90% of the combat power they had arrayed around Ukraine at the beginning of the invasion.

The U.S. assesses that the airspace over Ukraine remains contested, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the military assessments. The Ukrainian air force is continuing to fly aircraft and employ air and missile defenses..

“Just look at the map, and you just look at how little progress the Russians have been able to make,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said recently.

The math of military conquests and occupation may be against Putin in Ukraine.

Estimates of Russian deaths vary widely. Yet even conservative figures are in the low thousands. That's a much faster pace than in previous Russian offensives, threatening support for the war among ordinary Russians. Russia had 64 deaths in five days of fighting during its 2008 war with Georgia. It lost about 15,000 in Afghanistan over 10 years, and more than 11,000 over years of fighting in Chechnya.

Russia’s number of dead and wounded in Ukraine is nearing the 10% benchmark of diminished combat effectiveness, Gorenburg said. The reported battlefield deaths of four Russian generals — out of an estimated 20 in the fight — signal impaired command, he said.

Researchers tracking only those Russian equipment losses that were photographed or recorded on video say Russia has lost more than 1,500 tanks, trucks, mounted equipment and other heavy gear. Two out of three of those were captured or abandoned, signaling the failings of the Russian troops that let them go.

Meanwhile, Russia needs to limit its use of smart, long-range missiles in case they’re needed in any larger war with NATO, military analysts say. On Saturday, the Russian military said it has used its latest hypersonic missile for the first time in combat, claiming that the Kinzhal, with a range of up to 2,000 kilometers (about 1,250 miles), destroyed an underground warehouse storing Ukrainian missiles and aviation ammunition.

When it comes to the grinding job of capturing and holding cities, conventional military metrics suggest Russia needs a 5-to-1 advantage in urban fighting, analysts say. Meanwhile, the formula for ruling a restive territory in the face of armed opposition is 20 fighters for every 1,000 people — or 800,000 Russian troops for Ukraine’s more than 40 million people, Clarke notes. That's almost as many as Russia's entire active-duty military of 900,000.

On the ground, that means controlling any substantial chunk of Ukrainian territory long term would take more resources than Russia could foreseeably commit.

Other Russian options remain possible, including a negotiated settlement. Moscow is demanding that Ukraine formally embrace neutrality, thus swearing off any alliance with NATO, and recognize the independence of the separatist regions in the east and Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.

Russia's other options include an unrelenting air campaign in which it bombs and depopulates cities as it did in Chechnya and Syria. U.S. officials also warn of the risk of Russian chemical attacks, and the threat of escalation to nuclear war.

“Unless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal — they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation — there will be just constant guerrilla war"" if Russian troops remain, Clarke said.

There are huge discrepancies in the number of casualties and injuries reported by Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Although Moscow consistently reports low numbers, army casualties may be higher than Russian officials say.

“We have looked at them deliberately and discussed the possibility of re-supplying to include replacement troops,” a senior Pentagon defense official said. said on Wednesday, “But we haven’t – we haven’t seen any signs that they already have anything moving in Ukraine. But we do know that they are taking damages every day; loss of people, of equipment. Damage, loss of aircraft.”

on Tuesday, The Armed Forces of Ukraine reported More than 13,500 Russian soldiers have been killed since February 24. He also said that Ukraine’s military has destroyed more than 1,200 Russian armored personnel carriers, 640 vehicles and 404 tanks.

But the director of the US Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General Scott Barrier, estimated a much lower number last week.

“With less confidence, somewhere between [2,000] And 4,000,” Barrier told the House Intelligence Committee. “That number comes from some intelligence sources, but also from open source, and that’s how we pull it together.”

US officials estimate that Russia has deployed more than 82 percent of its forces outside Ukraine.

Russia offered surprisingly low casualties on March 2. The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that 498 Russian soldiers were killed and 1,597 more were wounded.

The losses on both the Russian and Ukrainian sides have been difficult to verify, but talk of Russia sending replacement troops could justify high estimates from the US and Ukraine.

A senior US defense official says there are no signs that replacement troops have yet moved to Ukraine. Although The Ministry of Defense of the United Kingdom says Some have already arrived.

Putin offered Syrian military personnel a monthly salary of $200 to $300 USD for six months, among other “privileges” to join Russia’s fight against Ukraine.

More than 40,000 Syrians are enlisted to fight, according to a report by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR)—a Syrian non-governmental group.

Last week, US Department of Defense (DOD) Russia’s intention to backup was conveyed.

“We find it remarkable that [Russian President Vladimir Putin] “It needs to rely on foreign fighters to complement a very important commitment of combat power inside Ukraine,” a DoD spokesman said.

Russia’s reinforcements may come sooner. Four Russian warships were seen crossing the Strait in northeastern Japan on Wednesday.

7,381daa76-ba22-41a6-8af7-051d9b7aee6b,[],,"The United States says that Ukraine will be given long-range missile defense and Switchblade armed drones, enabling Kyiv’s forces to better defend against Russian aircraft and armor from a distance.

The new arms and equipment that US President Biden announced for Ukraine include:

S-300 long-range missile defense

Ukraine has had the ability to shoot down Russian aircraft and cruise missiles at relatively close quarters. Washington is arranging for it to acquire systems that can strike attacking aircraft from much farther away.

According to a military source, the systems are the Soviet/Russian-made S-300, which like the US-made Patriot system, is a fully automated, ground-based radar-and-missile launcher unit that can detect, track and fire at multiple incoming aerial threats at long distances.

Ukrainians already know how to operate the S-300, and the United States and a number of NATO countries possess the systems or components of them to supply Ukraine.

‘Kamikaze drones’

Washington will send Ukraine 100 Switchblade drones, essentially camera-equipped, remote-controlled flying bombs that can be directed by an operator to find and then, when ready, plunge onto a target, exploding on contact.

Dubbed “kamikaze drones,” Switchblades can extend the range of attack on Russian vehicles and units to beyond the sight of the user. That gives them an advantage over the guided heat-seeking missiles that Ukrainians have used against Russian tanks.

Anti-aircraft Stingers

The United States is also giving 800 more Stingers, which are shoulder-mounted infrared anti-aircraft missiles. The US provided Stingers to Afghan fighters in the 1990s to shoot down Russian helicopters; Ukrainians have used them effectively against Russian helicopters and slower, lower-flying fixed-wing attack aircraft.

‘Saint Javelin’

Western allies have already provided the Ukrainian army with some 17,000 lightweight, shoulder-launched, self-guided missiles which have become the weapon of choice in the ground war. These are being used with great effect to destroy armored vehicles at close quarters.

Among those, the US-made Javelin, with dual charges designed to defeat Russian tanks’ anti-missile defenses, has become legendary in its effectiveness. A popular Ukrainian song extols it and there is now even a viral depiction of “Saint Javelin,” an Eastern iconography-style image of a woman cradling the weapon. Biden said Washington will send 2,000 more javelin missiles to Ukraine.

Guns, ammunition, body armor

The new US arms provisions also include 7,000 other anti-armor weapons, thousands of machine guns, rifles, and grenade launchers, 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition fitting both Russian and NATO standards, and 25,000 sets of body armor and helmets.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-17-2022/

Last month, Russia’s position on Ukraine’s borders looked promising: Moscow had amassed an invasion force with nearly as many troops as Ukraine has in its active-duty military, had spent two decades modernizing its weapons and organization, and was ready to use the lessons learned fighting recent wars in Chechnya and Syria.

But the Russian military is not succeeding in Ukraine. Russia’s plans to conquer Kyiv quickly were delusionally optimistic, and commanders are struggling to fix their problems. Russian troops haven’t demonstrated basic combined arms proficiency — the ability to coordinate between air power, land power and long-range firing — have failed to control the skies, evidently lack stockpiles of precision-guided munitions and are even communicating on open phone lines. They’re looting food and other supplies. It’s possible they have experienced more combat deaths in two weeks than the United States did in the entirety of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.

Yet paradoxically for those of us who ardently hope Ukraine will prevail and push the invading forces out, the deficiencies of the Russian military are exacerbating the damage and risks of the war. And there’s reason to worry that the ineptitude and lack of professionalism that Russian forces have displayed in the first three weeks of the conflict are making fighting considerably more brutal for civilians than a more competent military would — and increasing the prospects that the war escalates.

Military effectiveness is much more than numbers of troops and weapons. The Russian military exhibits no cohesion: Soldiers have been sabotaging their equipment and deserting. That doesn’t happen if officers and noncommissioned officers, who often take the lead in heat-of-the-moment decisions, have control of their units. A lack of control frequently leads to increases in war crimes, as soldiers in the heat of battle lose discipline; in well-regulated militaries, officers are typically restraints on such behavior. In Russia’s military, officers may encourage it and participate.

Russia’s first resort to overcome inadequacies has been to shift its focus from attacking military forces to targeting civilian populations indiscriminately. Its military has shown no compunction in destroying Mariupol as it did Grozny and Aleppo, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s discredited claims that he intends to liberate fellow Slavs. Ukrainian cities that have been surrounded are being deprived of water and food, shelled unmercifully, and — in a signature Russian military move — having their hospitals destroyed. War crimes are not only actions undertaken by poorly disciplined troops; they are policy choices by a government whose military is incapable of achieving its objectives while adhering to the Geneva Conventions. Avoiding such atrocities may not even come into Russia’s thinking — the country partially withdrew from the Geneva Conventions in 2019.

Ukrainian civilian casualties appear to be blessedly low so far under terrible circumstances. Apartment buildings being shelled are largely unoccupied as residents have taken shelter in subway stations, and more than 3 million people have become refugees to escape anticipated Russian depredations. Ukrainians’ courage to protest day after day in occupied cities under the guns of Russian soldiers is profound; it is also notable that Russian soldiers have chosen not to fire on crowds or run over protesters lying down in front of vehicles to prevent their movement. But that restraint is likely to fade as the war grinds on.

Western governments say Russia has now moved its entire invasion force into the country. But Russian forces are so ineffective they’ll need far more troops to sustain the attack, much less conquer and control Ukraine’s major cities. As Stalin is believed to have said, “Quantity has a quality all its own.” But here the reverse is true: Given their quality, Russia doesn’t have the quantity of troops it needs. Russian law prohibits the use of conscripts outside Russian territory, but many of the invaders were conscripts anyway, and half of the Russian army is now committed in Ukraine. Putin claims that army leaders disobeyed him in their use of conscripts, but that charade is unsustainable. So Putin has recruited Chechen and Syrian soldiers, widening the war to involve other states directly. Belarus, a close Russian client state that’s been the base of some operations in Ukraine, may have also been asked for troops but hasn’t yet committed any; China, too, has been asked for support. If China were to enter the war on Russia’s side, the conflict would take on global dimensions — that is, it would become a world war.

Folding in foreigners often detracts from combat effectiveness. They often don’t speak the language or have compatible equipment, complicating communications and resupply. Sophisticated combined arms operations require significant training that host forces may not be able to divert attention from combat to provide. Putin is explicitly recruiting soldiers with reputations for brutality from Syria, Chechnya and the Central African Republic, which bodes ill for restraint in combat and occupation. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov claims to be sending 70,000 troops.

Russia seems to have bad on-the-ground intelligence operations in Ukraine as well. Military operations run on information: knowing where to go, what targets to prioritize, whether you’ve rendered them inoperable. The heads of Russia’s foreign intelligence service have been arrested and their agency raided by the Federal Protective Service (the successor to the KGB) in more than 20 locations, a strong indication that Putin is dissatisfied with their performance or is making them scapegoats for his own failures of judgment. Fear won’t improve the quality of reporting or the dearth of information Russian decision-makers are getting. Local sources become especially important during occupations; Russia clearly doesn’t have them, because it’s already resorting to collective punishments and “disappearing” elected officials to subjugate communities, brutalities that tend to fuel rather than quell insurgencies. Those recourses are likely to be widespread as Russian casualties increase in urban fighting.

Now Russia is conveying its willingness to expand the war geographically, another sign that its initial approach has failed. Russia attacked a Ukrainian military base 10 miles from Poland at which U.S. and other NATO troops trained recently. Attacks on weapons supplies flowing into Ukraine are likely if Russia can find them; but it probably can’t, which means strikes on border points through which weapons are being transferred may be more probable. Assaults on weapons-staging sites in NATO countries would be a major escalation, but Russia has declared the supplies legitimate targets.

Ukraine partisans are likely to operate from neighboring NATO countries, attacking Russian forces and then fleeing into refuge, as the Taliban did into Pakistan. Pressure from such ghost forces strains the discipline of militaries, and we could see Russian commanders disobeying orders and undertaking hot pursuit of their attackers, or the Russian government making a policy choice to target such insurgents or the communities that shield them.

The worse the war goes for Russia, the higher the risk of escalation to chemical or even nuclear weapons. Western intelligence is sounding the alarm that Moscow may attempt a “false flag” operation using chemical weapons, then blame Ukraine. That approach might prove politically useful as Putin wrenches the war narrative from “Russians greeted as liberators after a successful regime change” — which his military couldn’t effectuate — to “Russia must occupy a dangerous, hostile neighbor.”

Putin has several times darkly threatened nuclear escalation, and he’s commanded the military to put nuclear forces on a “special regime of combat duty.” Those threats seem mostly aimed at preventing Western intervention. But Russia’s military doctrine is to “escalate to de-escalate” by using nuclear weapons to force a pause by adversaries when its conventional forces cannot win. And Russia’s conventional forces are not winning. That means we could conceivably see the use of nuclear weapons. Ukraine’s troops are not operating in easily targetable masses — making cities the likely targets. If Russia’s military is forced to retreat, Putin or whoever succeeds him could salve their humiliation by torching a Ukrainian city with a nuclear weapon.

Russia’s military failures are likely to prevent the conquest and long-term occupation of Ukraine, but the invasion is exacting a terrible toll on the country’s people. The weaknesses of Russia’s military could drive the cost much higher — for Ukrainians and the countries assisting their brave defense. Failing militaries can be even more dangerous than successful ones.

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Thursday on Day 22:

U.S. drones heading to Ukraine effective against Russian vehicles and artillery

After the White House on Wednesday announced 100 ""tactical unmanned aerial systems"" would be part of a new $800 million weapon package for Ukraine, a U.S. official confirmed to ABC News these would be small ""Switchblade"" drones.

Unlike long-range Predator drones, which look similar to small planes and fire missiles at targets, Switchblade drones are the missiles, using GPS to guide themselves straight into their targets to detonate their payloads.

The smallest version, the Switchblade 300, fits in a backpack, weighs only 5.5 pounds, and has a range of about six miles. It can be sent into flight from a small mortar tube, its wings extending into place as it exits the launcher. The larger Switchblade 600 weighs nine times more, but carries an anti-armor warhead and can hit targets up to 25 miles away, according to the manufacturer.

Both models have a ""wave-off"" feature so that human operators can abort an attack if civilians appear near the target or if the enemy leaves the area.

The U.S. official could not confirm which versions the U.S. is sending to Ukraine, but a senior U.S. defense official told reporters on Thursday that they would be effective against various targets.

""These tactical UAVs can be useful against Russian vehicles and artillery,"" the senior U.S. defense official said.

Taking out Russian long-range artillery is especially important for Ukraine as Russian forces ramp up their bombardment of major cities.

No Russian progress on Kyiv in 7 days

The Russian forces nearest Kyiv are still about nine miles to the northwest of the city's center, the senior U.S. defense official said. This is the same distance away they were estimated to be last Friday.

They haven't been able to advance because Ukrainian forces ""are very actively resisting any movement by the Russians,"" the official said, but adding that Russia maintains an advantage with ""long-range fires"" -- missiles and artillery.

Although those nearest troops have stalled, other forces are coming to join them from behind, bringing with them long-range artillery pieces.

""So, it appears that they continue to want to conduct a siege of Kyiv, that's what you want to use artillery for,"" the official said. ""We haven't seen that manifest itself, we're just seeing them move them into place.""

The only notable advancement of Russian forces since Wednesday is to the southeast of Kharkiv, where the Pentagon assesses they have taken control of Izyum. The official said their intent is likely to push south toward Donetsk and Mariupol to seal off the Donbas area and prevent Ukrainian troops in the east from moving westward to defend other areas.

Russian warships near Odessa

The U.S. continues to see Russian naval activity ""not far from Odessa"" in the northern Black Sea, the official said. This includes about six surface-war vessels: at least two amphibious landing ships, frigates, and one mine-warfare ship. Despite this activity, there are still no indications of an imminent amphibious assault.

Unlike on Wednesday, there have been no signs of Russian ships shelling towns around Odessa, the official said.

Russian bombardment of cities continues, more civilians hit

Russia has now launched more than 1,000 missiles against Ukraine, according to the official. This is up from an estimate of 980 on Wednesday. These estimates count missile launches, not necessarily effective hits. The official said they could not offer an estimate of how many of these munitions end up being duds.

Again the official said Russians are relying more on ""dumb"" munitions, meaning unguided weapons.

The official said it's not clear why, but said it could be an effort to conserve their precision weapons, or a sign they're running low on them. At any rate, these less-discriminate weapons are seen as a greater threat to civilians.

""We have seen an increase of strikes on civilian infrastructure and civilian targets,"" the official said, but could not quantify the damage or casualties.

S-300s for Ukraine

The official would not directly address questions about whether the U.S. would help facilitate Russian-made S-300 long-range surface-to-air missile systems for Ukraine.

""We are working with allies and partners to continue to provide security assistance to the Ukrainians on short-range and tactical systems as well as long-range systems, to include long-range air defense. And there's a lot that goes into that, and some countries just have access to inventory that are more suitable for the Ukrainians than some of our systems because they're trained on them -- they operate them, they know them, they're comfortable with them. And it's a whole suite of things. And I've stayed away from naming individual systems and I think it's just better if I continue to do that. But we are in active conversations with countries about all these kinds of capabilities to see what they can do to continue to provide support to Ukraine,"" the official said.

Russian disinformation campaign

""In Russia, anecdotally, we see their narratives having more of an effect. But then again, they shut down independent media. The only thing available for most Russians now is state media, and so you would expect that those narratives would be more widely consumed and even more widely believed. But outside of Russia, there's little to no evidence that their information ops are working. In fact, we've seen quite the opposite,"" the official said.

Low Russian morale

The U.S. has anecdotal evidence of low morale in some Russian units, according to the official.

""Some of that is, we believe, a function of poor leadership, lack of information that the troops are getting about their mission and objectives, and I think disillusionment from being resisted as fiercely as they have been,"" the official said.

The official also said it's ""noteworthy"" that Russians are considering bringing in more troops and supplies only three weeks into the invasion. The Pentagon believes this is due to poor logistical planning and stronger-than-expected resistance.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-switchblade-drones-heading-ukraine-target-russian-vehicles/story?id=83512614
