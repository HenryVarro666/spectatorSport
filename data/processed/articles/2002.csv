The exact number hit with punitive measures on Thursday was initially unclear – as a notice from the Treasury said 59 entries had been added to the list, while Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said 65 new sanctions had been announced.

The Treasury issued separate notices on sanctions against Russia and Belarus, with 59 of the latest designations listed in the former and six in the latter, the Foreign Office later clarified.

The Foreign Office said the UK has targeted more than 1,000 individuals and businesses under the Russia sanctions scheme since the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine began on February 24.

Here is a list of some of the key entities and figures named in the latest wave:

Entities

Wagner Group

The Wagner Group is a paramilitary organisation seen as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s private army.

Alfa-Bank

According to the Foreign Office, Alfa-Bank, based in Moscow, ranks among the top 10 largest banks in terms of capital in Russia and Ukraine. It is a separate entity to Alfa-Bank (Ukraine), which has not been sanctioned.

Alrosa

Alrosa is the world’s largest diamond mining company, the Foreign Office said. The business is based in Mirny, Russia, it added, and its market capitalisation is reported as an estimated £4.69 billion.

Individuals

Eugene Shvidler

The Foreign Office said Mr Shvidler is a billionaire oil tycoon with close business links to Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich. Mr Abramovich was added to the UK’s sanctions list on March 10.

Oleg Tinkov

Mr Tinkov is the founder of Tinkoff Bank. His net worth is reported to be an estimated £3.4 billion, the Foreign Office said.

Herman Gref

Mr Gref is the chief executive officer of Sberbank, the largest Russian bank. The Foreign Office said he is a close adviser to Mr Putin and the pair worked together in the St Petersburg government in the 1990s. He served as Mr Putin’s minister of economic development and trade between 2000 and 2007 before taking over at Sberbank, it added.

Galina Danilchenko

Ms Danilchenko was installed by Moscow as the mayor of occupied Melitopol in south-east Ukraine. This is the first designation by any partner country for collaboration with the Russian military in Ukraine since the invasion, the Foreign Office said.

Polina Kovaleva

Ms Kovaleva is the alleged step-daughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. The Foreign Office said she reportedly owns a property worth about £4 million in London. “This sends a strong signal that those benefiting from association of those responsible for Russian aggression are in scope of our sanctions,” it added.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/russia-sanctions-latest-entities-individuals-105257415.html

Johnson is using a NATO emergency summit in Brussels today to commit to a new package to shore up Ukrainian forces, including 6,000 more missiles.

Speaking to broadcasters after landing in Belgium’s capital, Mr Johnson said: “Vladimir Putin is plainly determined to double down on his path of violence and aggression.”

Describing Mr Putin’s treatment of Ukrainians as “absolutely brutal”, he added: “We’ve got to step up. We’ve got to increase our support. We’ve got to tighten the economic vice around Putin, sanctioning more people today, as we are, sanctioning the Wagner Group, looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves, and also doing more to help the Ukrainians defend themselves.

US President Joe Biden is also attending the summit to bolster Western unity and ramp up unprecedented sanctions against Russia.

Biden told reporters as he boarded the Marine One helicopter at the White House that he sees “a real threat” of Russian chemical warfare against Ukraine.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrives in Brussels, Belgium to attend a special meeting of Nato leaders to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Picture date: Thursday March 24, 2022.

Speaking to broadcasters after landing in Belgium’s capital, Mr Johnson said: “Vladimir Putin is plainly determined to double down on his path of violence and aggression.”

The Wagner Group plans to assassinate Mr Zelensky as his forces continue to put up a far stronger resistance than many anticipated, it has been warned.

Western officials had expected to be supporting a Ukrainian insurgency at this point in the war, rather than the nation’s army, which is holding up.

Mr Johnson said: “We’re moving, really, from a programme of supporting resistance to supporting the Ukrainian defence of their own country.”

Praising him as “one of the most extraordinary war leaders of recent times”, Mr Johnson said Mr Zelensky wants tighter sanctions on Mr Putin’s regime and “very specific defensive military support” for his armed forces.

“And that, we’re determined to provide,” Mr Johnson said.

He also hit out at Moscow’s bid to host Euro 2028, saying Russia should withdraw its forces and the football tournament should be handed to Ukraine.

“The idea of Russia holding any kind of football tournament or any kind of cultural event right now is beyond satire,” he said.

“The best thing possible would be for the entire Russian armed forces to retire forthwith from Ukraine and to hand it to them, of course.”

However, those remarks came just a day after the UK and Ireland football associations submitted their joint formal interest in staging the tournament.

Six more banks were among those being sanctioned with asset freezes and travel bans, as was one of the world’s largest diamond producer Alrosa, and Polina Kovaleva, the stepdaughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who was travelling with Mr Johnson, said: “These oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price.

“Putin should be under no illusions – we are united with our allies and will keep tightening the screw on the Russian economy to help ensure he fails in Ukraine. There will be no let-up”.

Ahead of the summit getting under way, Russian hoaxers, suspected of working for the Kremlin, released a full version of their video call with Defence Secretary Ben Wallace.

The MoD has warned the footage being trickled out, in which Mr Wallace thought he was talking to Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal, is doctored and propaganda.

Speaking to the imposter, Mr Wallace says: “I’ve just been looking at our new anti-air missiles that we’re sending you, which is better than Stinger, it’ll work at night, it’s a very, very fast missile and it will help close the skys to Russian aircraft.”

Nato has refused Ukrainian demands for a no-fly zone to be imposed over the nation out of fears it would drag the West into a direct conflict with Russia.

The hoaxers warned that a “prank” call with Home Secretary Priti Patel will follow “soon”.

As the war in Ukraine continues, the UK has revealed that Russian paramilitary group, the Wagner Group, is among the 65 new entities and oligarchs sanctioned for links to Vladimir Putin and attacks on Ukraine.

The sanctions came amid increased international concern over the possibility of chemical weapon attacks by Russian forces in Ukraine, with more than 100,000 people reportedly stranded in the city of Mariupol amid “constant bombing”, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

The Wagner Group is an organisation of groups and companies said to be involved in Russian operations in Ukraine, with mercenaries associated with the group reportedly sent to Ukraine to assassinate President Zelenskyy.

Here’s what you need to know about the Wagner Group, who they are and the UK sanctions targeting the paramilitary organisation.

Who are the Wagner Group?

According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), an American think tank, the Wagner Group is a Russian private military organisation and network of companies, mercenaries and troops known to have played a role in conflicts on Russia’s behalf.

First identified in 2014 during Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, the group has featured among Russian military operations as an extended, semi-independent branch of its military.

The mercenary group is believed to have more than 6,000 members, but according to the CSIS and international private law experts, the group is not registered in Russia or any other country – meaning it doesn't appear to exist legally as a single entity.

But it’s existence as a private military company which has previously acted alongside Russian operations in Syria, Sudan and the Central African Republic has been said to allow President Putin extend military actions with an indirect, arms-length approach.

Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has close ties to Putin and allegedly runs a major Russian troll farm, is believed to be the owner of the Wagner Group but denies any involvement with the military organisation.

Have the Wagner Group been active in Ukraine?

According to The Times, up to 400 mercenaries associated with the Wagner Group were sent to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv to assassinate President Zelenskyy, with possibly thousands more making their way to Ukraine since tensions escalated in January.

In response to the threat posed by Wagner Group mercenaries to the Ukrainian leader, the government introduced a hard 36 hour curfew in the capital on February 26, warning that anyone who could be seen as a potential threat would be ‘liquidated’ by armed forces.

Ukrainian officials have previously said that mercenaries from the Wagner Group have been active in the Donbas region, and particularly in the Russian-occupied territories of Luhansk and Donetsk.

Why has the UK sanctioned the Wagner Group?

Boris Johnson hit the paramilitary Wagner Group - seen as Vladimir Putin's private army - in a raft of new sanctions as he urged allies to ""step up"" support against the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine.

The Prime Minister is using a Nato emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday to commit to a new package, including 6,000 more missiles for Ukraine and pressing to prevent the Russian president using his gold reserves.

The Russian Foreign Minister’s stepdaughter has been sanctioned in a new UK crackdown on allies of Vladimir Putin.

Polina Kovaleva, Sergei Lavrov’s ‘unofficial wife’s’ child – widely considered a London party girl – has a luxury home in the centre of the capital.

The Imperial College London and Loughborough University graduate is one of 65 individuals and organisations hit by a new round of sanctions.

It means the Government has now targeted more than 1,000 entities since Russia’s war with Ukraine began.

Kovaleva will have her assets frozen and be prohibited from travelling from or to the UK.

Her mother is thought to be Svetlana Polyakova, 51, a powerful member of the Russian Foreign Ministry said to be Lavrov’s ‘unofficial’ wife.

Crowds reportedly chanted ‘your Dad’s a murderer’ outside her 26-year-old daughter’s £4.4 million home in Kensington earlier this month.

Kovaleva’s Instagram account shows her living the high life, posing by pools and on boats in exclusive destinations, decked in expensive clothing and jewelry.

The raft of new sanctions also hit the paramilitary Wagner Group – seen as Vladimir Putin’s private army – and came as Boris Johnson urged allies to ‘step up’ and support moves against the Kremlin’s invasion.

The Prime Minister is using a Nato emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday to commit to a new package, including 6,000 more missiles, to help fight the Russian President’s forces.

The Foreign Office said it was sanctioning 65 more entities and individuals, including Russian billionaire Eugene Shvidler and Galina Danilchenko, who was installed by Moscow as the mayor of occupied Melitopol in south-east Ukraine.

The Wagner Group is feared to be plotting assassination attempts on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The Government says key industries supporting Russia’s illegal invasion – including Russian Railways and defence company Kronshtadt, the main producer of Russian drones – are also being sanctioned, alongside six more banks and the world’s largest diamond producer, Alrosa.

Other individuals sanctioned include the founder of Tinkoff bank Oleg Tinkov and Herman Gref, the CEO of Russia’s largest bank Sberbank.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ‘These oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price.

‘All those sanctioned today will have their assets in the UK frozen which means no UK citizen or company can do business with them, and individuals subject to travel bans are also prohibited from travelling to or from the UK.’

Ms Truss continued: ‘Today’s sanctions will bring the total global asset value of the banks the UK has sanctioned since the invasion to £500bn and the net worth of the oligarchs and family members in excess of £150bn.

‘The government will continue to tighten the screw and use sanctions to degrade the Russian economy on a scale that the Kremlin, or any major economy, has never seen before.’

The Prime Minister used a Nato press conference to dismiss personal Moscow attacks linked to growing sanctions on its economy and increasing military aid for Ukraine.

Britain committed to a new package of 6,000 more missiles for Ukraine today ahead of a meeting of the alliance, plus fresh punitive measures against a further 65 individuals and entities.

Among those hit with travel bans and asset freezes were the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organisation accused of plotting to assassinate Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.

Britain's response in particular appeared to be riling Mr Putin. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by the state-owned RIA news agency as saying: 'As for Mr Johnson, we see him as the most active participant in the race to be anti-Russian. It will lead to a foreign policy dead end.'

But speaking this afternoon in Brussels, Mr Johnson said he was no anti-Russian but 'deeply hostile' towards leader Vladimir Putin.

And he joked: 'I think I'm probably the only Prime Minister in UK history to be called Boris, I think I have that distinction, and I'm not remotely anti-Russian.'

He became serious as he added: 'But I think what we all agree is that what Vladimir Putin is doing, the way he's leading Russia at the moment, is utterly catastrophic, that his invasion of Ukraine is inhuman and barbaric.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister was instead 'among the most active anti-Putin leaders' as he rallied allies at a Nato summit in Brussels to provide more defensive military support to Ukraine.

UK sanctions Sergei Lavrov's stepdaughter Britain has sanctioned the stepdaughter of Putin's lapdog Sergei Lavrov as part of a new raft of sanctions on a string of Russian 'oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs'. Also among the targets of the new measures announced today are The Wagner Group mercenaries – known as 'Putin's private army' and accused of trying to assassinate Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian politicians. The new sanctions cover individuals including billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler, founder of Tinkoff bank Oleg Tinkov, Herman Gref, and Polina Kovaleva, Foreign Minister Lavrov's stepdaughter. NATO leaders are gathering in Brussels today to discuss the Ukraine War, while Putin's advance appears to be increasingly stalled after Russia invaded 26 days ago. Arriving at the summit this morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: 'We've got to tighten the economic vice around Putin, sanctioning more people today, as we are, sanctioning the Wagner Group, looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves, and also doing more to help the Ukrainians defend themselves.' The most prominent target of the sanctions is Imperial College graduate Polina Kovaleva, a glamorous 26-year-old who lives in a £4million home in Kensington. Polina went to a private boarding school in Bristol before gaining a first-class degree in economics with politics at Loughborough University and later completing a masters in economics and strategy for business at Imperial College London. She went on to work for Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, where she helped with mergers and acquisitions and later worked at Glencore, the mining company. Before buying her own home, she lived in Holland Park, west London, in an apartment in a townhouse that is owned by the Russian embassy. Records show that the nearby Ukrainian embassy alleged Russia had wrongly claimed ownership of the property. Polina now lives in an apartment, which Land Registry documents state she purchased for £4.4million with no mortgage in 2016, when she was 21, in a block just off Kensington High Street. It is still unknown who paid for Polina's flat. She shares the apartment with a man, believed to be her partner, who also has a 10 per cent stake in the investment company she now runs. The property is part of an award-winning development offering a swimming pool, gym, spa, cinema, golf simulator, games room and views across Kensington and Holland Park. Polina's mother is reported to be Svetlana Polyakova, 51, a powerful member of the Russian Foreign Ministry who accompanies Lavrov on every foreign trip and has had a relationship since the early 2000s. It is rumoured that she is Lavrov's unofficial wife. Advertisement

'And the conduct of that invasion is now moving into the type of behaviour that, as I said before, we haven't seen in the continent of Europe for 80 years, and it's horrific.

'So you can be sympathetic towards ordinary Russians, who are being so badly led, but you can be deeply hostile to the decisions of Vladimir Putin.'

The Foreign Office said this morning a total of 1,000 fresh sanctions have been handed out since the invasion begun, with the new round including Russian billionaire Eugene Shvidler and Galina Danilchenko, who was installed by Moscow as the mayor of occupied Melitopol in south-east Ukraine.

Mr Zelensky was to remotely address the meeting which is expected to sign off on the formation of four new battlegroups in eastern Europe, adding thousands more troops. US President Joe Biden was present.

Western officials had expected to be supporting a Ukrainian insurgency at this point in the war, rather than the nation's army as it puts up a fierce resistance.

Praising him as 'one of the most extraordinary war leaders of recent times', Mr Johnson said Mr Zelensky wants tighter sanctions on Mr Putin's regime and 'very specific defensive military support' for his armed forces.

'And that, we're determined to provide,' Mr Johnson said.

He also hit out at Moscow's bid to host Euro 2028, saying Russia should withdraw its forces and the football tournament should be handed to Ukraine.

'The idea of Russia holding any kind of football tournament or any kind of cultural event right now is beyond satire,' he said.

'The best thing possible would be for the entire Russian armed forces to retire forthwith from Ukraine and to hand it to them, of course.'

However, those remarks came just a day after the UK and Ireland football associations submitted their joint formal interest in staging the tournament.

Downing Street said Mr Johnson was responding to a question about Moscow's 'brazen and sorely misjudged' attempt to obtain a platform on the international stage by hosting the tournament.

'Clearly we remain entirely committed to the UK and Ireland bid for Euro 2028 which retains the Government's full backing,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

Six more banks were among those being sanctioned with asset freezes and travel bans, as was one of the world's largest diamond producer Alrosa, and Polina Kovaleva, the stepdaughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who was travelling with Mr Johnson, said: 'These oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price.

Ahead of the summit getting under way, Russian hoaxers, suspected of working for the Kremlin, released a full version of their video call with Defence Secretary Ben Wallace.

The MoD has warned the footage being trickled out, in which Mr Wallace thought he was talking to Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal, is doctored and propaganda.

It is also supplying and training Ukrainian troops in the use of Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles as well as providing body armour, helmets and combat boots.

The main thing President Zelensky wants is a no fly zone, but that hasn’t happened because the risk of the conflict with Russians will be too great.

We are also likely to hear more about what support will be given to Ukraine to combat a chemical or biological attack, as the US has raised its concerns that Russia might resort to that possibility,

The secretary general of Nato has called on Putin to stop this “nuclear sabre rattling”, pointing out that Russia simply couldn’t win if there were to be nuclear warfare.

The one thing Putin said he didn’t want was Nato expansion on his doorstep and that he would like to see that go.

But we are told there will be a doubling of Nato battlegroups in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.

Nato says it will have forces in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia – all part of this message the Nato-Western alliance wants to send out that if Putin is going to do this to a non-Nato member like Ukraine, he is certainly not going to do it in the club of 30.",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-60856533/page/12

The Prime Minister is using a Nato emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday to commit to a new package, including 6,000 more missiles for Ukraine and pressing to prevent the Russian president using his gold reserves.

Mr Johnson will be joined by world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for worldwide demonstrations to mark a month since Russia launched its attack.

Mr Zelensky will remotely address the meeting, which is expected to sign off on the formation of four new battlegroups in eastern Europe, adding thousands more troops.

Speaking to broadcasters after landing in Belgium’s capital, Mr Johnson said: “Vladimir Putin is plainly determined to double down on his path of violence and aggression.”

Describing Mr Putin’s treatment of Ukrainians as “absolutely brutal”, he added: “We’ve got to step up. We’ve got to increase our support.

“We’ve got to tighten the economic vice around Putin, sanctioning more people today, as we are, sanctioning the Wagner Group, looking at what we can do to stop Putin using his gold reserves, and also doing more to help the Ukrainians defend themselves.”

The Foreign Office said it was sanctioning 65 more entities and individuals, including Russian billionaire Eugene Shvidler and Galina Danilchenko, who was installed by Moscow as the mayor of occupied Melitopol in south-east Ukraine.

The Wagner Group plans to assassinate Mr Zelensky as his forces continue to put up a far stronger resistance than many anticipated, it has been warned.

Western officials had expected to be supporting a Ukrainian insurgency at this point in the war, rather than the nation’s army, which is holding up.

Mr Johnson said: “We’re moving, really, from a programme of supporting resistance to supporting the Ukrainian defence of their own country.”

Praising him as “one of the most extraordinary war leaders of recent times”, Mr Johnson said Mr Zelensky wants tighter sanctions on Mr Putin’s regime and “very specific defensive military support” for his armed forces.

“And that, we’re determined to provide,” Mr Johnson said.

He also hit out at Moscow’s bid to host Euro 2028, saying Russia should withdraw its forces and the football tournament should be handed to Ukraine.

“The idea of Russia holding any kind of football tournament or any kind of cultural event right now is beyond satire,” he said.

“The best thing possible would be for the entire Russian armed forces to retire forthwith from Ukraine and to hand it to them, of course.”

However, those remarks came just a day after the UK and Ireland football associations submitted their joint formal interest in staging the tournament.

Downing Street said Mr Johnson was responding to a question about Moscow’s “brazen and sorely misjudged” attempt to obtain a platform on the international stage by hosting the tournament.

“Clearly we remain entirely committed to the UK and Ireland bid for Euro 2028 which retains the Government’s full backing,” the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.

Six more banks were among those being sanctioned with asset freezes and travel bans, as was one of the world’s largest diamond producer Alrosa, and Polina Kovaleva, the stepdaughter of Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who was travelling with Mr Johnson, said: “These oligarchs, businesses and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price.

“Putin should be under no illusions – we are united with our allies and will keep tightening the screw on the Russian economy to help ensure he fails in Ukraine. There will be no let-up”.

Ahead of the summit getting under way, Russian hoaxers, suspected of working for the Kremlin, released a full version of their video call with Defence Secretary Ben Wallace.

The MoD has warned the footage being trickled out, in which Mr Wallace thought he was talking to Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal, is doctored and propaganda.

Speaking to the imposter, Mr Wallace says: “I’ve just been looking at our new anti-air missiles that we’re sending you, which is better than Stinger, it’ll work at night, it’s a very, very fast missile and it will help close the skys to Russian aircraft.”

Nato has refused Ukrainian demands for a no-fly zone to be imposed over the nation out of fears it would drag the West into a direct conflict with Russia.

The hoaxers warned that a “prank” call with Home Secretary Priti Patel will follow “soon”.

Secretary of state Antony Blinken cited the besieged city of Mariupol where an estimated 100,000 people remain trapped with chronic shortages of food and clean drinking water.

In a call with Mr Zelensky on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the bombardment of civilian areas in the city was “unconscionable” and demanded a response from the international community.
