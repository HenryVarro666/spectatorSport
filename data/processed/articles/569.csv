The government of President Vladimir Putin ""almost certainly maintains extensive links"" with Russian companies that sell mercenary fighting services, the U.K. Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update released Wednesday night GMT.

Russian corporate fighters have been accused of committing human rights abuses in Syria, Libya and the Central African Republic while working on behalf of Moscow, the ministry said.

The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said last year that Moscow gave security and military services through so-called ""private military companies"" to the government of the Central African Republic in exchange for the right to extract gold, uranium and diamonds.

Such mercenary services already operated in eastern Ukraine prior to Russia's current invasion, according to the U.S. government.

In 2017, the U.S. Treasury placed sanctions on the biggest Russian mercenary company, PMC Wagner, and its founder, Dmitriy Utkin, for ""actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine.""

Russian mercenary companies including Wagner ""have a poor track record—including operational failures and human rights abuses,"" CSIS said.

The U.S. Department of Defense said on Monday that Russia is trying to recruit mercenaries from Syria as well.

""We find that noteworthy that [Putin] believes that he needs to rely on foreign fighters to supplement what is a very significant commitment of combat power inside Ukraine as it is,"" the official said in a briefing.
