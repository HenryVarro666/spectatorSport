Notes of hope and love from around the world will be displayed hundreds of feet in the air for millions of refugees in Poland starting Friday night.

The notes are part of the project, Messages to Ukraine, which has collected thousands of messages from people around the world — showing distance and language barriers are no obstacle to human kindness.

The project is the brainchild of employees at Preply, a language learning company. Anyone can submit messages, in any language, on the Preply site. So, far, people from 115 countries have left more than 5,600 messages in 84 languages. Each note has been translated to Ukrainian and English.

""The idea was born of simply wanting to spread messages of positivity and hope,"" Daniele Saccardi, a campaigns manager with Preply, told NPR. ""What is most moving is the scope of messages. People from all over the world are sharing messages of strength and hope.""

The messages are set to stream across the 722 foot tall Warsaw Spire in the center of Poland's capital.

The messages include one from someone in Suriname, nearly 6,000 miles away from Ukraine, that reads, in part, ""Do not lose heart, especially during this dark moment.""

Another message from Venezuela said, ""I send you all my love in these difficult times for the Ukrainian people.""

It's been more than a month since Russia invaded Ukraine and more than 3 million people have fled the country, many of whom have gone to Poland. This is why Preply wanted to display these messages in Poland, to start, the organization said.

""It's more about getting them in front of Ukrainians in a tough time, so they can see the solidarity from the world,"" Saccardi said. ""We chose Warsaw because it's a key place where a lot of people are waiting for residency.""

Saccardi said the employees at Preply worked hard to get the site launched and the messages up and running in just two weeks.

""These processes usually take months, so it's been a particularly difficult and emotional few weeks for us all,"" he said.

It's been made even more so by the fact that the war in Ukraine has directly impacted Saccardi's coworkers.

""Our founders are based in Ukraine which means we have a lot of colleagues working in the Kyiv office that were temporarily displaced,"" Saccardi said.

The messages from around the world have touched those colleagues, he said.

""They have found them moving,"" Saccardi said.

Following Friday night's planned showing, the messages will move to digital billboards at the Warsaw Centralna railway station, where millions of Ukrainians have first entered Poland.

""Over the next few weeks, we will look and see how else we can spread these messages to the people who might benefit from them,"" Saccardi said.",https://www.npr.org/2022/03/25/1088858439/ukraine-share-message-online-warsaw-spire-preply

Warsaw, Poland

6:16 P.M. CET



THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, if you have a seat, be seated. (Laughter.) If you don’t, come up on stage.



Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to be here. Mr. President, they tell me you’re over there somewhere. There you are. Thank you, Mr. President.



“Be not afraid.” They were the first words at the first public address of the first Polish Pope after his election on October of 1978. They were words that would come to define Pope John Paul II. Words that would change the world.



John Paul brought the message here to Warsaw in his first trip back home as Pope in June of 1979. It was a message about the power — the power of faith, the power of resilience, and the power of the people.



In the face of a cruel and brutal system of government, it was a message that helped end the Soviet repression in the Central land and Eastern Europe 30 years ago. It was a message that will overcome the cruelty and brutality of this unjust war.



When Pope John Paul brought that message in 1979, the Soviet Union ruled with an iron fist behind an Iron Curtain.



Then a year later, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. And while I know he couldn’t be here tonight, we’re all grateful in America and around the world for Lech Wałęsa. (Applause.)



It reminds me of that phrase of philosopher Kierkegaard: “[F]aith sees best in the dark.” And there were dark moments.



Ten years later, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Poland and Central and Eastern Europe would soon be free. Nothing about that battle for freedom was simple or easy. It was a long, painful slog fought over not days and months, but years and decades.



But we emerged anew in the great battle for freedom: a battle between democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force.



In this battle, we need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.



Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Mayor, members of the Parliament, distinguished guests, and the people of Poland, and I suspect some people of Ukraine that are here: We’re — (applause) — we are gathered here at the Royal Castle in this city that holds a sacred place in the history of not only of Europe, but humankind’s unending search for freedom.



For generations, Warsaw has stood where liberty has been challenged and liberty has prevailed.



In fact, it was here in Warsaw when a young refugee, who fled her home country from Czechoslovakia was under Soviet domination, came back to speak and stand in solidarity with dissidents.



Her name was Madeleine Korbel Albright. She became — (applause) — one of the most ardent supporters of democracy in the world. She was a friend with whom I served. America’s first woman Secretary of State. She passed away three days ago.



She fought her whole life for essential democratic principles. And now, in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom, Ukraine and its people are on the frontlines fighting to save their nation.



And their brave resistance is part of a larger fight for an essential democratic principles that unite all free people: the rule of law; free and fair elections; the freedom to speak, to write, and to assemble; the freedom to worship as one chooses; freedom of the press.



These principles are essential in a free society. (Applause.) But they have always — they have always been under siege. They’ve always been embattled. Every generation has had to defeat democracy’s mortal foes. That’s the way of the world — for the world is imperfect, as we know. Where the appetites and ambitions of a few forever seek to dominate the lives and liberties of many.



My message to the people of Ukraine is the message I delivered today to Ukraine’s Foreign Minister and Defense Minister, who I believe are here tonight: We stand with you. Period. (Applause.)



Today’s fighting in Kyiv and Mariupol and Kharkiv are the latest battle in a long struggle: Hungary, 1956; Poland, 1956 then again 1981; Czechoslovakia, 1968.



Soviet tanks crushed democratic uprisings, but the resistance continued until finally, in 1989, the Berlin Wall and all of the walls of Soviet domination — they fell. They fell. And the people prevailed. (Applause.)



But the battle for democracy could not conclude and did not conclude with the end of the Cold War.



Over the last 30 years, the forces of autocracy have revived all across the globe. Its hallmarks are familiar ones: contempt for the rule of law, contempt for democratic freedom, contempt for the truth itself.



Today, Russia has strangled democracy — has sought to do so elsewhere, not only in its homeland. Under false claims of ethnic solidarity, it has invalidated [invaded] neighboring nations.



Putin has the gall to say he’s “de-Nazifying” Ukraine. It’s a lie. It’s just cynical. He knows that. And it’s also obscene.



President Zelenskyy was democratically elected. He’s Jewish. His father’s family was wiped out in the Nazi Holocaust. And Putin has the audacity, like all autocrats before him, to believe that might will make right.



In my own country, a former president named Abraham Lincoln voiced the opposing spirit to save our Union in the midst of a civil war. He said, “Let us have faith that right makes might.” “Right makes might.” (Applause.)



Today, let us now have that faith again. Let us resolve to put the strength of democracies into action to thwart the denigns [sic] of our — the designs of autocracy. Let us remember that the test of this moment is the test of all time.



The Kremlin wants to portray NATO enlargement as an imperial project aimed at destabilizing Russia. Nothing is further from the truth. NATO is a defensive alliance. It has never sought the demise of Russia.



In the lead-up to the current crisis, the United States and NATO worked for months to engage Russia to avert a war. I met with him in person and talked to him many times on the phone.



Time and again, we offered real diplomacy and concrete proposals to strengthen European security, enhance transparency, and build confidence on all sides.



But Putin and Russia met each of the proposals with disinterest in any negotiation, with lies and ultimatums. Russia was bent on violence from the start.



I know not all of you believed me and us when we kept saying, “They are going to cross the border. They are going to attack.”



Repeatedly, he asserted, “We have no interest in war.” Guaranteed he would not move.



Repeatedly saying he would not invade Ukraine.



Repeatedly saying Russian troops along the border were there for “training” — all 180,000 of them.



There is simply no justification or provocation for Russia’s choice of war. It’s an example of one of the oldest of human impulses: using brute force and disinformation to satisfy a craving for absolute power and control.



It’s nothing less than a direct challenge to the rule-based international order established since the end of World War Two.



And it threatens to return to decades of war that ravaged Europe before the international rule-based order was put in place. We cannot go back to that. We cannot.



The gravity of the threat is why the response of the West has been so swift and so powerful and so unified, unprecedented, and overwhelming.



Swift and punishing costs are the only things that are going to get Russia to change its course.



Within days of its invasion, the West had moved jointly with sanctions to damage Russia’s economy.



Russia’s Central Bank is now blocked from the global financial systems, denying Kremlin’s access to the war fund it stashed around the globe.



We’ve aimed at the heart of Russia’s economy by stopping the imports of Russian energy to the United States.



To date, the United States has sanctioned 140 Russian oligarchs and their family members, seizing their ill-begotten gains: their yachts, their luxury apartments, their mansions.



We’ve sanctioned more than 400 Russian government officials, including key architects of this war.



These officials and oligarchs have reaped enormous benefit from the corruption connected to the Kremlin, and now they have to share in the pain.



The private sector is acting as well. Over 400 private multinational companies have pulled out of doing business in Russia — left Russia completely — from oil companies to McDonald’s.



As a result of these unprecedented sanctions, the ruble almost is immediately reduced to rubble. The Russian economy — (applause) — that’s true, by the way. It takes about 200 rubles to equal one dollar.



The economy is on track to be cut in half in the coming years. It was ranked — Russia’s economy was ranked the 11th biggest economy in the world before this evasion [sic] — invasion. It will soon not even rank among the top 20 in the world. (Applause.)



Taken together, these economic sanctions are a new kind of economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that rivals military might.



These international sanctions are sapping Russian strength, its ability to replenish its military, and its ability — its ability to project power. And it is Putin — it is Vladimir Putin who is to blame, period.



At the same time, alongside these economic sanctions, the Western world has come together to provide for the people of Ukraine with incredible levels of military, economic, and humanitarian assistance.



In the years before the invasion, we, America, had sent over $650 million, before they crossed the border, in weapons to Ukraine, including anti-air and anti-armor equipment.



Since the invasion, America has committed another $1.35 billion in weapons and ammunition.



And thanks to the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian people — (applause) — the equipment we’ve sent and our colleagues have sent have been used to devastating effect to defend Ukrainian land and airspace. Our Allies and partners have stepped up as well.



But as I’ve made clear: American forces are in Europe — not in Europe to engage in conflict with Russian forces. American forces are here to defend NATO Allies.



Yesterday, I met with the troops that are serving alongside our Polish allies to bolster NATO’s frontline defenses. The reason we wanted to make clear is their movement on Ukraine: Don’t even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory.



We have a sacred obligation — (applause) — we have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend each and every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power.



And earlier today, I visited your National Stadium, where thousands of Ukrainian refugees are now trying to answer the toughest questions a human can ask: “My God, what’s going to happen to me? What’s going to happen to my family?”



I saw tears in many of the mothers’ eyes as I embraced them; their young children — their young children not sure whether to smile or cry. One little girl said, “Mr. President” — she spoke a little English — “is my brother and my daddy — are they going to be okay? Will I see them again?” Without their husbands, their fathers, in many cases, their brothers or sisters who stayed back to fight for their country.



I didn’t have to speak the language or understand the language to feel the emotion in their eyes, the way they gripped my hand, and little kids hung on to my leg, praying with a desperate hope that all this is temporary; apprehension that they may be perhaps forever away from their homes, almost with debilitating sadness that this is happening all over again.



But I was also struck by the generosity of the people of Warsaw — for that matter, all the Polish people — for the depths of their compassion, their willingness to reach out — (applause) — opening their hearts.



I was saying to the Mayor they’re preparing to open their hearts and their homes simply to help. I also want to thank my friend, the great American chef, José Andrés, and his team who helped feeling [sic] those — (applause) — feeding those who are yearning to be free.



But helping these refugees is not something Poland or any other nation should carry alone. All the world democracies have a responsibility to help. All of them. And the people of Ukraine can count on the United States to meet its responsibility.



I’ve announced, two days ago, we will welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. We already have 8,000 a week coming to the United States of other nat- — nationalities.



We’ll provide nearly $300 million of humanitarian assistance, providing tens of thousands of tons of food, water, medicine, and other basic supplies.



In Brussels, I announced the United States is prepared to provide more than $1 billion, in addition, in humanitarian aid.



The World Food Programme told us that despite significant obstacles, at least some relief is getting to major cities in Ukraine, but not Metropol [sic] — no, excuse me, Mar- — not Mariupol, because Russian forces are blocking relief supplies.



But we’ll not cease our efforts to get humanitarian relief wherever it is needed in Ukraine and for the people who’ve made it out of Ukraine.



Notwithstanding the brutality of Vladimir Putin, let there be no doubt that this war has already been a strategic failure for Russia already. (Applause.) Having lost children myself — I know that’s no solace to the people who’ve lost family.



But he, Putin, thought Ukrainians would roll over and not fight. Not much of a student of history. Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance.



Rather than breaking Ukrainian resolve, Russia’s brutal tactics have strengthened the resolve. (Applause.)



Rather than driving NATO apart, the West is now stronger and more united than it has ever been. (Applause.)



Russia wanted less of a NATO presence on its border, but now he has [we have] a stronger presence, a larger presence, with over a hundred thousand American troops here, along with all the other members of NATO.



In fact — (applause) — Russia has managed to cause something I’m sure he never intended: The democracies of the world are revitalized with purpose and unity found in months that we’d once taken years to accomplish.



It’s not only Russia’s actions in Ukraine that are reminding us of democracy’s blessing. It’s our own country — his own country, the Kremlin, is jailing protestors. Two hundred thousand people have allegedly already left. There’s a brain drain — leaving Russia. Shutting down independent news. State media is all propaganda, blocking the image of civilian targets, mass graves, starvation tactics of the Russian forces in Ukraine.



Is it any wonder, as I said, that 200,000 Russians have all left their country in one month? A remarkable brain drain in such a short period of time, which brings me to my message to the Russian people:



I’ve worked with Russian leaders for decades. I sat across the negotiating table going all the way back to Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin to talk arms control at the height of the Cold War.



I’ve always spoken directly and honestly to you, the Russian people.



Let me say this, if you’re able to listen: You, the Russian people, are not our enemy.



I refuse to believe that you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards that, for God’s sake, are being pummeled with Russian missiles and bombs; or cities being surrounded so that civilians cannot flee; supplies cut off and attempting to starve Ukrainians into submission.



Millions of families are being driven from their homes, including half of all Ukraine’s children. These are not the actions of a great nation.



Of all people, you, the Russian people, as well as all people across Europe, still have the memory of being in a similar situation in the late thirties and forties — the situation of World War Two — still fresh in the minds of many grandparents in the region.



What — whatever your generation experienced — whether it experienced the Siege of Leningrad or heard about it from your parents and grandparents — train stations overflowing with terrified families fleeing their homes; nights sheltering in basements and cellars; mornings sitting through the rubble in your homes — these are not memories of the past. Not anymore. Because it’s exactly what the Russian army is doing in Ukraine right now.



March 26, 2022. Just days before — we’re at the twenty-fir- — you were a 21st century nation with hopes and dreams that people all over the world have for themselves and their family.



Now, Vladimir Putin’s aggression have cut you, the Russian people, off from the rest of the world, and it’s taking Russia back to the 19th century.



This is not who you are. This is not the future reserve — you deserve for your families and your children. I’m telling you the truth: This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people.



Putin can and must end this war. The American people stand with you and the brave citizens of Ukraine who want peace.



And my message to the rest of Europe: This new battle for freedom has already made a few things crystal clear.



First, Europe must end its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. And we, the United States, will help. (Applause.) That’s why just yesterday, in Brussels, I announced a plan with the President of the European Commission to get Europe through the immediate energy crisis.



Over the long term, as a matter of economic security and national security and for the survivability of the planet, we all need to move as quickly as possible to clean, renewable energy. And we’ll work together to help get that done so that the days of any nation being subject to the whims of a tyrant for its energy needs are over. They must end. They must end.



And second, we have to fight the corruption coming from the Kremlin to give the Russian people a fair chance.



And finally, and most urgently, we maintain absolute unity — we must — among the world’s democracies.



It’s not enough to speak with rhetorical flourish, of ennobling words of democracy, of freedom, equality, and liberty. All of us, including here in Poland, must do the hard work of democracy each and every day. My country as well.



That’s why — (applause) — that’s why I came to Europe again this week with a clear and determined message for NATO, for the G7, for the European Union, for all freedom-loving nations: We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul. We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come. (Applause.)



It will not be easy. There will be costs. But it’s a price we have to pay. Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere.



Time and again, history shows that it’s from the darkest moments that the greatest progress follows. And history shows this is the task of our time, the task of this generation.



Let’s remember: The hammer blow that brought down the Berlin Wall, the might that lifted the Iron Curtain were not the words of a single leader; it was the people of Europe who, for decades, fought to free themselves.



Their sheer bravery opened the border between Austria and Hungary for the Pan-European Picnic. They joined hands for the Baltic Way. They stood for Solidarity here in Poland. And together, it was an unmistakable and undeniable force of the people that the Soviet Union could not withstand.



And we’re seeing it once again today with the brave Ukrainian people, showing that their power of many is greater than the will of any one dictator. (Applause.)



So, in this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today: “Never, ever give up hope, never doubt, never tire, never become discouraged. Be not afraid.” (Applause.)



A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people’s love for liberty. Brutality will never grind down their will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia — for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.



We will have a different future — a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities.



For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.



God bless you all. And may God defend our freedom. (Applause.) And may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.

""Democracies of the world are revitalized,"" Biden said of worldwide reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking from a former castle in Warsaw before a crowd that included Ukrainian refugees, Biden blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin and called on the Russian people to choose a different path for their own country. He also urged Europe to end its dependence on Russian gas and unite behind a pressure campaign against Putin.

""It will not be easy, there will be costs,"" the president said, as the crowd waved U.S., Ukrainian and Polish flags. ""But it's a price we have to pay. Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere.""

""We stand with you,"" he said of Ukraine.

Biden attacked Putin for repeatedly claiming ahead of the invasion that he had no intention of entering Ukraine, and blasted him for his brutality since the military assault began. Moments before Biden spoke, the Ukrainian city of Lviv, which had been a relative safe haven within the country, was hit by at least three missile strikes.

""For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden said of Putin.

A White House official said later that the president had not been calling for Putin's deposal. ""The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,"" the official said. ""He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.""

Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated Sunday that the U.S. was not pursuing “a strategy of regime change” in Moscow.

The Kremlin was quick to seize on the remark. “That’s not for Biden to decide,” Putin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Reuters. “The president of Russia is elected by Russians.” Russia has for years accused the U.S. and its allies of attempting to carry out regime change in its country.

But Biden also painted a hopeful picture — one where freedom prevails over autocracies and where unity among the Western allies has never been stronger.

""A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never be able to erase the people’s love for liberty. Brutality will never grind down the will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness, of darkness,"" Biden said.

Biden made multiple references to popular historic Polish figures, like Pope John Paul II and former president Lech Wałęsa, and referenced the battles Poland has faced over the years for freedom.

It was a message directed at the Polish people — who filled the streets outside the venue to hear Biden's remarks — as they find themselves on the frontlines of the refugee crisis and increasingly fearful that they may be Russia's next target.

""In this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today, never ever give up hope, never doubt, never tire, never become discouraged. Be not afraid,"" Biden said.

Biden also had a message for the Russian people, warning them that Putin's actions would cut them off from the world and is ""taking Russia back to the 19th century.""

""This is not who you are, this is not the future you deserve for your families and your children,"" Biden said. ""This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people. Putin can, and must end this war.""

Ahead of the speech, Biden met with Ukrainian refugees and aid workers at a sports stadium that once hosted rock concerts and soccer matches. It now provides temporary shelter for refugees, and assistance helping them register for school and work.

At the stadium, a group of refugee women and children gathered around Biden telling him about their experiences, asking him to pray for their male relatives back in Ukraine, and thanking him for the U.S. support. Biden hugged a woman with tears in her eyes and picked up a little girl, clad in pink winter wear, to take a photo with her. The girl's mother told Biden how her daughter and infant had been sheltering in a basement before making it to Poland.

""I’m always surprised by the depth and strength of the human sprint, I mean it sincerely,"" Biden said after meeting with the refugees. ""They are an amazing group of people.""

When asked by a journalist about reports of a change in Russian strategy, Biden sounded a skeptical note. ""I’m not sure they have,"" he said. A Russian general said Friday that forces are shifting away from their countrywide attack on Ukraine and refocusing on the “complete liberation” of the country’s separatist Donbas region.

Biden, asked what he thought of Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine, was blunt. ""He's a butcher,"" said Biden.

The refugee crisis has been ever present throughout Biden's two days in Poland. As Biden’s motorcade headed to a meeting with Poland’s president Saturday, it rolled past the Warsaw train station where a steady stream of refugees just arriving in the country lined up for food and basic supplies like toilet paper, and sought help with housing and transportation.

While Poland has welcomed the refugees with open arms, and signs of support for Ukraine blanket the city, Polish officials, including the mayor of Warsaw, whom Biden met with on Saturday, have said they are being pushed to the brink trying to help the more than 2 million refugees who have flooded into the country in a matter of weeks.

""We do acknowledge that Poland is taking on a significant responsibility that I don’t think should just be Poland,"" Biden told President Andrzej Duda during a meeting Saturday. ""It should be the whole world. All nations' responsibility.""

Biden also provided reassurances to Duda that if Russia were to attack Poland, the U.S. would come to its defense as part of its commitment under the NATO alliance.

Biden's speech capped three days in Europe, where he held what could be some of the most consequential meetings of his presidency with world leaders, seeking to solidify their unity behind a sustained pressure campaign against Russia.

The White House had said it hoped Biden's speech would help unite support for the Ukrainian people, hold Russia accountable and frame the conflict as a larger battle for democracy.

The U.S. announced a series of steps this week to try to ratchet up pressure on Russia and assist Ukraine, including additional sanctions on more than 400 Russians and Russian entities, $1 billion in humanitarian assistance, plans to take in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and a task force to lessen European dependence on Russian natural gas.",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-rally-support-ukraine-efforts-speech-warsaw-rcna21382

""I’m always surprised by the depth and strength of the human sprint, I mean it sincerely,"" Biden said after meeting with the refugees. ""They are an amazing group of people.""

When asked by a journalist about reports of a change in Russian strategy, Biden sounded a skeptical note. ""I’m not sure they have,"" he said. A Russian general said Friday that forces are shifting away from their countrywide attack on Ukraine and refocusing on the “complete liberation” of the country’s separatist Donbas region.

Biden, asked what he thought of Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine, was blunt. ""He's a butcher,"" said Biden.

The refugee crisis has been ever present throughout Biden's two days in Poland. As Biden’s motorcade headed to a meeting with Poland’s president Saturday, it rolled past the Warsaw train station where a steady stream of refugees just arriving in the country lined up for food and basic supplies like toilet paper, and sought help with housing and transportation.

While Poland has welcomed the refugees with open arms, and signs of support for Ukraine blanket the city, Polish officials, including the mayor of Warsaw, whom Biden met with on Saturday, have said they are being pushed to the brink trying to help the more than 2 million refugees who have flooded into the country in a matter of weeks.

""We do acknowledge that Poland is taking on a significant responsibility that I don’t think should just be Poland,"" Biden told President Andrzej Duda during a meeting Saturday. ""It should be the whole world. All nations' responsibility.""

Biden also provided reassurances to Duda that if Russia were to attack Poland, the U.S. would come to its defense as part of its commitment under the NATO alliance.

Biden's speech capped three days in Europe, where he held what could be some of the most consequential meetings of his presidency with world leaders, seeking to solidify their unity behind a sustained pressure campaign against Russia.

The White House had said it hoped Biden's speech would help unite support for the Ukrainian people, hold Russia accountable and frame the conflict as a larger battle for democracy.

The U.S. announced a series of steps this week to try to ratchet up pressure on Russia and assist Ukraine, including additional sanctions on more than 400 Russians and Russian entities, $1 billion in humanitarian assistance, plans to take in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and a task force to lessen European dependence on Russian natural gas.",https://www.yahoo.com/now/biden-rally-support-ukraine-efforts-065840694.html

WARSAW — After the White House announced this week that President Biden would visit Poland, the Kremlin let rip with a belligerent tirade: Polish leaders were a “vassal” of the United States, gripped by “pathological Russophobia,” and their country a “community of political imbeciles.”

Instead of fearful jitters, however, the broadside by Dmitri A. Medvedev, deputy head of the Kremlin’s security council, stirred a burst of pride in Warsaw.

“This is further proof that the Russians treat Poland seriously and see its growing importance in the West,” said Stanislaw Zaryn, director of the Department of National Security and spokesman for the coordinating minister for security.

The US president’s pledge over “further defence cooperation” was said to have been made during a meeting with Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in Warsaw on Saturday.

Biden’s administration has already made available $1bn (£760m) worth of military lethal weapons, including Stinger anti-aircraft systems Javelin missiles, light anti-armour weapons.

Volodmyr Zelenskiy has been pushing the US to also facilitate the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland but the White House is yet to be convinced by the Ukrainian president’s arguments, fearing a widening of the conflict.

The Kremlin had hinted on Friday that it may be scaling back its war ambitions, saying it was close to completing the “first phase” of its military campaign and would now focus on the complete “liberation” of Donbas in eastern Ukraine.

Speaking to the Guardian, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Zelenskiy and the lead negotiator in talks with Russia, said he did not believe that the Kremlin was downgrading its war aims.

“They had poor operational planning, and they realised it was advantageous for them to surround cities, cut off the main supply routes, and force people there to have a deficit of food, water and medicines,” he said, describing the siege of Mariupol as a tactic to sow psychological terror and exhaustion.

However, Podolyak expressed scepticism over the claim from the Russian defence ministry that Moscow’s forces would now focus mainly on the Donbas area in east Ukraine.

“Of course I don’t believe that. They don’t have interests in Donbas. Their main interests are Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and the south – to take Mariupol, and to close the Azov Sea … we see them regrouping and preparing more troops to send in,” he said.

Earlier on Saturday, the Kremlin had again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine.

Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chairman of the country’s security council, said Moscow could strike against an enemy that only used conventional weapons, while Putin’s defence minster Sergei Shoigu claimed nuclear “readiness” was a priority.

Biden, who is due to make what is being billed as a major speech later on Saturday, met Kuleba and Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, in what was the first meeting between the US president and the Ukrainian leadership since the war began a month ago.

The US expressed “unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, State department spokesman Ned Price said.

Kuleba told reporters that Ukraine had received pledges from Biden and his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, on developing defence cooperation.

“We did receive additional promises from the United States on how our defence cooperation will evolve,” Kuleba said. “President Biden said what is happening in Ukraine will change the history of the 21st century, and we will work together to ensure that this change is in our favour, in Ukraine‘s favour, in the favour of the democratic world.”

In his speech later on Saturday, the White House said Biden “will deliver remarks on the united efforts of the free world to support the people of Ukraine, hold Russia accountable for its brutal war, and defend a future that is rooted in democratic principles”.

The meeting with the Ukrainian politicians took place at Warsaw’s Marriott Hotel in the city centre – opposite the central train station, where there has been a constant flow of Ukrainian refugees since the conflict started.

In some comments on Saturday, Biden said Poland was taking a “significant” responsibility in the humanitarian crisis and that the world should help lessen the burden.

Biden and Duda are expected to discuss Warsaw’s wish for more US troops bolstering Nato’s eastern flank, as well as the idea of an international peacekeeping mission proposed by the leader of Poland’s ruling party, Jarosław Kaczyński. US diplomats have voiced scepticism about the idea, which Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has criticised as “very reckless”.

US officials said on Friday that Russian forces in Ukraine appeared to have halted their ground offensive aimed at capturing the capital, Kyiv, and were focused on gaining control of the Donbas region in the south-east.

Russia’s defence ministry said the first phase of its military operation was “generally” complete, and that its forces would focus on the “liberation” of Donbas. The announcement was seen as an indication that after a failed month-long effort to subjugate Ukraine, the Kremlin may be having to considerably scale back its objectives.

Authorities in Mariupol have said as many as 300 people were killed in a Russian bombing of a theatre last week, putting a death toll for the first time on the deadliest single attack since Moscow launched its invasion, which has featured many attacks on apparently civilian targets and residential areas.

During a video address to European Union leaders, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confronted Hungary’s president, Viktor Orbán, who has for years been Vladimir Putin’s most staunch ally in the EU. The Hungarian government is not joining other EU countries in supplying arms to Ukraine, nor will it allow weapons to pass through its territory.

“Listen, Viktor, do you know what’s going on in Mariupol?” Zelenskiy said, drawing a line between the brutal bombardment and Hungary’s past. “There is no time to hesitate. It’s time to decide.”

Zelenskiy has said that with 16,000 Russian troops killed so far there must be serious conversations to end the war. Speaking late on Friday, Zelenskyiy reiterated Ukraine’s terms including sovereignty and territorial integrity, and underlined that conditions should be “fair”, declaring: “The Ukrainian people won’t accept otherwise.” Zelenskyy said 26,000 residents had been evacuated from Mariupol though “the situation in the city remains absolutely tragic”.

The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Biden’s address in Warsaw on Saturday would “speak to the stakes of this moment, of the urgency of the challenge that lies ahead, what the conflict in Ukraine means for the world, and why it is so important that the free world to stay in unity and resolve in the face of Russian aggression”.

The White House said Biden “will deliver remarks on the united efforts of the free world to support the people of Ukraine, hold Russia accountable for its brutal war and defend a future that is rooted in democratic principles”.

Biden told reporters in Brussels on Thursday that his visit to eastern Europe was designed to “reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine”.

On Friday, Biden and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced that the US would provide “at least” 15bn cubic metres (bcm) of liquefied natural gas to the EU in 2022 to help Europe curb its consumption of Russian gas.

Biden has visited the Polish town of Rzeszów, about an hour’s drive from the Ukrainian border, in a symbolic show of support for eastern European states that are seeing Russian aggression wreak havoc in their neighbourhood.

During the visit, which the White House had kept under wraps until shortly before his arrival, the American leader got a first-hand look at international efforts to help the more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees who have found temporary shelter from war in their country in Poland, and met US troops bolstering Nato’s eastern flank.

Air Force One touched down at Rzeszów-Jasionka airport in Poland’s south-east shortly after 2pm local time. Rzeszów is about 105 miles (170km) from Lviv, the city that could become the de facto capital of Ukraine if Kyiv falls to Russian forces.

Wearing a black mask, the US president was greeted by the Polish defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, and a host of military generals – though not Duda, whose plane from Warsaw was turned back en route to Rzeszów and had to make an emergency landing due to technical problems. An official in his office said Duda had not been in any danger.

With the schedule of the visit flipped upside down, Biden first visited a barber shop at the G2A Arena next to the airport, where 14 US soldiers were sitting in folding chairs awaiting their crew cuts. At the adjacent cafeteria, a tieless US president joined service members tucking into a pizza lunch at six long tables.

Over a slice of pepperoni and jalapeño pizza, Biden regaled the paratroopers with stories about his late son Beau’s deployment in Iraq and his family in Ireland.

He later addressed a group of soldiers in more formal remarks, quoting the late secretary of state Madeleine Albright to underscore their significance of Nato’s role in the current crisis.

“The secretary of state used to have an expression. She said, ‘We are the essential nation,’” Biden told the troops. “I don’t want to sound philosophical here, but you are in midst of a fight between democracy and an oligarch.”

The 5,000-strong first main body of US’s elite 82nd Airborne Division, which specialises in parachute assault operations, has been based in Poland since 6 February.

The US troops’ presence in the area has been low-key, with them carrying out visits to orphanages and the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp site rather than displays of military strength visible to the local population.

After his meeting with the military, Biden was due to be briefed on the humanitarian situation on the Ukraine border by Samantha Power, the director of the United States Agency for International Development.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

But since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, Warsaw Central train station, as it’s known in English, has seen a steady stream of Ukrainian refugees fleeing their homes — carrying bags full of their possessions, seeking aid as they flee from Russia’s incursion.

Inside, a woman walked around with a handwritten sign that reads, “I’m from Ukraine. Please help.”

It’s a sign of what the United Nations calls the worst refugee crisis since World War II.

One month since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, almost a quarter of the country’s population of more than 44 million has been displaced, according to the United Nations.

Over 10 million people have been forced to flee their homes and leave everything behind, according to the U.N. refugee agency. Of that figure, more than 6.5 million are displaced within the country, and 3.7 million have fled Ukraine’s borders.

No nation has taken in more refugees than Poland: More than 2 million Ukrainians have fled across the border to their neighbor to the west, leaving everything behind in fear for their safety.

The station in Warsaw has been transformed: Volunteers in bright vests aid refugees with everything from information to translation, or even a cup of coffee. Bins full of stuffed animals are provided for children.

There are signs for phone chargers, medical care and messages of encouragement. Outside, Celebrity chef José Andrés’ World Central Kitchen provides thousands of meals a day to those in need.

There’s even a man in a giant Tyrannosaurus rex costume handing out candy and treats to refugee children, trying to make them smile through a tough time.

Every day, train after train brings new refugees, thousands upon thousands of people seeking safety from Russia’s invasion.

One of them is Joseph Nichols, an American who arrived with his wife after a four-day journey from Ukraine.

“We were lucky,” Nichols said, telling Spectrum News that he was in the U.S. when Russia invaded, but rushed back to Ukraine after their home was destroyed by the fighting.

“Gone,” Nichols said.

Nichols and his wife plan on moving on from Warsaw to a “more quiet” place in Poland for a few weeks — signs inside the train station urge refugees to travel to smaller cities, saying the larger ones have become “overcrowded.”

“Big cities in Poland are already overcrowded,” one sign in the station reads. “Don’t be afraid to go to smaller towns: they are peaceful, have good infrastructure, and are well-adapted.”

Authorities in Poland have been providing free transportation to get to other European Union countries, including eight special trains per day traveling directly to Germany, according to one official.

Despite the danger, leaving everything behind is a difficult decision.

“It’s not an easy choice for the millions of people,” Nichols told Spectrum News. ""You know, family, friends, language, culture. A lot of them are going back already.”

As for Nichols? “No, no.”

On Friday, President Joe Biden landed in Poland to be briefed on the humanitarian crisis and to announce $1 billion in additional aid. On Saturday, he will meet with Ukrainian refugees, after announcing this week that the U.S. will welcome as many as 100,000 Ukrainians into the United States.

The volunteers at Warsaw’s train station are a stark reminder of how much aid is still needed.

But for some, their presence makes all the difference.

“The volunteers here in Poland — the help given is remarkable, just fantastic,” Nichols said. “People smiling, helpful, no questions asked.”

“It would be a mess if those weren’t doing what they’re doing,” he added.",https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2022/03/25/poland-warsaw-train-station-ukraine-russia
