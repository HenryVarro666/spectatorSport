With one of President Biden’s top foreign-policy goals imperiled, the U.S. official said Washington would start exploring alternatives to the deal over the next week if Russia didn’t back away from its demands for written guarantees exempting Russia from Ukraine-related sanctions that could curtail its future trade with Iran. Such guarantees could undercut the West’s punishing array of sanctions leveled at Russia over the Ukraine invasion.

""I don’t see the scope for going beyond what is within the confines of the JCPOA,"" the U.S. official said, referring to the 2015 nuclear deal formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. ""I think it’s pretty safe to say that there is no room for making exemptions beyond those.""

RUSSIA ASKED CHINA FOR HELP AHEAD OF US MEETING, ZELENSKYY WANTS TALKS WITH PUTIN: LIVE UPDATES

Meanwhile, Iran’s top paramilitary force took responsibility for a missile attack early Sunday on what it claimed were Israeli targets. It said the strike was in response to recent Israeli actions in the region, which included an airstrike last week in Syria that killed two of the group’s commanders.

The Iranian attack is likely to create more regional resistance to American efforts to strike a new nuclear containment deal with Iran. The U.S. effort to resurrect the deal with Iran, which then-President Donald Trump withdrew from in 2018, has drawn criticism from Israeli and Persian Gulf leaders who worry that it will allow Tehran to continue to arm allies across the region and carry out its own missile strikes with impunity.

American, Iraqi and other world leaders condemned Sunday’s missile strike as a destabilizing act, as the Israeli military stepped up its defenses and U.S. officials considered how to respond. The French foreign ministry warned that the strike could imperil talks over the nuclear deal.

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said U.S. officials are still seeking an agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear program despite the Iranian missile strike in Iraq.

""If Iran has a nuclear weapon, its ability to project power into the Middle East and to deter us, our allies, and partners, is enormous,"" Ms. Sherman said on Fox News Sunday. ""So President Biden believes very strongly, as does Secretary Blinken, as do I, that we need to make sure that Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and then we also need to deal with their malign behavior in the region.""

Time is pressing. U.S. and European officials say that Iran’s nuclear work has expanded close to a point that the deal’s main benefit to the West—keeping Iran months away from amassing enough nuclear fuel for a nuclear weapon—would be impossible. Iran is currently just a few weeks from that so-called breakout point.

The senior U.S. official said an agreement between Iran and the U.S. was ""within reach,"" saying only a few issues were holding up a deal when talks in Vienna were broken off Friday because of Russia’s demand. The official called Russia’s demands ""the most serious stumbling block and obstacle to reaching a deal.""

IRAN COULD SUPPLY AN 'INITIAL 1.3 MILLION BARRELS A DAY' TO GLOBAL MARKET IF NUCLEAR DEAL REACHED, EXPERT SAYS

There was no comment from Iran or Russia.

European officials say Russia had promised to respond with its precise demands for guarantees in the next few days. They have also started to explore among themselves options for pursuing a deal without Russia, two diplomats said.

""We would know within a week whether or not Russia is prepared to back down,"" the U.S. official said.

Earlier this month, as Western diplomats were seeking to wrap up the talks, Russia requested guarantees that its work under the JCPOA would be exempted from Western sanctions over Ukraine. The U.S. had given sanctions waivers for the 2015 deal.

However after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters Moscow wanted much broader guarantees, its chief negotiator in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, presented a second paper to European negotiators on Tuesday seeking to protect all future trade and investment against Ukraine-related sanctions.

It couldn’t be determined whether Iran would be willing to negotiate an alternative deal without Russia, or whether China—which has grown closer to Russia—would participate.

Mr. Ulyanov on Friday said his country’s demands weren’t the only reason an agreement on reviving the nuclear deal hadn’t been reached. Since negotiations hadn’t concluded, it was his country’s right to raise its concerns, he said.

The U.S. push to salvage the deal also comes as the Biden administration is on the hunt for new oil supplies during the war in Ukraine, as it seeks to contain surging energy prices. Iran could supply up to a million barrels a day of new crude supplies eventually if sanctions are lifted.

GAS PRICES: CAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE STAY UNDER $4 PER GALLON?

One option for the U.S. and its partners would be to create an interim deal that could freeze some of Iran’s activities and wind back aspects of its nuclear program in return for some level of sanctions relief from the U.S. Iran has always rejected the idea of an interim deal.

Another option would be to create what the senior U.S. official called a ""replica of the JCPOA,"" without Russia, which would assign Moscow’s tasks in the agreement elsewhere.

""I do think we would be open to various alternatives. We are beginning to think about what those might be,"" the official said. ""We…at this point wouldn’t rule anything out.""

Further complicating any attempt to re-craft a deal with Iran: Tehran has refused to let its negotiators talk directly to the U.S. until Washington lifts its sanctions.

Any new deal would also trigger U.S. legislation giving Congress time for an in-depth review of the accord.

The negotiations in Vienna, which have dragged on for close to a year, aim to agree on the steps the U.S. and Iran would take to return into compliance with the nuclear deal. If Russia’s demands can be resolved, negotiators have said they could be back in Vienna within a few days to finish the talks.

A NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN IS IMMENSELY HARMFUL TO AMERICAN INTERESTS: KUDLOW

Iran has avoided calling out Russia and has continued to blame the failure to complete the talks on Washington. However there have been hints of irritation from Iranian officials, who have said they wouldn’t let external factors get in the way of their interests.

The senior U.S. official declined to say whether an agreement would have been concluded by now without the Russian intervention. Among the issues still on the table is whether Iran’s Revolutionary Guards would have their Foreign Terrorist Organizations listing removed and what any conditions might be around that, Western diplomats say.

Sunday’s missile attack, which the Revolutionary Guards claimed, could make any immediate attempt to remove them from the FTO listing more politically explosive.

The missile strikes injured at least two people, blasted holes in nearby homes, and sent U.S. forces rushing for cover at the American military base in Erbil. At least one missile hit within about a mile of a new U.S. consulate under construction. Erbil is the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region in Iraq.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement that the U.S. ""condemns in the strongest terms Iran’s missile attack on the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. This attack targeted a civilian residence in Erbil, the Kurdistan Region’s capital city, without any justification."" He added that the U.S. would stand with other allies in the Middle East ""in confronting similar threats from Iran.""

Iran claimed that it was targeting Israelis in the strike. Israel has strong relations with the Kurdish region, but Israeli officials declined to comment on reports that Sunday’s strike was aimed at Israeli spies working in northern Iraq.

Israel has been carrying out airstrikes against Iranian-backed militias and Iranian personnel in Syria as it seeks to prevent Iran from transferring weapons to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia group. The campaign includes placing mines on ships carrying oil and other goods that are bound for Syria.

The Iranians, in turn, have often sought to pressure the U.S. to constrain its Israeli ally.

3,b4b5d514-f0bb-463e-bb78-70964c74ef78,['Michael Singh'],2022-03-14 00:00:00,"U.S. officials are increasingly concerned that Russia’s intransigence could completely derail the negotiations.

But Moscow’s effort also comes as Biden faces growing pressure in Washington to abandon the agreement. Republicans have long opposed the deal, but concerns about its efficacy appear to be rising among Biden’s fellow Democrats.

Some career staffers at the State Department and others who work on Iran issues — including those who supported the original deal when it was struck in 2015 — are wary of restoring it now, according to current and former U.S. officials. They worry it is weaker today and that reviving it could involve giving Iran undeserved sanctions relief.

At least two members of the U.S. negotiating team have left in recent months over concerns about the talks’ direction. Ariane Tabatabai and Richard Nephew are political appointees, not career staffers, but are well-regarded experts on Iran. People familiar with the pair’s thinking said they thought the United States was leaning toward giving up too much in sanctions relief and that a restored deal would not be strong enough.

The Russian machinations may ultimately offer Biden a face-saving excuse to walk away from the agreement. In doing so, he and other Democrats would face less political heat in the run-up to midterm elections. And if attacked by progressives and others for not restoring the deal, they could simply blame Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

“Russia, in cynically attempting to leverage the Iran deal to obtain its own sanctions exemptions, may have done the Biden administration a favor,” said Michael Singh, a longtime skeptic of the agreement who served at the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration. “Moscow’s gambit only underscores that a new approach is needed.”

The Biden administration has so far rejected Russia’s efforts to tie its Ukraine-related problems with the nuclear deal, even threatening to find ways to push Russia out of the talks. That, however, could invite more challenges down the line, because a reconfigured agreement without Russia would likely be subject to congressional review.

Privately, some current and former Biden administration officials agree that restoring the deal won’t have the benefits it once did. For one, Iran’s advances in nuclear know-how in recent years could make any cap on uranium enrichment more a freeze than a death knell to a bomb. They argue, however, that even a weaker nuclear agreement may be worth restoring for the benefits that still exist, including the ability to monitor Iran’s activities on the ground.

“From a national security perspective this is still the right move,” one Biden administration official said. “From a political perspective it’s going to be a headache.”

A more-for-less return?

Last week, a group of 70 Democratic and 70 Republican lawmakers sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken raising concerns about the nuclear negotiations.

The carefully worded missive did not outright insist that Biden abandon the current talks, which have been held in Vienna over recent months. But it made clear that lawmakers are more united than back in 2015 — when the initial nuclear deal was reached — that any new deal needs to take into account Iran’s other troubling actions.

The letter urged the Biden administration to pursue “an agreement or set of agreements with Iran that are comprehensive in nature to address the full range of threats that Iran poses to the region.” Those threats, they wrote, includes Iran’s ballistic missile activity and its support for terrorist groups in the Middle East.

The Democrats who signed the agreement include some moderates and liberals, such as Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Andy Kim (D-N.J) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). It was a sign that, while most of Biden’s fellow Democrats will likely support returning to the 2015 agreement, as other letters have suggested, there nonetheless are many with reservations. Many GOP members, meanwhile, are warning Biden that a deal that lacks congressional support will not survive, and that they will fight it. Some say it will be revoked (again) once a Republican wins back the White House.

Such concerns are privately shared by some officials at the State Department and other parts of the executive branch, including career staffers who have spent years working on Iran nuclear issues. A serving U.S. official familiar with the deal confirmed that some in the career ranks fear that, in restoring the deal, the United States will be giving too much sanctions relief in return for increasingly weaker nuclear restrictions.

A former career State Department official who worked on Iran sanctions issues echoed the fears. Like several others interviewed for this article, the former official requested anonymity to speak about sensitive matters.

Russia, in cynically attempting to leverage the Iran deal to obtain its own sanctions exemptions, may have done the Biden administration a favor. Michael Singh

The original Iran deal, he said, “was a revolutionary nonproliferation agreement and removed the most worrisome element of the Iran threat, but considering the advances in Iran’s centrifuge program, and with some of the provisions due to expire in the coming years, we’re giving up far more than we’re getting this time.”

The White House is still pursuing a deal. “Our objective is to ensure Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, and we believe that the best way to do that is for all the parties to work constructively and with urgency to resolve remaining issues and return to full compliance and implementation of the JCPOA as soon as possible,” Emily Horne, National Security Council spokesperson, said.

But Gabriel Noronha, a former Trump administration official opposed to restoring the nuclear agreement, cited career U.S. government officials worried about the extent of sanctions relief the United States is considering offering Iran as a source for a lengthy Twitter thread, which laid out some of the details of the negotiations.

The original deal was reached during Barack Obama’s presidency, after years of talks among Iran, the United States and other leading countries, including Russia and China. It lifted an array of nuclear sanctions on Iran in exchange for severe curbs on its atomic program. The deal had limits, however, including provisions that would expire over time, technically starting within the next three years. (Supporters of restoring the deal argue that the most important provisions won’t expire for several more years and some elements last in perpetuity.)

In 2018, then-President Donald Trump abandoned the deal, saying it wasn’t comprehensive or long-lasting enough. He reimposed the previous economic sanctions and heaped new ones on Iran, including many leveled ostensibly for reasons other than Iran’s nuclear activities. About a year later, Iran began abandoning its commitments in return, and it has since made serious advances in its nuclear program, including enriching uranium to an unusually high level of 60 percent. (Weapons-grade uranium is typically at 90 percent enrichment, which is not that far a step away.)

Biden took office promising to restore the nuclear deal so long as Iran reimposed the limits on its program and agreed to sit down for follow-on talks about a bigger, more comprehensive agreement. Biden named Rob Malley, a longtime Middle East hand, to lead U.S. negotiators in Vienna to restore the deal.

Despite an array of obstacles over the past year, including the election of a more hardline Iranian government, the talks to restore the agreement had been making progress in recent months. But there has been little mention from the U.S. side lately of future talks about a follow-on deal, indicating that it’s no longer a condition from Washington to restore the original agreement.

Those who worry about reviving the deal further point to how much knowledge Iranians have gained over the past few years as they’ve resumed work on their nuclear program — technical know-how that cannot be erased by an agreement. A restored deal also is likely to result in a shortened breakout time (the period needed to produce enough enriched uranium for a weapon) of just six months, whereas the 2015 deal pegged Iran to roughly a year.

A better option, some skeptics of returning to the deal say, is continuing with and adding more sanctions on Iran in an effort to push it to agree to new talks about a better agreement. Supporters of restoring the 2015 deal say that’s the strategy that Trump tried, and it didn’t work.

Malley has declined to divulge specifics about what is under consideration in the talks, including what sanctions the United States may be willing to lift. But among the most contentious are Trump’s labeling of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group. Iran wants that designation lifted. The IRGC sanctions were technically not imposed in response to Iran’s nuclear activities, however, making them legally and politically tricky to lift.

Trump administration officials insist that the legal reasoning behind every sanction they imposed on Iran was explicitly laid out: for instance, to thwart Iran’s human rights abuses or its terrorist activities. But many Biden administration officials say the true purpose of many of the Trump-era sanctions was to make it harder to restore the nuclear deal, and that some may have to be lifted — even if they’re not officially nuclear sanctions.

“We know the Trump administration erected a sanctions wall precisely to make it difficult for a future administration to return to the deal. That was not inadvertent. It was by design,” a senior Biden administration official said. “So yes, some bitter pills to swallow, but that is the cost of undoing Trump’s reckless decision.”

Russia’s new rules

The progress made over many months of talks appears to have screeched to a halt in recent days because of Russia.

Moscow is demanding that a restoration of the agreement include promises that future Russian trade with Iran will be exempt from U.S. and European Union sanctions. The demand comes as the Russian economy has been brought to its knees by Western sanctions imposed over Putin’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The Kremlin appears to be angling for a way to keep an economic relationship with Iran even as it is increasingly isolated from much of the rest of the world’s economy. But it’s also putting Iran in an awkward position: Tehran wants to get more of its oil back on the market as soon as possible, especially now that Russia’s crucial oil and gas sector faces sanctions and there’s more demand for Iranian oil. The Kremlin, meanwhile, wouldn’t be sad if Iran’s oil stays off the international market, giving Moscow’s oil and gas more leverage over Europe.

In any case, U.S. officials insist they’re not going to give into Russia’s demands to tie Ukraine issues with the nuclear agreement’s restoration.

The problem is that the original Iran nuclear deal involves the Russians taking special roles in helping Iran implement the agreement, such as shipping out Iran’s excess enriched uranium. If Russia refuses to play that role, the deal is once again undermined.

The senior Biden administration official confirmed a report in The Wall Street Journal that the United States would consider crafting an alternative deal that sidelines Russia.

Such a new agreement, though, could lead to more political scrutiny in Washington because it is likely to trigger a legally required review by Congress. In fact, some lawmakers argued that even an agreement to return to the original deal triggers that review, a stance Biden administration officials privately dismiss.

The diplomatic wrangling comes as the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, has grown more limited in its ability to monitor the Iranian nuclear program since Tehran began to restrict the scope of inspections in February of last year. The agency’s director-general, Rafael Grossi, has warned on numerous occasions that his inspectors are “flying blind” and stressed the need to revive the nuclear deal so as to restore the strict inspections structure.

U.S. officials acknowledge that time is running short and that a revived nuclear deal probably won’t be as strong as back in 2015. But those who support restoring it point out that it’s better than the current situation: Iran’s breakout time is now roughly a month. They say it’s critical to revive the deal if only to give the United States and its allies some breathing room and the time to come up with a future plan for dealing with Iran’s other troubling activities.

Reviving the 2015 deal “was always going to be a political headache, and we know some moderate Democrats would have to oppose – that was baked in,” the senior official said. “But again, think of the politics if Iran becomes a [nuclear] threshold state on Biden’s watch — or worse.”",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/14/russia-biden-killing-iran-deal-00017113
4,b4b5d514-f0bb-463e-bb78-70964c74ef78,['Published'],,"Diplomats said Borrell was referring to Russia’s demand, first raised last Saturday, for U.S. sanctions relief to be applied to its future commercial dealings with Iran as a condition for participating in a revived deal.

A final text for a new agreement is “essentially ready and on the table,” Borrell said, adding that he and his team would remain in contact with all the participants to overcome the remaining obstacles and finalize an agreement.

But the open-ended pause could also potentially signal a break from which there is no return, putting to rest any hope that restoring the deal will be possible.

“It’s certainly serious. If you lose momentum at this late stage the dynamics shift in ways that it could become impossible to resume the talks,” said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj of the European Council on Foreign Relations.

A small number of outstanding differences still to be settled between Iran and the United States may also have contributed to the deadlock, diplomats said. They include how far the United States will go in removing terrorism designations from organizations such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, guarantees regarding the lifting of U.S. sanctions and the details of a prisoner exchange, which could bring freedom for U.S. and other Western detainees held in Iranian jails.

In Washington, State Department spokesman Ned Price cited the complex nature of the final stages of a negotiation for the pause, adding that there are “external factors that are also interceding” in the effort to revive the Joint Coordinated Plan of Action, or JCPOA, as the deal is known.

He said the United States is not prepared to offer Russia any concessions on sanctions for the sake of reviving the Iran deal, stressing that the new sanctions on Russia are “wholly and entirely unrelated to the JCPOA.”

Mikhail Ulyanov, Moscow’s envoy to the talks, told reporters that the break could not solely be blamed on Russia. “There are others that need to settle their issues among themselves,” he said.

Iran was restrained in its comments after the pause was announced Friday. Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Twitter that he hoped the break would create “momentum” toward resolving the remaining issues. “The successful conclusion of talks will be the main focus of all,” he said.

Meanwhile, however, the clock is ticking on the patience of Western allies to hold out for an agreement while Iran continues to accelerate its nuclear program. Iran has now advanced its enrichment and stockpiles of uranium to the extent that it could now only be weeks away from the threshold required to build a nuclear weapon, and U.S. officials have warned that they will not allow the negotiations to drag on indefinitely.

U.S. officials have in the past raised the possibility of implementing a “Plan B” in the event the talks fail, without specifying what the plan would entail. The options raise from imposing even tougher sanctions to military action, potentially compounding the global instability triggered by the Ukraine war by adding a second war in the Middle East.

“We’re not in that hellscape yet. We are just stuck in purgatory,” said Batmanghelidj.

The talks in Vienna had been focused on laying out a timetable to bring the United States and Iran back into compliance with the 2015 deal. Under a new agreement, the United States would be expected to lift the harsh new sanctions imposed after Trump withdrew, and Iran would be required to dial back advances subsequently made in its nuclear program.

A deal was so close that a podium for the final ceremonies had been erected in the Palais Coburg hotel where the talks were held. In recent weeks Iran had increasingly signaled its willingness to finalize the arrangement, diplomats say.

But the outbreak of the Ukraine war has shifted the geopolitical backdrop to the negotiations, and it is now possible that the fate of the Iran deal will effectively become hostage to the course of the war, diplomats say.

The deal would herald a return to world markets of Iranian oil, potentially tempering the price hikes caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the U.S. sanctions on Russian oil. Russia has no interest in seeing the oil price come down and may also feel it can use the Iran deal as leverage in future negotiations over Ukraine, analysts say.

Putin does not feel threatened by Iran’s nuclear advancement and Tehran’s isolation has served Russian interest,” said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",https://daily.energybulletin.org/2022/03/iran-nuclear-talks-are-halted-after-new-russian-demands-related-to-ukraine-the-washington-post/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=iran-nuclear-talks-are-halted-after-new-russian-demands-related-to-ukraine-the-washington-post

Mr. Sullivan said China “was aware before the invasion took place that Vladimir Putin was planning something,” but added that the Chinese might not have known the full extent of the Russian leader’s plans. “It’s very possible that Putin lied to them, the same way he lied to Europeans and others,” he said.

Mr. Xi has met with Mr. Putin 38 times as national leaders, more than with any other head of state, and the two share a drive to weaken American power.

Traditionally, China has bought military equipment from Russia rather than the other way around. Russia has increased its sales of weaponry to China in recent years. But China has advanced missile and drone capabilities that Russia could use in its Ukraine campaign.

However, international censure of Russia and a globally coordinated sanctions regime – which is increasingly targeting Russia's oil exports, its primary financial artery – are resonating in Vienna's conference rooms.

What Is the Iran Nuclear Deal?

In July 2015, Iran and numerous international powers, including the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Russia, France, and Germany (together known as P5+1), struck a historic deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). In exchange for billions of dollars in sanctions relief, Iran pledged to destroy much of its nuclear programme and open its sites to more thorough international inspections.

Proponents of the agreement claimed that it would help avoid a revival of Iran's nuclear weapons programme, reducing the likelihood of conflict between Iran and its regional enemies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. However, since President Donald Trump removed the US from the agreement in 2018, the accord has been in risk.



Iran allegedly resumed some nuclear activity in retribution for the US exit and for lethal attacks on prominent Iranians in 2020, including one by the US. President Joe Biden stated in 2021 that if Iran returns to compliance, the US will rejoin the agreement.

What were the goals and what did Iran agree to?

According to reports, the P5+1 planned to slow down Iran's nuclear development to the point where pursuing a nuclear weapon would take at least a year, giving international powers time to respond. In the run-up to the JCPOA talks, US intelligence agencies predicted that if no agreement was reached, Iran could create enough nuclear material for a weapon in a relatively short time. Iran's efforts to become a nuclear-weapons state alarmed negotiating nations, who feared a new crisis in the region.

Iran stopped working on nuclear weapons in 2003, according to US intelligence analysts, but continued to collect nuclear technology and experience. Following President Hassan Rouhani's victory in 2013, who was viewed as a reformer, the parties reached a preliminary agreement to guide negotiations towards a comprehensive settlement.

As a part of the deal, Iran pledged not to manufacture highly enriched uranium or plutonium that may be used in nuclear weapons. It also made measures to ensure that its facilities in Fordow, Natanz, and Arak were only used for civilian purposes, including as medical and industrial research. The agreement restricts the number and types of centrifuges Iran can use, as well as the amount of enrichment and the size of its enriched uranium stockpile.



Iran promised to eventually implement a protocol allowing the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN's nuclear watchdog, unrestricted access to its nuclear facilities and possibly undeclared sites. The inspections are meant to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons in secret, as it has purportedly attempted in the past. The IAEA has produced quarterly reports to its board of governors and the UN Security Council on Iran's nuclear commitments.

The Joint Commission, which comprises representatives from all of the negotiating parties, oversees the agreement's implementation and resolves any issues that may emerge.

What did the other signatories agree to?

The EU, the United Nations (UN), and the US have all agreed to suspend their nuclear-related sanctions against Iran. However, many other US sanctions against Iran remained in place, some dating back to the 1979 hostage crisis. They address issues like Iran's ballistic missile development, support for terrorist organisations, and human rights violations.

After five years, the parties agreed to lift a UN ban on Iran transferring conventional weapons and ballistic missiles if the IAEA certifies that Iran is only involved in civilian nuclear activity.

Russia connects the Iran deal to Ukraine sanctions

Now, after eleven months of talks, negotiators appear to be close to reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which removed sanctions in exchange for Iran's nuclear programme being curtailed. However, the talks have been delayed by Russia's last-minute demand for ""formal guarantees"" from the US that broad Western sanctions targeting Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine would not harm its economic and military cooperation with Iran.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the media, ""We seek assurances that these sanctions would have no influence on the JCPOA's commercial, economic, and investment relations regime.""

Russia's demand was swiftly rejected by the US, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken declaring that such requests are ""irrelevant"" and that sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine ""have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal.""



Iran stated that it was seeking clarity from Russia on the nature of their requests. ""We're still waiting for additional details from Moscow,"" Saeed Khatibzadeh, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, told the press on Monday.

Meanwhile, Western nations advised Moscow on Tuesday not to jeopardise the nearly finished deal to bring the US and Iran back into compliance with the agreement.

Britain, France, and Germany said in a joint declaration to the 35-nation board of governors of the UN nuclear watchdog, ""The time is running out to seize this opportunity. We urge all parties to take the steps necessary to complete the agreement as soon as possible, and we urge Russia not to add any additional conditions to the agreement's conclusion""

Complicated situation for Tehran?

For months, diplomats from Iran and other world countries have been meeting in Vienna to try to restore the 2015 nuclear deal. Along with the United Kingdom, China, France, and Germany, Moscow is a direct participant in the ongoing discussions in Vienna. Former President Donald Trump withdrew from the pact in 2018, therefore Washington is only indirectly involved.

Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog said on Saturday that they had reached an agreement on a strategy for resolving concerns critical to the agreement's revival. If fully implemented, the accord will bring the US and Iran back into line with the original agreement, the JCPOA.

According to the watchdog, Iran would undoubtedly reap enormous economic benefits as a result of the agreement, which will allow the country to freely sell oil and gas and access the global banking system. In exchange, Tehran will limit uranium enrichment and accept international inspections and other nuclear-related restrictions.



However, a last-minute Russian demand could make reaching an agreement more difficult. ""Tehran, in my opinion, is currently in a very complicated situation. The Islamic Republic has spent decades attempting to portray Russia as a friend or at the very least a strategic partner, and admitting openly that they have been played by the Russians would result in a massive public response ""Azizi, an SWP specialist, stated.",https://www.indiatimes.com/explainers/news/explained-how-russias-ukraine-invasion-complicates-the-iran-nuclear-deal-564421.html

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.
