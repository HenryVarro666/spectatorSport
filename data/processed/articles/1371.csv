""Sweden is now proposing direct support for Ukraine's armed forces. It includes 135,000 field rations, 5,000 helmets, 5,000 body shields and 5,000 anti-tank weapons,"" Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told a news conference.

Andersson underlined that the decision to send this kind of military aid is the first time Sweden has sent weapons to a country in an armed conflict since the Soviet Union invaded Finland in 1939.

Finland also announced Sunday that it is considering whether to send weapons to Ukraine directly.

In what would be a departure from its long-standing policy of not allowing weapons to be exported to war zones, Finnish Defense Minister Antti Kaikkonen said.

The minister also said that Finland, which is not a NATO member and shares a long border with Russia, had given the green light to Estonia to send previously Finnish-owned field guns to Ukraine.

Earlier on Sunday, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell proposed the idea to EU foreign ministers that EU funds could be used to send weapons and fuel to Ukraine.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later said the EU will fund arms supplies to Ukraine, ban pro-Kremlin media and impose new sanctions on Belarus.

Asked if Finland would send weapons to Ukraine directly, Kaikkonen said: ""We have not ruled that out.""

Sweden on Sunday announced it would break its doctrine of not sending arms to countries in active conflict and send military equipment, including anti-tank launchers, to Ukraine.

“My conclusion is now that our security is best served by us supporting Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia,” Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told reporters.

Andersson said 5,000 anti-tank weapons of the model “Pansarskott 86,” a single-use anti-tank launcher known internationally as Bofors AT-4, would be sent to Ukraine.

The decision to send arms, 135,000 field rations, 5,000 helmets, and 5,000 pieces of body armor is the first time Sweden has sent weapons to a country in armed conflict since the Soviet Union attacked Finland in 1939, Andersson added.

Swedish media reported that Ukraine had specifically requested the more advanced Robot-57 anti-tank system.

“A weapons system that can strike against tanks and armored vehicles has been requested and this is such a system,” Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist said when asked about the decision.

“In addition this is a system that is easy to operate, doesn’t require training and can be handled by a single soldier,” Hultqvist added.

Sweden officially abandoned its stance of neutrality at the end of the Cold War but remains officially “non-aligned” and outside military alliances.

And some of its former personnel.

The fighting in many parts of Ukraine has been tremendously hard. Ukrainian soldiers have proven themselves incredibly tough and fearless, as have Ukrainian civilians. By now, the videos of Ukrainians driving up to Russian tankers to chastise them for being in the wrong country, or of Ukrainian soldiers casually strolling through automatic weapon fire to level a anti-tank weapon at ranks of Russian vehicles have become so common that they’re like a meme which gets reinforced by the hour.

To put in terms that science fiction fans will understand, the Ukrainians are looking like the Sardaukar, Dorsai, and the Colonial Space Marines all rolled into one. They deserve every ounce of praise and admiration they’ve been getting. They don’t just have the swagger, they have the hard-won results to go with it. “Russian warship, go fuck yourself,” is going to be the “Nuts!” of the 21st century.

But still … Here’s an article from Popular Mechanics that happened to drop just hours before Russia launched its invasion. In it, the author describes how the upgraded and reorganized Russian war machine would roll through Ukraine using a modernized method of arranging its forces into “Battalion Tactical Groups.” These groups are designed to have flexibility. They’re designed to let every part of Russia’s expansive set of military hardware and hundreds of thousands of experienced troops work to their advantage. Check out this description of how a BTG would use a mixture of tools to take a bridge away from Ukraine.

“The BTG commander could first send reconnaissance patrols and his flying drones to probe enemy lines, then call up his self-propelled howitzers and mortars to pound their positions. Two motor rifle companies of 20 BMP vehicles, plus infantry, rumble toward the front line, protected by Pantsir-S1 air-defense vehicles watching the skies over them. Once the motor rifle troops penetrate enemy lines, the BTG commander calls up his ten T-80 tanks, ordering them to exploit the penetration and push on. The BTG’s air defense and anti-tank troops then defend the bridge against enemy counterattacks.”

Yeah, that sounds formidable. But it is nothing like what’s been happening at that bridge at Kherson. It’s nothing like what we’ve seen anywhere in Ukraine. Russia hasn’t been fighting with one hand behind its back—Putin has now deployed two-thirds of the forces arrayed around Ukraine at the onset of the conflict, and the troops and equipment busted up outside Kyiv on Sunday morning were among the best Russia has to field. But the organization, logistics, deployment … it’s all been awful.

Why its been awful will be interesting to learn. After Putin is gone.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/2/27/2082710/-Ukraine-update-What-the-f-k-is-going-on-with-the-Russian-military

As the war between Ukraine and Russia continues to escalate after Moscow sent its troops into its neighbouring country, several countries across the globe are sending military aid to Kyiv.

According to Ukraine’s health ministry, the conflict has killed more than 350 civilians since the beginning of Russia’s invasion.

The UN’s refugee agency also believes at least 368,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries, mostly to Poland.

So, which countries are sending military assistance to Ukraine?

United States

On February 25, President Joe Biden instructed the State Department to release up to an additional $350m worth of weapons from US stocks to Ukraine.

In a memorandum to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden directed that $350m allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act be designated for Ukraine’s defence.

Ukraine has been asking for Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to shoot down aircraft.

The Pentagon said the weapons included anti-armour, small arms, body armour and various munitions in support of Ukraine’s front-line defenders. A State Department spokesperson said anti-aircraft systems were also included in the material.

Over the past year, the United States has committed more than $1bn in security assistance to Ukraine, Blinken said.

European Union

For the first time in its history, the EU is financing the purchase and delivery of arms after leaders agree to transport weapons worth 450 million euros ($502m) to Kyiv.

Foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says some nations are sending the Ukrainians fighter jets.

United Kingdom

In January, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK had “taken the decision to supply Ukraine with light anti-armour defensive weapon systems”.

On Wednesday, Downing Street promised military support to Ukraine, including lethal defensive weapons.

“In light of the increasingly threatening behaviour from Russia and in line with our previous support, the UK will shortly be providing a further package of military support to Ukraine,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament. “This will include lethal aid in the form of defensive weapons and non-lethal aid.”

France

France, which has already sent help, is dispatching more military equipment as well as fuel.

Paris said it has acted on earlier Ukrainian requests for defensive anti-aircraft and digital weapons.

The Netherlands

The Netherlands will supply air defence rockets and anti-tank systems to Ukraine, the Dutch government said in letters to parliament on Saturday.

The Dutch government agreed to a Ukrainian request to rapidly ship 200 Stinger air defence rockets and 50 “Panzerfaust 3” anti-tank weapons with 400 rockets, the letters said.

It is also jointly considering sending a Patriot air defence system alongside Germany to a NATO battle group in Slovakia, it said.

Germany

Germany will supply Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles from Bundeswehr stocks for defence against Russia.

It is a major shift from Berlin’s longstanding policy of banning weapon exports to a conflict zone.

“The Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a turning point. It is our duty to do our best to support Ukraine in defending itself against Putin’s invading army,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Saturday.

Canada

Ottawa is sending lethal military weaponry to Ukraine and loaning Kyiv half a billion Canadian dollars ($394m) to help it defend itself.





Sweden, Norway and Denmark

Stockholm is also breaking its historic neutral stance to send 5,000 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, with Denmark contributing a further 2,700. Norway is sending helmets and body armour and up to 2,000 M72 anti-tank weapons.

Finland

Neutral Finland takes the “historic” decision to supply weapons to Ukraine and will send 1,500 rocket launchers, 2,500 assault rifles, 150,000 rounds of ammunition, and 70,000 servings of field rations.

Belgium

Belgium says it will supply Ukraine with 3,000 more automatic rifles and 200 anti-tank weapons, as well as 3,800 tonnes of fuel.

Portugal

Portugal is giving Ukraine night-vision goggles, bulletproof vests, helmets, grenades, ammunition and automatic G3 rifles.

Greece

Greece, which has a large diaspora community in Ukraine – 10 of whom have been killed – is sending “defence equipment” as well as humanitarian aid.

Romania

Romania – which shares a border with Ukraine – is offering to treat wounded people from the crisis zones in its 11 military hospitals as well as sending fuel, bulletproof vests, helmets and other “military material” worth $3.3m.

Spain

Spain says it will supply Ukraine with 1,370 grenade launchers, 700,000 munitions and light automatic weapons.

Czech Republic

Prague said Saturday it is sending Ukraine 4,000 mortars “in the next few hours” as well as an arsenal of 30,000 pistols, 7,000 assault rifles, 3,000 machine guns, many sniper rifles and a million bullets.

The Czechs had already promised Kyiv 4,000 mortars worth $1.6m which have yet to be delivered.

Croatia

Zagreb will dispatch 16 million euros’ worth of small arms and body armour.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/28/which-countries-are-sending-military-aid-to-ukraine
