The two Presidents had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on China-US relations, the situation in Ukraine, and other issues of mutual interest.

President Biden said that 50 years ago, the US and China made the important choice of issuing the Shanghai Communiqué. Fifty years on, the US-China relationship has once again come to a critical time. How this relationship develops will shape the world in the 21st century. Biden reiterated that the US does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China’s system; the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China; the US does not support “Taiwan independence”; and it has no intention to seek a conflict with China. The US is ready to have candid dialogue and closer cooperation with China, stay committed to the one-China policy, and effectively manage competition and disagreements to ensure the steady growth of the relationship. President Biden expressed readiness to stay in close touch with President Xi to set the direction for the US-China relationship.

President Xi noted the new major developments in the international landscape since their first virtual meeting last November. The prevailing trend of peace and development is facing serious challenges. The world is neither tranquil nor stable. As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world’s two leading economies, China and the US must not only guide their relations forward along the right track, but also shoulder their share of international responsibilities and work for world peace and tranquility.

President Xi stressed that he and President Biden share the view that China and the US need to respect each other, coexist in peace and avoid confrontation, and that the two sides should increase communication and dialogue at all levels and in all fields. President Biden has just reiterated that the US does not seek to have a new Cold War with China, to change China’s system, or to revitalize alliances against China, and that the US does not support “Taiwan independence” or intend to seek a conflict with China. “I take these remarks very seriously,” said President Xi.

President Xi pointed out that the China-US relationship, instead of getting out of the predicament created by the previous US administration, has encountered a growing number of challenges. What’s worth noting in particular is that some people in the US have sent a wrong signal to “Taiwan independence” forces. This is very dangerous. Mishandling of the Taiwan question will have a disruptive impact on the bilateral ties. China hopes that the US will give due attention to this issue. The direct cause for the current situation in the China-US relationship is that some people on the US side have not followed through on the important common understanding reached by the two Presidents and have not acted on President Biden’s positive statements. The US has misperceived and miscalculated China’s strategic intention.

President Xi underscored that there have been and will continue to be differences between China and the US. What matters is to keep such differences under control. A steadily growing relationship is in the interest of both sides.

The two sides exchanged views on the situation in Ukraine.

President Biden expounded on the US position, and expressed readiness for communication with China to prevent the situation from exacerbating.

President Xi pointed out that China does not want to see the situation in Ukraine to come to this. China stands for peace and opposes war. This is embedded in China’s history and culture. China makes a conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter. China advocates upholding international law and universally recognized norms governing international relations. China adheres to the UN Charter and promotes the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. These are the major principles that underpin China’s approach to the Ukraine crisis. China has put forward a six-point initiative on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, and is ready to provide further humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and other affected countries. All sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace. The US and NATO should also have dialogue with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.

President Xi stressed that with the need to fight COVID-19 on the one hand and protect the economy and people’s livelihood on the other, things are already very difficult for countries around the world. As leaders of major countries, we need to think about how to properly address global hotspot issues and, more importantly, keep in mind global stability and the work and life of billions of people. Sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions would only make the people suffer. If further escalated, they could trigger serious crises in global economy and trade, finance, energy, food, and industrial and supply chains, crippling the already languishing world economy and causing irrevocable losses. The more complex the situation, the greater the need to remain cool-headed and rational. Whatever the circumstances, there is always a need for political courage to create space for peace and leave room for political settlement. As two Chinese sayings go, “It takes two hands to clap.” “He who tied the bell to the tiger must take it off.” It is imperative that the parties involved demonstrate political will and find a proper settlement in view of both immediate and long-term needs. Other parties can and should create conditions to that end. The pressing priority is to keep the dialogue and negotiation going, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a humanitarian crisis, and cease hostilities as soon as possible. An enduring solution would be for major countries to respect each other, reject the Cold War mentality, refrain from bloc confrontation, and build step by step a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture for the region and for the world. China has been doing its best for peace and will continue to play a constructive role.

The two Presidents agreed that the video call is constructive. They directed their teams to promptly follow up and take concrete actions to put China-US relations back on the track of steady development, and make respective efforts for the proper settlement of the Ukraine crisis.

On the evening of 18 March, Chinese President Xi Jinping had a video call with US President Joe Biden at the request of the latter. The two heads of state had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on China-US relations, the situation in Ukraine, and other issues of mutual interest. Both sides agreed that the video call was constructive. This is also the common feeling of the international community.At a special moment when the Ukraine crisis affects the entire world, the two heads of state of China and the US, two influential global powers, had a constructive interaction. This is what the international community was expecting to see. It's not only in line with the interests of both China and the US, but also will help safeguard regional peace and stability.The video call between Chinese and US presidents expressed the common desire of both sides to effectively manage differences and promote the stable development of bilateral ties. It released a positive message to the world. Biden reiterated the commitments he made during his virtual meeting with Xi last November: the US does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China's system; the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China; the US does not support ""Taiwan independence""; and it has no intention to seek conflict with China. This, to a certain degree, reflects the strategic sobriety and rationality of the Biden administration.The consensus reached by Chinese and US leaders could play a key role in setting the tone and guiding the development of China-US relations. It could steer the China-US relationship through storms and obstacles. If the consensus reached by the two presidents is well implemented, China-US relations won't derail from the track.It needs to be pointed out that the US didn't do a good job in implementing the consensus reached by the two leaders in the past. Over the four months since the virtual meeting between the two presidents last time, the actions the US took against China mostly ran counter to Biden's commitments. This has left the world with a deep impression that the US says one thing and does another. In particular, some people in the US have frequently sent wrong signals to the ""Taiwan independence"" forces. If such ""playing-with-fire"" behavior is not curbed, it will inevitably have a subversive impact on the China-US relationship.This time, the leaders of the two countries directed their teams to promptly follow up and take practical actions to put China-US relations back on the track of steady development, and make respective efforts for the proper settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Next, we hope to see clear changes on the US side.It's worth noting that the two sides engaged in a round of fierce verbal war before the video call between the two heads of state. Some senior US officials made irresponsible remarks intensively in the past two days and even threatened to impose sanctions on China. China didn't buy this. The Chinese side resolutely refuted the attacks and smears on it by the US side through media a few hours before the video call. ""It is impolite not to reciprocate."" China has always valued diplomatic etiquette, but it pays more attention to the right and wrong.The virtual meeting this time was requested by the US side and many have interpreted it as a signal that the US side wants to seek help from China over the Ukraine issue. The US wants China to be part of a comprehensive web of sanctions against Russia. But it needs to be said that China doesn't have an obligation to cooperate with the US, and it doesn't agree with such rough means of unilateral sanctions at all. The US must respect China's different position so that the talks can continue. The Chinese side will never accept US' coercion, nor will it allow the US to use the Ukraine issue to harm China's legitimate interests. The Chinese side has made this point very clearly.Just as President Xi underscored, there have been and will continue to be differences between China and the US. What matters is to keep such differences under control. During this virtual meeting, Biden mentioned the Shanghai Communique at the beginning. The ice-breaking of China-US relations 50 years ago was due to the political wisdom of seeking a common ground with existing differences. Mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and avoiding confrontation are the consensus reached by the two leaders. They should be converted into practical actions at various levels and areas by both sides.The Chinese people always honor their promises. China will implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state as usual. We also expect the US will match words with deeds, and act on what it says to show the world the integrity as a major power, and hope the US will work with China to safeguard world peace and tranquility.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202203/1255265.shtml

The U.S. should follow through on President Joe Biden's positive remarks on China-U.S. relations, said Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng on Saturday when delivering a speech at the 4th International Forum on Security and Strategy in Beijing.

He made the remarks when talking about Chinese President Xi Jinping's video call with Biden, saying that the two sides talked for two hours on bilateral relations, the situation in Ukraine and other issues.

The atmosphere was very pragmatic and the exchanges were candid and in-depth, Le said.

Noting the ongoing Ukraine crisis, he said that China has always been active in promoting peace talks.

""The European continent is a crucial region in determining world peace. It was devastated by two World Wars. It was not peaceful after the cold war and now it's back on fire,"" he said, calling on the world to have a deep reflection.

The world should not pursue absolute security unilaterally, engage in bloc politics or camp confrontation and globalization must not be weaponized, he stressed, adding that small countries' interests should not be sacrificed.

He noted further how the Asia-Pacific region can avoid a repeat of the Ukraine crisis.

Countries in the Asia-Pacific region should cherish peace, respect each other, adhere to unity and cooperation, and insist on self-reliance, he said.

The countries should not undermine regional tranquility, rudely interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, create division and confrontation or let others control their own destinies, he warned.

China stands ready to work with other Asia-Pacific countries under the banner of true multilateralism and promote lasting peace and common development, and upholds open regionalism to create a brighter future for the Asia-Pacific community with a shared future, he said.

The forum, one of the core forums of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, is themed ""The Changing Asia-Pacific: United or Divided?""",http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/view/2022-03/19/content_10141888.htm
