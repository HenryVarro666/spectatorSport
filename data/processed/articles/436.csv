In Jackson, Biden delivers on a campaign promise to make the historic appointment and to further diversify a court that was made up entirely of white men for almost two centuries. He has chosen an attorney who would be the high court’s first former public defender, though she also possesses the elite legal background of other justices.

Jackson would be the current court’s second Black justice — Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, is the other — and just the third in history.

The news was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it before the president’s official announcement later today.

She would also be only the sixth woman to serve on the court, and her confirmation would mean that for the first time four women would sit together on the nine-member court.

The current court includes three women, one of whom is the court’s first Latina, Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Jackson would join the liberal minority of a conservative-dominated court that is weighing cutbacks to abortion rights and will be considering ending affirmative action in college admissions and restricting voting rights efforts to increase minority representation.

Biden is filling the seat that will be vacated by Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, who is retiring at the end of the term this summer.

Jackson, 51, once worked as one of Breyer’s law clerks early in her legal career. She attended Harvard as an undergraduate and for law school, and served on the US Sentencing Commission, the agency that develops federal sentencing policy, before becoming a federal judge in 2013.

Her nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority by a razor-thin 50-50 margin with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaker. Party leaders have promised swift but deliberate consideration of the president’s nominee.

The next justice will replace one of the more liberal justices, so she would not tip the balance of the court, which now leans 6-3 in favor of conservatives.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-february-25-2022/

President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia was always open to diplomacy but put its own national security interests first and would continue to strengthen its military in the face of what he called a difficult international situation.

Putin, speaking in a video statement released to coincide with the annual Defender of the Fatherland Day, did not mention his standoff with the West over Ukraine which has seen Western sanctions imposed on Russia after he decided to recognize the independence of two breakaway Ukrainian regions.

But he used the appearance to send a message to the West about his stance over the issue all the same.

“Our country is always open to a direct and honest dialogue and ready to search for diplomatic solutions to the most complicated issues,” said Putin.

“But I want to repeat that Russia's interests and the security of our people are unconditional. So, we will continue to strengthen and modernize our army and navy."" The United States has accused Putin of massing more than 150,000 troops near Ukraine's borders in preparation for what it fears could be a full-scale invasion. Russia has repeatedly denied plans for such an attack but says it has a duty to protect people living in the two breakaway regions.”

We can see the difficult international situation and the threats posed by current challenges, such as the erosion of the arms control system and NATO’s military activities,” said Putin.

“And yet, Russia’s appeals to build a system based on equal and indivisible security that would reliably defend all countries, remain unanswered.”",https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/LIVE-ukraine-russia-crisis-updates-white-house-says-biden-putin-meeting-off-the-table-1.10628914

Ukrainian armed forces believe more than 60 Russian battalion tactical groups - the equivalent of between 30,000 and 60,000 troops - have been deployed on Ukrainian territory, according to an update on the invasion.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said early on Friday that 137 people inside Ukraine had died and 316 had been injured in Russian military attacks.

Kyiv

Russian forces have entered the city, with tanks pictured inside its boundaries, and appear to be advancing on the centre. Taking the Ukrainian capital is believed to be President Vladimir Putin's aim.

The advance on the city appears to have been quick - the US said early on Friday morning that it understood Russian troops were 20 miles away.

Footage posted online by Ukrainian citizens earlier appears to show Russian tanks driving through Obolon, in the wider Kyiv district and about 5.5 miles north of the city centre.

Ukrainian national guard troops were pictured in central Kyiv this morning lining up with their guns, seemingly in readiness for an imminent attack.

And air raid sirens and heavy gunfire were heard in residential areas near the government district as Russian tanks were spotted just miles away.

A US official said Russian forces were moving from annexed Crimea to Kherson in the south, from Belarus - north of Ukraine - towards Kyiv.

Meanwhile, Mayor Vitali Klitschko says three people were injured after a rocket attack on a residential building in the capital and a fierce battle has been ongoing for the Hostomel airfield nearby.

It comes after a pilot was seen parachuting into the Dnipro river, having seemingly ejected from his plane above the city.

Chernobyl

Russian troops have reportedly taken the site of the nuclear power plant.

Ukraine's nuclear agency said it is recording increased radiation levels in the area, but that the rise was ""insignificant"" and caused by the dust raised by Russia moving in its military equipment.
