Shelling can be heard across parts of Ukraine as Russia has begun its military action. In Odesa, Ukrainian's are packing up and leaving to seek shelter elsewhere.

A MARTINEZ, HOST:

Russia has invaded Ukraine. Ukraine's president says Ukrainian troops are currently fighting Russian forces that are trying to capture the former nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. Russia tanks have also rolled into the country from Belarus. And in many cities across Ukraine, residents woke to the sounds of shelling and air raid sirens. Missile strikes were reported in the capital city of Kyiv, as well as in other cities near the Russian border and in the southern port city of Odesa. That is where NPR's Frank Langfitt has been reporting for the last couple of days.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Walk us through what happened this morning in Odesa.

FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Yeah. I mean, just after President Putin declared war - about 5 o'clock local time - and 10 minutes later, we started (inaudible) explosions, which shook the hotel. These were clearly missile strikes. And it's no surprise because Odesa - it's a strategic port. There's a naval base in Odesa, and this is what it sounded like.

(SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)

LANGFITT: And then jets were roaring overhead. You can hear those.

(SOUNDBITE OF JETS FLYING)

LANGFITT: And then, Rachel, just more missile strikes. Now, most people in the hotel where I was staying - some of them actually slept through this, remarkably. But there's a father I ran into in the hallways. His name is Constantine (ph). He's a lawyer. He was trying to get his family out. And this is what he said as we stood, before dawn, and he was there packing his vehicle.

CONSTANTINE: I am scared.

LANGFITT: Yeah.

CONSTANTINE: I am very scared. I am scared for my baby. And the people don't know what do.

LANGFITT: And so, as he was saying there, people don't know what to do. He headed up north, as did we, out of the city because of the airstrikes. And he's going to be driving hundreds of miles today, west to the city of Lviv, which is near the Polish border, and then be able to settle in there, a place much safer.

MARTIN: What do we know about the damage so far?

LANGFITT: I think it's considerable. But I think what's really striking is the Russian military has come in from three different directions. It is pushing into the Kyiv region, according to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. So it's rolling along, apparently. In the Odesa region, there's a strike on a military base. They killed 18 people, according to the regional (inaudible) there. And there were also additional missile strikes in other strategic ports - Mykolaiv and Kherson - both of them in the Black Sea area.

MARTIN: I mean, Ukrainians have been living under the threat of this for so long now. Even so, it must be a shock.

LANGFITT: I think it was. I mean, it was really striking last night in Odesa, as I was - it was lovely, quiet night, and I went out to dinner and wanted to stroll around, but I was tired and headed back. But it was just a normal night in Odesa, and it is like flipping a switch when this happens. And so a lot of people didn't think it would, even though there have been lots of threats. And so as we made our way north, we just saw more and more people driving north - long lines at gas stations. I was in a gas station trying to get some food and ran into a guy named Sergey (ph), who had jumped on his motorcycle and headed north to try to find a place for him to live and his parents. And this is what he said.

SERGEY: So I left my parents behind, but they will be coming after me when - you know, when I settle everything down, when we know where to go.

MARTIN: And you can imagine all different versions of him - you know, people trying to leave. So, Frank...

LANGFITT: Tens of thousands.

MARTIN: Tens of thousands.

LANGFITT: Yeah.

MARTIN: You spent a lot of time in the capital city. What is the sense in political and intelligence circles about Putin's ultimate objective here?

LANGFITT: Well, I think that, you know, Putin has said Russia doesn't want to occupy Ukraine. Of course, he also said for months he didn't want to invade. Either way, it is a huge country - 41 million people. The widespread thought is what he really wants to do here is change the regime or change the politics of the regime, even if it could involve killing political leaders. And the reason is, Ukraine shares this huge border with Russia. Ukraine has been drifting west towards NATO and the European Union for many years. And people think Putin really wants to stop this and use his army to redraw the geopolitical map of Europe, that after the collapse of the Soviet Union was very (inaudible) to Russia. And many of these countries, Ukraine among them, have tilted away from Russia and towards democratic countries in Europe and, of course, ultimately, the U.S.

MARTIN: NPR's Frank Langfitt reporting from Ukraine near the port city of Odesa. Frank, thank you.

LANGFITT: Good to talk, Rachel.

Meanwhile, according to a Reuters report, Ukraine said early on Thursday that it had closed its airspace to civilian flights because of a ""high risk"" to safety, hours after a conflict zone monitor warned airlines should stop overflights over the risk of an unintended shootdown or cyber attack.

In a televised address, Putin accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. As Putin spoke, explosions were heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other areas of Ukraine.

US President Joe Biden has condemned the 'unprovoked and unjustified attack' by Russia against Ukraine and warned of 'catastrophic loss of life and human suffering'.

""I will address the American people tomorrow (tonight in Indian time) and will be monitoring the situation from the White House,"" Biden said. ""We will coordinate with NATO allies for a strong response and will announce further consequences on Russia.""

Russian forces have intensified their bombardment of Ukraine’s biggest cities, officials said, raining rockets on residential areas and killing at least 21 people in the eastern city of Kharkiv and four in the western city of Zhytomyr.

The deaths, reported early on Wednesday, came as Ukrainian authorities said another five people had been killed in a Russian attack on a television tower in the capital, Kyiv.

The attacks on urban areas signal a shift of Russian tactics amid Western assessments that Moscow’s six-day invasion had stalled. They raised fears the invading troops may now fall back on tactics that call for a crushing bombardment of built-up areas before trying to enter them.

Oleh Sinehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, said that Russian shelling and bombing of various locations in Ukraine’s second biggest city had killed at least 21 people and wounded 112.

“Fires due to the air raids are still being eliminated, shells are being detonated,” he said.

Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, said on his Telegram channel that a Russian cruise missile had hit residential areas in Zhytomyr, about 120km (75 miles) west of Kyiv.

The missile appeared aimed at a nearby base of the 95th Airborne Brigade in Zhytomyr.

It set several residential buildings on fire.

“So far, four people have died. Including a child,” he said.

Інформація щодо руйнувань та постраждалих уточнюється.#stoprussia pic.twitter.com/N4JWS4qOoT — DSNS.GOV.UA (@SESU_UA) March 1, 2022

Al Jazeera could not independently verify the figures.

The total number of casualties since the invasion began also remains unclear.

The United Nations human rights office said on Tuesday that it had confirmed 136 civilian deaths, including that of 13 children. Another 400 people were wounded, it said.

Ukraine’s health ministry has previously said 352 civilians had been killed during the Russian attack, as of Monday. The figure included 14 children, it said.

There was no immediate comment from Moscow.

Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, describing it as a “special military operation” aimed at dislodging “neo-Nazis” ruling Ukraine.

But facing emboldened Ukrainian troops bolstered by citizen soldiers, Russia has failed to capture a single city since its full-scale invasion began nearly a week ago.

“Looking at the Russian operation so far, they’re having tremendous problems with logistics and communications. The whole effort seems shambolic,” Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at Washington’s Wilson Center, wrote in a tweet.

A miles-long armoured column bearing down on Kyiv also has not made any advances in the past 24 hours, according to a US defence official who spoke to the Reuters news agency, frozen in place by logistics problems, short on fuel and food, and perhaps pausing to reassess tactics.

The defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters: “One reason why things appear to be stalled north of Kyiv is that the Russians themselves are regrouping and rethinking and trying to adjust to the challenges that they’ve had.”

The Russians have been surprised not only by the scale of Ukrainian resistance but also by poor morale among their own forces, some of whom surrendered without a fight, the official said, without providing evidence.

Many Western military analysts fear that Russia may be shifting tactics, and using artillery and air bombardments to pulverize cities to crush fighters’ resolve.

The United Kingdom’s defence ministry said it had seen an increase in Russian air and artillery strikes on populated urban areas over the past two days.

It also said three cities – Kharkiv, Kherson and Mariupol – were encircled by Russian forces.

Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, said it has documented a cluster bomb attack outside a hospital in Ukraine’s east in recent days.

Residents also reported the use of such weapons in Kharkiv, and Kiyanka village.

Cluster bombs shoot smaller “bomblets” over a large area, many of which fail to explode until long after they have been dropped. If their use is confirmed, that would represent a new level of brutality in the war and could lead to the further isolation of Russia.

The Kremlin denied using cluster bombs.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/2/more-deaths-as-russia-intensifies-bombing-of-ukraine-cities

Odessa is also an administrative centre of the Odessa Oblast and a multiethnic major cultural centre. Odessa is the third most populous city in Ukraine and is alternatively known as the ""pearl of the Black Sea, ""the ""South Capital"" (under the Russian Empire and Soviet Union), and ""Southern Palmyra"".

The predecessor of Odessa, a small Tatar settlement, was founded by Haci I Giray, the Khan of Crimea, in 1440 and originally named after him as ""Hacibey"". After a period of Lithuanian control, it passed into the domain of the Ottoman Sultan in 1529 and remained in Ottoman hands until the Ottoman Empire's defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1792.

In 1794, the city of Odessa was founded by a decree of the Empress Catherine the Great. From 1819 to 1858, Odessa was a free port. During the Soviet period it was the most important port of trade in the Soviet Union and a Soviet naval base. On 1 January 2000, the Quarantine Pier at Odessa Commercial Sea Port was declared a free port and free economic zone for a period of 25 years.

During the 19th century, it was the fourth largest city of Imperial Russia, after Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Warsaw. Its historical architecture has a style more Mediterranean than Russian, having been heavily influenced by French and Italian styles. Some buildings are built in a mixture of different styles, including Art Nouveau, Renaissance and Classicist.

Odessa is a warm-water port. The city of Odessa hosts both the Port of Odessa and Port Yuzhne, a significant oil terminal situated in the city's suburbs. Another notable port, Illichivsk, is located in the same oblast, to the south-west of Odessa. Together they represent a major transport hub integrating with railways. Odessa's oil and chemical processing facilities are connected to Russian and European networks by strategic pipelines.

Odessa

Overlay image (Before and After)

This week, our tour of European cities takes us over the major city of Odessa in the south of central Ukraine, which is capital of Odessa administrative region. Odessa is the main trading and fishing port of the country and its harbour is kept open all year round, with the use of ice-breakers in winter. It is also a major industrial city, a cultural centre (with several museums and theatres, and an opera house), and owing to its milder climate, a popular resort.

The city being a rail junction helps Odessa with some of its exports:

Petroleum

Processed food

Fertiliser

Chemicals

Plastics

Pharmaceuticals

Machinery

Clothing

Odessa also is a centre for higher learning, with a university, polytechnic, medical schools, marine academy and a music conservatory.

A colony from ancient Greece may have occupied the site of the city once, and Crimean Tatars traded there in the 14th century. Odessa itself was founded in 1794 as a Russian naval fortress on territory annexed from Turkey in 1792. By the early 19th century, the Russian settlement had become an important grain port.

During the Crimean War, Odessa was bombarded by both French and British naval forces. In 1905, the city was the site of a workers' uprising; supported by the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin. Odessa suffered heavy damage during The Second World War, when it was occupied from 1941 to 1944 by German and Romanian forces. During the occupation, many civilians were killed by the occupying forces.

These images were acquired by the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites over thirty-one years and aims to show the difference from 1985 until today in Odessa. In these two images, using this comparison, you can see the changing urban development to the west of the city and in the harbour area, where new infrastructure has been built.

Another aim of these images is to promote the opportunity to download Landsat data through the ESA portals, where images captured every day are made available in near real time to the users and the scientific community.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine by land, air, and sea on Thursday morning, in what NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg condemned as a ""brutal act of war.""

People across Ukraine were jolted from their sleep by the sounds of sirens and explosions as Russian airstrikes hit the country's capital and other cities.

Eyewitnesses told Insider that this was their first realization that a full-scale invasion was underway.

—U.S. Embassy Kyiv (@USEmbassyKyiv) February 24, 2022

In Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, the airstrikes started before dawn, and across the city of 3 million people, the sound of explosions, gunfire, and sirens was heard, Reuters reported.

""I woke up at five in the morning to the sounds of the blasts. We all did,"" said Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, a member of the Ukrainian parliament with the European Solidarity Party, speaking to Insider from her home in Kyiv.

Bryan Stern from Project Dynamo, an American group helping to evacuate American, Canadian, and UK citizens from Ukraine, said his ""entire room shook"" when a missile landed near his hotel room in downtown Kyiv. ""It was pretty intense,"" he added.

Witnesses also described missile blasts in other cities, including Kramatorsk, Dnipro, and Odesa, reports said.

Minutes after President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation on Thursday morning, The New York Times reported, explosions were visible in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.

Makama Ezekial, a South African living in Kharkiv, said the ""crashing sounds"" of missiles exploding made him jump out of bed. Ezekial said he immediately went to find his children because he was afraid for their safety.

His children were fine. But Reuters reported that emergency services said a boy was killed in Kharkiv after shelling struck an apartment complex.

In Odesa, a picturesque tourist hub in the southwest of Ukraine, a local journalist said he heard ""roughly 20 rockets"" explode near his home on Thursday morning.

""Then we saw the smoke from the balcony,"" said Ugo Poletti, the editor in chief of The Odessa Journal.

But despite the ""scary scenario,"" Poletti said the citizens of Odesa appeared to be ""quite calm.""

Yosri Lahouar, a Tunisian living in Ukraine, was also struck by the calmness of the locals in Odesa.

A missile landed about 10 meters away from Lahouar's apartment, he said. He immediately grabbed his backpack and ran out to the streets to find shelter as smoke engulfed him, he said.

Then 10 minutes later, he continued, there was another explosion nearby. ""I was on the ground, and I started to cry,"" he said.

Lahouar said his reaction stood out from the crowd. ""When I looked around, everyone was walking around normally, like nothing had happened,"" he said. ""I was surprised.""

The explosions, Lahouar added, were a moment of clarity for him. He said, ""At first, I was one of the voices who thought that war would never happen."" But as of this morning, he said, he had to come to terms with the fact that he was living in a ""war zone.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-invades-ukraine-eyewitnesses-to-bombing-of-kyiv-odessa-kharkiv-2022-2
