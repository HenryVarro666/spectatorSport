0,9916ae1f-cab8-4b6d-ac0b-d5b0caba4af8,[],2022-02-23 00:00:00,"KYIV, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The Ukrainian parliament has approved a declaration of a state of emergency in the entire country, except for two eastern regions where it has already been in place since 2014.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy proposed introducing a nationwide state of emergency earlier on Wednesday, as the country braces for a possible large scale military offensive from Russia.

The state of emergency comes into force at midnight local time (1000 GMT). It will last 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days.

The declaration means that Ukraine can impose restrictions on the freedom of movement of conscripted reservists and curbs on the distribution of information and media, as well as introduce personal document checks.

It also gives authorities a right to impose a curfew and ban mass gatherings and strikes.

KYIV, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine will introduce a nationwide state of emergency in which special restrictions will apply in order to keep the country calm and protect its economy amid fears of a Russian invasion,

a senior Ukrainian security official said on Wednesday.

The state of emergency will last for 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days, Oleksiy Danilov told a briefing. Parliament must now vote to enact the decision.

Introducing a state of emergency gives powers to the authorities, who can choose which ones to implement. These could include restrictions on transport, extra protection for critical infrastructure and a ban on strikes.

Regional authorities can make decisions on whether to introduce curfews and other measures, Danilov said.

""These are preventive measures to keep calm in the country, so that our economy and our country can work,"" Danilov said.

""Depending on the threats that may arise in certain territories, there will be either a more strengthened or more weakened state of emergency. We are talking about border areas where we have a border with the Russian Federation, with Belarus,"" he said.

Ukraine has introduced a series of measures including the conscription of reservists as it braces for a possible military offensive from Russia, which sent troops into eastern Ukraine this week to prop up two breakaway regions.

Danilov reiterated that Ukraine was not introducing general mobilisation yet.

Some lawmakers have urged the government to impose martial law - a move that could trigger a response from Russia. Danilov said no such decision had been taken yet.

""If necessary, this provision will be adopted immediately,"" he said.

Martial law would impose harder restrictions, which could include bans on meetings, movements and political parties.

The state border guards service said new measures had been introduced regarding the stay of foreigners near the border zone, the use of radios, flights of drones and the filming and photographing of certain people and buildings.

The state of emergency applies to all of Ukraine except the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where it has been in place since 2014.

Russian-backed fighters have controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014. Russia recognised them as independent states and approved use of its troops abroad this week.

Danilov also said that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had not discussed the development of nuclear weapons, something Russian President Vladimir Putin has said posed a strategic threat for Russia.

Event: There are reports that on February 23, the government of Ukraine declared a state of emergency. The decree went into force at midnight on February 24 for 30 days. Each oblast will decide on the measures to be implemented according to local requirements. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, increased security inspections; and other measures.

On February 24, 2022, the Government of Ukraine closed its airspace to all commercial flights due to Russian military actions. U.S. citizens should not travel to Ukraine, and those in Ukraine should depart immediately using commercial or other privately available ground transportation options. The Department previously ordered the departure of most U.S. direct hire employees from Embassy Kyiv on February 12, 2022.

Actions to Take:

The Department of State continues to urge U.S. citizens to depart Ukraine immediately using commercial or private means due to the increased threat of Russian military action.

Follow any state of emergency measures imposed in your oblast.

Carry ID and ensure travel documents are valid and easily accessible.

Monitor local and international news and social media news channels for updates.

4,9916ae1f-cab8-4b6d-ac0b-d5b0caba4af8,['The Economist'],,"IN UKRAINE’S WEST families flee from war as one, but crumble into pieces upon arrival. Using powers conferred by martial law, the government has banned all men aged 18-60 from leaving the country. Instead they must report for duty at a military recruitment office. And so Anna was this week one of many women to bid her husband goodbye as she crossed the border to safety. She is seven months pregnant. Back in Kyiv, her abandoned apartment is full of baby clothes and the cot that she has chosen for her daughter. Anna’s husband, she says via phone from Hungary, “believes that I will give birth in Kyiv,” because peace will come by May. “But I don’t believe it.”

The Ukrainian army enjoys stratospheric morale and is punching far above its weight against Vladimir Putin’s troops, tanks and missiles. Thousands of foreigners have flocked to join its newly created International Legion, while Russian troops abandon their posts. Volodymyr Zelensky, the country’s president, knows his country’s fight is just, whereas Russia’s is rotten. For that he derides Mr Putin, who ""collects reservists and conscripts from all over Russia to throw them into the hell of war”.

Russia’s generals did not tell troops that they would be invading Ukraine in a war of territorial conquest. Russian lawmakers have acknowledged that the army includes conscripts who were forced to sign a contract affirming that they were “volunteers”. Intercepted radio communications suggest some have abandoned their posts. Other soldiers have mutinied, deliberately running over their commander in one instance, Western officials claim. On March 24th British intelligence suggested that Russia was looking to enlist more conscripts to replace the killed and injured, who are rumoured to number in the tens of thousands. Unmotivated and ill-prepared troops are commonly cited as one of the main reasons that Russia’s invasion has gone so badly wrong.

Ironically, though, Ukraine’s army is built on conscription as well. For years Ukrainian law has demanded 12 to 18 months of military service from Ukrainian men, even if many of them manage to postpone it through studies or parenthood (registering with a fake address is a popular trick to duck it entirely). The practice of conscription itself, like so much else about Ukraine, is a relic that it has tried to shed: when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, all its men had to complete at least three years of military service. Four of Ukraine’s last five elected presidents promised to abolish it. One succeeded in 2013, but it was reinstated the following year, after Russia began grabbing chunks of Ukrainian territory. Last month, just before the war started, Mr Zelensky proposed an end to conscription by early 2024.

So far Ukraine has forcibly enlisted only those with combat experience, even if much of that experience was derived from conscription. The “general mobilisation” announced by Mr Zelensky on the eve of the war is split into four “waves”. On March 15th the army announced that the second of those waves (former servicemen and reservists with combat experience prior to 2014) would commence. Only in the fourth and final wave, if it comes to that, will ordinary citizens need to head to the front.

At present, military kit is harder for Ukraine’s army to come by than men are. Even before the war it was among the largest in Europe. The government has since raised frontline soldiers’ pay to 100,000 hryvnias ($3,400) a month, seven times the average salary; the bills are being paid through war bonds. By March 6th some 100,000 Ukrainians had already chosen to enlist in the territorial defence force, a new branch of the military. Some wonder whether the popularity of Ukraine’s cause makes conscription unnecessary. At any rate, for the army to call up citizens en masse would require the war to take a dark turn.

What is happening now is not full conscription. One recent morning scores of young men, some gruff, some tender, were waiting outside a recruitment office in Lviv. All newcomers to the city must register there within 24 hours of arrival. An officer pokes his head outside and bellows: “Who here wants to serve”? Only a few men put their hands up and trot in. Those men will go straight to the front. The rest are merely there to provide their names, contact information and a list of their skills. Then they will wait for the call.

Elsewhere, civilians feel mistreated. One family outside Lviv station was distraught: the father was exempt from service as his child has autism, but lacked the documents proving he was the boy’s guardian, and so he could not board the train to Poland. They had rushed to pack the day before when bombs hit their town of Izyum, near Kharkiv. In the case of Anna’s family, her husband refuses to fight on pacifist grounds: “We are people of the church,” she explains. The law allows for this. But army officials “were very aggressive” and tried to send him to battle, she says. The defence ministry has set up a hotline for anyone who feels he was wrongly shipped off to fight.

Conversations with Ukrainians in Lviv reveal strong support for such rules, even if they are imperfectly enforced. “The men must protect the children, the women and the country,” says Evhenii, an economist from Kyiv who has relocated to Lviv. Dmytro, an IT worker from the capital signing up at a recruitment office, says he feels a moral obligation to enlist as well as a legal one: “I want to be useful.” His mother and sister are abroad. If he goes to fight, his wife may join them.

Ukraine remains a society where old-fashioned family norms remain popular, even if a tenth of its combat troops are women. Yana is a police officer from the city of Avdiivka, which sits on the frontline of Ukraine’s earlier war against Russia-backed separatists in Donbas. Her boyfriend serves alongside her. But when Russia invaded, the police force instructed all its women to leave. Yana’s boyfriend is still there, while she is in Lviv with her family. But she says she supports such rules, as they help men “work without worrying about their family’s safety”.

Many feel that conscription during peacetime not only forces people to fight against their will, but also makes little economic sense. It costs a fortune and pulls people away from their preferred jobs. That line of thinking helped persuade America to end conscription in 1972. (Of course, it was not fighting a war of survival against a larger invader.) Even in wartime, Ukraine’s minister for digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, has suggested exempting the country’s IT workers from military duties so that they could aid the war effort from behind a computer, or simply work to “fill the budget”, though some feel that this unfairly benefits the well-off.

Asylum and human-rights laws offer states ample room to force citizens to fight, or forbid them from fleeing. Anna acknowledges that her country’s circumstances are exceptional. But she cannot help but recall images of Syrian refugees in Europe having fled Russian bombs—men, women and children, suffering acutely but suffering together. Anna dreams of a family reunion. But it may not come until well after May.

The parliament approved Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's decree that imposes the measure for 30 days starting Thursday.

The state of emergency allows authorities to impose restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organisations in the interests of national security and public order.

The move follows Russian President Vladimir Putin's move Monday to recognise the independence of rebel regions in eastern Ukraine, where the nearly eight-year conflict has killed over 14,000.

Putin has sanctioned the deployment of Russian troops there to maintain peace and received a parliamentary approval to use military force outside the country.

Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly voiced concern that could try destabilise the country by relying on Moscow supporters inside the country, including a pro- political party represented in parliament.

The document also bans information materials that could destabilise the situation in the country, and gives government the right to impose curfews and conduct checks.",https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/ukraine-s-parliament-approves-state-of-emergency-amid-russia-tensions-122022400066_1.html

Ukraine has imposed a state of emergency and told its citizens in Russia to leave immediately, as Moscow began evacuating its Kyiv embassy in the latest ominous signs of an all-out Russian military onslaught.

Shelling intensified on Wednesday at the line of contact in eastern Ukraine, where Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised the independence of two Moscow-backed rebel regions this week and where he has ordered the deployment of Russian troops as “peacekeepers”.

But there was still no clear indication of whether he plans to follow that up with a massed assault on Ukraine involving the tens of thousands of troops he has gathered near his neighbour’s borders.

“Predicting what might be the next step of Russia, the separatists or the personal decisions of the Russian president – I cannot say,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

Later on Wednesday, Ukraine’s parliament overwhelmingly approved Zelenskyy’s decree that imposes a state of emergency for 30 days starting Thursday. The state of emergency allows authorities to impose restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organizations “in the interests of national security and public order.”

The Ukrainian government has also announced compulsory military service for all men of fighting age.

Ukrainian government and state websites, which have experienced outages in recent weeks blamed by Kyiv on cyberattacks, were again offline on Wednesday. Ukraine’s parliament, cabinet and foreign ministry websites were affected.

Moscow denies planning an invasion and has described warnings as anti-Russian hysteria. But it has taken no steps to withdraw the troops deployed along Ukraine’s frontiers.

On Wednesday, Russia took down flags from its embassy in Kyiv, having ordered its diplomats to evacuate for safety reasons.

Sanctions

The United States has described Russia’s actions as the start of an “invasion”, but along with allies has so far unveiled mostly incremental sanctions, while making clear they were keeping tougher measures in reserve in case of a full-scale invasion.

As part of an initial tranche of sanctions, President Joe Biden said the US would impose sanctions on the company building Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

European Union sanctions approved on Wednesday will add all members of Russia’s lower house of parliament who voted to recognise the separatist regions in Ukraine to a blacklist, freezing their assets and banning travel.

EU leaders were due to hold an emergency summit later on Thursday to discuss next steps.

The United Kingdom announced new restrictions banning Russia from the issuing of new bonds in its security markets, and called for its broadcasting regulator to investigate Russia’s RT international television news channel as a propaganda outlet.

“There will be even more tough sanctions on key oligarchs, on key organisations in Russia, limiting Russia’s access to the financial markets, if there is a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said.

The steps follow measures announced on Tuesday, including freezing the approval of a new Russian gas pipeline by Germany, and imposing new US sanctions on Russian banks.

But none of the measures announced so far directly targets Putin himself, or is expected to have serious medium-term consequences for Moscow, which is sitting on more than $630bn in international reserves. The rouble fell, but not by much.

Western countries have been warning for weeks about the possibility of the bloodiest war in Europe for decades. That has not materialised but the apparent threat remains, leaving policymakers to struggle with calibrating their responses.

UN warns of dire global impact

A United Nations meeting on Ukraine on Wednesday heard that a full-scale Russian invasion of the country would have a devastating global impact that would likely spark a new “refugee crisis”.

The US said a war could displace up to five million people while Ukraine’s foreign minister said such a conflict would mark “the end of the world order as we know it”.

The dire warnings were made during a UN General Assembly session on “temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories” that has been held at UN headquarters in New York every year since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the body that “our world is facing a moment of peril” over the crisis.

“If the conflict in Ukraine expands, the world could see a scale and severity of need unseen for many years,” he said.

“It is time for restraint, reason and de-escalation,” Guterres added, stressing there was no room for actions or statements that would “take this dangerous situation over the abyss”.

Fresh troops deployed

Ukraine’s military said one soldier had been killed and six wounded in increased shelling by pro-Russian separatists using heavy artillery, mortar bombs and Grad rocket systems in the two breakaway areas over the previous 24 hours.

New satellite imagery showed several fresh troop and equipment deployments in western Russia and more than 100 vehicles at a small airfield in southern Belarus, which borders Ukraine, according to US firm Maxar.

For months, Russia has presented the crisis mainly as a dispute with the West, demanding security guarantees, including a promise never to allow Ukraine to join NATO.

But the recognition of the separatist regions was accompanied by much stronger language against Ukraine, including personally from Putin.

In a TV address on Monday, Putin rambled across centuries of history to characterise the Ukrainian state as an artificial construct wrongly carved out of Russia by its enemies.

Some who saw the speech said they now feel menaced by a leader making decisions that no longer appear rational.

“In the case of Putin, this is not a struggle for money or power: It’s about pride, which means the mind is switched off. He can’t stop, and he can’t be stopped,” said Lilia, 72, a pensioner in the Kyiv suburb of Brovary.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Russia was heading down a path that would make it a global pariah, and urged it not to “completely isolate yourself worldwide”.

Diplomacy has now faltered. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian cancelled separate meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

A summit between US President Joe Biden and Putin, floated by France at the start of the week, now seems unlikely.

Putin said he was always open to finding diplomatic solutions but that “the interests of Russia and the security of our citizens are unconditional for us”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/23/ukraine-declares-state-of-emergency-summons-citizens-home

He specifically mentioned areas along Ukraine’s border with Russia, as well as its border with Belarus — where Russia has prolonged its joint military exercises.

The proposed state of emergency would apply to all of Ukraine, with the exception of the breakaway Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which Russia formally recognized as independent republics on Monday. A state of emergency has already existed in those areas — collectively known as the Donbas region — since 2014.

The state of emergency measure is the latest step Ukrainian officials have taken in recent days in response to Russia’s aggression. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday ordered the mobilization of reservists, and the military on Wednesday began the conscription of those aged 18 to 60 for a maximum period of one year.

Zelenskyy ruled out a general mobilization of civilians, however, and Danilov stressed that the government had not yet decided to impose martial law. “If necessary, this provision will be adopted immediately,” he said on Wednesday.

In the United States, President Joe Biden leveled new sanctions against Russia on Monday that punished Moscow for recognizing the two breakaway regions as independent, followed by further sanctions on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops to move into the areas.

The United States on Tuesday also announced new troop deployments from within Europe to the three so-called Baltic states, which are NATO member nations: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/23/ukraine-state-of-emergency-00010911

The state of emergency, which would initially last 30 days, would be enacted in an effort to keep Ukrainians calm and protect the nation’s economy, Reuters reported, citing a senior security official in Ukraine.

“Depending on the threats that may arise in certain territories, there will be either a more strengthened or more weakened state of emergency. We are talking about border areas where we have a border with the Russian Federation, with Belarus,” Oleksiy Danilov said, according to Reuters.

The news service noted that some lawmakers have urged for Ukraine to enact martial law, which would impose even stricter restrictions, particularly on movement in general, but no such move has yet been made.

“If necessary, this provision will be adopted immediately,” Danilov added.

The state of emergency would reportedly allow officials to impose restrictions on transportation and ban strikes, as well as give local authorities the ability to enact curfews or other measures.

NBC News added that the Ukrainian parliament has also drafted a proposal that would allow citizens to bear arms in self-defense.

Ukraine on Wednesday began drafting reservists aged 18 to 60 into its armed forces after a presidential order on Tuesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ruled out a general mobilization, however.

On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ratified treaties with the Russian separatist-held Ukrainian regions he officially recognized as independent one day earlier.

The treaties give the green light to Russian troops to enter the Donbas region and build military bases.

A Kremlin spokesperson said Tuesday that Russia recognized all territory that the separatists claimed in 2014 after Russia invaded Crimea.",https://thehill.com/policy/international/europe/595438-ukraine-officials-approve-plans-for-a-state-of-national-emergency/
