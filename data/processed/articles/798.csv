The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

“The broad narrative he conveyed to me is that they will continue their aggression until Ukraine meets their demands, and the least of these demands is surrender,” Kuleba told reporters after he met for more than an hour around a U-shaped table in the seaside resort city of Antalya with Lavrov and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu of Turkey.

There had been some hope that the meeting Thursday could yield a breakthrough because Russia appeared to narrow its diplomatic demands in recent days. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, whose top diplomat has held a total of 10 calls with his Ukrainian and Russian counterparts since the start of the war, said Wednesday that the meeting could “crack the door open to a permanent cease-fire.”

But the separate remarks by Kuleba and Lavrov after their meeting dashed those hopes. And if the Kremlin really was prepared to step back from its maximalist demands, Lavrov appeared not to be authorized to make them.

“I have the impression that Minister Lavrov came to talk but not to decide,” Kuleba told Turkish television.

Lavrov stuck to President Vladimir Putin’s original demands from the start of the war, describing the goals of Russia’s invasion as the “denazification” and “demilitarization” of Ukraine. The Kremlin falsely describes the Ukrainian government as controlled by Nazis, indicating that the stated aim of denazification means replacing President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government with a Russia-friendly one.

In a news conference that lasted nearly an hour, Lavrov took questions from Ukrainian, Russian and Western journalists and stuck to a narrative detached from reality. He harangued a Ukrainian reporter for peddling “fakes” about Russian actions in Ukraine. Asked whether the war could threaten countries beyond Ukraine, he said: “We do not plan to attack other countries. We didn’t attack Ukraine, either.”

Lavrov said Russia remained open to talks, leaving the door open to a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin and pointing to Zelensky’s recent comments that he was prepared to make concessions over things like Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO to stop the war. Zelensky told Germany’s Bild newspaper in an interview published Wednesday that he was “ready to take certain steps” to end the war — but that he needed to speak directly to Putin in order to carry them out.

“We are ready to discuss security guarantees for the Ukrainian state along with security guarantees for European countries and, of course, for the security of Russia,” Lavrov said. “And the fact that now, judging by the public statements of President Zelenskyy, an understanding of just such an approach is beginning to take shape, inspires a certain optimism.”

But Lavrov said that for now, the main negotiating track was the one between Russian and Ukrainian officials who had been meeting in Belarus. Negotiators have met there for three rounds of talks, clashing over issues like limited cease-fires and civilian evacuations. One member of the Russian delegation said Thursday that the date for a fourth round of those talks had yet to be set, the Interfax news agency reported.

Cavusoglu, who sat between Lavrov and Kuleba on Thursday, described the meeting as “extremely civilized,” without raised voices. Turkey, which has close ties both to Russia and Ukraine, has tried to play the role of a mediator in the conflict.

“No miracles should be expected in just one meeting,” Cavusoglu said. “This political-level meeting is an important beginning.”

Russian Diplomat Says Moscow Won't Attack More Countries but Bizarrely Lies That 'We Didn't Attack Ukraine'

The top diplomats for Russia and Ukraine met in Antalya, Turkey, on Thursday for the latest round of talks between the countries but failed to pause the fighting from Russia's invasion that has killed or wounded more than 1,200 civilians and spurred a refugee crisis in Europe.

Despite it being the highest-level meeting so far since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, both sides implied that an agreement was never going to be reached in Turkey, where Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made a false claim that his country ""didn't attack Ukraine,"" according to The New York Times.

Lavrov ""came to talk but not to decide,"" his counterpart, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, told Turkish television.

""They will continue their aggression until Ukraine meets their demands, and the least of these demands is surrender,"" Kuleba told reporters after the talks.

Russia continues to ""seek surrender from Ukraine, but this is not what they are going to get,"" Kuleba said, according to NBC News.

Lavrov said his country's demands were made clear in previous negotiations in Belarus.

""It is there that all practical issues are discussed, it is there that it was explained in the most detailed way what needs to be done in order to end this crisis,"" he said, according to CNN. ""This includes demilitarization and 'de-Nazification' and ensuring the neutral status of Ukraine.""

Lavrov was referring in part to a widely rejected claim by the Russian government that Ukraine has somehow been overtaken by Nazis. The country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish.

""Ukraine is strong. Ukraine is fighting. Ukraine made Russian initial plans fail,"" Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, also said of the latest talks. ""We are ready to seek balanced diplomatic solutions to put an end to this war, but we will not surrender.""

There was hope that Russian President Vladimir Putin's frustration with the state of the invasion, which has met tougher-than-expected resistance in Ukraine, and a slight shift in his apparent goals could ""crack the door open to a permanent cease-fire,"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday before his foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, presided over the meeting.

But in mentioning ""demilitarization and 'de-Nazification,' "" Lavrov signaled a return to Russia's apparent aim of regime change in Ukraine.

Answering questions from members of the media, Lavrov said reports of Russian actions in Ukraine were ""fakes,"" even as a horrific scene unfolded Wednesday when injured pregnant women evacuated a severely damaged children's hospital and maternity ward in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

Asked if other countries could be threatened by Russia, Lavrov said, ""We do not plan to attack other countries. We didn't attack Ukraine, either.""

Cavusoglu reportedly called Thursday's meeting ""extremely civilized,"" and said no one raised their voices. ""No miracles should be expected in just one meeting,"" the Turkish diplomat added. ""This political-level meeting is an important beginning.""

Russia's attack on Ukraine continues after their forces launched a large-scale invasion late last month — the first major land conflict in Europe in decades.

Details of the fighting change by the day, but more than a thousand civilians have already been reported dead or wounded, including children. More than 2 million Ukrainians have also fled, the United Nations says.

""You don't know where to go, where to run, who you have to call. This is just panic,"" Liliya Marynchak, a 45-year-old teacher in Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine, told PEOPLE of the moment her city was bombed — one of numerous accounts of bombardment by the Russians.

The invasion, ordered by Putin, has drawn condemnation around the world and increasingly severe economic sanctions against Russia.

With NATO forces massing in the region around Ukraine, various countries have also pledged aid or military support to the resistance. Ukraine President Zelenskyy urged his country to fight back.

Putin insists Ukraine has historic ties to Russia and he is acting in the best security interests of his country. Zelenskyy vowed not to bend.

""Nobody is going to break us, we're strong, we're Ukrainians,"" he told the European Union in a speech in the early days of the fighting, adding, ""Life will win over death. And light will win over darkness.""",https://people.com/politics/top-russian-diplomat-says-moscow-wont-attack-other-countries/

Kramer', 'Lucas Lilieholm', 'Victoria Kim', 'Katie Rogers', 'Keith Bradsher', 'Mike Ives']",2022-03-10,"Iuliia Shuvalova and Sergei Ignatev attended demonstrations after the Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny was imprisoned. They recently crossed into the United States from Tijuana, with no plans to return to Russia.

LOS ANGELES — Last fall, Iuliia Shuvalova and Sergei Ignatev, a young Russian couple, sold their car and took out a loan to pay for a holiday at a beach resort on Mexico’s Riviera Maya.

But they were not going on vacation. And they did not intend to return to Russia.

Once in Cancun, the couple purchased flights to Tijuana, a city just across the border from San Diego, and stayed there just long enough to buy a used car with a California license plate. At 4 a.m. on Dec. 2, they joined a line inching toward the U.S. border station in their $3,000 black Chrysler 200.

Ms. Shuvalova, 24, a political activist, said they were immediately honest with the American officers when they reached the inspection booth. “Sorry, we are Russians,” she told them. “We need asylum.”

At least two million Ukrainians have fled Russia’s assault on their nation to neighboring countries, and Russians, too, have been pouring out of their country in recent weeks amid crushing economic sanctions and a severe clampdown on public dissent. But a Russian exodus to the United States was already well underway, according to tallies on border crossings over the past year, as the number of Russians seeking asylum on the southern border grew to the highest numbers in recent history.

More than 4,100 Russians crossed the border without authorization in the 2021 fiscal year, nine times more than the previous year. This fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the numbers are even higher — 6,420 during the first four months alone.

Ukrainians have also been crossing in greater numbers, with 1,000 apprehensions in the first four months of fiscal 2022 — some as recent as this week — compared with 676 in 2021.

Like Ms. Shuvalova and Mr. Ignatev, many of the newly arriving Russians are supporters of the jailed Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny and said they no longer felt safe in their homeland. They include L.G.B.T.Q. people and religious minorities, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses, who were ostracized and harassed.

“I get calls every other day; people have been fleeing Russia like crazy,” said Anaida Zadykyan, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who has been helping Russians file asylum claims.

“Politically, the times in Russia are worse than during Stalin; people are living in terror,” said Ms. Zadykyan, who grew up in Moscow. “Economically, there is no money. People feel they can’t survive.”

The spike in Russian migration across the southern border coincides with a confluence of factors that have rendered it virtually impossible for Russians to enter the United States directly, and the number of asylum seekers soared in the months leading up to the invasion of Ukraine.

Strained relations between the United States and Russia had hobbled visa processing at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, as consular operations had also halted in nearby countries under pandemic shutdowns. All that limited legal options for reaching the United States, while Russians could still enter Mexico with relative ease, needing only a visa they obtained electronically.

Some Ukrainians have arrived at the U.S. border in the days since the Russian invasion began driving millions out of the country, though exact numbers have not yet been made public.

A mother and three children who showed up at the border in San Diego on Wednesday were refused entry, according to an immigrant advocate familiar with the case, but the U.S. authorities informed the family the following day that it would be allowed to enter.

Ukrainians in the United States have been inundating immigration lawyers with calls asking how they can sponsor relatives stranded in Poland and other countries. “There is newfound panic, and demand is overwhelming,” said Jeff Khurgel, a Russian-speaking lawyer in Irvine, Calif. U.S. consulates in some European cities have begun expediting visas, he said.

Russians and Ukrainians represent only a small fraction of all the people crossing the southern border. But unlike most migrants from Mexico and Central America, who have often been turned away since the beginning of the pandemic, they are being allowed to make asylum claims at ports of entry. And while a vast majority of asylum cases are ultimately denied, two-thirds of those from Russia and Ukraine have been winning their cases, according to government data analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Between June and Feb. 21, with the exception of one week, Russians were among the top-three nationalities assisted by the San Diego Rapid Response Network, which offers food and lodging to migrants after their release from U.S. border custody. The network has also been receiving a small but growing number of Ukrainians, and the volume is expected to increase in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion, assuming access to Mexico remains relatively easy.

“This is about to become a torrent,” said Lou Correa, a Democratic representative from California who recently testified in Congress about what he witnessed at the San Ysidro port of entry near San Diego. “You are going to have destitute Ukrainians and hungry Russians.”

A flight that he boarded from Cancun to Tijuana six weeks ago was packed with Russian speakers, he said in an interview.

To qualify for asylum in the United States, applicants must establish that they have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. All those who cross without visas are placed in deportation proceedings, and make a case for asylum during court hearings.

L.G.B.T.Q. people from Russia have for years been seeking asylum in the United States. But in recent years, the pressure against them in Russia has escalated with a spate of state-sanctioned discriminatory policies, especially in the Russian republic of Chechnya, according to advocates who have been working with the new immigrants.

“The increase in L.G.B.T.Q. asylum seekers coming over the border reflects the desperation that people are feeling,” said Tess Feldman, an immigration lawyer at the Los Angeles LGBT Center.

Jehovah’s Witnesses, subjected to raids and imprisonment since a Russian court labeled the Christian denomination an extremist group in 2017, have been heading to the U.S. border with photographs of themselves worshiping and proof they were baptized, said Mr. Khurgel, the immigration lawyer.

Most Russians driving through San Diego-area border crossings have been following tips shared by groups on the encrypted messaging app Telegram — about how to plan the journey, find car dealers in Tijuana and avoid arousing suspicions. (Hint: Don’t buy a beater car.)

In December, when a record 2,000 Russians were encountered, officers fired at two vehicles carrying 18 Russians as they raced toward the San Ysidro port of entry. Bullets hit one car, which crashed into the other, and two migrants suffered minor injuries.

Ilia Kiselev, 29, a Russian opposition activist who made the trip in November, said he had felt increasingly vulnerable after a Russian court last June classified organizations linked to Mr. Navalny, the jailed Kremlin critic, as extremist. He attended opposition rallies and hoisted posters denouncing parliamentary elections in September as a sham. The police in his hometown, Yaroslavl, wrote down his information and then came searching for him at his house, he said.

“I knew that I was a target, and I had to get out of Russia before it was too late,” Mr. Kiselev said in a recent interview at a cafe in Los Angeles.

In late November, he paid $1,500 for a vacation package to Playa del Carmen, a popular beach town south of Cancun. Once there, he spent $220 on airfare to Tijuana and to Mexico City; he never meant to fly to the capital but had read on Telegram that Mexican officials had been detaining Russians with one-way tickets to the border city.

From Tijuana, Mr. Kiselev and a fellow Russian rode to the border on a bright-red Honda motorcycle.

After requesting asylum, they were handcuffed and detained in a room with about 15 people, mainly from Russia, he recalled, until being allowed to proceed to Los Angeles.

His roommate, Vadim Fridovskii, 34, another activist, was turned back by American officers who were standing a few feet short of the port of entry. (Asylum claims can be made only by people who touch American soil.) A few hours later, Mr. Fridovskii and his group managed to make it to the drive-up window, and to request asylum.

Before deciding to seek asylum in the United States, Ms. Shuvalova and Mr. Ignatev said, they had participated in activities organized by supporters of Mr. Navalny in their hometown, Ulyanovsk.

“We saw with our own eyes people being beaten and arrested; we could be next,” Ms. Shuvalova, a chemist, said while sitting beside her husband, a chef, on a recent afternoon.

The couple tried to gain entry to Poland, only to be refused visas. So they turned to social networks, where people were swapping information about how to enter the United States via Mexico.

They told their families that they were planning a beach vacation in Mexico.

“They would never understand the truth. They think we are zombies, programmed by Western propaganda,” Ms. Shuvalova said.

In late November, the couple boarded a charter flight from Moscow to Cancun, with two carry-ons and one suitcase between them. The flight was full, the couple recalled.

They spent a few nail-biting days in Cancun arranging travel to Tijuana after getting a tip that the Mexican authorities had been arresting Russians in hotels. At the border town, they bought a car and, with the help of GPS, made their way to the border.

As their car crawled toward the checkpoint, Ms. Shuvalova said, she was trembling.

When they reached the window and requested asylum, “the American officers chuckled and replied, ‘Oh, more Russians,’” she recalled, before instructing them to pull to the side.

After two days in detention, the couple was bused to a San Diego shelter with a notice to appear in immigration court, their throwaway car impounded by the U.S. authorities.

Watching events unfold in Ukraine and Russia, they have been horrified but also especially grateful that they left their homeland, even though some relatives call them “traitors,” Mr. Ignatev said.

6,8c119358-b572-4fb2-9303-c43ca9d14fc7,['Published Am Et Mar.'],2022-03-10,"MARIUPOL, Ukraine (AP) — An airstrike on a maternity hospital in the port city of Mariupol wounded women waiting to give birth and buried children in the rubble as Russian forces intensified their siege of Ukrainian cities. Bombs also fell on two hospitals in another city west of the capital.

The World Health Organization said it has confirmed 18 attacks on medical facilities since the Russian invasion began two weeks ago.

Turkey, meanwhile, was hosting the highest-level talks so far between the two sides on Thursday. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he hoped the meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba “will open the door to a permanent cease-fire.” But Kuleba said he did not have high expectations.

Ahead of those talks, artillery fire was heard on the western edge of Kyiv, Deputy Interior Minister Vadym Denysenko said. He told Ukrainian TV channel Rada that residents had a “rather difficult” night on the outskirts of the capital in which Russian forces started by targeting military sites but then hit residential areas.

Ukrainian officials said the attack Wednesday at a medical complex in Mariupol, where a siege has forced residents to scavenge for food and water, wounded at least 17 people.

The ground shook more than a mile away when the series of blasts hit. Explosions blew out windows and ripped away much of the front of one building. Police and soldiers rushed to the scene to evacuate victims, carrying a bleeding woman with a swollen belly on a stretcher past burning and mangled cars.

Another woman wailed as she clutched her child. In the courtyard, a blast crater extended at least two stories deep.

“Today Russia committed a huge crime,” said Volodymir Nikulin, a top regional police official, standing in the ruins. “It is a war crime without any justification.”

In Zhytomyr, a city of 260,000 to the west of Kyiv, bombs fell on two hospitals, one of them a children’s hospital, Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn said on Facebook. He said there were no injuries.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Mariupol strike trapped children and others under debris.

“A children’s hospital. A maternity hospital,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address, switching to Russian to express horror at the strike. “What kind of country is this, the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals, afraid of maternity hospitals, and destroys them?”

He urged the West to impose even tougher sanctions than the ones that have already plunged its economy into severe isolation, so Russia “no longer has any possibility to continue this genocide.”

Video shared by Zelenskyy showed cheerfully painted hallways strewn with twisted metal.

“There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenseless,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin will be held “to account for his terrible crimes.”

The WHO said it had confirmed 10 people were killed and 16 injured in attacks on health facilities and ambulances since the fighting began. It was not clear if its numbers included the assault on the maternity hospital.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken condemned Russia’s “unconscionable attacks” in a call with his Kuleba, the State Department said.

Two weeks into Russia’s assault on Ukraine, its military is struggling more than expected, but Putin’s invading force of more than 150,000 troops retains possibly insurmountable advantages in firepower as it bears down on key cities.

Despite often heavy shelling on populated areas, American military officials reported little change on the ground over the previous 24 hours, other than Russian progress against the cities of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv, in heavy fighting. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to assess the military situation.

Authorities announced new cease-fires to allow thousands of civilians to escape bombarded towns. Zelenskyy said three humanitarian corridors operated on Wednesday, from Sumy in the northeast near the Russian border, from suburbs of Kyiv and from Enerhodar, the southern town where Russian forces took over a large nuclear plant.

In all, he said, about 35,000 people got out. More evacuations were planned for Thursday from towns and cities under bombardment in eastern and southern Ukraine — including Mariupol — as well as the Kyiv suburbs.

People streamed out of Kyiv’s suburbs a day earlier, many headed for the city center, as explosions were heard in the capital and air raid sirens sounded repeatedly. From there, the evacuees planned to board trains bound for western Ukrainian regions not under attack.

Civilians leaving the Kyiv suburb of Irpin were forced to make their way across the slippery wooden planks of a makeshift bridge, because the Ukrainians blew up the concrete span leading to Kyiv days ago to slow the Russian advance.

With sporadic gunfire echoing behind them, firefighters dragged an elderly man to safety in a wheelbarrow, a child gripped the hand of a helping soldier, and a woman inched her way along, cradling a fluffy cat inside her winter coat. They trudged past a crashed van with the words “Our Ukraine” written in the dust coating its windows.

“We have a short window of time at the moment,’’ said Yevhen Nyshchuk, a member of Ukraine’s territorial defense forces. “Even if there is a cease-fire right now, there is a high risk of shells falling at any moment.”

Previous attempts to establish safe evacuation corridors over the past few days largely failed because of what the Ukrainians said were Russian attacks. But Putin, in a telephone call with Germany’s chancellor, accused militant Ukrainian nationalists of hampering the evacuations.

International Red Cross spokesman Jason Straziuso said safe passage corridors were welcome but have to be well planned, with details agreed on by all sides including the right to bring in food, clean water, medical supplies and other necessities.

Such guarantees are vital for places like Mariupol, a city of 430,000 on the Sea of Azov, where Zelenskyy's office said about 1,200 people have died during the nine-day siege.

“We haven’t been able to resupply our teams in recent days in Mariupol, for example,"" Straziuso said.

Local authorities hurried to bury the dead from the past two weeks of fighting in a mass grave in the city. Workers dug a trench some 25 meters (yards) long at one of the city’s old cemeteries and made the sign of the cross as they pushed in bodies wrapped in carpets or bags.

Nationwide, thousands are thought to have been killed, both civilians and soldiers, since Putin’s forces invaded. The U.N. estimates more than 2 million people have fled the country, the biggest exodus of refugees in Europe since the end of World War II.

The fighting knocked out power to the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant on Wednesday, raising fears about the spent radioactive fuel stored there that must be kept cool. But the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said it saw “no critical impact on safety” from the loss of power.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk pleaded Thursday with the Russian military to allow access for repair crews to restore electricity to the plant, and to fix a damaged gas pipeline in the south that has left Mariupol and other towns without heat for days.

The crisis is deteriorating as Moscow’s forces intensify their bombardment of cities in response to what appears to be stronger Ukrainian resistance and heavier Russian losses than anticipated.

The Biden administration warned Russia might seek to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine and rejected Russian claims of illegal chemical weapons development there.

This week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova — without evidence — accused Ukraine of running chemical and biological weapons labs with U.S. support. White House press secretary Jen Psaki called the claim “preposterous” and said Russia might be trying to lay the groundwork for its own use of such weapons against Ukraine.

MARIUPOL

An airstrike on a hospital in the port of Mariupol killed three people, including a child, the city council said Thursday, and Russian forces intensified their siege of Ukrainian cities, even as the top diplomats from both sides met for the first time since the war began.

The attack a day earlier in the besieged southern city wounded 17 people, including women waiting to give birth, doctors and children buried in the rubble. Bombs also fell on two hospitals in another city west of the capital, Kyiv.

The World Health Organization said it has confirmed 18 attacks on medical facilities since the Russian invasion began two weeks ago.

As the war entered its third week, Western officials said Russian forces have made little progress on the ground in recent days, but they have intensified the bombardment of Mariupol and other cities, trapping hundreds of thousands of people, with food and water running short. Temporary cease-fires to allow evacuations have often faltered, with Ukraine accusing Russia of continuing their bombardments. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 35,000 people managed to get out on Wednesday from several besieged towns.

The Mariupol city council posted a video Thursday showing buses driving down a highway, with a note saying that a convoy bringing food and medicine was on the way despite several days of thwarted efforts to reach the city.

Images from the city, where hundreds have died and some victims have been buried in a mass grave, have drawn condemnation from around the world. Britain called the attack on a children’s hospital a war crime. Two other hospitals were also hit in Zhytomyr, a city west of Kyiv, Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn said on Facebook. He said there were no injuries.

“Everyone is working to get help to the people of Mariupol. And it will come,” said Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko.

On the western edge of Kyiv, artillery fire could be heard Thursday, Deputy Interior Minister Vadym Denysenko said. He told Ukrainian TV channel Rada that residents had a “rather difficult” night on the outskirts of the capital in which Russian forces started by targeting military sites but then hit residential areas.

Meanwhile, the sides held their highest-level talks so far Thursday. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he hoped the meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in a Turkish Mediterranean resort “will open the door to a permanent cease-fire.”

Kuleba said the two sides discussed a 24-hour cease-fire but did not make progress. He said Russia was still seeking “a surrender from Ukraine.”

“This is not what they are going to get,” he said, adding that he was willing to continue the dialogue.

The ground shook more than a mile away when the series of blasts hit a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol. Explosions blew out windows and ripped away much of the front of one building. Police and soldiers rushed to the scene to evacuate victims, carrying a bleeding woman with a swollen belly on a stretcher past burning and mangled cars.

Another woman wailed as she clutched her child. In the courtyard, a blast crater extended at least two stories deep.

“Today Russia committed a huge crime,” said Volodymir Nikulin, a top regional police official, standing in the ruins. “It is a war crime without any justification.”

President Zelenskyy said the Mariupol strike trapped children and others under debris.

“A children’s hospital. A maternity hospital,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address, switching to Russian to express horror at the strike. “What kind of country is this, the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals, afraid of maternity hospitals, and destroys them?”

Sharing video that showed cheerfully painted hallways strewn with twisted metal, Zelenskyy urged the West to impose even tougher sanctions than the ones that have already plunged its economy into severe isolation, so Russia “no longer has any possibility to continue this genocide.”

Britain’s Armed Forces minister, James Heappey, said that whether hitting the hospital was “indiscriminate” fire into a built-up area or a deliberate targeting, “it is a war crime.”

On Thursday, Britain added more oligarchs to its sanctions list, including Roman Abramovich, the billionaire Premier League soccer club Chelsea. The government said Abramovich’s assets were frozen, he was banned from visiting the U.K. and barred from transactions with U.K. individuals and businesses.

Russia’s military is struggling more than expected, but Putin’s invading force of more than 150,000 troops retains possibly insurmountable advantages in firepower as it bears down on key cities.

Despite often heavy shelling on populated areas, American military officials reported little change on the ground over the previous 24 hours, other than Russian progress against the cities of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv, in heavy fighting. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to assess the military situation.

Authorities announced new cease-fires to allow thousands of civilians to escape bombarded towns. Zelenskyy said three humanitarian corridors operated on Wednesday, from Sumy in the northeast near the Russian border, from suburbs of Kyiv and from Enerhodar, the southern town where Russian forces took over a large nuclear plant.

In all, he said, about 35,000 people got out. More evacuations were planned for Thursday from towns and cities under bombardment in eastern and southern Ukraine _ including Mariupol _ as well as the Kyiv suburbs.

People streamed out of Kyiv’s suburbs a day earlier, many headed for the city center, as explosions were heard in the capital and air raid sirens sounded repeatedly. From there, the evacuees planned to board trains bound for western Ukrainian regions not under attack.

Civilians leaving the Kyiv suburb of Irpin were forced to make their way across the slippery wooden planks of a makeshift bridge, because the Ukrainians blew up the concrete span leading to Kyiv days ago to slow the Russian advance.

With sporadic gunfire echoing behind them, firefighters dragged an elderly man to safety in a wheelbarrow, a child gripped the hand of a helping soldier, and a woman inched her way along, cradling a fluffy cat inside her winter coat. They trudged past a crashed van with the words “Our Ukraine” written in the dust coating its windows.

Previous attempts to establish safe evacuation corridors over the past few days largely failed because of what the Ukrainians said were Russian attacks. But Putin, in a telephone call with Germany’s chancellor, accused militant Ukrainian nationalists of hampering the evacuations.

International Red Cross spokesman Jason Straziuso said safe passage corridors were welcome but have to be well planned, with details agreed on by all sides including the right to bring in food, clean water, medical supplies and other necessities.

Such guarantees are vital for places like Mariupol, a city of 430,000 on the Sea of Azov, where Zelenskyy’s office said about 1,200 people have died during the nine-day siege.

Local authorities hurried to bury the dead from the past two weeks of fighting in a mass grave in the city. Workers dug a trench some 25 meters (yards) long at one of the city’s old cemeteries and made the sign of the cross as they pushed in bodies wrapped in carpets or bags.

Nationwide, thousands are thought to have been killed, both civilians and soldiers, since Putin’s forces invaded. The U.N. estimates more than 2 million people have fled the country, the biggest exodus of refugees in Europe since the end of World War II.

The fighting knocked out power to the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant on Wednesday, raising fears about the spent radioactive fuel stored there that must be kept cool. But the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said it saw “no critical impact on safety” from the loss of power.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk pleaded Thursday with the Russian military to allow access for repair crews to restore electricity to the plant, and to fix a damaged gas pipeline in the south that has left Mariupol and other towns without heat for days.

The crisis is deteriorating as Moscow’s forces intensify their bombardment of cities in response to what appears to be stronger Ukrainian resistance and heavier Russian losses than anticipated.

The Biden administration warned Russia might seek to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine and rejected Russian claims of illegal chemical weapons development there.

This week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova _ without evidence _ accused Ukraine of running chemical and biological weapons labs with U.S. support. White House press secretary Jen Psaki called the claim “preposterous” and said Russia might be trying to lay the groundwork for its own use of such weapons against Ukraine.",https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/airstrike-hits-ukraine-maternity-hospital-nearly-20-reported-hurt-172096

ANKARA, March 10 (KUNA) -- The foreign ministers of Turkey, Ukraine and Russia met in Turkey's Mediterranean city of Antalya on Thursday for the first time since the Russian war in Ukraine.

Prior to the tripartite meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister had a couple of separate meetings with his Ukrainian and Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov and Dmytro Kuleba respectively, Anadolu news agency reported.

The first round of Russia-Ukraine negotiations took place on February 28 in Gomel, Belarus near the Ukrainian border and lasted five hours.

The second round took place on March 3 and the third on March 7, both in the Brest region of Belarus.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday expressed hope for the meeting to open doors for a permanent cease-fire. (end) rs.mt",https://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=3030113&Language=en

MARIUPOL, Ukraine -- Russian forces kept up their bombardment of the port city of Mariupol on Thursday, while satellite photos showed that a convoy that had been mired outside the Ukrainian capital split up and fanned out into towns and forests near Kyiv, with artillery pieces moved into firing positions.

International condemnation escalated over an airstrike in Mariupol a day earlier that killed three people at a maternity hospital. Western and Ukrainian officials called the attack a war crime. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russian refusal to permit evacuations from the port city amounted to ""outright terror.""

As the West seeks new ways to punish Moscow, U.S. President Joe Biden planned to announce today that the United States, the European Union and the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations would move to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Meanwhile, the highest-level talks held since the invasion began two weeks ago yielded no progress and the number of refugees fleeing the country topped 2.3 million.

Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showed that 40-mile convoy of vehicles, tanks and artillery has broken up and been redeployed, the company said. Armored units were seen in towns near the Antonov Airport north of the city. Some of the vehicles have moved into forests, Maxar reported, with towed howitzers nearby in position to open fire.

In Mariupol, a southern seaport of 430,000, the situation was increasingly dire as civilians trapped inside the city scrounged for food and fuel. More than 1,300 people have died in the 10-day siege of the frigid city, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Residents have no heat or phone service, and many have no electricity. Nighttime temperatures are regularly below freezing, and daytime ones normally hover just above it. Bodies are being buried in mass graves. The streets are littered with burned-out cars, broken glass and splintered trees.

""They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to mock it, to constantly bomb and shell it,"" Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. He said the Russians began a tank attack right where there was supposed to be a humanitarian corridor.

Grocery stores and pharmacies were emptied days ago by people breaking in to get supplies, according to a local official with the Red Cross, Sacha Volkov. A black market is operating for vegetables, meat is unavailable, and people are stealing gasoline from cars, Volkov said.

Places protected from bombings are hard to find, with basements reserved for women and children, he said. Residents, Volkov said, are turning on one another: ""People started to attack each other for food.""

Repeated attempts to send in food and medicine and evacuate civilians have been thwarted by Russian shelling, Ukrainian authorities said.

""They want to destroy the people of Mariupol. They want to make them starve,"" Vereshchuk said. ""It's a war crime.""

All told, some 100,000 people have been evacuated during the past two days from seven cities under Russian blockade in the north and center of the country, including the Kyiv suburbs, Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy told Russian leaders that the invasion will backfire on them as their economy is strangled. Western sanctions have already dealt a severe blow, causing the ruble to plunge, foreign businesses to flee and prices to rise sharply.

""You will definitely be prosecuted for complicity in war crimes,"" Zelenskyy said. ""And then, it will definitely happen, you will be hated by Russian citizens -- everyone whom you have been deceiving constantly, daily, for many years in a row, when they feel the consequences of your lies in their wallets, in their shrinking possibilities, in the stolen future of Russian children.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed such talk, saying the country has endured sanctions before.

""We will overcome them,"" he said at a meeting of government officials. He did, however, acknowledge the sanctions create ""certain challenges.""

In addition to those who have fled the country, millions have been driven from their homes inside Ukraine. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said about 2 million people, half the population of the metropolitan area, have left the capital.

""Every street, every house ... is being fortified,"" he said. ""Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.""

Western officials said Russian forces have made little progress on the ground in recent days and are seeing heavier losses and stiffer Ukrainian resistance than Moscow apparently anticipated.

A child was among those killed in the hospital airstrike Wednesday. Seventeen people were also wounded, including women waiting to give birth, doctors, and children buried in the rubble. Images of the attack, with pregnant women covered in dust and blood, dominated news reports in many countries.

French President Emmanuel Macron called the attack ""a shameful and immoral act of war."" Britain's Armed Forces minister, James Heappey, said that whether the hospital was hit by indiscriminate fire or deliberately targeted, ""it is a war crime.""

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed concerns about civilian casualties as ""pathetic shrieks"" from Russia's enemies, and denied Ukraine had even been invaded.

HARRIS IN POLAND

U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, on a visit to Ukraine's neighbor Poland, backed calls for an international war-crimes investigation into the invasion, saying, ""The eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities.""

Speaking alongside Polish President Andrzej Duda at a news conference in Warsaw, where she is demonstrating U.S. support for NATO's eastern flank allies, Harris expressed outrage over the bombing Wednesday of the maternity hospital and scenes of bloodied pregnant women being evacuated, as well as other attacks on civilians.

""Absolutely there should be an investigation, and we should all be watching,"" said Harris, noting that the United Nations has already started a process to review allegations. ""I have no question the eyes of the world are on this war and what Russia has done in terms of this aggression and these atrocities.""

Harris' visit to Poland came amid a question between Warsaw and Washington over a Polish proposal to send its Soviet-made fighter jets to a U.S. and NATO base in Germany so they could then go to Ukraine. Poland, in turn, would receive American F-16s.

Poland had publicly floated the proposal without first consulting the U.S. Just as Harris arrived in Warsaw late Wednesday, the Pentagon rejected the idea, saying it would run the risk of escalating the Russia-Ukraine war.

At Thursday's news conference, both Harris and Duda sought to brush aside differences on the fighter jets issue.

""I want to be very clear, the United States and Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to do to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop,"" she said.

When asked why Poland announced its proposal without first consulting the United States, Duda stressed his government's intention was driven by a desire for ""NATO as a whole to make a common decision"" on the matter.

""In a nutshell we have to be a responsible member of the North Atlantic Alliance,"" Duda said.

Harris' embrace for an investigation of war crimes came after the Biden administration on Wednesday warned that Russia might seek to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine as the White House rejected Russian claims of illegal chemical weapons development in the country it has invaded.

Duda said, ""It is obvious to us that in Ukraine Russians are committing war crimes."" He added that in his view the invasion was ""bearing the features of a genocide -- it aims at eliminating and destroying a nation.""

Harris praised the Polish people for their generosity for taking in nearly 1.5 million refugees since Russia invaded Ukraine last month.

""I've been watching or reading about the work of ordinary people doing extraordinary things, and so I bring you thanks from the American people,"" Harris said earlier during a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.

The vice president also met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau while in Warsaw. Trudeau credited the Biden administration for rallying Europe's largely unified response.

""Vladimir Putin totally underestimated the strength and resolve of the Ukrainian people,"" Trudeau said. ""But he also underestimated the strength and resolve of democracies to stand up in support of Ukraine, [and] in support of those values, and principles that underlie everything we do.""

Harris' visit to Poland and Romania was billed by the White House as a chance for the vice president to consult with two of the leaders from eastern flank NATO nations about the growing humanitarian crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Already, more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine -- with more than half coming to Poland -- and even more expected to arrive in the days ahead.

Duda warned of a ""refugee disaster"" if Poland doesn't receive more assistance to help house and feed Ukrainians fleeing the conflict. He said he asked Harris for the U.S. to ""speed up"" the process for those Ukrainian refugees who would want to go to the U.S.

""The United States is absolutely prepared to do what we can and what we must to support Poland, in terms of the burden that they have taken on,"" Harris said.

TALKS FAIL

The highest-level talks between Russia and Ukraine since the start of the war failed to stop the fighting, with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov of Russia declaring Thursday that a cease-fire was not even on the table at his meeting in Turkey with his Ukrainian counterpart.

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba of Ukraine said Lavrov indicated he did not have the authority to negotiate even a 24-hour cease-fire, showing that the talks, arranged by Turkey, had failed to alleviate the suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians under Russian fire.

""The broad narrative he conveyed to me is that they will continue their aggression until Ukraine meets their demands, and the least of these demands is surrender,"" Kuleba told reporters after he met for more than an hour with Lavrov and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu of Turkey.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, whose top diplomat has held a total of 10 calls with his Ukrainian and Russian counterparts since the start of the war, said Wednesday that the meeting could ""crack the door open to a permanent cease-fire.""

Separate remarks by Kuleba and Lavrov after their meeting dashed hopes for a cease-fire.

""I have the impression that Minister Lavrov came to talk but not to decide,"" Kuleba said.

Lavrov stuck to Putin's original demands from the start of the war, describing the goals of Russia's invasion as the ""denazification"" and ""demilitarization"" of Ukraine.

When asked in a news conference whether the war could threaten countries beyond Ukraine, Lavrov said: ""We do not plan to attack other countries. We didn't attack Ukraine, either.""

Lavrov said Russia remained open to talks, leaving the door open to a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin and pointing to Zelenskyy's recent comments that he was prepared to make concessions over issues such as Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO to stop the war. Zelenskyy told Germany's Bild newspaper in an interview published Wednesday that he was ""ready to take certain steps"" to end the war -- but that he needed to speak directly to Putin in order to carry them out.

""We are ready to discuss security guarantees for the Ukrainian state along with security guarantees for European countries and, of course, for the security of Russia,"" Lavrov said. ""And the fact that now, judging by the public statements of President Zelenskyy, an understanding of just such an approach is beginning to take shape, inspires a certain optimism.""

But Lavrov said that for now, the main negotiating track was the one between Russian and Ukrainian officials who had been meeting in Belarus. Negotiators have met there for three rounds of talks, clashing over issues like limited cease-fires and civilian evacuations. One member of the Russian delegation said Thursday that the date for a fourth round of those talks had yet to be set, said reporters.

Cavusoglu, who sat between Lavrov and Kuleba on Thursday, described the meeting as ""extremely civilized,"" without raised voices.

""No miracles should be expected in just one meeting,"" Cavusoglu said. ""This political-level meeting is an important beginning.""
