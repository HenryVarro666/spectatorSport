If Russia continues its shelling campaign in Ukraine, then the sanctions that have been imposed are ""not enough,"" added Zelensky.

Earlier, in a video address from the streets of Kyiv, Zelensky said European Union sanctions against Russia ""need to be stronger.""

Referring to Thursday's meeting of EU leaders in Versailles, Zelensky said Ukraine knows the leaders ""who supported us"" and those ""who kept silent ... and tried to water down the wording to make it insufficient for Ukraine, for Europe and for our joint freedom.""

""The European Union must do more for us, for Ukraine and for itself. We are waiting for it,"" he said.

“We have all seen the devastating images coming out of Ukraine and are appalled by Russia’s brutal tactics. Pregnant women on stretchers, apartment buildings shelled, families killed while seeking safety from this terrible violence. We are also seeing reports of other types of potential abuses, including sexual and gender-based violence,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told reporters aboard Air Force One.

Bates continued: “These are disgusting attacks. Civilian casualties are increasing. If Russia is intentionally targeting civilians, that would be a war crime. And as we are all seeing on live television, evidence is mounting and we are documenting it as it takes place. There are strong indications that this is occurring and that the heinous way Russia is prosecuting this war will result in war crimes.”

The US, he added, supports the human rights activists, civil society, and independent media documenting, collecting and exposing evidence of possible war crimes, human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law.

The US will share that evidence with allies and partners and will “support accountability” with every tool available, “including prosecutions when appropriate,” Bates said.

US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield became the highest-ranking US official to say that actions committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people constitute war crimes, telling the BBC Thursday, ""They constitute war crimes; there are attacks on civilians that cannot be justified by any — in any way whatsoever.”

Bates also said that US President Joe Biden's warning to Russia over any potential use of chemical weapons was ""unmistakable.""

""You heard from the President clearly that if Russia uses chemical weapons there will be severe consequences,"" Bates said. ""I don't have anything to preview on that front, but his meaning was unmistakable.""

Bates also pointed to the recent warnings from US officials, including press secretary Jen Psaki, that Russia could use chemical weapons as part of a false flag operation to justify further violence.

""The truth is Russia is the only question in the equation with a chemical and biological weapons program in violation of international law,"" Bates said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-11-22/h_997756f816e71f7bc14311d0d23bfad3

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday asked President Biden to broaden America’s economic campaign against Russia, telling the U.S. president that more should be done to cut off Russia from international trade, according to two people familiar with the phone call. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Zelensky has been grateful and supportive of the economic penalties announced by the Biden administration to date, such as a White House measure announced Friday to end normalized trade relations with Russia. But he also requested that Biden seek to close loopholes in the existing sanctions, significantly broaden the list of sanctioned Russian government officials and restrict Russia’s access to international waterways, the people familiar with the matter said.

Zelensky and the Ukrainian government have been adamant that Western allies move faster to punish Russia economically for its invasion, with Zelensky calling for an international trade embargo on all Russian goods and products. Ukraine also wants the United States to ban Russian ships from its ports and channels.

U.S. sanctions on Russian officials have largely targeted Kremlin elites and members of the State Duma, one of two chambers of Russia’s legislature. Zelensky on Friday asked Biden to extend the sanctions to cover members of Russia’s regional governments, too, the people familiar with the matter said.

Shortly before publicly announcing the measures in a speech at the White House, Biden called Zelensky on Friday morning to brief the Ukrainian president on the administration’s latest suite of sanctions on Russia, one person familiar with the matter said. Zelensky told Biden that the sanctions are having a significant impact on Russia but that he wanted them to be expanded as quickly as possible, the person said.

The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect details of the private phone call.

Zelensky previously tweeted about the conversation with Biden: “Had a substantive conversation with @POTUS. Gave him the assessment of the situation on the battlefield, informed about the crimes of Russia against the civilian population. We agreed on further steps to support the defense of Ukraine and increase sanctions against Russia.”

A White House spokesman declined to comment. The White House previously said in a statement that Biden spoke to Zelensky on Friday “to underscore his support for the Ukrainian people as they continue to defend their country against Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack.”

Zelensky’s request reflects the increasingly difficult challenge facing the White House as it tries to enact severe financial penalties on Russian President Vladimir Putin without causing too much damage to the global economy.

The White House has moved with unprecedented speed to impose economic punishments on Russia since the invasion began. It has limited Russia’s technology imports, cut off U.S. imports of Russian oil and gas, targeted Russia’s financial reserves and imposed sanctions on Kremlin financial elites close to Putin, among other measures.

Russia’s economy still retains key financial ties to the West, however. Europe, for instance, was unable to immediately cut off its Russian energy supply because of its massive reliance on it, and only the United Kingdom has moved to ban Russian vessels from its ports.

“What you’ve seen, at least to start with, is incredible and unprecedented coordination of sanctions from among the largest economies in the world,” said Adam Smith, who served as a sanctions official during the Obama administration. “However, all of these jurisdictions have their own methods for imposing sanctions, and their own vulnerabilities with respect to collateral consequences, and there’s been some divergence.”

The ongoing atrocities in Ukraine will only increase pressure on the Biden administration to escalate economic measures on Russia. Russian missiles struck a Ukrainian military site near the Polish border early Sunday, killing at least 35 people and injuring more than 100. A U.S. journalist was killed on Sunday, and The Washington Post reported on Saturday that Russian attacks have hit at least nine Ukrainian medical facilities.

“The reality is that the Russian army invading Ukraine right now can operate because of the taxes many [international] companies are paying to the Russian budget, which is paying for the killing spree in Ukraine at the moment,” Sviatoslav Yurash, a member of Ukraine’s parliament, said in an interview.

Members of Ukraine’s government have been adamant that Western firms cease financial operations in Russia. Maryan Zablotsky, a member of Ukraine’s parliament who sits on its finance committee, is preparing a list of U.S.-based firms still paying taxes in Russia.

“We should make all U.S. companies leave Russia — not just stopping investment but leaving,” Zablotsky said. “Of course, they’re stopping investment in Russia — that’s not a concession, given the conditions.”

Logistical hurdles could also complicate full implementation of Zelensky’s requests.

Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council Eurasia Center and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, said a ban on Russian ships in certain ports and channels could lead them to “reflag” — to change the registry of the ship to be under another country — though such a move is likely to be “insignificant in the overall picture in Russian economic activity.”

“We definitely need to help Ukraine, but if we don’t want an all-out war with Russia that may escalate to nuclear, we cannot impose an outright blockade. We need to think what can and cannot fly in terms of these measures,” Cohen said. “What prevents China from stepping in and using Chinese ships, for example?”

The domestic consequences could also increase along with the economic measures. Shortly after the invasion began, the amount of both crude oil and oil products flowing out of Russia fell from approximately 8 million barrels a day to close to 6 million barrels a day, primarily because of traders who feared being hit by sanctions, according to Bob McNally, an energy analyst at Rapidan Energy Group who served in the George W. Bush administration. Biden has already been bludgeoned by Republicans over high inflation, and further economic escalation could push the price of a gallon of gas still higher.

Still, administration officials have expressed confidence that Americans will blame Putin more than the president for higher prices at the pump.

“I think the American people understand the importance of suffering some toll themselves to uphold the values that we hold dear that are fundamental to a peaceful world order,” Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen told reporters on Friday.

U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday at the House Democratic Caucus Issues Conference in Philadelphia that he had been on the phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the better part of an hour earlier in the day, and that he communicates with him regularly.

US assistance to Ukraine

On Thursday, Kamala Harris, the Vice President of the US, announced nearly $53 million in new humanitarian assistance to innocent citizens who have been harmed as a result of Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine. While on a trip to Poland to negotiate the ongoing issue of the transfer of MiG-29 to Ukraine, Kamala Harris announced on Thursday that the US would provide additional assistance through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

""This additional assistance includes support to the UN World Food Program (WFP) to provide lifesaving emergency food assistance to meet immediate needs of hundreds of thousands affected by the invasion, including people who are displaced from their homes and who are crossing the border out of Ukraine. In addition, it will support WFP’s logistics operations to move assistance into Ukraine, including to people in Kyiv,"" a press release from the White House read.

The US also announced about $54 million in humanitarian aid less than two weeks ago to offer vital health supplies, food aid, high-thermal blankets, and other help. According to US officials, two million people have fled Ukraine as a result of the Russian aggression, and at least 12 million people need humanitarian aid across the country.

The continuing war in Ukraine's embattled cities has raised the shortage of food in the country. Also, the inflow of a large number of refugees into Ukraine's bordering countries is another crisis, as these countries need to offer food and shelter assistance to them.",https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/joe-biden-dials-ukraine-president-zelensky-explains-us-talks-with-g7-eu-to-punish-russia-articleshow.html

In a Friday announcement, the White House said leadership from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Union will take additional actions aimed at economically isolating Russia in response to President Vladimir Putin’s military invasion of Ukraine. The announcement includes banning imports of many Russian goods, banning the export of luxury goods to Russia and guidance for the U.S. Treasury Department to monitor the country’s attempts to evade existing sanctions.

“Treasury’s expansive actions against Russia require all U.S. persons to comply with sanctions regulations regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency,” said the White House. “Treasury is closely monitoring any efforts to circumvent or violate Russia-related sanctions, including through the use of virtual currency, and is committed to using its broad enforcement authorities to act against violations and to promote compliance.”

The United States’ policy is part of a coordinated effort with the European Union and G7 nations to “collectively ramp up pressure on Putin” and impose additional financial restrictions on Russia. On Wednesday, the European Commission said its member states agreed to amend regulations with the goal of ensuring “even more effectively that Russian sanctions cannot be circumvented, including through Belarus,” specifically mentioning the possible use of crypto assets.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said officials will introduce the measures against Russia starting on Saturday. Though many EU members have not said they will impose restrictions on Russia-produced oil and gas similar to the measures U.S. President Joe Biden announced earlier this week, Von der Leyen said there would be a “big ban” on European investments across Russia’s energy sector.

3. Make sure that the Russian state and its elites cannot use crypto assets, to circumvent the sanctions.



4. Ban the export of any EU luxury goods from our countries to Russia. — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) March 11, 2022

Regulatory agencies and government departments across many countries enacting such economic measures against Russia have also warned individuals and businesses dealing in crypto of possible enforcement actions. Bloomberg reported on Friday that the U.S. Justice Department will be forming a new task force aimed at freezing or seizing the crypto holdings of wealthy Russian individuals as well as investigating those banks and crypto firms that help entities named under sanctions for money laundering. In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority and Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation issued a joint statement warning crypto firms to “play their part in ensuring that sanctions are complied with.”

“Financial sanctions regulations do not differentiate between crypto assets and other forms of assets,” said the U.K. regulators. “The use of crypto assets to circumvent economic sanctions is a criminal offense.”

The economic measures against Russia have been swift and affected many industries. Private businesses from the fast-food chain McDonald’s, major bank Goldman Sachs and credit card companies including Visa and Mastercard have all cut ties with the country in the last seven days.

Though some U.S. officials have said Russian individuals and businesses will face difficulty using crypto to evade such sudden and comprehensive sanctions, a Friday report from Reuters suggested they may be turning to the United Arab Emirates for solutions. The news outlet reported that crypto firms in the country had received multiple inquiries about using crypto to purchase property or liquidate large amounts of digital assets.

""We've been seeing a lot of Russians and even Belarusians coming to Dubai and bringing whatever they can bring, even in crypto,"" said an unnamed real estate broker whose company partnered with a crypto firm.

Some crypto exchanges have refused requests from Ukraine to block all addresses from Russian users. However, Coinbase and Kraken — both with headquarters in the United States — said they would freeze assets of individuals named in sanctions. Crypto exchange Binance said users with accounts from sanctioned Russian banks would not be able to use them, nor could the platform take payments from Mastercard and Visa cards issued in Russia.

Fact: there are about 350 banks in Russia. Only about a dozen are on the sanction list.
