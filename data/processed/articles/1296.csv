""We will spare no efforts to hold President Putin and the architects and supporters of this aggression, including the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, accountable for their actions. To this end, we will continue to work together, along with our allies and partners around the world,"" the joint statement by the G7 leaders said.

The joint statement came following a meeting of the G7 leaders in Brussels which comes at a time when civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine are rapidly rising.

The G7 or the Group of Seven is an inter-governmental political forum consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Calling the Russian invasion unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal, the leaders said that the Russian leadership is obligated to immediately comply with the order of the International Court of Justice to suspend the military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine, without any further delay.

The joint statement also resolved to impose severe consequences on Russia including by fully implementing the economic and financial measures that have already been imposed, while also addressing the Russian people saying, ""the people of Russia must know that we hold no grievances against them. It is President Putin, his government and supporters, including the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, who are imposing this war and its consequences on Russians and it is their decision that besmirches the history of the Russian people.""



The statement further said that the Russian attacks near the nuclear sites have put the Ukrainian populations under ""extreme risk"" with the potential for ""catastrophic results"".

""We warn against any threat of the use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons or related materials. We recall Russia's obligations under the international treaties to which it is a signatory, and which protect us all. In this regard, we categorically denounce Russia's malicious and completely unfounded disinformation campaign against Ukraine, a state in full compliance with international non-proliferation agreements,"" the statement said.

The statement also extended thanks to all those who are providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine, asking others to join as well, while it commended the neighbouring countries of Ukraine ""for their solidarity and humanity in welcoming Ukrainian refugees and third-country nationals from Ukraine.""

The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine continues to deteriorate even as the conflict that began on February 24 with the Russian announcement of ""special military operations"" has entered its second month.

3,3a9a3400-82bf-43c5-b3d9-42d891a78e17,['Online News Editor'],,"Brussels, Mar 24 (EFE).- Western leaders were meeting in Brussels on Thursday for emergency Nato, European Union and G7 summits as Russia’s war in Ukraine rages on.

Following their meeting, which was held shortly after the Nato summit, G7 leaders reiterated that they stand with the government and people of Ukraine in the face of “Russia’s unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal aggression” and the “suffering and loss of life it continues to cause.”

The group condemned the “devastating attacks” on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools, and said it would support the collection of evidence of war crimes.

The G7 also repeated its demand that Moscow withdraw its troops from Ukraine immediately and to comply with the International Court of Justice’s order to end what Russian president Vladimir Putin has called a “special military operation.”

The group pledged to continue imposing “severe consequences on Russia, including by fully implementing the economic and financial measures” that have already been applied.

As part of its response, the G7 pledged to reduce its reliance on Russian oil and gas, and to limit the Kremlin’s ability to circumvent sanctions through sales of gold.

“We will spare no efforts to hold President Putin and the architects and supporters of this aggression, including the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, accountable for their actions,” the statement said.

The G7 also said it was “resolved in our support to the Ukrainian people in their heroic resistance to Russia’s unjustifiable and illegal aggression” and promised to “step up” support to Ukraine and neighboring countries.

The statement also addressed the repression in Russia of peaceful protesters and critics of the war since the Kremlin banned the publication or distribution of anything it deems to be false information relating to the conflict.

“We deplore the Russian leadership’s attempt to deprive Russian citizens of access to unbiased information through censorship, and denounce its malicious disinformation campaigns”, while praising those citizens in Russia and Belarus for “standing up against the unjustified war of aggression against their close neighbor.”

“The people of Russia must know that we hold no grievances against them. It is President Putin, his government and supporters, including the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, who are imposing this war and its consequences on Russians and it is their decision that besmirches the history of the Russian people,” the group said.

24 Mar 2022 11.52 Pope 'embarrassed' by west's increased military spending Pope Francis has levelled strong criticism against countries for increasing defence spending following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, describing it as “madness”, Reuters reports. Speaking to a coalition of women’s groups in Rome today, the pope said the conflict in Ukraine was a product of “the old logic of power that still dominates so-called geopolitics”. It is now clear that good politics cannot come from the culture of power understood as domination and oppression, but only from a culture of care, care for the person and their dignity, and care for our common home. The real answer was not more weapons, more sanctions and more political-military alliances, he said. Pope Francis receiving audience participants in the meeting promoted by the Italian Women’s Centre, at the Vatican. Photograph: Vatican Media/Ansa/Zuma Press/Rex/Shutterstock What was needed was “a different way of governing the globalised world, not by showing your teeth, as is done now, but a different way to frame international relations”, he argued. I was embarrassed when I read that a group of states have committed to spending 2% … of GDP in acquiring weapons as a response to what is happening now. Madness.

Asked whether NATO would provide Ukraine with the list of weapons and equipment requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Stoltenberg said that alliance members are already supplying weapons and equipment, but ""at the same time, we have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe.""

NATO pledges more support for Ukraine

Stoltenberg said that the alliance will increase its support for Ukraine as well as its deployments in Eastern Europe during a press conference that came after an emergency session of NATO member-state leaders.

Stoltenberg's comments coincided with the release of a statement from the alliance as well as the announcement that he will stay on for an extra year due to the invasion, delaying his plan to step down from the position.

NATO members are ""equipping Ukraine with significant military supplies including anti-tank and air defense systems and drones, which are proving highly effective, as well as substantial financial and humanitarian aid,"" Stoltenberg said.

""Today we agreed to do more, including cyber security assistance and equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats,"" he added.

The NATO chief warned against escalating the war and pledged more support for other countries facing threats from Russia, namely Georgia and Bosnia.

Red Cross chief holds talks with Russia's Lavrov

The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, has held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, saying afterward they had discussed the need to protect civilians during Moscow's operations in Ukraine.

""We certainly also discussed the international humanitarian law and provisions of the Geneva Convention in regard to conduct of hostilities ... that civilians must be protected,"" Maurer told a news conference.

""We think we are confronted with a very complex front line at the present moment in Ukraine which sees a lot of people trapped and people caught people in between front lines,"" Maurer added.

""It's not possible to think about access or evacuation, either in Mariupol or another place, if we don't have a solid ... and detailed agreement between the militaries on the ground,"" he said.

The southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol has been particularly devastated by street fighting and bombardments, with hundreds of thousands of people believed to be trapped inside buildings, with no access to food, water, power or heat. Numerous attempts to create humanitarian corridors for evacuation have been thwarted by continued fighting.

Prior to the talks, Maurer had said he would raise the issues of prisoners of war, missing people and detained civilians in his talks with Lavrov in Moscow.

Lavrov said, ""We hope the efforts of the ICRC will bear fruit"" and called the organization an ""impartial and independent intermediary"".

""Unfortunately we don't have any particular basis to rely on conscientious fulfillment by the Kyiv authorities,"" he added.

He thanked the members of the alliance for the support they have already provided, but said it was not enough. ""You can give us one percent of all your planes. One percent of your tanks. One percent!""

""We need to do more and so we need to do more economically,"" Johnson told LBC radio ahead of his attendance at a NATO summit in Brussels.

The Moscow stock exchange is reopening, albeit for limited trading, for the first time since February 25, the day after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.

Trading is to be heavily restricted to avoid the huge selloff that occurred on February 24 as investors pulled out in anticipation of the swingeing financial and economic sanctions that have been imposed by the West.

US officials previewed the upcoming announcement to reporters earlier this week.

Today's announcement will sanction 328 members of the 450-seat Russian State Duma, the lower level of the two-tiered Russian Parliament, cut off 48 Russian defense and material companies from Western technology and financing, as well as sanction Herman Gref — the head of Sberbank — who has worked with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the 1990s when both men were employed in the mayor's office of St. Petersburg.

Long-time Putin associate Gennady Timchenko — plus his companies, family members and yacht — have also been sanctioned, as well as 17 board members of Russian financial institution Sovcombank, according to the White House.

""They personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies, and they should share in the pain,"" Biden wrote on Twitter shortly after the US Treasury Department officially announced the new measures.

The Treasury Department sanctioned 12 members of the Duma earlier this month for their calls to recognize the Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, which precipitated Russia's invasion. Today's measures will also sanction the State Duma as an institution, according to the department.

“The Russian State Duma continues to support Putin’s invasion, stifle the free flow of information, and infringe on the basic rights of the citizens of Russia. We call on those closest to Putin to cease and condemn this cold-blooded war,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a written statement.

Does this name sound familiar? One of the Duma members sanctioned today includes Maria Butina, who studied at American University in the US and pleaded guilty in 2018 to conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government after she tried to infiltrate conservative political groups, including the National Rifle Association. Butina was the first Russian citizen convicted of crimes relating to the 2016 election, although her efforts seemed to be separate from the sweeping election-meddling outlined in former special counsel Robert Mueller’s report.

After her release in 2019, Butina returned to Russia and got involved in politics, and she is now serving as a member of the Duma.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-24-22/h_6d3ff7bb3ce8193ece02333aea7cf5dc
