The Prime Minister is in Kyiv today [Saturday] to demonstrate the UK’s steadfast solidarity with Ukraine and hold in-depth discussions with President Zelenskyy on military and economic assistance.

He reiterated that the UK will do everything in its power to support Ukraine’s brave fight against Russia’s brutal and unprovoked invasion and ensure its long term security and prosperity.

The Prime Minister set out new military assistance of 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems, to support Ukraine in this crucial phase while Russia’s illegal assault continues. This is in addition to the £100 million worth of high-grade military equipment announced yesterday, including more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles, another 800 anti-tank missiles, and high-tech loitering munitions for precision strikes.

The Prime Minister also confirmed further economic support, guaranteeing an additional $500m [£385m] in World Bank lending to Ukraine, taking our total loan guarantee to up to $1 billion. This comes alongside the £394m the UK has provided in grant aid, and will help ensure the continued running of vital humanitarian services for Ukrainians .

A No. 10 spokesperson later confirmed the trip. “The Prime Minister has travelled to Ukraine to meet President Zelenskyy in person, in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people,” the spokesperson said.

Johnson tweeted: “We’re setting out a new package of financial & military aid which is a testament of our commitment to his country’s struggle against Russia’s barbaric campaign.”

Later on Saturday, Downing Street said the U.K. was offering 120 “armoured vehicles” and a new “anti-ship missile systems” to Ukraine. The U.K. government had already announced on Friday it would also be sending £100 million of military equipment, including more Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles, helmets, night-vision devices and body armor.

Johnson had said on Friday the West would not be able to meet all of the weaponry requests submitted by Ukraine, because it “wouldn’t be appropriate” to supply some of that equipment to Kyiv. Asked if Britain would send its own tanks and armored vehicles to Kyiv, Johnson replied: “I’m in principle willing to consider anything by way of defensive weaponry to help the Ukrainians protect themselves and their people,” but said it “ important that we should be giving equipment that is genuinely useful and is operable by Ukrainians, that’s our consideration.”

Johnson on Saturday “reiterated that the UK will do everything in its power to support Ukraine’s brave fight against Russia’s brutal and unprovoked invasion and ensure its long term security and prosperity,” Downing Street said in the statement, adding the pair had “in-depth discussions” on military and economic assistance.

The U.K. will guarantee an extra $500 million in World Bank lending to Ukraine if the U.K. parliament agrees, taking the total loan guarantee to up to $1 billion. The U.K. is also “liberalising tariffs on the vast majority of imports from Ukraine “and easing customs, Downing Street said.

“Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century,” Johnson said. “I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run.”

Johnson’s trip comes one day after the EU’s top executives, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell, visited Kyiv and met with Zelenskyy. Von der Leyen also visited Bucha, a town just outside Kyiv where mass killings and atrocities were uncovered last week, provoking a new round of sanctions by the West. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer also visited Kyiv on Saturday.

Zelenskyy and Johnson have spoken on the phone since the beginning of the war, and Zelenskyy has praised Johnson’s support on numerous occasions, saying “he is a leader who is helping more” than some of his European counterparts. Oliver Dowden, the chair of the Conservative Party, previously said on March 21 that Johnson is “desperate” to go to Ukraine.

Earlier on Saturday, Deputy Head of the Ukrainian President's Office Andrii Sybiha said that Zelensky was holding a meeting with Boris Johnson in Kyiv.

The head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak, said that Johnson's visit to Kyiv was not spontaneous, and his conversation with Zelensky turned out to be constructive.

The video was recorded on board a train as it travelled from Poland to the Ukrainian capital, with Johnson offering his condolences to the railway workers who were victims of a missile strike at Kramatorsk railway station, where more than 50 people were killed on Friday.

The UK's Ministry of Defence said on Sunday that Russia is suffering mounting losses and as a consequence is trying to recruit from amongst the group of military personnel who retired after 2012.

It also claimed that Russia is trying to recruit soldiers from the breakaway region of Transnistria, which remains a part of Moldova.

For more than thirty years about 1,500 to 2,000 Russian soldiers have been stationed in the mostly Russian-speaking region.

Boris Johnson paid a visit to Kyiv, the latest in a long line of European politicians to go to the Ukrainian capital including als Austria's Chancellor Kerl Nehammer earlier on Saturday.

Johnson, who is the first leader of a G7 country to visit, was taken for a walk through empty streets to Independence Square.

Russia's military has now withdrawn from northern Ukraine, as well as from around Kyiv, and is focussing on the mostly Russian-speaking industrial Donbast region in the east.

On Friday British government promised to supply high-grade weapons worth 120 million euros, including anti-tank missiles to Ukraine.

Johnson also confirmed further economic support, guaranteeing an additional 550 million euros in World Bank lending to Ukraine, taking Britain’s total loan guarantee to up to 1.1 billion euros.

In an interview with AP news agency, Zelenskyy noted the increased support but expressed frustration when asked if the weapons and equipment Ukraine has received from the West is sufficient to shift the war’s outcome.

After the meeting on Saturday, the prime minister said: “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.

“It is because of president Zelenskiy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted.

“We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.”

No 10 said Britain would send 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to Ukraine. The missiles can do serious damage to Russian warships and could be used to tackle the Russian navy siege of Black Sea ports. The UK pledged £100m in military assistance last week, including another 800 anti-tank missiles, more anti-aircraft weapons, “suicide drones”, which hover over the battlefield before attacking a target, and helmets, body armour and night-vision goggles.

Johnson has been praised by Zelenskiy, who contrasts the fulfilment of a promise to deliver vital anti-tank weapons to its army with the more timid responses from other Nato member countries such as Germany.

The security situation in Ukraine’s capital has stabilised since Russia withdrew from its positions around the city on 29 March to regroup its forces and consolidate territorial gains in Ukraine’s south and east.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen also visited Ukraine’s capital on Friday, as well as the nearby town of Bucha, where overwhelming evidence suggests that civilians were raped and murdered by Russian troops.

Johnson’s visit comes a day after Zelenskiy called on western allies to provide more military aid and step up sanctions on Russia in the wake of a missile attack on a train station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk that killed 52 people, including five children.

Russia’s defence ministry has denied responsibility for the strike, but western intelligence officials believe a Russian short-range ballistic missile was fired indiscriminately towards the town centre. At the time of the attack the station was packed with civilians who had been ordered by the Ukrainian government to evacuate the town in the face of the Russian advance from the south-east.

“I have already left Kramatorsk, because when a missile hit a school very close to my house, we were very scared,” said Sofiya Ruban, 17, who fled to the Kyiv area with her family.

“When we heard about yesterday’s airstrikes at the railway station we were shocked and very saddened.”

Russian shelling and missile attacks have intensified in several areas across eastern Ukraine as Moscow moves its “special military operation” away from toppling the government to focus on building a corridor connecting the Russian-occupied region of Crimea with Luhansk and Donetsk – also de-facto controlled by Moscow – with the Russian mainland.

The besieged city of Mariupol, together with the southern city of Mykolaiv, which has faced significant shelling, are major Kremlin targets, the UK Ministry of Defence has said.

With trains not running out of Kramatorsk on Saturday, panicked residents boarded buses or looked for other ways to get out, fearing the kind of unrelenting assaults and occupations by Russian invaders that delivered food shortages, demolished buildings and death to other cities in Ukraine.

Zelenskiy called the station attack the latest example of war crimes by Russian forces and said it should motivate the west to do more to help his country defend itself.

“All world efforts will be directed to establish every minute of who did what, who gave what orders, where the missile came from, who transported it, who gave the command and how this strike was agreed,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.

In response to the shelling of Kramatorsk, a curfew in the southern port city of Odesa went into effect on Saturday evening until Monday evening.

Ten humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from embattled areas across the country had been agreed on Saturday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, but by nightfall it was unclear whether civilians had been able to make it to Ukrainian-controlled territory.

Several attempts to evacuate 150,000 people still in Mariupol, which has been under constant fire since 24 February, and bring in vital provisions such as food and medicine, have ended in failure after Russian shelling of safe routes. Two UN agencies also called for urgent action to help an estimated 1,000 seafarers stranded in Ukrainian ports and waters with dwindling supplies.

The US-based Institute for the Study of War said that Ukrainian forces retain control of defensive positions in eastern and south-western Mariupol, and Russian forces are continuing to attempt to redeploy units in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces are “unlikely to enable a Russian breakthrough and face poor morale”, ISW said.

Last week, Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, said the country had “significant losses of troops and it’s a huge tragedy for us”.
