The development was confirmed on Wednesday by Kyrylo Tymoshenko, Deputy Head of the Office of the President, reports the Ukrayinska Pravda.

Kiev: Ivan Fedorov, the Mayor of Melitopol who was allegedly abducted by Russian forces on March 11, has been released from captivity, according to Ukrainian government officials.

The development was confirmed on Wednesday by Kyrylo Tymoshenko, Deputy Head of the Office of the President, reports the Ukrayinska Pravda.

Tymoshenko said that a “special operation” to release Fedorov from Russian captivity had concluded.

Meanwhile, Andriy Yermak, Head of the Office of the President, said after Fedorov was released, he held talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky.

But Yermak did not provide any details of the conversation.

Citing media reports, the BBC report said that Fedorov was “exchanged for nine Russian prisoners”.

Speaking on Ukrainian television, a Press secretary to Zelensky said the Russian conscripts were between 18 and 19 years old.

Earlier this week, the military administration of Zaporizhzhya region, where Melitopol is located, had said that Fedorov was taken to the Russian-occupied Luhansk region, “where he is incriminated with terrorism”.

Following his abduction, there were widespread protests in condemnation.

A protest rally in Berdyansk on Monday demanding the release of Fedorov was obstructed by Russian forces.

“Armed Russian troops surrounded the square and pushed people away. The occupying forces accompanied their actions with warnings from loudspeakers to ban rallies,” the military administration.

Since Russia began its invasion on February 24, there has been several abductions.

On March 10, the Russian forces abducted Leyla Ibragimova, a deputy of the Zaporizhzhya Regional Council, in Melitopol. She was later released, reports the Ukrayinska Pravda.

During a protest in the city on March 12, activist Olga Haisumova was kidnapped amidst the demonstration.

A Ukrainian mayor who was abducted by Russian forces last week was released, days after Kyiv said he was in Russian forces’ captivity. On Wednesday, Ukraine handed over nine detained Russian soldiers in order to gain the release of Melitopol’s mayor, who was detained last week, according to the Interfax Ukraine news agency.

Melitopol has been occupied since the first days of Russia’s invasion. Ukrainian officials said Fedorov, who had insisted that the southeastern Ukrainian city remain free and backed daily pro-Ukrainian protests, was kidnapped on March 11 after resisting takeover.

Fedorov disappeared after he was purportedly shown being led away with a bag over his head by a large group of heavily armed Russian soldiers in Melitopol’s Victory Square in a CCTV video shared by Victor Kovalenko on Twitter. Russian-controlled separatists then announced they were bringing charges against Fedorov for “aiding terrorism.”

On Wednesday, a video posted on Telegram showed President Volodymyr Zelensky speaking to him on the phone and telling him he was “happy to hear the voice of a man alive.”

In a video tweeted by Ukraine’s defense ministry, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is heard on the phone with Federov, telling him, “We do not abandon ours.” Federov responded that he plans on getting back to work in Melitopol. The city is under Russian control, and following Federov’s abduction, Galina Danilchenko was installed as mayor. She is now being investigated by the Ukrainian prosecutor general for treason.
