French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday denounced Russia’s use of “explosive weapons in densely populated areas”, saying that “everything in Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is unacceptable,” AFP reported.

“International law is being mocked, civilian infrastructure is being bombed, explosive weapons are being used in densely populated areas and humanitarian workers are being targeted,” the French president said in a video broadcast at the first European Humanitarian Forum, which began in Brussels on Monday. .

“International law is this line that separates barbarism from our common humanity,” he added, according to Agerpres.

“The right to war is not optional. Protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure is non-negotiable. Those who betray these rules will have to be held accountable to international justice, “Macron said.

He recalled the referral to the International Criminal Court on March 2 by 39 states, including all EU states, “an unprecedented step in diplomatic history, depending on the gravity of the situation.”

In Ukraine, “it is urgent to guarantee the unhindered provision of European aid to the population,” the French head of state added.

He also announced that in order to fight the global food crisis that the war risks triggering, he will propose at the EU summit on Thursday and Friday “an international solidarity initiative for food security” of the countries most dependent on Ukraine and Russia .

“Europe will mobilize its G7 partners and beyond,” he said.

(CNN)

Yuliia Karpenko, 17, and her family lived through winter without heat for weeks in their Mariupol home, taking shelter as the port city in southeastern Ukraine came under unrelenting fire by Russian forces.

Speaking from Berlin — where she recently escaped to with her mother — the teenager on Thursday described their life under Russia's assault.

""On March 2 they turned off everything but gas — and they turned off gas a few days later,"" she told CNN. At the time, the temperature outside had dropped as low as -7 degrees Celsius (19.4 degrees Fahrenheit).

""We had to sleep in our jackets, and we had five sweaters and T-shirts on, and we slept under all the blankets we had — but I was cold anyway,"" she said.

Karpenko said the family melted snow for water and used candles to light their small shelter, while living with the mental stress of constant attacks.

""I couldn't see my friends, I couldn't talk to them, I could only talk to my family,"" she said. ""It's a feeling of helplessness, and it's the feeling that you don't know when it ends ... when you don't have anything but the sound of bombings.

""You're only feeling more and more miserable. You know that nowhere is safe.""

After she left Mariupol, her family's building was directly hit, and much of it burned down, she said. Videos of the building show ""nothing is left,"" she added.

In Germany, Karpenko plans to find a school to attend and pursue higher education. But her stepfather, dogs and grandparents are still in Ukraine. ""They didn't want to leave,"" she said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-24-22/index.html

“Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,” according to the OHCHR.

In a statement, the UN body detailed the 1,035 civilian deaths as “214 men, 160 women, 14 girls, and 28 boys, as well as 48 children and 571 adults whose sex is yet unknown.”

It added that at least 1,650 civilians have been injured since the start of the invasion.

In the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, the OHCHR has recorded 311 civilian deaths and 857 civilians injured. In other regions, including the city of Kyiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions, 724 civilians have been killed and 793 injured.

A huge explosion has rocked a shopping centre in Kyiv as rescuers pulled bloodied victims from the rubble as police said at least eight people had been killed amid fears dozens of others were missing.

The blast smashed the sprawling 'Retroville' mall and was so powerful it pulverised vehicles in its car park - leaving a massive crater - as well as bodies scattered in the carnage. Mayor Vitali Klitschko this morning said it was one of several bombs to be dropped on the city overnight, with others flattening homes. Offices and a gym were also hit.

Rescuers were continuing to trawl through the chaos this morning as they desperately searched for any more survivors of the latest horror attack to rock Ukraine. Shortly after the strike, mayor Vitali Klitschko declared the start of another 35-hour curfew - going from 8pm this evening until 7am on Wednesday.

Russian forces have increasingly resorted to long-range rocket strikes as their army has stalled. Heavy fighting continues to the north of Kyiv, Britain's Ministry of Defence said Monday, but advances from the north-east have been halted. Attackers in the north-west have been 'repulsed by fierce Ukrainian resistance', the ministry added.

Western intelligence now estimates that Russia is losing up to 1,000 troops per day, which would be its fastest rate of casualties since the Second World War. Desite the punishing losses, British intelligence believes that capturing Kyiv remains Russia's 'primary objective' and Putin's men are 'likely to prioritise attempting to encircle the city over the coming weeks', the ministry added.

It comes as Ukraine rejected Russian demands troops in the Black Sea port of Mariupol lay down their weapons and surrender in return for letting tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the heavily besieged city leave safely.

Russian Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev laid out Moscow's offer late Sunday, saying Ukrainian troops and 'foreign mercenaries' who laid down their arms and raised white flags would be given safe passage.

But Mariupol rejected the demands within minutes, with Pyotr Andryushenko - an adviser to Mariupol mayor - saying Russian promises of amnesty could not be trusted and troops defending the city were determined to fight.

Odesa is Russia's next target, ex-Army chief Sir Richard Barrons says What is the significance of the battle for Mariupol? 'When the Russians feel they've successfully concluded that battle, they will have completed the land-bridge from Russia to Crimea, and they will see that as a major strategic success. And the second is if you look at the method they have adopted, where this really matters to them. 'They couldn't walk in, they couldn't drive in with their tanks, so they've pounded it to rubble. And that's what we should expect to see anywhere else that really matters to them.' If no price is too high in terms of losses, what will happen? 'We're going to see them applying firepower on the Ukrainian military in depth, so they're beginning to hit their supply lines, logistics and air bases as well as the forces that are doing the fighting. And then they'll pound away at cities and territory that they feel they need to own. 'And I think our eyes should now turn to Odessa, because that logically is the next place to go in the south and there seem to be more ships in the Black Sea pointing towards it.' Will they delay the attack on Kyiv? 'I think they'll maintain pressure on Kyiv because it's the political centre of gravity, but they know that it's too big an objective, it's too well defended to force the way into anything like the whole of the city. What we'll probably see is some bombardment of it, maybe attempt to force down some narrow routes – but so far the Ukrainians have very effectively pushed that away. And I think the next big strategic prize could be Odessa because that would isolate Ukraine's economy from the Black Sea.' Advertisement

Klitschko said on his Telegram channel: 'According to the information we have at the moment, several homes and one of the shopping centers [were hit].'

He said 'rescuers, medics and police are already in place' and reported 'at this time - one victim'. It is unclear if he referred to a fatality or injury.

In another post, he said: 'Rescuers are extinguishing a large fire in one of the shopping centers in the Podolsk district of the capital. All services - rescue, medics, police - work on site. The information is being clarified.'

The burnt-out mall was still smoking on Monday morning. All of its south side had been destroyed, as well as a fitness centre in its car park.

Twisted bits of metal and other debris were strewn across the area for hundreds of metres, as firefighters and soldiers searched the devastation for victims.

'Enemy shelling' had caused fires on several floors and set several cars ablaze, emergency services said on Facebook.

They released security camera footage showing a massive explosion and a mushroom cloud, followed by a series of smaller blasts.

Firefighters pulled at least one man covered in dust from the twisted debris, according to more video released by the emergency services.

Soldiers cordoned off the site and told journalists to move back, warning of danger from unexploded munitions without elaborating further.

Neighbours in a housing block whose windows were shattered by the blast said they had seen a mobile rocket launcher near the mall for several days previously.

At least 902 civilians have been killed and 1,459 wounded in Ukraine as of midnight on March 19, the UN human rights office said.

Ten million people have been displaced, including nearly 3.4 million who have fled the country, the U.N. refugee agency said.

The latest attacks come ahead of Biden's trip to Europe next week for face-to-face talks with European leaders about the Russian invasion, White House press secretary Jen Psaki.

Biden will meet with European leaders at an extraordinary NATO summit in Brussels on March 24. He will attend a scheduled European Council summit, where efforts to impose sanctions are underway.

Psaki said: 'While he's there, his goal is to meet in person face-to-face with his European counterparts and talk about, assess where we are at this point in the conflict in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.

'We've been incredibly aligned to date. That doesn't happen by accident. The president is a big believer in face-to-face diplomacy. So it's an opportunity to do exactly that.'

The trip follows Kamala Harris's visit to eastern flank NATO countries of Poland and Romania last week to discuss with leaders the growing refugee crisis in eastern Europe and to underscore the US's support for NATO.

Poland's foreign minister Zbigniew Rau said Tuesday a visit by Biden to Poland was 'very probable' when he comes to Europe.

More than 1.8million Ukrainians have fled to Poland since the start of the war, according to the UN. More than three million people have fled Ukraine since Russian launched its invasion.

Rau told Polish state TVP INFO: 'It would be hard to imagine a better place for the United States and for the entire alliance to stress their position than the brightest link on the eastern flank, that Poland is.'

Psaki said she did not have additional details about whether Biden would visit Poland during the trip.

The White House's announcement of Biden's visit to Brussels came on the same day leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia set out for Kyiv by train despite the security risks to show their support for Ukraine.

It was a visit EU officials said was not sanctioned by other members of the 27-nation bloc.

The latest attacks come ahead of Biden's trip to Europe next week for face-to-face talks with European leaders about the Russian invasion, White House press secretary Jen Psaki (pictured)

Daniel Hamilton, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs, said Biden's trip to Europe comes as the White House looks to continue to maintain what's been a largely unified western opposition to Russia since the invasion.

'As the war continues, it's important that the president show he is not sitting comfortably across the Atlantic, but that he is part of the coalition meeting with European colleagues in Europe and that the United States is a European power,' said Hamilton, non-resident fellow at Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.

Biden will travel to Poland on Friday to discuss the international response to 'the humanitarian and human rights crisis that Russia's unjustified and unprovoked war on Ukraine has created,' Psaki said.

In Poland, Biden will hold a bilateral meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda. But Biden will not visit Ukraine during his trip to Europe, Psaki said earlier Sunday after officials in Kyiv issued an open invitation to the president.

More than two million refugees have entered Poland from Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, the Polish border guard said on Friday.

The White House also said Biden will host a call Monday at 11 am EST with Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz, Mario Draghi and Boris Johnson to discuss their coordinated responses to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

UN data showed as of Thursday about 3.2 million have fled abroad from Ukraine since last month, in what has become Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since the Second World War.

Mariupol 'will NOT surrender': Besieged Ukrainian city where 300,000 are trapped vows to fight to the LAST soldier and rejects Russia's demand to lay down their arms or face 'humanitarian crisis' - as those who do make it out go to 'filtration camps'

Chris Pleasance, Elmira Tanatarova, Stephen Wynn-davisand Chris Matthews for MailOnline

Ukraine has rejected Russian demands that troops in the Black Sea port Mariupol lay down their weapons and surrender in return for letting tens of thousands of civilians trapped in the heavily besieged city leave safely - saying promises of amnesty cannot be trusted and they are determined to fight 'to the last soldier'.

Russian Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev laid out Moscow's offer late Sunday, saying Ukrainian troops and 'foreign mercenaries' who laid down their arms and raised white flags would be allowed to leave via 'humanitarian corridors'. Civilians would then be evacuated afterwards. He gave Ukraine until 5am to respond.

Daria Morozova, of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said that all of those who remained behind would face a military tribunal for 'all the crimes of the Ukrainian national battalions.' She said inspectors would be sent into the city once it had been 'completely cleansed' by Russian troops.

But Mariupol rejected the demands within minutes, with Pyotr Andryushenko - an adviser to the city's mayor - saying that Russian promises of amnesty could not be trusted and that troops defending the city were determined to fight down to the last man.

Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk called on Russia to stop 'wasting time on eight pages of letters' and open humanitarian corridors for civilians to leave the city instead of using them as bargaining chips. Mariupol has been under siege for three weeks with little access to food or water and no power, with multiple attempts to evacuate civilians failing amid claims Russia had bombed and shelled the escape routes.

She told news outlet Ukrainska Pravda: 'There can be no talk of any surrender, laying down of arms. We have already informed the Russian side about this.' Mizintsev warned of a 'humanitarian catastrophe' that will be faced by all those who remain behind after Moscow's deadline for surrender elapsed.

His offer was made just hours after a Russian missile strike hit a school sheltering some 400 people, though there was no immediate word on casualties. Last week, Russia had bombed a theatre in the city being used to shelter children - potentially trapping hundreds of people in underground bomb shelters. There is still no word on casualties from that strike either.

And it came as Ukrainian officials claimed that people are being forcibly evacuated from parts of the city under Russian control into parts of the country currently occupied by Putin's forces - or into Russia itself. 'Several thousand' people have so-far been taken, the city council claimed, before being processed through 'filtration camps' and sent to 'remote cities' in Russia where they will be obliged to stay for years and work for free.

European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Monday decried Russia's attack on the Ukrainian port city Mariupol as 'a massive war crime', as the bloc discussed imposing more sanctions on Moscow. '[They are] destroying everything, bombarding and killing everybody,' Borrell said at a meeting of EU foreign ministers.

Russia has also kept up its bombardment of other Ukrainian cities today, hitting a shopping mall and several apartments in the capital Kyiv in the early hours - reducing the former to rubble. Bombings in the surrounded city of Sumy also hit an ammonia plant, sparking an evacuation.

The blast smashed the sprawling 'Retroville' mall in Kyiv and was so powerful it pulverised vehicles in its car park - leaving a massive crater - as well as bodies scattered in the carnage.

Kyiv department of the state emergency service said four people had been killed but there were reports as many as six were dead with dozens more missing in the debris.

In Sumy, emergency officials said they had contained an ammonia leak at a chemical plant that contaminated wide area on the city's eastern outskirts forcing everyone within a three mile radius to evacuate.

Meanwhile General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of UK Joint Forces Command, told the BBC that the port city of Odessa is likely to be targeted by Russian forces if and when Mariupol falls into their hands.

Asked whether the Russians will reposition to attack Kyiv next, he replied: 'I think they'll maintain pressure on Kyiv because it's the political centre of gravity, but they know that it's too big an objective, it's too well defended to force the way into anything like the whole of the city.

'What we'll probably see is some bombardment of it, maybe attempt to force down some narrow routes – but so far the Ukrainians have very effectively pushed that away. I think the next big strategic prize could be Odessa because that would isolate Ukraine's economy from the Black Sea.'

UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has condemned the 'abduction and deportation' of Ukrainians from the besieged city of Mariupol, in a move that has been likened to Nazi Germany.

She added: 'The leaders also discussed the ongoing negotiations and the Prime Minister reaffirmed his staunch support for Ukraine's position.

'Both leaders stressed the continued importance of sanctions in exerting pressure on (Russian President Vladimir Putin), and they condemned the abhorrent attacks on innocent civilians, following the appalling bombings in Mariupol.

'The Prime Minister expressed his admiration for the bravery of Ukraine and was clear that the UK was committed to stepping up military, economic and diplomatic support in order to help bring an end to this terrible conflict.'

This comes as authorities in the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol say that the Russian military has bombed an art school where about 400 people had taken refuge.

Local authorities said on Sunday that the school building was destroyed and people could remain under the rubble, but there was no immediate word on casualties.

The Russian governor of Sevastopol, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, said on Sunday that Post Captain Andrei Paliy, deputy commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, had been killed during fighting in Mariupol.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 7,295 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Sunday, 3,985 of them from Mariupol. She said the government planned to send nearly 50 buses to Mariupol on Monday for further evacuations.

Greece's consul general in Mariupol, Manolis Androulakis, left the city on Tuesday.

After a four-day trip through Ukraine he crossed to Romania through Moldavia, along with 10 other Greek nationals.

As he arrived in Athens on Sunday, Mr Androulakis said: 'Mariupol will become part of a list of cities that were completely destroyed by war; I don't need to name them- they are Guernica, Coventry, Aleppo, Grozny, Leningrad.'

According to the Greek Foreign Ministry, Androulakis was the last EU diplomat to leave Mariupol.

Three have today been injured in air strike on western Ukraine, emergency services said, as thirteen buildings were damaged in the attack, which targeted the Korostensky district north of the region's main city Zhytomyr.

'Three people were injured,' a Facebook post from Ukraine's emergency services added, posting images of burning buildings and scattered charred debris.

Also on Sunday, Russia's defence ministry said its 'high-precision missiles' hit a training centre of Ukrainian special forces in Zhytomyr region, around 150 kilometres (90 miles) west of Ukraine's capital Kyiv.

'More than 100 (Ukrainian) servicemen of the special forces and foreign mercenaries were destroyed,' in the attack, the ministry said.

Terrifying footage has emerged apparently showing Russia firing deadly thermobaric TOS-1A rockets, which can allegedly melt human organs.

Moscow defence sources claimed: 'The TOS-1A Solntsepek was used against Ukrainian nationalists by the people's militia of the Donetsk People's Republic with the support of the Russian army during a special operation in Ukraine.'

Earlier Zelensky also said Russia's siege of the port city was 'a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come'.

His comments came after local authorities said Russian troops had forcefully deported several thousand people from the besieged city last week, after Russia had spoken of 'refugees' arriving from the strategic port.

'Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents were deported onto the Russian territory,' the city council said in a statement on its Telegram channel late on Saturday.

'The occupiers illegally took people from the Livoberezhniy district and from the shelter in the sports club building, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from the constant bombing.'

Zelensky said the siege of Mariupol would 'go down in history of responsibility for war crimes'.

'To do this to a peaceful city... is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come.'

Meanwhile, authorities in Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv say at least five civilians, including a nine-year-old boy, have been killed in the latest Russian shelling.

This comes as Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba has on Twitter posted about protests in Energodar, a city in the country's north-west oblast, following claims that Russian forces have abducted its deputy mayor.

Mr Kuleba's tweet said: 'Brave Ukrainians in Energodar hold a peaceful protest demanding to release deputy mayor Ivan Samoidyuk who was abducted by Russian invaders. Russians thought they could impose their authoritarian rules in democratic Ukraine. Instead, they need to go home.'

Earlier this month President Zelensky demanded the release of Melitopol's mayor after his alleged kidnap by Russian troops, which sparked local protests.

The Ukrainian leader said the capture was an 'attempt to bring the city to its knees' and demanded the immediate release of Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of the besieged city.

Mr Fedorov is understood to have been released according to Ukrainian authorities, Sky News reports.

Zelensky today also urged Israel to 'make its choice' and abandon its effort to maintain neutrality towards the invasion.

The Ukrainian leader, who is Jewish, made the appeal during an address to Israeli lawmakers, the latest in a series of speeches by videoconference to foreign legislatures.

In remarks that at several points compared Russian aggression to the Holocaust, Zelensky said that 'Ukraine made the choice to save Jews 80 years ago.'

'Now it's time for Israel to make its choice.'

Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has walked a careful diplomatic line since Russia launched its invasion on February 24.

Stressing Israel's strong ties to Moscow and Kyiv, Bennett has sought to preserve delicate security cooperation with Russia, which has troops in Syria, across Israel's northern border.

He has held regular phone calls with Zelensky and Vladimir Putin, including a three-hour meeting with the Russian President at the Kremlin on March 5.

While Ukrainian officials have voiced appreciation for Bennett's mediation efforts, Zelensky today implied that this too had proven to be a misstep.

'We can mediate between states but not between good and evil,' the Ukrainian leader said.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said that the West needs to have a 'degree of scepticism' about the prospect of a peace deal between Russia and Ukrainevas Kyiv looked to stand firm against giving up territory in a settlement.

Speaking today, the Chancellor said it is 'encouraging' that discussions are under way but the West has to be on its guard.

Mr Sunak told Sky News' Sophy Ridge On Sunday programme: 'You have to have some degree of scepticism about it given the track record of these things.

'I think the most important thing is that any talk of a settlement must be on Ukraine's terms.

'And the best thing we can do is just maintain the significant pressure that we are bringing to bear on Putin, but also providing support to the Ukrainians in the meantime - that's the best we can do and the Ukrainians will take the lead.'

An official in Mr Zelensky's office told the Associated Press that the main subject discussed between the two sides last week was whether Russian troops would remain in separatist regions in eastern Ukraine after the war and where the borders would lie.

But a Ukraine politician said while her country is open to further meetings with Russia, it is not prepared to give up land to the aggressor.

Olha Stefanishyna, deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, told Sky News that re-drawing Ukraine's borders is 'absolutely not' being considered.

'Ukrainian territory is a territory which has been fixed (since) 1991,' she said.

'That is not an option for discussion.'

According to reports, Kyiv has insisted on the inclusion of one or more Western nuclear powers in the negotiations with the Kremlin and on legally binding security guarantees for Ukraine.

Asked whether the UK would act as a security guarantor to the Ukrainians as part of any peace deal, Mr Sunak - who confirmed his family will not be taking in a Ukrainian refugee - said it is 'probably a bit too early to get into the details' of what an agreement might look like.

Elsewhere, Boris Johnson has urged China to get off the fence and join in global condemnation of Russia's invasion.

The Prime Minister, in comments made to the Sunday Times, said he believes some in Xi Jinping's administration are having 'second thoughts' about the neutral stance adopted by Beijing following Russia's actions against its neighbour.

But today China's ambassador to the US defended his country's refusal to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking with CBS's 'Face the Nation' Qin Gang said condemnation 'doesn't solve the problem'.

He said: 'I would be surprised if Russia will back down by condemnation.'

Mr Gang added: '(China) will continue to promote peace talks and urge immediate fire.

'And, you know, condemnation, you know, only, doesn't help. We need wisdom. We need courage and we need good diplomacy.'

Zelensky also said peace talks with Russia were needed although they were 'not easy and pleasant'. He said he discussed the course of the talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday.

'Ukraine has always sought a peaceful solution. Moreover, we are interested in peace now,' he said.

Vladimir Putin has reportedly 'finally agreed' to meet in person with Zelensky for peace talks.

So far the negotiations have been between middle men on neutral ground but the war has continued into its fourth week.

The Russian tyrant will allegedly meet President Zelensky 'at some point', the Express reported.

The two leaders have let their diplomatic teams conduct peace talks on the neutral ground since shortly after the start of the conflict on February 24, but a BBC correspondent has confirmed the two will meet in person.

Putin has come to terms with fact he will have to lead the negotiations at some time in the future, the BBC's Lysa Doucet said.

She said: 'The diplomats are talking, the negotiators are talking. We understand President Putin has finally agreed that he will meet, at some point, President Zelensky who has been asking for a meeting since January.

'He hasn't said it in public, he says quite the opposite in public.'

She added: 'The Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett is very busy, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is very busy.

Footage filmed in Mariupol showed a Ukrainian regiment firing a BTR-4 30mm cannon on a Russian BTR-82A and a T-72B3 tank

The Ukrainian cannon seemed to aim at the Russian tank's tracks in a bid to put the vehicles out of order

It seemed to shoot around a metre above the heads of soldiers on the ground, who had their rifles aimed at the tanks

The tanks had been painted with a white 'Z', which has quickly become a symbol for Russia in its war with Ukraine

'They've said privately their understanding is that President Putin will meet President Zelensky when the time is right. But the time is not right now.'

Meanwhile, Russia's military isn't even recovering the bodies of its soldiers in some places, Zelensky said.

'In places where there were especially fierce battles, the bodies of Russian soldiers simply pile up along our line of defence. And no one is collecting these bodies,' he said.

He described a battle near Chornobayivka in the south, where Ukrainian forces held their positions and six times beat back the Russians, who just kept 'sending their people to slaughter'.

Russian news agencies, citing the country's defence ministry, have said buses carrying several hundred people - which Moscow calls refugees - have been arriving in Russia from Mariupol in recent days.

Earlier on Sunday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia's siege of the port city of Mariupol was 'a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come'

The Russian TASS news agency reported on Saturday that 13 busses were moving to Russia, carrying more than 350 people, about 50 of whom were to be sent by rail to the Yaroslavl region and the rest to temporary transition centres in Taganrog, a port city in Russia's Rostov region.

Russia's Defence Ministry said this month that Russia had prepared 200 busses to 'evacuate' citizens of Mariupol.

RIA Novosti agency, citing emergency services, reported last week that nearly 300,000 people, including some 60,000 children, have arrived in Russia from the Luhansk and Donbas regions, including from Mariupol, in recent weeks.

Russia's Defence Ministry said this month that more than 2.6 million people in Ukraine have asked to be evacuated.

The city council in the Azov Sea port city said Sunday that 39,426 residents, almost ten per cent of the 430,000 who live there, have safely evacuated from Mariupol in their own vehicles. It said the evacuees used more than 8,000 vehicles to leave via a humanitarian corridor via Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia.

Air raid sirens sounded across major Ukrainian cities early on Sunday but there were no immediate reports of fresh attacks.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped in Mariupol for more than two weeks, sheltering from heavy bombardment that has severed central supplies of electricity, heating, food and water supplies, and killed at least 2,300 people, some of whom had to be buried in mass graves, according to local authorities.

The governor of the northeastern Sumy region, Dmytro Zhyvytskyy, said Sunday that 71 infants have been safely evacuated via a humanitarian corridor.

Zhyvytskyy said on Facebook that the orphans will be taken to an unspecified foreign country. He said most of them require constant medical attention. Like many other Ukrainian cities, Sumy has been besieged by Russian troops and faced repeated shelling.

Meanwhile, the Russian military says it has carried out a new series of strikes on Ukrainian military facilities with long-range hypersonic and cruise missiles.

A Russian attack on a barracks for young Ukrainian recruits in the middle of the night that killed at least 50 young Ukrainian recruits was branded as 'cowardly'.

Russian rockets struck the military school in Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine, on Friday, killing dozens of young Ukrainian ensigns at their brigade headquarters.

Ukrainian soldier Maxim, 22, who was at the barracks, said 'no fewer than 200 soldiers were sleeping in the barracks' at the time of the strike.

'At least 50 bodies have been recovered, but we do not know how many others are in the rubble,' he said.

Vitaly Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, said Russia 'hit our sleeping soldiers with a rocket in a cowardly manner.'

Meanwhile Olga Malarchuk, a military official, said: 'We aren't allowed to say anything because the rescue operation isn't over and the families haven't all been informed.

'We are not yet able to announce a toll and I cannot tell you how many soldiers were present'.

Russia also said it had fired a second 'unstoppable' hypersonic Kinzhal missile at a fuel depot in Kostyantynivka, in the southern region of Mykolaiv.

A MiG-31K jet fired the aeroballistic missile at the warehouse as it was flying over Crimea.

Major General Igor Konashenkov, from the Russian Defence Ministry, said the target was the main supply of fuel for Ukrainian armoured cars in the south of the country.

He claimed the missile had destroyed the depot. It is the second time Russia says it has used the missile in Ukraine, after a weapons storage site was destroyed in Deliatyn, in the Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine, on Friday.

NATO deem the weapon so powerful it has been nicknamed The Sizzler.

Russia has never before admitted using the high-precision weapon in combat.

Moscow claims the 'Kinzhal'- or Dagger - is 'unstoppable' by current Western weapons. The missile, which has a range of 2,000 kilometer (1,250 miles), is nuclear capable.

However, both hypersonic strikes so far have not been nuclear.

'The Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse containing missiles and aviation ammunition in the village of Deliatyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk region', the Russian defence ministry said Saturday.

Russian Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov also said that the Russian forces used the anti-ship missile system Bastion to strike Ukrainian military facilities near the Black Sea port of Odessa.

Aerial footage released by the Russian military claimed to show the missile strike. Large, long buildings are shown in the footage in a snowy region, before one is obliterated by a huge explosion - sending flames, earth and debris high into the air. People can be seen on the ground fleeing as smoke pours from the site.

Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuri Ignat confirmed that a storage site had been targeted, but added that Kyiv had no information regarding the type of missile that was used.

Hypersonic missiles differ from ballistic ones in that they travel closer to the earth and as such can largely avoid radar detection

'The enemy targeted our depots' but 'we have no information of the type of missile,' he said. 'There has been damage, destruction and the detonation of munitions. They are using all the missiles in their arsenal against us.'

Russia reportedly first used the weapon during its military campaign in Syria in 2016 to support the Assad regime, although it was unclear if this was the same model. Some of the most intense bombing came in 2016 during the battle for Aleppo, resulting in hundreds of civilian deaths.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has termed the missile 'an ideal weapon' that flies at 10 times the speed of sound, which is 7672.69 miles per hour, and can overcome air-defence systems.

Russia also said it had fired a second 'unstoppable' hypersonic Kinzhal missile at a fuel depot in Kostyantynivka, in the southern region of Mykolaiv. The MiG-31K jet (pictured as it took off) fired the aeroballistic missile at the warehouse as it was flying over Crimea

Major General Igor Konashenkov, from the Russian Defence Ministry, said the target was the main supply of fuel for Ukrainian armoured cars in the south of the country. He claimed the missile had destroyed the depot. Pictured: The Russian pilot flying the fighter jet

Deliatyn, a picturesque village in the foothills of the picturesque Carpathian mountains, is located outside the city of Ivano-Frankivsk. The region of Ivano-Frankivsk shares a 30-mile long border with NATO member Romania.

Konashenkov noted that the Kalibr cruise missiles launched by Russian warships from the Caspian Sea were also involved in the strike on the fuel depot in Kostiantynivka. He said Kalibr missiles launched from the Black Sea were used to destroy an armor repair plant in Nizhyn in the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine.

Konashenkov added that another strike by air-launched missiles hit a Ukrainian facility in Ovruch in the northern Zhytomyr region where foreign fighters and Ukrainian special forces were based.

The British defense ministry said the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense forces are 'continuing to effectively defend Ukrainian airspace'.

'Russia has failed to gain control of the air and is largely relying on stand-off weapons launched from the relative safety of Russian airspace to strike targets within Ukraine', the ministry said on Twitter.

'Gaining control of the air was one of Russia's principal objectives for the opening days of the conflict and their continued failure to do so has significantly blunted their operational progress.'

A Ukrainian military official meanwhile confirmed to a Ukrainian newspaper that Russian forces carried out a missile strike Friday on a missile and ammunition warehouse in the Deliatyn settlement of the Ivano-Frankivsk region in western Ukraine.

But Ukraine's Air Forces spokesman Yurii Ihnat told Ukrainskaya Pravda on Saturday that it has not been confirmed that the missile was indeed a hypersonic Kinzhal.

Russia also boasted in a chilling newly-released video how it is using adapted Israeli reconnaissance combat drone technology to kill in Ukraine.

The footage shows a Forpost-R destroying a battery of Ukrainian howitzers and military hardware.

Israel six years ago stopped supplying components for the drone - but Russia still has a force of around 100.

The Russian defence ministry said: 'Unmanned aerial vehicles of the Aerospace Forces carried out missile strikes on a self-propelled artillery battery of 122mm howitzers and military hardware of the Ukrainian armed forces.

'A battery of self-propelled artillery guns, armoured vehicles and vehicles were destroyed by airborne weapons.'

The import-substituted Forpost-R drone is a licensed version of the Israeli Searcher MkII.

The drone was supplied to Russia but was designed exclusively for reconnaissance.

It is an improved and indigenised model variant of the Forpost (Outpost), the Israeli Searcher Mk II UAV assembled by Yekaterinburg-based Ural Civil Aviation Plant.

From 2016, Israel stopped supplying components to Russia, apparently under pressure from the US, triggering the move by the Kremlin to adapt the drone.

The Forpost-R unmanned combat aerial vehicle was first seen a week ago deployed by Russia in the current conflict.

The video is believed to show the combat drone taking off from Gomel, in Belarus, and striking at targets in Ukraine.

Mariupol, a key connection to the Black Sea, has been a target since the start of the war on February 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he calls a 'special military operation' to demilitarise and 'denazify' Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

As Russia has sought to seize most of Ukraine's southern coast, Mariupol has assumed great importance, lying between the Russian-annexed peninsula of Crimea to the west and the Donetsk region to the east, which is partially controlled by pro-Russian separatists.

The U.N. human rights office said at least 847 civilians had been killed and 1,399 wounded in Ukraine as of Friday. The Ukrainian prosecutor general's office said 112 children have been killed.

Rescue workers on Sunday were still searching for survivors in a Mariupol theatre that local authorities say was flattened by Russian air strikes on Wednesday. Russia denies hitting the theatre or targeting civilians.

Satellite images, released on Saturday, showed the collapsed remains of the building which was sheltering hundreds of children and their families before being levelled in a Russian airstrike.

More than 1,300 people, including women and babies, are still feared trapped in the bombed ruins of the theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol as rescue efforts are hampered by constant Russian shelling.

Their prospects of survival are growing bleaker by the day, with no supplies and Russian troops firing at rescuers trying to dig through the rubble.

Last night a local MP said those inside were forced to dig from within the wreckage because rescue attempts had been thwarted by ongoing airstrikes.

On Sunday the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine shared photographs of children's drawings about the ongoing war. This one includes a dead soldier and a Russian military truck with a 'Z' symbol on it that seems to be firing at the child, labelled 'Me', and their 'Papa' and 'Mama' as well as a pet, who are all inside a heart the colours of the Ukrainian flag

But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who branded Russia's attack as 'outright terror', last night vowed to continue the rescue mission.

'Hundreds of Mariupol residents are still under the debris. Despite the shelling, despite all the difficulties, we will continue the rescue work,' he said.

On Sunday the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine shared photographs of children's drawings about the ongoing war.

Another drawing by a Ukrainian girl called Victoria showed a female relative in camouflage, holding a rifle.

The mother of Sasha, a 10-year-old Ukrainian boy who draw a picture of himself praying, said: 'It's hard to imagine what our children have to endure. My son became an adult prematurely.'

Russian troops have now reached the city centre and civilians remain hiding in bunkers while fighters battle on the streets.

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said: 'Tanks and machine gun battles continue. There's no city centre left. There isn't a small piece of land in the city that doesn't have signs of war.'

The devastating losses across Ukraine have sparked a poignant protest in Lviv, where 109 empty prams were arranged in solemn rows to mark the number of children killed since Russia invaded.

Local authorities said more than 130 survivors have emerged from the rubble of the Mariupol theatre which was being used as the ravaged port city's biggest civilian bomb shelter.

But they said that those saved represented just one tenth of the civilians still trapped within the refuge which miraculously withstood the blast.

Ukraine's human rights commissioner Lyudmyla Denisova said: 'According to our data there are still more than 1,300 people there who are in these basements, in that bomb shelter. We pray that they will be alive but so far there is no information about them.'

More than 1,300 people including women and babies are still feared trapped in the bombed ruins of a theatre in the besieged city of Mariupol (pictured)

Former governor MP Serhiy Taruta said he fears many survivors will die because the city's emergency services have been destroyed by Russian troops.

'Services that are supposed to help are demolished, rescue and utility services are physically destroyed. This means that all the survivors of the bombing will either die under the ruins of the theatre, or have already died,' he wrote on Facebook.

He said those trapped had been left to dig their way out of the collapsed three-storey building.

'People are doing everything themselves. My friends went to help but due to constant shelling it was not safe.'

However Mariupol MP Dmytro Gurin insisted that while the rescue mission had been hampered by constant Russian attacks, efforts were still under way.

One woman said the strike had taken place while those sheltering beneath the theatre were cooking and only around 100 had time to flee.

Nick Osychenko, the CEO of a Mariupol TV station, said as he fled the city with six members of his family, aged between 4 and 61, he saw dead bodies on nearly every block.

'We were careful and didn't want the children to see the bodies, so we tried to shield their eyes,' he said. 'We were nervous the whole journey. It was frightening, just frightening.'

Russia has denied responsibility for the devastating strike which was branded a 'war crime' and sparked global outrage.

After an agonising first night of uncertainty following the bombing, Ukrainian officials revealed on Thursday that they were hopeful that the majority within had survived.

Rescuers said that while the entrance to the basement had caved in, the relatively modern shelter had remained intact.

But Miss Denisova said that while some had survived, the situation remained unclear.

She said there was 'currently no information about the dead or wounded under the rubble' and called the attack 'an act of genocide and a terrible crime against humanity'.

Ukraine's Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov branded the Russian pilot behind the bombing a 'monster'.

But the Kremlin's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzya yesterday denied that Russia had targeted the shelter.

Russia's defence ministry previously said its forces were 'tightening the noose' around Mariupol and that fighting had reached the city centre.

Long columns of troops that bore down on the capital Kyiv have been halted in the suburbs.

Ukraine's military said Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations on Saturday, focusing instead on replenishing supplies and repairing equipment. It also said Ukrainian air defences shot down three Russian combat helicopters.

Zelensky said the Ukrainian front line was 'simply littered with the corpses of Russian soldiers'.

In Syria, some paramilitary fighters say they were ready to deploy to Ukraine to fight in support of their ally Russia but have not yet received instructions to go.

Russia said on Saturday its hypersonic missiles had destroyed a large underground depot for missiles and aircraft ammunition in the western Ivano-Frankivsk region. Hypersonic weapons can travel faster than five times the speed of sound, and the Interfax agency said it was the first time Russia had used them in Ukraine.

A spokesperson for the Ukrainian Air Force Command confirmed the attack, but said the Ukrainian side had no information on the type of missiles used.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow expected its operation in Ukraine to end with the signing of a comprehensive agreement on security issues, including Ukraine's neutral status, Interfax reported.

Kyiv and Moscow reported some progress in talks last week toward a political formula that would guarantee Ukraine's security, while keeping it outside NATO, though each sides accused the other of dragging things out.

Zelensky has said Ukraine could accept international security guarantees that stopped short of its longstanding aim to join NATO. That prospect has been one of Russia's primary stated concerns.

The Ukrainian president, who makes frequent impassioned appeals to foreign audiences for help, told an anti-war protest in Bern on Saturday that Swiss banks were where the 'money of the people who unleashed this war' lay and their accounts should be frozen.

Ukrainian cities 'are being destroyed on the orders of people who live in European, in beautiful Swiss towns, who enjoy property in your cities. It would really be good to strip them of this privilege', he said in an audio address.

Neutral Switzerland, which is not a member of the European Union, has fully adopted EU sanctions against Russian individuals and entities, including orders to freeze their wealth in Swiss banks.

The EU measures are part of a wider sanctions effort by Western nations aimed at squeezing Russia's economy and starving its war machine.

U.S. President Joe Biden warned his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday of 'consequences' if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

On Saturday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China stood on the right side of history over the Ukraine crisis.

'China's position is objective and fair, and is in line with the wishes of most countries. Time will prove that China's claims are on the right side of history', Wang told reporters, according to a statement published by his ministry on Sunday.

Putin spoke in front of a crowd tens of thousands strong at the Luzhniki World Cup stadium in Moscow, one of the few times he has been seen in public since launching his invasion 23 days ago

Putin used the rally to peddle falsehoods about why the war started and to shill a narrative of Russia's battlefield success, speaking of 'how our guys are fighting during this operation, shoulder to shoulder, helping each other'

Putin called the rally to mark the eighth anniversary of 'annexing' Crimea, speaking of 'de-Nazifying' the peninsula and of debunked claims of 'genocide' in the Donbass

Zelensky has also ordered to suspend activities of 11 political parties with links to Russia.

The largest of them is the Opposition Platform for Life, which has 44 out of 450 seats in the country's parliament. The party is led by Viktor Medvedchuk, who has friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is the godfather of Medvedchuk's daughter.

Also on the list is the Nashi (Ours) party led by Yevheniy Murayev. Before the Russian invasion. the British authorities had warned that Russia wanted to install Murayev as the leader of Ukraine.

Speaking in a video address early Sunday, Zelenskyy said that 'given a large-scale war unleashed by the Russian Federation and links between it and some political structures, the activities of a number of political parties is suspended for the period of the martial law.' He added that 'activities by politicians aimed at discord and collaboration will not succeed.'

Zelenskyy's announcement follows the introduction of the martial law that envisages a ban on parties associated with Russia.

Meanwhile feared Chechen special forces are fighting house-to-house in the besieged port city.

Video said to have been released by pro-Putin Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov shows heavily armed fighters from the region pounding a high-rise building in the bombed-out city during a fierce gunfight with Ukrainian soldiers.

The propaganda video then cuts before showing some of the Chechen fighters emerging from the building with children in their arms while supposedly 'liberating' civilians.

Russia's defence ministry said on Friday that its troops have now entered the city and are fighting in the centre, amid fears that it could soon fall into Putin's hands after three weeks of shelling weakened the defences. If the city does fall, it will be the largest captured so-far - albeit at the cost of near-totally destroying it.

Svitlana Zlenko, who said she left the city with her son on Tuesday this week, described how she spent days sheltering in a school building - melting snow to cook pasta to eat while living in constant terror of Russian bombs which flew overhead 'every day and every night'.

She described how a bomb hit the school last week, wounding a woman in the hip with a piece of shrapnel. 'She was lying on the first floor of the high school all night and prayed for poison so that she would not feel pain,' Svitlana said. '[She] was taken by the Red Cross within a day, I pray to God she is well.'

She added: 'There is no food, no medicine, if there is no snow with such urban fights, people will not be able to go out to get water, people have no water left. Pharmacies, grocery stores - everything is robbed or burned.

'The dead are not taken out. Police recommend to the relatives of those who died of a natural death, to open the windows and lay the bodies on the balcony. I know you think you understand, but you will never understand unless you were there. I pray that this will not happen again in any of the cities of Ukraine, or of the world.'

Despite the pleas, shelling was well underway in other Ukrainian cities on Friday - with Lviv, in the west of the country, the capital Kyiv, and Kharkiv, in the east, coming under fire.

The war launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin ground into its fourth week as his troops have failed to take Kyiv - a major objective in their hopes of forcing a settlement or dictating the country's future political alignments.

Russia offers safe passage to stranded ships

Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev has said Russia is offering to allow foreign vessels to gather in the Black Sea, 32km southeast of the port of Illichivsk and then follow a 129km-long “humanitarian corridor” to safety.

He added that 67 ships from 15 countries have been stranded in Ukrainian ports. A safe route will be open daily from 8 am to 7 pm Moscow time (05:00-16:00 GMT) starting on Friday.

Mizintsev charged that those ships have been unable to leave due to the threat of Ukrainian shelling and the presence of sea mines deployed by Ukrainian forces.

Putin’s war to wipe out 15 years of progress for Russian economy

Russia is set to erase 15 years of economic gains by the end of 2023 after its invasion of Ukraine spurred a multitude of sanctions and prompted companies to pull out of the country, according to the Institute of International Finance.

The economy is expected to contract 15 percent in 2022, followed by a decline of 3 percent in 2023, leaving gross domestic product where it was about fifteen years ago.

ICRC President concludes Moscow visit

The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has completed a two-day visit to Moscow to discuss pressing humanitarian needs in Ukraine with Russian officials.

Discussions focused on the need for all parties to facilitate evacuations and allow the passage of humanitarian supplies. The ICRC also addressed the repatriation and dignified treatment of the dead on all sides of the armed conflict, it said in a statement, without specifying whether an agreement had been reached.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he welcomed the efforts by the Red Cross to help people in Ukraine and the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics. “Unfortunately, we have no particular reason to rely on the fulfilment by the Ukrainian authorities of their obligations under international humanitarian law,” he told a press conference.

US President Joe Biden has said NATO would “respond” if Russian President Vladimir Putin used a chemical weapon during his invasion of Ukraine.

“We will respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,” Biden said after a NATO summit in Brussels.

He added Putin had failed to divide the West and that “NATO has never, never been more united than it is today”.

Before departing for Europe on Wednesday, Biden had said that the possibility of a chemical attack was a “real threat”.

Ukraine’s comparison with Syria war draws criticism on social media

The Ukrainian National Guard’s official Twitter account has posted an infographic claiming that more missiles have been fired at Ukraine in less than a month than at Syria in five years.

The post, which calls on people to “realise the scale of the disaster”, does not have a source, but appears to reference a US assessment on March 21 that 1,100 missiles have been fired at Ukraine by Russian forces since the invasion began on February 24.

However, the Russian military has conducted 45,000 attacks in Syria since its intervention on the side of President Bashar al-Assad in 2015, killing at least 4,300 civilians, according to the independent monitor Airwars.

The Ukrainian National Guard’s post, which has been deleted, was widely criticised on Twitter with one Syrian, Asaad Hanna, saying that there was “no need to compare suffering” and others calling out the inaccurate numbers.

‘Time is on Ukraine’s side’: Analyst

Nikolay Mitrokhin, a Russia expert and researcher at Germany’s Bremen University, says Ukraine has successfully thwarted Moscow’s intended rapid offensive, turning the war into a conflict that exhausts demoralised and undersupplied Russian soldiers.

“The situation has finally stabilised on all fronts,” Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera.

“It could be temporary, but in the past two weeks, the [opposed] armies are in the same position, and the war has turned from manoeuvre warfare into a trench phase,” he added.

Instead of pushing forward in strategic directions, the Russians boast very moderate gains only in the breakaway, eastern Donbas region, where Moscow’s troops “take a village a day”, albeit with enormous losses, Mitrokhin said.

Despite Russia’s lack of overall progress, its forces have the northern city of Chernihiv almost fully surrounded and launch “attack after attack” on the eastern city of Izium, Mitrokhin said, in addition to the almost continuous bombardment of Kharkiv and Mariupol.

“But time is on Ukraine’s side,” he said, noting its forces may encircle the Russians in areas north and west of Kyiv while Moscow accumulates more troops only to “patch the holes” in the locations it currently holds.

“Ukraine has withstood the aggression, it wages a just war on its territory, and the government and the president have remained in Kyiv and enjoy popular support,” Mitrokhin added.

“Warsaw has embarked on a dangerous escalation in the region, proceeding not from national interests, but within the framework of NATO guidelines, which are based on outright Russophobia elevated to the rank of official policy,” the ministry said in a statement.

Mariupol authorities say 15,000 people ‘illegally deported’ to Russia

Authorities in Mariupol say about 15,000 civilians have been illegally deported to Russia since Moscow’s forces seized parts of the city.

“Residents of the Left Bank district are beginning to be deported en masse to Russia. In total, about 15,000 Mariupol residents have been subjected to illegal deportation,” Mariupol’s city council said in a statement.

It claimed there was also evidence that Russian forces are seizing Ukrainians’ passports and other identity documents as they are deported.

Kyiv and Moscow have repeatedly traded blame for the consistent failure to agree on arrangements to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, control of which would help Russia secure a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Zelenskyy said in a video address to Italy’s parliament on Tuesday that there was “nothing left” in Mariupol after weeks of Russian bombardment, with civilians trapped there facing a desperate plight without access to food, water, power or heat.

Russia “wants to go further” and take military action against the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as Poland, Zelenskyy said.

The figure includes more than 1.8 million children who have crossed into neighbouring countries as refugees and 2.5 million who are now internally displaced inside Ukraine, it added.

“The war has caused one of the fastest largescale displacements of children since World War II,” Catherine Russell, UNICEF’s executive director, said.

“This is a grim milestone that could have lasting consequences for generations to come. Children’s safety, wellbeing and access to essential services are all under threat from non-stop horrific violence,” she added.

As of 09:08 GMT, the rouble had firmed 1.6 percent to 95.61 to the US dollar, extending overnight gains driven by Putin’s statement that Russia would start selling its gas to “unfriendly” countries in roubles.

NATO believes Russian offensive ‘largely stalled’: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s James Bays, reporting from NATO’s headquarters in Brussels, says the alliance believes Russia’s offensive has “largely stalled”, with Moscow suffering a “great deal of losses”.

Citing an unnamed, senior military official from the alliance, Bays said NATO estimates between 7,000-15,000 Russian troops have been killed.

“But they say when you take into account the number that have been wounded or captured, then the number of Russian troops who are no longer able to fight could be 30,000-40,000,” he added.

However, Bays also said the same official believes the besieged southeastern port city of Mariupol could fall under Russian control within “days”.

“Clearly that would be very important for the state of the battlefield and it would be an important but very barbaric victory by Russia,” he added.

“Mariupol … is so strategically important in the fight because it gives the access to the coast from Crimea to the Donbas.”

The Belgian government has agreed – a few hours before a NATO summit – to inject an extra billion euros ($1.098bn) in its defence forces, on top of 10 billion euros ($10.98bn) already agreed, according to Belgian newspaper l’Echo.

The new investments aim at reinforcing Belgian defence by 2030, including developing a cybersecurity unit in the Belgian army, replenishing stocks of fuel and munitions, military equipment and supplies, and improving intelligence and communication systems, l’Echo reported.

NATO member states are supposed to spend more than two percent of their GDP on defence annually. Belgium is currently spending 1.2 percent and the latest investments will increase it to 1.54 percent.

Stoltenberg warns chemical weapons could contaminate NATO territory

Any use of chemical weapons by Russia in its war in Ukraine could cause contamination in NATO territory, Stoltenberg has warned.

“Any use of chemical weapons would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict – it would be a blatant violation of international law, and it will have widespread and severe consequences,” he said ahead of the NATO summit.

“The seriousness of using chemical weapons, of course, becomes even more obvious knowing that there is a risk always for contamination… we can see the spread of chemical agents also into NATO territory,” he said.

Putin made ‘big mistake’ invading Ukraine: NATO chief

Stoltenberg says Putin made a “big mistake” by invading Ukraine, as leaders gathered to discuss overhauling the alliance’s eastern defences.

“President Putin has made a big mistake and that is to launch a war against an independent sovereign nation. He has underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian people, the bravery of the Ukrainian people and their armed forces,” Stoltenberg said ahead of the summit.

Stoltenberg said the leaders of the US-led military alliance would “address the need for a reset of our deterrence and defence in the longer term”, starting with agreeing on new deployments to eastern members Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria.

Bodies of Russian servicemen ‘endanger’ Ukraine’s environment: Official

A Ukrainian health official says Russia has not taken away many bodies of its servicemen killed in action, and the decaying corpses pose an environmental threat.

Russia “doesn’t need them, doesn’t take them away”, Anatoly Kotlyara, the top healthcare official in the northeastern Sumy region, was quoted by Ukraine’s UNIAN news agency as saying.

He added that 10 railroad refrigerators had been commissioned for storing the bodies, but their arrival was delayed by the hostilities.

Most of the bodies Russia does take away are shipped to neighbouring Belarus and only then delivered to relatives, Kotlyara said.

UK PM says pressure could be applied to Putin’s gold reserves

The UK and its western allies will increase the economic pressure on Russia and are looking to see if more can be done to prevent Putin from accessing his gold reserves, Johnson said.

Ahead of the NATO summit, the British Prime Minister told the UK’s LBC radio station that Putin had already crossed a red line and that he should appear before the International Criminal Court.

“We need to do more economically,” Johnson said.

“Can we do more to stop him using his gold reserves for instance, in addition to his cash reserves? The more pressure we apply now, particularly on things like gold, that I believe the more we can shorten the war,” he added.

Banned phosphorus bombs kill 4, destroy houses in Luhansk: Governor

Russia has used banned white phosphorus bombs to shell residential areas in the southeastern Luhansk region, its governor has said on his Telegram channel.

Four people were killed, Serhiy Haidai said, adding that the shelling destroyed 10 apartment buildings and 13 private houses, and set fire to 16 of them.

Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Russia of using phosphorus bombs, which cause huge fires and lead to severe injuries or excruciating death; the 1977 Geneva Convention bans their use if they endanger civilians.

UN to vote on blaming Russia for humanitarian crisis

The UN General Assembly is voting Thursday on a resolution backed by over 90 countries that blames Russia for the escalating humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and demands an immediate halt to hostilities, especially attacks on civilians and their homes, schools and hospitals.

Russia has denounced the resolution as “anti-Russian” and accuses its supporters of not really being concerned about the humanitarian situation on the ground, saying they want to politicise aid.

The vote follows the Security Council’s overwhelming defeat on Wednesday of a Russian resolution that would have acknowledged Ukraine’s growing humanitarian needs – but without mentioning Russia’s invasion that has left millions of Ukrainians in desperate need of food, water and shelter.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has verified 64 incidents of attacks on Ukrainian health care facilities and workers since the invasion began, amounting to two to three attacks on healthcare per day, causing 15 deaths and 37 injuries.

“Attacks on healthcare are a violation of international humanitarian law, but a disturbingly common tactic of war – they destroy critical infrastructure, but worse, they destroy hope,” said Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO representative in Ukraine.

“They deprive already vulnerable people of care that is often the difference between life and death. Healthcare is not – and should never be – a target.”

4:30 am: 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops dead in Ukraine, says NATO

NATO estimated on Wednesday that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in four weeks of war in Ukraine, where fierce resistance from the country's defenders has denied Moscow the lightning victory it sought.

By way of comparison, Russia lost about 15,000 troops over 10 years in Afghanistan.

A senior NATO military official said the alliance's estimate was based on information from Ukrainian authorities, what Russia has released – intentionally or not – and intelligence gathered from open sources. The official spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by NATO.

Ukraine has released little information about its own military losses, and the West has not given an estimate, but President Volodymr Zelensky said nearly two weeks ago that about 1,300 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed.

2:25 am: Russian regulator blocks Google News, reports Interfax

Russia's communications regulator has blocked the news aggregator service of Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, accusing it of allowing access to what it calls fake material about the country's military operation in Ukraine, Interfax news agency said on Wednesday.

""We’ve confirmed that some people are having difficulty accessing the Google News app and website in Russia and that this is not due to any technical issues on our end,"" Google said in statement.

""We’ve worked hard to keep information services like News accessible to people in Russia for as long as possible.""

Interfax said Roskomnadzor, the regulator, had acted on a request from the office of Russia's prosecutor general.

""The American online news resource in question provided access to numerous publications and materials containing inauthentic and publicly important information about the course of the special military operation on the territory of Ukraine,"" Interfax quoted the regulator as saying.

A new Russian law makes it illegal to report any event that could discredit the Russian military.

The decision was taken in response to the expulsion by Washington of Russian diplomats at the UN in New York, the source said.

""The US side has been given firm notice that any hostile action by the United States against Russia will be met with a resolute and appropriate response,"" the statement added.

Close to 7 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced in the one month of war, with one in three of them suffering from a chronic health condition, according to the global health agency.

11:57 pm: Russian move on Ukraine aid fails at UN Security Council

A Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine that does not mention Moscow's role in the crisis failed at the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday, with only Russia and China voting yes and the remaining 13 members abstaining.

""If Russia cared about the humanitarian situation, it would stop bombing children and end their siege tactics. But they haven't,"" Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward told the council after the vote. Russia denies attacking civilians.

A Security Council resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, Britain, France or the United States to be adopted. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused those who abstained on Wednesday of doing so ""for political reasons.""

Explaining China's yes vote, Ambassador Zhang Jun said Beijing had a ""strong expectation"" that there should be an immediate ceasefire, but that while pushing for a halt to the fighting, the council should ""also respond to the humanitarian crisis in a positive, pragmatic and constructive manner.""

11:30 pm: Russian army 'taking defensive positions' in Ukraine: Pentagon

The Russian army has retreated more than 30 kilometres (18 miles) east of Kyiv in the past 24 hours and has begun to establish defensive positions on several fronts in Ukraine, a senior Pentagon official said Wednesday.

""The Ukrainians have managed to push the Russians back 55 kilometres east and northeast of Kiev,"" the senior official, who requested anonymity, told reporters. ""That is a change from yesterday.""

On Tuesday the Pentagon had estimated that Russian forces were around 20 kilometres from the center of the capital.

To the northwest, ""they're basically digging in and they are establishing defensive positions,"" the official added. ""So it's not that they're not advancing. They're actually not trying to advance right now.""

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, speaking on Air Force One, told reporters that G7 nations will soon reveal a unified response to ensure Russia cannot evade Western sanctions.

""That's not specifically about China, but it will apply to every significant economy and the decisions that any of those economies take to try, in an intentional and active way, to undermine or weaken the sanctions that we put in place.""

Simba the lion and Akyla the wolf escape from Ukraine

Animal rights activists have evacuated Simba the lion and Akyla the wolf from a zoo in Zaporizhzhia in southeast Ukraine.

The journey took four days, and was hampered by border entry bureaucracy.

Simba and Akyla were awake for the whole journey due to a lack of tranquilizers in Ukraine.

The two animals arrived safely at a zoo in the Romanian city of Radauti, near the Ukrainian border.

""If there is something this war brought on is incredible cooperation between organizations,"" said Sebastian Taralunga, from Animals International, one of several groups involved in the extraction.

""Everybody agreed that in extreme times we have to have extreme measures and we decided to do whatever possible to bring those animals out of war.""

The animals will be quarantined in their new enclosure, where zoo visitors can see them before they are relocated to sanctuaries.

NATO: 7,000 to 15,000 Russian deaths in Ukraine

NATO has estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the invasion of Ukraine, according to figures released to the Associated Press.

The estimate is reportedly based on Ukrainian information, Russian publications, and open source information.

Extrapolating from the deaths using standard ratios of wounded and dead soldiers in other conflicts, NATO estimates total Russian battlefield casualties of between 30,000 and 40,000 soldiers. Previous reports also indicated Russia has lost at least three generals since the conflict started on February 24.

Russia has suppressed reporting of its battlefield causalities, making accurate information difficult to come by. A recent report in the pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda reported 9,861 Russians deaths and 16,153 injured, but the report was very quickly taken down and blamed on hackers.

Russia has not updated its official casualty figures since March 2, when it said 498 servicemen had been killed and 1,597 had been wounded. Ukraine puts the Russian death toll at 15,600.

It's not clear from when exactly this policy will take effect.

Germany says more Strela missiles on their way to Ukraine

Further supplies of Strela missiles taken from the inventories of the former East German army are to be delivered to Ukraine after a delay, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock says.

The Strela system is a shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile designed to hit low-flying aircraft. The missiles are fitted with passive infrared homing guidance and a high-explosive warhead.

So far, Ukraine has received 500 Strela missiles, but a delivery of up to 2,700 of the weapons has been discussed.

""We are one of the biggest weapons suppliers in this situation; it doesn't make us proud but it's what we must do to help Ukraine,"" Baerbock told the Bundestag.

Ukraine MP says no compromise with Putin on 'territorial integrity'

Ukrainians will not step back from the war, no matter the destruction wrought upon them, said Andrii Osadchuk, member of the Ukrainian parliament for the opposition party.

""Ukraine is resisting ... we know how to fight. We burned Russians on the ground extremely well almost a month of war. Russians are stuck almost in all points of the front line,"" he told DW.

Describing it as a ""full-scale, terrible war,"" the MP said it's not correct to blame Vladimir Putin alone because ""thousands and thousands of Russian soldiers"" are also involved in attacks on Ukraine.

""All of them are committing crimes against humanity, war crimes,"" he said.

Osadchuk also stressed the need for a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

""We will fight until the end ... Our big problem for today is protecting of Ukrainians from Russians in the sky. They are not able to move on the ground. They are not able to kill Ukrainian soldiers. They are killing civilians and they are taking us by cruise missiles and jet fighters.""

Scholz said Germany would also not impose an embargo on Russian oil, coal and gas.

He stressed that Europe will end its energy dependence on Russia but to do so from one day to the next would plunge it into an economic recession, risking mass unemployment and entire industrial sectors. ""Sanctions should not hurt European states harder than the Russian leadership,"" Scholz said.

Russians accused of destroying Chernobyl laboratory

The agency responsible for managing the Chernobyl exclusion zone has accused Russian forces of destroying a new laboratory at the nuclear power plant.

Ukraine's State Agency for Exclusion Zone Management said that Russian troops had ""illegally seized"" the laboratory and then said they ""robbed and destroyed the November Central Analytical Laboratory.""

The agency said the laboratory contained ""highly active samples and samples of radionuclides that are now in the hands of the enemy, which we hope will harm itself and not the civilized world.""

The facility was built at a cost of €6 million ($6.6 million) with the help of the European Union. It had been in operation since 2015.

Russian defense chief makes first appearance in weeks

Sergei Shoigu, Russia's defense minister and close-ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, resurfaced on Thursday after having been out of the public eye for several weeks.

However, the 66-year-old's appearance was limited to a small section of Putin's computer screen during a split-screen video call along with other Russian officials.

The video, taken from within Putin's office by the RIA news agency, zoomed in on the section of the screen where Shoigu was. The video is believed to be the first public sighting of the minister since March 11.

""The defence minister has a lot on his mind right now. A special military operation is under way. Now is not really the time for media activity,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

However, the original disappearance of Shoigu, and the claims that the invasion has not been going as well as Moscow has expected, led to speculation over the fate of the defense chief.

""The Russian occupiers are forcing them to move to Russia. The invaders confiscate people's passports and other identity documents,"" the statement said, adding that it was ""in order to use them as hostages and put more political pressure on Ukraine.""

The statement also accused Russian forces of firing on columns of civilians fleeing from the city that was the subject of intense bombardment by the Russian military and a siege that left thousands of people without access to food, water and power for days.

NATO activates chemical and nuclear defense elements

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance was concerned Russia may be preparing a pretext to use chemical weapons. ""We see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext accusing Ukraine, the United States and NATO allies of preparing to use chemical and biological weapons,"" he told reporters after a NATO summit in Brussels.

""Our top military commander ... has activated NATO's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense elements and allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defenses,"" he said.

He reiterated the significant impact any use of chemical weapons would have on the course of events, not just in Ukraine, but also in neighboring countries. He also stressed the continuity of NATO's Open Door policy, which has been one of Moscow's main complaints and justifications for its invasion of Ukraine.

Asked whether NATO would provide Ukraine with the list of weapons and equipment requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Stoltenberg said that alliance members are already supplying weapons and equipment, but ""at the same time, we have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe.""

NATO pledges more support for Ukraine

Stoltenberg said that the alliance will increase its support for Ukraine as well as its deployments in Eastern Europe during a press conference that came after an emergency session of NATO member-state leaders.

Stoltenberg's comments coincided with the release of a statement from the alliance as well as the announcement that he will stay on for an extra year due to the invasion, delaying his plan to step down from the position.

NATO members are ""equipping Ukraine with significant military supplies including anti-tank and air defense systems and drones, which are proving highly effective, as well as substantial financial and humanitarian aid,"" Stoltenberg said.

""Today we agreed to do more, including cyber security assistance and equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats,"" he added.

The NATO chief warned against escalating the war and pledged more support for other countries facing threats from Russia, namely Georgia and Bosnia.

Red Cross chief holds talks with Russia's Lavrov

The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, has held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, saying afterward they had discussed the need to protect civilians during Moscow's operations in Ukraine.

""We certainly also discussed the international humanitarian law and provisions of the Geneva Convention in regard to conduct of hostilities ... that civilians must be protected,"" Maurer told a news conference.

""We think we are confronted with a very complex front line at the present moment in Ukraine which sees a lot of people trapped and people caught people in between front lines,"" Maurer added.

""It's not possible to think about access or evacuation, either in Mariupol or another place, if we don't have a solid ... and detailed agreement between the militaries on the ground,"" he said.

The southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol has been particularly devastated by street fighting and bombardments, with hundreds of thousands of people believed to be trapped inside buildings, with no access to food, water, power or heat. Numerous attempts to create humanitarian corridors for evacuation have been thwarted by continued fighting.

Prior to the talks, Maurer had said he would raise the issues of prisoners of war, missing people and detained civilians in his talks with Lavrov in Moscow.

Lavrov said, ""We hope the efforts of the ICRC will bear fruit"" and called the organization an ""impartial and independent intermediary"".

""Unfortunately we don't have any particular basis to rely on conscientious fulfillment by the Kyiv authorities,"" he added.
