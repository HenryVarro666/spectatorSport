1,8d09c798-6ae6-4064-a660-120ccf6c8a69,[],2022-02-27 00:00:00,"At this dark hour, when we see Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine and massive disinformation campaigns and information manipulation, it is essential to separate lies – invented to justify what cannot be justified – from facts.

The facts are that Russia, a major nuclear power, has attacked and invaded a peaceful and democratic neighbouring country, which posed no threat to it, nor provoked it. Moreover, president Putin is threatening reprisals on any other state that may come to the rescue of the people of Ukraine. Such use of force and coercion has no place in the 21st century.

What Putin is doing is not only a grave violation of international law, it is a violation of the basic principles of human coexistence. With his choice to bring war back to Europe, we see the return of the “law of the jungle” where might makes right. The target is not only Ukraine, but the security of Europe and the whole international rules-based order, based on the UN system and international law.

His aggression is taking innocent lives, crushing people’s wish to live in peace. Civilian targets are being struck, clearly violating international humanitarian law, forcing people to flee. We see a humanitarian catastrophe developing. For months, we pursued unparalleled efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution. But Putin lied to the faces of all who met him, pretending to be interested in a peaceful solution. Instead, he opted for a full-scale invasion, a fully fledged war.

Russia must cease its military operations immediately, and unconditionally withdraw from the entire territory of Ukraine. The same goes for Belarus, which has to immediately stop its involvement in this aggression and respect its international obligations. The European Union is united in offering its strong support to Ukraine and its people. This is a matter of life and death. I am preparing an emergency package to support the Ukrainian armed forces in their fight.

The international community will now in response opt for a full-scale isolation of Russia, to hold Putin accountable for this aggression. We are sanctioning those who finance the war, crippling the Russian banking system and its access to international reserves.

The EU and its partners have already imposed massive sanctions on Russia that target its leaders and elites and strategic sectors of the Kremlin-run economy. The aim is not to harm the Russian people, but to weaken the Kremlin’s ability to finance this unjust war. In doing this, we are closely aligned with our partners and allies – the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea and Australia. We also see many countries from around the world rallying to protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, including the United Kingdom. We stand together on the right side of history in the face of Russia’s horrifying attack on a free and sovereign country.

To justify its crimes, the Kremlin and its supporters have engaged in a massive disinformation campaign, which started already weeks ago. We have seen Russian state media and their ecosystem peddling untruths in social media networks with the aim of deceiving and manipulating.

The Kremlin propagandists call the invasion “a special operation”, but this cynical euphemism cannot hide the fact that we witness a fully fledged invasion of Ukraine, with the aim to crush its freedom, legitimate government and democratic structures. Calling the Kyiv government “neo-Nazi” and “Russophobic” is nonsense: all manifestations of nazism are banned in Ukraine. In modern Ukraine, extreme rightwing candidates are a fringe phenomenon with minimal support, without passing the barrier to enter the parliament. The Ukrainian government did not cut the Donbas off and it has not prohibited the use of Russian language and culture. Donetsk and Luhansk are no republics, they are Ukrainian regions controlled by Russia-backed and armed separatist groupings.

We know this – and many Russians know this. There have been courageous protests in cities across Russia since the invasion started, demanding the end of the aggression against a peaceful neighbouring nation. We hear their voices and recognise their courage in speaking out, and we also see many prominent public figures in Russia protesting this senseless invasion.

I continue to work with our partners around the world to ensure the joint action of the international community against the Kremlin’s behaviour. On 25 February, only Russia vetoed a UN security council Resolution on Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, with China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. From all over the world, countries condemn Russia’s attacks, and at the General Assembly the entire international community needs to join forces and help to end Russia’s military aggression by adopting the related UN resolution.

With this war on Ukraine, the world will never be the same again. It is now, more than ever, the time for societies and alliances to come together to build our future on trust, justice and freedom. It is the moment to stand up and to speak out. Might does not make right. Never did. Never will.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/27/eu-will-provide-weapons-for-ukraine-josep-borrell

Josep Borrell, the European Union's foreign affairs and security policy chief, has thanked Poland for its readiness to take the role of a logistic hub for EU support transports to Ukraine.

Borrell was speaking at a press conference after a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Sunday evening.

""I want to thank Poland who has offered to serve as logistics hub for the transfer of this material assistance to Ukraine,"" Borrell said.

On Sunday, the EU also decided to exclude select Russian banks from the international bank payment system Swift and to freeze half of Russia's central bank's assets.

""These measures will effectively cripple Russian financial markets,"" Borrell said.

A number of European countries, including Poland, have advocated for launching the Swift ban, considered the toughest possible economic sanction, from the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Thursday.

Italy, Germany, Hungary and Cyprus first opposed the move fearing disruption of business in their countries, but mounting pressure from other governments and societies appalled by the destruction and increasing civilian casualties forced them to change their policy.

The EU has also blocked access to EU skies and airports to Russian airlines and private jets. A number of other countries in Europe and across the world introduced similar restrictions.

Additionally, the EU has made an unprecedented decision to send military aid to Ukraine apart from humanitarian supplies.

""We have decided to use our capacities to provide arms, lethal arms, lethal assistance to the Ukrainian army by the value of 450 million (euros) in support package and 50 more million (euros) for non-lethal supplies,"" Borrell said.

The latest restrictions will also hit Russian oligarchs who were not targeted in previous round of sanctions.

Russia attacked Ukraine from three directions on Thursday but the Kremlin's plans of a fast-tracked conquest and replacement of the Ukrainian government with a puppet regime loyal to Moscow has failed so far as Russian forces met with fierce Ukrainian resistance.",https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/eu-foreign-policy-chief-thanks-poland-for-hub-role-in-ukraine-crisis-28255

“Another taboo has fallen these days – the taboo that the EU cannot use its resources to provide arms to a country that is being aggressed by another,” EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell said as EU foreign ministers met to green-light the unprecedented step.

EU treaties prohibit the bloc from using its regular multiannual budget to fund operations with military or defence implications.

That is why, under the unveiled plans, the EU will use an off-budget so-called ‘European Peace Facility’ (EPF) financing instrument with a ceiling of €5 billion that can be used to provide military aid.

The only recently created intergovernmental fund had opened the door for the bloc to deliver military aid to partner countries and finance the deployment of its military missions abroad.

Borrell said the EU had agreed “to provide arms — lethal arms, lethal assistance — to the Ukrainian army for a value of €450 million support package and €50 million more for the non-lethal supplies – fuel and protective equipment.”

The EPF would be used to coordinate shipments and other logistics.

EU defence ministers will meet virtually on Monday (28 January) to iron out the technical details of the mechanism.

The EU in December already decided to start providing security aid to Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova from this year under the instrument.

“For the first time ever, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday (28 February).

“This is a watershed moment,” she added.

EU adopts €5billion fund to train and equip foreign military forces Despite criticism from European lawmakers and advocacy groups, the EU adopted the €5 billion worth French-brokered European Peace Facility (EPF) on Monday (22 March), which will open the door for the bloc to deliver military aid to partner countries and …

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union agreed Sunday to close its airspace to Russian airlines, spend hundreds of millions of euros on buying weapons for Ukraine and ban some pro-Kremlin media outlets in its latest response to Russia’s invasion, EU officials said.

That and Germany’s announcement earlier in the day that it would almost triple its defense budget this year underscored how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was rewriting Europe’s post-World War II security and defense policy in ways that were unthinkable only a few weeks ago.

In what he described as “a defining moment for European history,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that the bloc’s 27 foreign ministers had greenlighted the unprecedented support for Ukraine and that those actions would take effect within hours.

“We have decided to use our capacities to provide lethal arms, lethal assistance, to the Ukrainian army by a value of 450 million (euros) ($502 million) … and 50 more million ($56 million) for non-lethal supplies, fuel, protective equipment,” Borrell told reporters.

Borrell said EU defense ministers will discuss Monday how to convert the funds into useful military materiel and ensure that it reaches the Ukrainian armed forces. He said Poland has agreed to act as a hub to distribute the arms and equipment.

The EU ministers also agreed to add several more people and organizations to a growing list of sanctions. Those included Russian oligarchs whose money, Borrell said, is important for the Russian economy, as well as other key officials, notably those spreading disinformation. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have already seen their assets in Europe frozen.

In a separate announcement, Germany’s leader said the country would commit 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to a special armed forces fund and keep its defense spending above NATO’s target of 2% of GDP.

Anti-war protesters, meanwhile, took to the streets in Berlin, Rome, Prague, Istanbul and elsewhere — even Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg and in a dozen Belarusian cities — to demand an end to the war, the largest ground offensive on the continent since WWII.

According to the OVD-Info rights group, Russian police detained at least 2,063 Russians in 48 cities over anti-war demonstrations on Sunday alone.Human rights advocates reported that more than 170 people had been arrested in the Belarusian protests. In Minsk, a large pile of flowers kept growing in front of Ukraine’s embassy.

Tens of thousands of people massed Sunday in front of Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, with some carrying posters with slogans such as “Hands off Ukraine,” “Tanks to Windmills” and “Putin, go to therapy and leave Ukraine and the world in peace.”

The EU’s plan to fund weapons would help to buy air defense systems, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine’s armed forces. It would also supply things like fuel, protective gear, helmets and first aid kits.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said beyond the weapons purchases, EU nations would shut down European airspace for Russians.

“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU,” she said.

She said the EU will also ban “the Kremlin’s media machine. The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin’s war and to sow division in our union.”

Von der Leyen added that the EU will also target Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko for supporting Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine.

“We will hit Lukashenko’s regime with a new package of sanctions,” she said.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s announcement of new defense funding is hugely significant for Germany, which has come under criticism from the United States and other NATO allies for not investing adequately in its defense budget.

“It’s clear we need to invest significantly more in the security of our country, in order to protect our freedom and our democracy,” Scholz told a special session of the Bundestag in Berlin.

Scholz said the 100 billion euro fund ($113 billion) was currently a one-time measure for 2022. Still, Scholz indicated Germany will exceed the 2% of GDP threshold going forward, signaling an overall future increase in defense spending.

A day earlier, Germany announced another major policy shift, saying it will send weapons and other supplies directly to Ukraine, including 500 Stinger missiles, which are used to shoot down helicopters and warplanes, and 1,000 anti-tank weapons.

Israel announced it was sending 100 tons of humanitarian aid — medical equipment and medicine, tents, sleeping bags and blankets — to help civilians in Ukraine. Israel also offered itself as a potential mediator during a phone call between Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Putin, the Kremlin and Israel said. Bennett spoke also Friday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is Jewish.

As Greece sent more military aid, Turkish officials termed Russia’s invasion a “war,” a categorization that could lead Ankara to close down the Turkish straits to Russian warships, which Ukraine requested earlier this week. The 1936 Montreux Convention gives Turkey the right to bar “belligerent states” from using the Dardanelles and the Bosporus during wartime but provides an exception for Black Sea vessels to return to port.

On the sanctions front, Japan joined the United States and European nations in cutting key Russian banks from the SWIFT international financial banking system. Japan will also freeze assets of Putin and other top Russian officials, while sending $100 million in emergency humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters.

Catholic and Orthodox religious leaders, meanwhile, prayed Sunday for peace, voiced solidarity with Ukrainians and denounced the Russian invasion.

At the Vatican, Ukrainian flags fluttered in St. Peter’s Square as Pope Francis delivered his weekly Sunday blessing and appealed for global solidarity for “the suffering people of Ukraine.”

“Those who make war forget humanity,” Francis said. He refrained from citing Russia by name, in apparent deference to his hopes of keeping dialogue open with the Russian Orthodox Church.

Also Sunday, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople described Russia’s invasion as “beyond every sense of law and morality” and pleaded for an end to the war.

Patriarch Bartholomew is considered the spiritual leader and first among equals of Eastern Orthodox Christians worldwide. He granted the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which severed it in 2019 from the Russian church to which it had been tied since 1686. The Russian Orthodox Church severed relations with him as result.

The European Union agreed Sunday to provide some €500 million in arms and other aid to the Ukrainian military as it battles Russia’s invasion, in a move the bloc described as a “watershed moment” in its history.

The EU’s treaties bar the bloc from using its normal budget to fund operations with military or defense implications. Under the plans announced Sunday, as first reported by POLITICO, the EU will use an off-budget so-called “European Peace Facility” financing instrument with a ceiling of €5 billion that can be used to provide military aid.

“For the first time ever, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a media appearance alongside the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. “This is a watershed moment,” she added.

The plan was agreed at an emergency videoconference of EU foreign affairs ministers on Sunday evening.

“Another taboo has fallen,” Borrell said. “The taboo that the EU was not providing arms in a war, yes we are doing it … This war requires our engagement in order to support the Ukrainian army.”

Borrell said the EU had agreed “to provide arms — lethal arms, lethal assistance — to the Ukrainian army for a value of [a] €450 million support package and €50 million more for the non-lethal supplies – [such as] fuel and protective equipment.”

The amount represents 10 percent of the €5 billion allocated to the European Peace Facility for the 2021-2027 budget cycle and “almost all what we can spend for this year,” one diplomat said.

The plans were announced a day after the German government said it would provide lethal weapons to Ukraine — a historic shift by a country that had long prohibited sending such arms into conflict zones.

Von der Leyen and Borrell said the proposal will also strengthen the EU’s previously announced package of measures designed to step up international support for Ukraine by imposing more financial sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, like removing “selected Russian banks” from the SWIFT international payments system.

The EU is also set to shut down its airspace for Russian planes — following similar moves made by most EU countries — and ban what von der Leyen called the Kremlin’s “media machine,” referring to state-owned outlets like Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries.

Sanctions will also be strengthened against Belarus and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, a close Russian ally, with restrictive measures affecting the country’s mineral, fuels, tobacco and steel sectors, and “those Belarusians helping the Russian war effort,” von der Leyen added.

U.S. citizens should consider leaving Russia immediately, State Department says The U.S. Embassy in Moscow warned U.S. citizens Sunday that they should consider leaving the country immediately as more countries impose airspace restrictions on Russia. ""An increasing number of airlines are canceling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available."" The embassy added that U.S. citizens should have a contingency plan ""that does not rely on U.S. government assistance."" Americans also should monitor local and international media, keep in contact with family and friends, stay alert to their surroundings when in public, review security plans and always carry their passports with current Russian visas, the embassy said. Since January, the State Department has said Americans should not travel to Russia because of ""ongoing tension along the border with Ukraine, the potential for harassment against U.S. citizens, the embassy's limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Russia, COVID-19 and related entry restrictions, terrorism, harassment by Russian government security officials, and the arbitrary enforcement of local law.""

In a phone call earlier Sunday, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko pledged that all missiles, planes and helicopters in his country would remain on the ground as Ukrainian officials travel to and from Belarus, as well as during the coming meeting, Zelenskyy said. Ukraine has not said when the meeting would take place or who would be part of its delegation. Share this -

U.N. Security Council votes to call rare emergency General Assembly session on Ukraine The U.N. Security Council voted Sunday to call a emergency special session of the General Assembly that will take place Monday, a rare move that comes as the U.S. and its allies, including the European Union, crack down on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The decision to call the session passed with 11 votes in favor. China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstained, and Russia was the lone vote against the resolution. Because it was a procedural vote, only nine votes were needed for it to pass, and Russia's veto did not apply. ""Russia cannot veto our voices. Russia cannot veto the Ukrainian people. Russia cannot veto the U.N. Charter. Russia cannot and will not veto accountability,"" said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., calling the vote ""an important step forward"" toward holding Russia responsible for its actions. Thomas-Greenfield, addressing Russia and reports that its forces have targeted civilians in Ukraine, said the ""world is watching."" ""Photographic and video evidence is mounting, and you will be held to account for your actions. We will not let atrocities slide,"" she said. Share this -







International Atomic Energy Agency says no damage after second reported missile strike on waste site Missiles struck a nuclear waste disposal facility in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, but there were no immediate signs of damage or radioactive release, the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, said Sunday. The IAEA said the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine informed the agency that the strike occurred late Saturday or early Sunday local time. The reported strike came less than 24 hours after the Ukrainian government reported an attack on a similar disposal facility near the country’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, the IAEA said. Again, there were no immediate reports of a radioactive release. NBC News was unable to immediately confirm the reports. Russian forces on Thursday captured the decommissioned power plant at Chernobyl, the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster. Share this -

Kyiv mayor proud of citizens’ spirit, anxious about future As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv’s mayor is filled with pride over his citizens’ spirit yet anxious about how long they can hold out. In an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv. “We can’t do that, because all ways are blocked,” he finally said, speaking in English. “All ways are blocked and right now we are encircled — everywhere is Russians and we don’t have a way to evacuate the people. And everyone who had plans to evacuate himself already moved.” The AP was not able to immediately verify the mayor’s report that Kyiv was surrounded, and his spokesperson later tweeted that the mayor had misspoken. Klitschko himself later backed away from his earlier assessment, saying on his Telegram channel that “In the evening, Russian Internet publications spread information with reference to me that Kyiv is allegedly surrounded and evacuation of people is impossible. ...

Russian oligarchs to face international sanctions, U.S. official says European leaders are in step with the U.S. over the decision to target assets owned by Russian oligarchs as well as sanctioned companies in retaliation for Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a senior White House official said. The Biden administration plans to launch a transatlantic task force to identify any ""ill-gotten gains"" from elites close to Putin and the Russian government, the official said. This is in addition to severe sanctions placed on Putin's personal assets and the limitations on Russian banks. ""We’ve also sanctioned Russian oligarchs and Putin’s inner circle and their family members, including Putin’s cronies who sit atop Russia’s largest financial institutions and are responsible for providing the resources necessary to support Putin’s further invasion of Ukraine,"" the official said. Russia's central bank said Thursday that it would offer assistance to any banks or businesses facing sanctions, after the ruble plummeted in value against the U.S. dollar. The U.S. and its allies announced Saturday that they would limit Russia's access to SWIFT, a service that facilitates global transactions among thousands of financial institutions. That decision, along with sanctions on Russian banks, Putin, and Putin's inner circle, is designed to tighten the financial straits on Putin's war reserves. Share this -

E.U. bans Russian planes across its airspace The European Union is banning all travel from Russian planes over its airspace in response to President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced Sunday.

No reason to doubt reports of Russia's nuclear activation, defense official tells NBC News The U.S. currently has no reason to doubt reports that Putin asked his military’s nuclear deterrent forces to be on alert, a senior defense official told NBC News on Sunday. In a meeting televised on state television on Sunday, Putin said the decision to place the country’s nuclear weapons on increased readiness to launch was in response to “aggressive statements"" from NATO leaders. There's no view yet from U.S. intelligence on how this might play out, according to the defense official. “We believe that this is an unnecessary and escalatory one,"" the official said. Russian forces have faced fierce resistance from Ukrainians since Russia invaded the country overnight Wednesday, while also facing severe sanctions from the U.S. and its allies. It appears that Russia has put roughly two-thirds of its combat power around Ukraine, the official said, but its military seems to be losing momentum. There's no evidence from U.S. intelligence that Russian forces have taken any Ukrainian cities as of yet, and it appears Russia is behind schedule on where it hoped to be with its invasion plans, the official added.

Ukrainian foreign minister calls Russia's willingness to hold talks 'a victory for Ukraine’ Russia's willingness to hold talks after encountering serious resistance to its invasion is a ""victory for Ukraine,"" Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said during a briefing Sunday. ""I think that the fact that Russia is ready to hold talks — without any preconditions, without any ultimatums, without any demands addressed to Ukraine — is already a victory for Ukraine,"" Kuleba said.

Former USCIS officials call on Biden to give Ukrainians temporary protected status Two former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service officials are calling on the Biden administration to immediately grant protections to Ukrainians that would allow them to remain in the country without fear of deportation. Emilio Gonzalez, who served as director of USCIS under former President George Bush, and León Rodríguez, who served as the director of USCIS under the Obama administration, told NBC News on Sunday that they have written a letter to President Joe Biden asking him to grant Temporary Protected Status to Ukrainians in the U.S., which they plan to send in the coming days. ""It's just something very pressing and something that I feel very strongly about,"" said Gonzalez, in a phone interview. ""I did when I was the USCIS director, and I do now [feel] that some people through no fault of their own need protection and if they find themselves in the greatest country in the world at that point in their lives, we should extend that protection."" Under U.S. immigration laws, the secretary of the Homeland Security is authorized to offer TPS to immigrants living in the country if it is determined that their home countries are unable to safely accept deportees due to armed conflict, natural disasters, an epidemic or other ""extraordinary"" emergencies. Asked whether the U.S. was considering extending TPS to Ukrainians, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday it would be a decision for the DHS to make. ""TPS is always on the table when you have a major military crisis that causes the level of displacement that this one has caused,"" said Rodríguez in a phone interview, noting that the status had previously been granted for other nations, including Syria and Venezuela. ""So there's nothing different really about Ukraine in my mind."" ""It is my sincere hope that people will be able to return to Ukraine soon, but right now, there's no question that it is not a place to which people can return safely,"" he added.

Russia suspends space launches from French Guiana in response to sanctions Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, is halting all launches of its Soyuz rocket from Europe's spaceport in South America over sanctions imposed by the European Union. ""In response to EU sanctions against our enterprises, Roscosmos is suspending cooperation with European partners"" on space launches from Europe's spaceport in French Guiana, Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin said in a statement posted Saturday on Twitter, according to a translation. The agency said it will also withdraw 87 personnel from the South American launch site who work for several Russian companies to support the launch of Soyuz rockets. ""The issue of the departure of Russian employees is being worked out,"" Roscosmos said on Twitter. Russian-built Soyuz rockets are used to launch satellites from French Guiana for Arianespace, a commercial launch provider based in France. Roscosmos' announcement will likely delay the launch of two Galileo navigation satellites from South America, while increasing tensions between Russia and its other space agency partners, including NASA and the European Space Agency.

U.S. and allies applying 'Iran model' to Russia with SWIFT restrictions, official says A senior Biden administration official has described the decision by the United States and some of its allies to remove select Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system as applying “the Iran model.” Banks kicked off of SWIFT will have to “use a telephone or a fax machine” to send money internationally, helping to turn Russia into “a global economic and financial pariah,” the official who spoke on condition of anonymity told reporters. The U.S. and its allies will “hunt down” the “yachts, jets, fancy cars and luxury homes” of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs, they said. On Saturday, the U.S. along with the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada announced that select Russian banks would be removed from the service that facilitates global transactions among thousands of financial institutions. The option had been on the table, but some allies in Europe with economies more closely tied to Russia's had been reluctant to include SWIFT among sanctions because of the possible impact it could have.

Radioactive waste site struck by Russian munitions Russian munitions struck a radioactive waste site in Kyiv, prompting some concern that the effects won't be known until the shelling and missile fire stops, government officials in Ukraine said Sunday. The State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine said in a statement that the capital branch of the government Radon Association reported seeing falling missiles on security cameras.

Experts from the Ukrainian State Association Radon, or Radon Association, reported the attack by phone after seeing it via security video, the inspectorate said. They had taken shelter and viewed the offensive via a remote video system intended for security, it said. The site's automated reporting system had failed. Now those personnel are pinned down until the offensive at their location ends, the inspectorate said. Assessment will happen in the wake of Russia's mission, it said. At the same time, the inspectorate believes there is no radioactive threat to people outside of a buffer zone intended to protect communities from radioactive waste sites. Ukraine has more than a half dozen of these regional sites, including the Kyiv SISP, for State Interregional Specialized Plants for Radioactive Waste Management. They were built to accept waste from the use of radiation in medicine, science and ""different industries,"" according to the government. Share this -

China so far not helping Russia evade sanctions, U.S. official says WASHINGTON — China so far does not appear to be helping Russia evade Western financial sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, but doing so would ""do profound damage"" to China's reputation, a senior Biden Administration official said on Saturday.

The official said that recent reports that some Chinese banks have stopped issuing letters of credit for purchases of physical commodities from Russia were a positive sign. This ""suggests that, much like has been the pattern for years and years, China has tended to respect the force of U.S. sanctions,"" the official added.

There have been at least 240 confirmed civilian casualties in Ukraine since Russia attacked it and invaded Thursday morning, a United Nations office said. That number includes at least 64 dead. The U.N. believes the ""real figures are considerably higher,"" because many reports of casualties have yet to be confirmed. Share this -







Kyiv children's hospital says it's undamaged, 6-year-old caught in nearby attack dead An official at a Kyiv children's hospital allegedly damaged by Russian forces Saturday says it remained intact despite nearby fighting, though a child brought to the hospital had died. Three adults and three children were brought to the Ukraine National Specialized Children’s Hospital, called Okhmadyt, after getting caught in a nearby attack, the hospital's press manager, Anastasia Maggeramova, said over the phone. One six-year-old boy was dead when he arrived at the medical facility. “We heard an attack and after that some people came in by emergency vehicle,"" she said, adding that they were treating the three adults and two children who had survived. ""Now a child is dead because of [the] massive attack.” Maggeramova said the hospital staff had frequently heard nearby conflict over the past few days, though it had not yet reached the medical facility. This is the most patients they'd yet received because of the conflict, she said. “Our doctors have tried to do their best to save them and to help them,” Maggeramova said. Local reports had said Saturday that the hospital, which specializes in treating children with cancer, had been hit by Russian artillery fire and killed one child. Though they remained safe so far, Maggeramova said the staff wanted people to know what was happening. “We want the world to know the truth: civilian people are under attack,"" she said. ""Children are suffering, people are suffering because of war, because of attacks, because of terrible things now happening here in Ukraine.” Share this -







Trump boasts as Russian attack continues; blames Biden, not Putin ORLANDO — Former President Donald Trump test drove a new message on Ukraine Saturday night that immediately won approval from his base. ""I stand as the only president of the 21st century on whose watch Russia did not invade another country,"" he said to applause at the Conservative Political Action Conference here. Russia launched attacks into Georgia during President George W. Bush's administration, Crimea during President Barack Obama's administration and into Ukraine just a few days ago. In a break with traditional decorum from a former president — but in line with Trump's approach to his successor — he placed more blame for the invasion on President Joe Biden, rather than on Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin. ""The problem is not that Putin is smart,"" Trump said. ""The problem is our leaders are dumb — so dumb."" While he called the attack on Ukraine ""an assault on humanity,"" he declined to criticize Putin for launching it. ""If you take over Ukraine, we’re going to sanction you, they say,"" Trump said of the western alliance. ""Sanction, well that’s a pretty weak statement."" Share this -







At least 240 civilian causalities in Ukraine, U.N. says GENEVA — The United Nations says it has confirmed at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed, in the fighting in Ukraine that erupted since Russia’s invasion — though it believed the “real figures are considerably higher” because many reports of casualties remain to be confirmed. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs relayed the count late Saturday from the U.N. human rights office, which has strict methodologies and verification procedures about the toll from conflict. OCHA also said damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water and produced a map of “humanitarian situations” in Ukraine — mostly in northern, eastern and southern Ukraine. The human rights office had reported early Friday an initial count by its staffers of at least 127 civilian casualties – 25 people killed and 102 injured – mostly from shelling and airstrikes.

What happens after removal from SWIFT? Phone or fax, U.S. official says Banks removed from SWIFT banking system would have to ""use a telephone or a fax machine"" to send money internationally, a senior Biden administration official said. The U.S. and its allies on Saturday announced an agreement in which they ""commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system"" as punishment for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Which banks have not been determined, but the administration official said that those already under U.S. and European Union sanctions would be considered first. ""If one of these 'de-SWIFT-ed' Russian banks wants to make, or receive, a payment with a bank outside of Russia, such as a bank in Asia, it will now need to use the telephone or a fax machine,"" the administration official said on condition of anonymity. ""In all likelihood, most banks around the world will simply stop transacting altogether with Russian banks that are removed from SWIFT,"" the official said. SWIFT is an industry-owned cooperative headquartered in Belgium. The U.S. official said that the list of banks that could be removed would be finalized by the EU. Share this -







French president asks Belarus counterpart to order removal of Russian soldiers PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has asked his Belarus counterpart to demand that the country, Ukraine’s neighbor, quickly order Russian troops to leave, claiming Moscow has been given the green light to deploy nuclear arms there. In a phone conversation Saturday, Macron denounced “the gravity of a decision that would authorize Russia to deploy nuclear arms on Belarus soil,” a statement by the presidential palace said. Macron told Alexander Lukashenko that fraternity between the people of Belarus and Ukraine should lead Belarus to “refuse to be a vassal and an accomplice to Russia in the war against Ukraine,” the statement said. Belarus was one one of several axes used by Russia to launch attacks on Ukraine, with Belarus the point to move toward the capital Kyiv, a senior U.S. defense official has said. Share this -







U.N. Security Council to meet Sunday UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council will meet Sunday afternoon to hold a procedural vote on a request by Ukraine for an emergency session of the 193-member General Assembly in light of Russia’s invasion of its country. There are no vetoes on a procedural vote in the council, unlike on resolutions. A procedural vote requires approval from nine of the 15 council members. Council diplomats said approval is virtually certain, and the emergency meeting of the General Assembly is expected to be held on Monday. Ukraine’s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya tweeted Thursday that he asked General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid to prepare for an emergency meeting in the coming days. He said the meeting should be held under the so-called “Uniting for Peace” resolution, initiated by the United States and adopted in November 1950 to circumvent vetoes by the Soviet Union during the 1950-53 Korean War. The resolution gives the General Assembly the power to call emergency meetings to consider matters of international peace and security when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France. Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. Share this -

Latest SWIFT move against Russia follows 'the Iran model' The move to kick some of Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial system follows ""the Iran model"" since this is what was done to Tehran in 2018, a senior Biden administration official told reporters Saturday. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the banks that are already under U.S. and E.U. sanctions will be considered first, but ultimately E.U. officials will have the final say.

Germany readying to block airspace to Russia Germany is preparing to close its airspace to Russian aircraft, the latest European country to take that step since Russia attacked Ukraine this week. Germany's transportation minister, Volker Wissing, supports the move and has ordered preparations to be made, the transportation ministry tweeted. The United Kingdom, Romania and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are among the countries that have either closed or announced plans to close their airspace to Russian aircraft. Also Saturday, German airline Lufthansa said it will not use Russian airspace for the next seven days ""due to the current and emerging regulatory situation."" Flights that were in Russian airspace would leave, it said, and all flights to Russia will be suspended. Share this -







U.S. and key allies kick select Russian banks out of SWIFT payment system The U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and Canada on Saturday announced that select Russian banks would be removed from the SWIFT payment system, a move that Ukraine had pushed allies for in recent days. ""We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,"" the joint statement read. ""This past week, alongside our diplomatic efforts and collective work to defend our own borders and to assist the Ukrainian government and people in their fight, we, as well as our other allies and partners around the world, imposed severe measures on key Russian institutions and banks, and on the architects of this war, including"" Putin. ""As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies,"" the statement continued. ""We will implement these measures within the coming days."" The allies said they ""commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system,"" will impose ""restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions,"" and that they ""commit to acting against the people and entities who facilitate the war in Ukraine and the harmful activities of the Russian government."" On that last bit, the group of nations said they will take ""measures to limit the sale of citizenship — so-called golden passports — that let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems."" The nations said they will launch a task force this week to ensure the implementation of the sanctions and identify and freeze assets of sanctioned people and companies within each of their jurisdictions.
