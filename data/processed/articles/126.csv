Two nine-story and 16-story buildings in the Sviatoshynskyi district were severely damaged as a result of the air strikes.

Another 10-story residential building was attacked in the Podilskyi district; as is a private house in the Darnytskyi district.

Part of the Lukyanivska metro station was hit and its facade damaged, although the subway service is still running.

Ukraine’s state emergency services say two people they died as a result of the latest attacks on residential buildings, while another 35 were rescued.

On Monday, March 14, a residential complex was attacked in the Obolon district, 10 kilometers from the center of kyiv. The attack took place early in the morning as Russian troops approached the capital.

The city’s mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, has imposed a curfew 35 hours from 20:00 local time on Tuesday until Thursday at 07:00. It will be forbidden to move around the city without special permission, except to go to air-raid shelters.

“The capital is the heart of Ukraine, and it will be defended. kyiv, which is currently the symbol and forward operating base of Europe’s freedom and security, will not be abandoned by us,” Klitschko said.

“It is a difficult and dangerous moment. That is why I ask all the inhabitants of kyiv to prepare to stay at home for two days, or if the sirens sound, in the shelters.”

UK Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told the BBC Breakfast program that Russia’s “plan of attack is not working” but as a result “we are seeing more civilian areas attacked”.

“difficult” conversations

Russia and Ukraine continue this Tuesday with the negotiations. Ukraine said on Monday that it had started “difficult” talks on a ceasefire, immediate troop withdrawal and security guarantees.

Previous rounds focused mainly on ceasefires to bring aid to towns and cities besieged by Russian forces and evacuate civilians.

But those truces have so far failed.

In a video published by various Ukrainian media, adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Oleksiy Arestovich, said he believes Russia is likely to run out of resources to attack its neighbor in May.

Arestovich said the exact timing would depend on the amount of resources the Kremlin was willing to commit to the invasion.

“I think that by May, early May at the latest, we should have a peace agreement, maybe much sooner, we’ll see, I’m talking about the latest possible dates,” Arestovich said.

An entirely different scenario would be if Russia sends in new recruits after a month of training, he said.

Meanwhile, the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia are traveling by train to kyiv and are expected to enter the city for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. They have already crossed the border between Poland and Ukraine.

They travel as representatives of the European Union and will present the details of a concrete support package for Ukrainesaid Michal Dworczyk, head of the Polish prime minister’s office.

The EU has introduced its fourth set of sanctions against Russia, aimed at crippling its ability to finance the invasion. The UK has also announced new sanctions against Russian vodka and luxury goods.

natural defense

In a briefing in their war room on Monday, the two Ukrainian generals responsible for kyiv’s defense explained to BBC journalist Jeremy Bowen how their forces were struggling to keep Russian artillery out of range of the city.

In recent days, kyiv has felt the war more acutely, due to Russia’s destructive firepower. However, the city center and many of its sprawling suburbs have yet to be attacked.

Generals responsible for kyiv’s defense said they were fighting hard to keep Russian artillery out of range, but accepted the capital was vulnerable to missiles.

However, the city’s topography and terrain are on their side, Gen. Andriy Kryschenko said. The city is large and extensive. It is divided by rivers, not only by the Dnieper that divides kyiv in two, but also by its tributaries.

BBC One of the Ukrainian generals tracks Russia’s military movement towards kyiv on a large interactive screen at the army base.

“It’s hard to defend on one side, since it’s so big,” he said. “But on the other hand, this is an advantage. The rivers, the bridges are in the accesses to the city. Our troops are building defenses and fortifications.

“Around the city there are many small rivers that flow into the Dnieper and there are many peat bogs, which means the area is not suitable for large-scale troop movements.”

More evacuations

The evacuation corridors of four cities in the northeastern region of Sumy in Ukraine will be ready today, according to a local official.

According to a Telegram post by Dmytro Zhyvytsky, head of the Sumy regional administration, the evacuation routes of the cities of Sumy, Konotop, Trostianets and Lebedyn They will be open between 09:00 and 21:00 local time.

Sumy, near the Russian border, has been under heavy shelling with reports of power and water cuts since Russia invaded.

But many other cities remain under fire from Russian troops and airstrikes.

Russian bombardment of some areas in Ukraine has been so intense that towns and cities are being forced to bury dozens of civilian victims, without any ceremony, in mass graves.

LONDON — Three European leaders staged a defiant show of support for Ukraine on Tuesday, traveling to its besieged capital, Kyiv, even as a relentless Russian artillery bombardment left apartment towers in the city ablaze, forcing terrified residents to flee into the street with only the clothes on their backs.

The dramatic visit by the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, which unfolded in tight secrecy as they crossed the Ukrainian border by train after dawn, was a strikingly personal gesture. But it caught other European leaders off guard, angering some and baring uncomfortable divisions in how best to demonstrate Western solidarity with Ukraine.

It also came as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia disparaged the second consecutive day of negotiations with Ukraine, undercutting the faint glimmers of hope raised from talks the day before that both sides were looking for a way to halt the war.

The Kremlin slapped retaliatory sanctions on President Biden and other senior American officials. Mr. Biden announced his own plans to travel to Europe next week to showcase the unity of the NATO alliance in the face of Russian aggression.

A spokesman for Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the three visitors were “de facto” representing the European Union in Ukraine. In Brussels, however, officials said the trio did not have the E.U.’s blessing, and some European diplomats complained that the trip was too risky, given the Russian forces encircling Kyiv.

Others said they admired the audacity of the group, which also included Prime Minister Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic and Prime Minister Janez Jansa of Slovenia, casting it as a powerful symbol of the backing for Ukraine among countries on Europe’s eastern flank, where the specter of Russian aggression looms larger than in Paris or London.

Still, for all the symbolism of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine’s leaders under the threat of Russia’s rockets, Ukraine was facing the devastating barrage largely on its own. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, imposed a 35-hour curfew, starting on Tuesday evening, which suggested the capital was entering an even more difficult phase of its grinding struggle to hold off Russian troops and tanks.

“This is their attempt to annihilate the Ukrainian people,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an emotional video address to the Canadian Parliament, repeating his plea for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. “It is an attempt to destroy our future, our nation, our character.”

Mr. Zelensky asked the lawmakers to imagine if the CN Tower in Toronto were shelled like the towers in Kyiv. His language has become more pointed, even scolding, with each speech to a Western audience, revealing his frustration with leaders who have resisted more direct military involvement out of fear that it would entangle them in a wider conflict with Russia.

The Ukrainian leader, who has become a hero to many in the West, is scheduled to speak via video to Congress on Wednesday, where he is expected to amplify his pleas for more help and increase the pressure on the United States and its allies.

Mr. Biden is planning to announce $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday, according to White House officials. The administration last week announced $200 million in security assistance for Ukraine and has made available a total of $2 billion in such funding.

On Tuesday evening, the Polish state broadcaster carried video of the Czech, Slovene and Polish leaders meeting Mr. Zelensky and other officials across a long table, with Ukraine’s blue-and-yellow flag behind them.

The Prime Ministers of 🇵🇱 @MorawieckiM, 🇸🇮 @JJansaSDS and 🇨🇿 @P_Fiala arrived on the behalf of @EUCouncil to #Kyiv today. The courage of true friends of 🇺🇦! Discussing support of #Ukraine and strengthening sanctions against the Russian aggression. — Denys Shmyhal (@Denys_Shmyhal) March 15, 2022

“They are here to support us,” Mr. Zelensky said at a news briefing after the meeting, which also was shown on Ukrainian television. “It is a great, courageous, right, friendly step. I am confident that with such friends, such countries and neighbors and partners, we can really win.”

A photograph posted earlier on Mr. Morawiecki’s Twitter account showed the three men poring over a map, seated in what appeared to be a train carriage en route to the Ukrainian capital.

“It is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made,” Mr. Morawiecki said in the Twitter post. “It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance.”

The White House announced that Mr. Biden would fly to Brussels for an extraordinary summit meeting of NATO on March 24. That may result in further economic and military aid for Ukraine but will likely fall short of Mr. Zelensky’s request for a no-fly zone. Administration officials declined to say whether Mr. Biden planned to meet with the Ukrainian president, whom he has called a hero. But they said Mr. Biden may go on to somewhere in Eastern Europe to meet with refugees streaming out of Ukraine.

The river of people fleeing the war continued unabated on Tuesday, as Russia claimed to have seized control of the strategic Kherson region in the south. Russian forces kept up their pounding of civilian targets in Kyiv, where Ukrainian troops were fortifying intersections with sandbags, tires, and iron spikes.

A pre-dawn rain of rockets on Kyiv shattered windows, left craters in buildings, and turned a 16-floor apartment house into a towering inferno. The fire spread quickly after a missile struck the building, blowing a jagged hole at its entrance. Firefighters rescued residents from windows by ladder through billowing smoke. By midafternoon, they had carried out two bodies encased in black bags.

“I came out with nothing,” said Mykola Fedkiv, 85, a retired geologist. “I left everything, my telephone, my medicines, everything.”

When the missile struck, Mr. Fedkiv fled his 12th-floor apartment and made his way down the stairs. He climbed through the blasted entrance hall and found himself in the bomb crater. People pulled him out by his arms. He stood outside for hours, hoping to re-enter his apartment to collect personal documents. Asked where he planned to stay the night, he responded, “God knows.”

Conditions were even more desperate in the coastal city of Mariupol, which has been pummeled by Russian forces in a two-week siege that has left some residents crushed in the rubble and many others dying in a winter freeze with no heat, food, or clean water. Officials can no longer account for the number of dead and missing.

Officially, 2,400 civilians killed in Mariupol have been identified, but Pyotr Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city government, said he believed the toll was far higher, possibly as many as 20,000. Ukrainian estimates of the number of people trapped have ranged from 200,000 to 400,000.

Mr. Andryushchenko said 2,000 vehicles had managed to escape Mariupol on Tuesday and that another 2,000 were packed and ready to leave. Officials told civilians to “delete all messages and photos from phones” in case Russian soldiers searched them for signs of support for Ukrainian forces.

The perils of reporting accurate information from Ukraine’s combat zones were further underscored Tuesday with news that a Fox News cameraman and a Ukrainian colleague had been killed in an attack on Monday outside Kyiv — raising to at least three the number of journalist fatalities in Ukraine in the past few days.

In Kherson, a southern city under Russian occupation, the mayor said that members of Russia’s national guard were rounding up activists who opposed Russia’s presence, possibly trying to recruit them through coercion.

“They’re all in the city, in the jail,” the mayor, Igor Kolykhaev, wrote in several text messages, referring to the activists. Russian troops, he said, “collect them, hold them, work them over and release them.”

Kherson was the first major city to fall to Russian forces after the Feb. 24 start of the invasion. Although Kremlin officials had predicted that the Ukrainian people would welcome their “liberation” by Russian troops, residents of Kherson have been defiant, regularly gathering in the central square to protest the Russian presence, even when Russian troops fire into the air to disperse them.

Russia claimed to have captured the entire Kherson region, potentially strengthening its ability to push west toward the strategic port cities of Mykolaiv and Odessa. A senior Ukrainian military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that Russian forces were in control of much of the Kherson region, but said Ukrainian forces were attacking their positions and inflicting losses.

Negotiations via video link between Russia and Ukraine continued for a second day on Tuesday, though Mr. Putin doused prospects of any imminent breakthrough. In a phone call with the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, Mr. Putin complained that “Kyiv is not demonstrating a serious attitude toward finding mutually acceptable solutions,” according to the Kremlin.

Mr. Putin also continued to struggle in the information battle with Ukraine. On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron of France said his country could offer diplomatic “protection” to a Russian state television employee who was detained and fined over an on-air antiwar protest on Monday.

The employee, Marina Ovsyannikova, burst onto the live broadcast of Russia’s most-watched news program on Monday evening, yelling, “Stop the war!” and holding a sign that read, “They’re lying to you here.”

Russia also faced further isolation from Britain, which imposed sanctions on more than 370 people it labeled oligarchs, political allies of, or propagandists for Mr. Putin. Among those blacklisted: Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president of Russia; Mikhail Mishustin, the current prime minister; and Mikhail Fridman, the billionaire founder of Alfa Bank, one of the country’s largest private banks.

Russia, for its part, said it had sanctioned 13 Americans including Mr. Biden, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III in response to American sanctions against Mr. Putin and other officials. Also on its list was Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, and Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.

Mr. Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, shrugged off the news, suggesting in jest that the Kremlin’s announcement might have missed its intended mark. The president, Ms. Psaki said, is a “junior, so they might have sanctioned his dad by mistake.”

Still, a narrow diplomatic channel remains open, with more talks between the two sides planned Tuesday despite the failures of diplomacy so far. Meanwhile, leaders of three European Union countries planned a bold visit to Kyiv amid the shelling.

8:30 p.m.- Official says Russian troops take 500 hostage

Russian troops seized a hospital in Mariupol and took about 500 people hostage during another assault on the southern port city late Tuesday, regional leader Pavlo Kyrylenko said.

Russians troops drove 400 people from neighboring houses into Regional Intensive Care Hospital, Kyrylenko said on the messaging app Telegram. About 100 doctors and patients also are believed to be inside, he said.

The troops are using those inside the hospital as human shields and are not allowing anyone to leave, he said.

“It’s impossible to leave the hospital, they are shooting hard,” Kyrylenko said.

Kyrylenko said the main building of the hospital has been heavily damaged by shelling, but medical staff are continuing to treat patients in makeshift wards set up in the basement.

He called on the world to respond to these “gross violations of the norms and customs of war, these egregious crimes against humanity.”

The Ukrainian army’s General Staff says Russian troops are trying to block off the city from the western and eastern outskirts of the city. “There are significant losses,” it said in a Facebook post.

6:45 p.m.- Biden to announce $1B in military aid for Ukraine

According to European diplomats, Ukrainian officials plan to present the U.S. with a list of needed military equipment, The New York Times reported ahead of President Volodymyr Zelensky addressing Congress on Wednesday.

The diplomats, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Times that the list does not replace Ukraine's request for MIG fighter planes but offers the U.S. other options the Biden administration might be more willing to give.

The request includes some equipment the U.S. has already provided, like antiaircraft Stinger missiles and antitank Javelin missiles. Other items are new additions, like armed drones and communication jamming equipment.

On Tuesday, Biden signed the omnibus budget bill which allocated roughly $13.6 billion for Ukraine assistance. Biden is expected to announce more than $1 billion in new military aid from the omnibus budget bill to the Ukraine government, The Wall Street Journal reported.

5:35 p.m. - US set to provide nearly $200M more humanitarian aid to support Ukrainian refugees

Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Tuesday that the United States will provide an additional $186 million in humanitarian aid to support internally displaced persons and the more than three million refugees displaced by Russia's ""premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified war"" in Ukraine.

Noting the U.S. government is ""largest single-country donor of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine,"" Blinken said their funding since Russia began its invasion in Ukraine amounts to nearly $644 million.

This latest funding will ""further support for humanitarian organizations responding to the crisis and complement the generosity of the neighboring countries that are welcoming and supporting refugees.""

4:35 p.m. - 20K people fled besieged city of Mariupol

A senior Ukrainian official says about 20,000 people have managed to leave the besieged port city of Mariupol.

Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy head of office of Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the evacuees left Mariupol in private vehicles via a humanitarian corridor on Tuesday.

He said that 570 of some 4,000 vehicles that left the city have reached the city of Zaporizhzhia some 260 kilometers (160 miles) northwest while others will spend the night in various towns along the way.

Mariupol, a strategic port city of 430,000 on the Sea of Azov, has been besieged by Russian troops for more than 10 days, facing heavy shelling that has killed more than 2,300 people and left residents struggling for food, water, heat and medicine.

""Our city is totally destroyed. Totally.""

2:00 p.m. - Russian state TV employee fined for protesting war on live news program

An employee of Russian state television who interrupted a live news program by protesting the war in Ukraine was ordered to pay a fine by a Russian court Tuesday.

Marina Ovsyannikova, an employee of the Russian Channel 1, walked into the studio during Monday’s evening news show with a poster saying “no war” and “Russians against the war.”

In a video recorded before her action, Ovsyannikova said that her father is Ukrainian and her mother Russian. She urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vladimir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.”

Ovsyannikova spent the night in police custody, and Moscow’s Ostankino District Court on Tuesday ordered Ovsyannikova to pay a fine of 30,000 rubles (about $270) on charges of organizing unsanctioned actions for her call to take part in demonstrations against the war.

1:50 p.m. - Russia withdraws from Europe’s leading human rights org

The Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow is withdrawing from the Council of Europe.

The ministry said it handed a formal notice about Russia’s decision to leave the continent’s leading human rights organization to the Council of Europe’s Secretary General Marija Pejčinović Burić on Tuesday.

It said the move followed the Council of Europe’s decision to suspend Russia’s membership that was taken on Feb. 25.

The ministry charged that the Council of Europe has become an instrument of exerting pressure on Russia and alleged that it has been heavily influenced by NATO and the European Union. It said in a statement that its withdrawal from the Council of Europe wouldn’t impact human rights and freedoms in the country, which officials said are safeguarded by the Russian constitution.

Russia’s invasion has sparked widespread allegations of war crimes, as hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been killed and numerous residential areas have been targeted by Russian troops.

1:15 p.m. - Biden to visit Europe next week for meeting on Ukraine

President Biden will visit NATO’s headquarters in Brussels next week for face-to-face talks with European leaders, White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced.

The president will attend a meeting on Ukraine with NATO and European Union leaders on Thursday, March 24.

“He will join an extraordinary NATO summit on March 24 to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine, as well as to reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies,” Psaki said at a press briefing.

Biden's trip will follow Vice President Kamala Harris' visit to the eastern flank NATO countries of Poland and Romania last week.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he had convened the summit for next week of the military organization’s 30 leaders to discuss Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Stoltenberg said the summit will be led by Biden and “will address the consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, our strong support for Ukraine, and further strengthening NATO’s deterrence and defense in response to a new reality for our security.”

Stoltenberg said in a statement that “at this critical time, North America and Europe must continue to stand together in NATO.”

NATO has been bolstering its eastern flank with troops and equipment to deter Russia from invading any of its members. NATO refuses to deploy troops to Ukraine as it is concerned about sparking a wider war in Europe.

The White House's announcement of Biden's visit to Brussels came on the same day that leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia set out for Kyiv by train despite the security risks to show their support for Ukraine. It was a visit EU officials said was not sanctioned by other members of the 27-nation bloc.

12 p.m. - Fox News cameraman killed in Ukraine

Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, was killed outside of Kyiv on Monday in an attack that also injured Fox News reporter Benjamin Hall.

Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott confirmed Zakrzewski’s death in a memo to employees, saying, “His passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched.”

Pierre was with Benjamin Hall yesterday newsgathering when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire.”

Zakrzewski was a war zone photographer who covered stories for Fox for years, including conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. He had been working in Ukraine since February.

She said it’s a “heartbreaking day for Fox News Media and for all journalists risking their lives to deliver the news.”

11:30 a.m. - Russia sanctions Biden, other top US officials

The Russian Foreign Ministry says that U.S. President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and other top Biden administration officials have been put on the Russian sanctions list.

The ministry said in Tuesday’s statement that the measure is a response to the U.S. sanctions against the Russian leadership.

At the same time, it noted that Russia may not renounce official contacts with the U.S. officials targeted by the sanctions if such contacts are in the country’s national interests.

11:15 a.m. - Zelenskyy addresses Canada's Parliament

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered a speech to Canada's Parliament.

The virtual address came as Zelenskyy has been pleading for more help from the international community, with Russia escalating its bombardments on Ukrainian cities during the third week of the invasion and moving closer to the center of Kyiv.

Zelenskyy asked Canadians to imagine bombs landing in their communities as he told the Canadian Parliament that his people want to live.

Among those attending the speech in Ottawa was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who invited Zelenskyy to speak to Parliament during a trip to Europe this month.

Zelenskyy urged Trudeau and Canadian lawmakers to help enact a no-fly zone over the Ukraine and called for greater economic pressure on Russia.

Canada’s support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity has not wavered. And it never will. Tune in as I speak about Canada’s commitment – and as President @ZelenskyyUa addresses Parliament and delivers his message directly to Canadians: https://t.co/ZMgGzrTTzU — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) March 15, 2022

“Justin, can you imagine you and your children hearing all these severe explosions, the bombing of the airport, the bombing of the Ottawa airport,” Zelenskyy said. “Cruise missiles are falling down and your children are asking you, ‘What happened?’”

Speaking by video from Ukraine to a packed Canadian House of Commons chamber, Zelenskyy said the Russian war is designed to annihilate Ukraine and subjugate its people.

Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Monday that Zelenskyy will address the U.S. Congress at 9 a.m. ET Wednesday in an event that will be livestreamed for the public.

The speeches in the U.S. and Canada follow an address Zelenskyy delivered last week to the U.K. Parliament.

10:30 a.m. - Zelenskyy says Ukraine realizes it ‘won’t be able to join’ NATO

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the country realizes that it can’t join NATO.

Speaking Tuesday to representatives of the U.K.-led Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), Zelenskyy said that “we heard for years about the allegedly open doors” of NATO, but “we have already heard that we won’t be able to join.”

He added that “it’s the truth we must recognize, and I’m glad that our people are starting to realize that and count on themselves and our partners who are helping us.”

The JEF may consist of Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway.

Zelenskyy again urged Western allies to provide Ukraine with warplanes.

Fighting for Kyiv has intensified, with artillery fire echoing through the city and Russia launching a flurry of strikes that early Tuesday blew out windows and ignited a huge fire in an apartment in western Kyiv. At least one person was killed as rescue efforts continued.

Large explosions thundered across the capital before dawn from what Ukrainian authorities said were artillery strikes, as Russia’s assault on the city appeared to become more systematic. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said barrages hit four multi-story buildings in the city and caused dozens of deaths.

One projectile slammed into a 15-story apartment building, sparking a huge fire and frantic rescue effort. At least one person was killed, officials said.

“Ukraine is on fire,” the U.N. chief, Antonio Guterres, warned on Twitter. “The impact on civilians is reaching terrifying proportions.”

Explosions around the city caused significant structural damage, with shockwaves from a blast tearing through the entrance of a downtown subway station that has been used as a bomb shelter and another igniting a fire in Kyiv's northern Podilsky district.

The day before, Russian rockets destroyed a television tower in the western city of Rivne, where authorities said the death toll had risen to 19. At least four people were killed and more wounded when Russian strikes on Kyiv slammed into Ukraine’s largest aircraft factory and a nine-story apartment building.

Russian forces also unleashed scores of new artillery strikes on downtown Kharkiv in the country's east. Thousands were trying to flee on evacuation trains amid the chaos and destruction.

After days of relentless Russian shelling on encircled Mariupol, 150 cars carrying hundreds of civilians managed to escape the besieged city. But hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in without heat, food or clean water as Russia renewed its offensive on Mariupol.

9:00 a.m. - Zelenskyy pleads for help as Ukrainian military uses up Western weapons

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told northern European leaders that they could “help yourself by helping us,” as he appealed for more weapons to counter Russia’s invasion of his country.

Zelenskyy, speaking to leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force via videolink Tuesday, said the Ukrainian military is rapidly using up weapons and other hardware that western nations have shipped to his country.

He also appealed for a full trade embargo on Russia, saying sanctions have not been enough to counter the Russian advance.

“We have to acknowledge Russia as a rogue state and there has to be a trade embargo with Russia,” Zelenskyy said. “This is something that we need and you need as well, just like the rest of the world, to make sure there is peace in Europe and Ukraine.”

Zelenskyy also repeated his frustration with NATO over its refusal to implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine as he addressed JEF leaders meeting Tuesday in London.

A flurry of diplomatic activity drew in leaders around the world. The leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia were traveling Tuesday to Kyiv on an EU mission of solidarity.

8:00 a.m. - Ukrainian refugees top 3 million

The International Organization for Migration says more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded last month.

The new milestone also indicated that some 157,000 third-country nationals — people who aren’t Ukrainian — were part of the outflow in what U.N. officials have called the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

IOM spokesman Paul Dillon said at a U.N. news briefing in Geneva on Tuesday that the totals were compiled from figures provided by national authorities.

The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, which provides a more detailed count than the IOM though based on similar data, has reported that more than 1.8 million of the refugees were in Poland.

7:00 a.m. - China says it's 'impartial' on Ukraine, denies aiding Russia

China insists that its stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is “impartial and constructive.”

The Chinese government is also repeating its accusations that the U.S. is spreading misinformation over reports Beijing has responded positively to a Russian request for military supplies.

Speaking to reporters at a daily briefing Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian accused the U.S. of “immoral and irresponsible” conduct by spreading misinformation.

“What the U.S. should do is to deeply reflect on the role it has played in the development and evolving of the Ukraine crisis and do something practical to ease the tension in Ukraine,” he said, in a nod to China’s contention that Russia was provoked by NATO’s expansion and threats to its security.

China has refused to criticize Russia over its invasion and the ensuing war, or even to refer to the conflict as such. In keeping with Russian preferences, Zhao referred to the war as the “Ukraine issue.” Beijing also opposes sanctions on the Russian economy.

In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says ""in one important sense, Putin has already failed"".

The prime minister says the Russian president ""did not understand what he would encounter when he sent his troops in to Ukraine"" and the ""strength of their resistance"".

He accused Putin of ""committing a series of war crimes"" on a level which has not been since in Europe ""since the Third Reich, not since the Second World War"".

Johnson says the UK wants to do more and feels ""the agony of Ukrainians"".

""Putin needs to realise that he cannot now succeed,"" he says.

""He won't be able to crush and conquer Ukraine, because they've shown fundamentally that they have an indomitable spirit. So... he's got to withdraw. He's got to close this thing down. He's got to take back his his tanks and his armour.

""And there's got to be as a solution that respects the will of the Ukrainian people. And that's what the UK will support.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60746557
