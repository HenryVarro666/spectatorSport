""I'm here to show support to my friends and family who are in Ukraine,"" said one person while standing outside the Russian Embassy.

The ""Ottawa Stands with Ukraine Rally and March"" was one of several events held in Ottawa this weekend to denounce Russia's invasion of Ukraine last Thursday.

""The Ukrainian people will never back down and they will defeat this army day-by-day,"" Organizer Cassian Soltykevych told the crowd. ""They will never give up.""

The rally started in front of the Russian Embassy with speeches and the singing of the Ukrainian national anthem, before the crowd marched to Ottawa City Hall waiving the Ukrainian flag and carrying signs saying ""Hands Off Ukraine"", ""Glory to Heroes"" and ""Long Live Ukraine.""

At City Hall, the crowd chanted, ""No Fly Zone over Ukraine"", ""Stop Putin, Stop the War"", and ""We Stand with Ukraine.""

The rally ended with the singing of the Ukrainian anthem.

""I have family in Kyiv as we speak under bomb attack and actually sleeping a fourth night in bombing shelters without electricity or access to the internet,"" said Jane Rubina, who has family in Ukraine.

Rubina, who has lived in Ottawa for 25 years, says her family has been sending updates all week.

""The air isn't breathable around where they are. Millions of Ukrainians are forced to leave their homes,"" Rubina said, reading a message from family members.

Margaret Jenkins expressed anger with the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and wants Canada to help Ukraine.

""I think it’s terrible and atrocious what Putin led Russia is doing to Ukraine,"" Jenkins said.

""I think we should all stand up and protect civilians and by saying this is completely unacceptable .... Canada needs to be doing everything in its power to stop the war against Ukraine.""

Interim Conservative leader Candice Bergen was one of several people who addressed the crowd outside the Russian Embassy.

Interim Conservative Leader Candice Bergen addressed the crowd, calling the attack on Ukraine “shocking”, but her words were drowned out by a chorus of shouts and boos. Those in the crowd ranged from new immigrants to those whose families came from Ukraine generations ago. Even as Canada and other western allies have announced sanctions, many in Ottawa say they fear for the safety of family and friends at home, especially those from the capital city Kyiv, as Russian troops draw closer. Some in the crowd have lived in Kyiv recently and say they know of people who have retreated to shelter underground, even root cellars. Armed civilians are helping to defend Kyiv, according to reports. Konstantin Avramets and Maryna Skobal say they have friends who are holding weapons in the streets of Kyiv.

Now they threaten the world with nuclear weapons. Canada is also in danger,” he said. “Canada is part of NATO. We understand that no one is going to participate in a war at this moment. But we trust that Canada can apply some pressure.” Added Skobal: “My goal for being here is to ensure that people do listen, that people do research and people believe only trustworthy sources.” Vasyl Myrutenko has lived in Canada for 10 years. He said his 70-year-old mother lives in a suburb of Kyiv. She has mobility problems, lives on the eighth floor of an apartment building and has no family nearby, except for a niece, he said.

Large crowds gathered in downtown Toronto on Sunday for a “Mega March” in support of Ukraine, and condemnation of Russia’s attack on the country.

Crowds carrying Ukraine flags and anti-Vladimir Putin signs gathered at Yonge and Dundas Square, and marched towards Nathan Phillips Square in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.

Toronto police temporarily closed a portion of Yonge Street and Dundas Street West to allow the demonstrators to march.

However, in an update Sunday afternoon, Toronto police said Yonge Street and Dundas Street West had both reopened. Bay Street remained closed.

In a post on Facebook, the organization said Ukraine is under a “relentless attack from Russia.”

“We cry out to everyone who cares about democracy and freedom to come out in support and in solidarity with Ukraine,” the post reads.

Peter Schturyn, President of the Ukrainian-Canadian Congress, said the goal of the march is to “rally all Canadian Ukrainians, along with the Toronto community (to) stand together (and) stand for our brothers and sisters in Ukraine.”

“We’re out here wanting Russia to stop its useless, senseless, horrific war with a nation that wants nothing but peace,” he said.

Schturyn said the demonstrations in Toronto are going to continue “until every inch of Ukrainian territory is back in Ukrainian hands.”

“They’re fighting until the very end, and so are we,” he said.

Schturyn said the “tide of the war is changing.”

“The pendulum is swinging back,” he said. “Ukrainians are fighting harder than ever before.”

He said the “whole country is up in arms, standing shoulder-to-shoulder.”

“And they’re going to win.”

Schturyn said what Ukraine needs immediately is a no-fly zone to be declared over its airspace.

“It’s not unprecedented, the West has done that for other countries,” he said. “They’ve done if for Libya, they’ve done it in former Yugoslavia. They’ve done it once for Israel.”

Ola Holyk is an elementary school ​teacher in Mississauga. She and several of her students attended the march on Sunday.

“We all believe in peace, we all feel that Ukraine is part of our heritage, it’s where our grandparents came from, it’s where our parents came from, and we feel it’s really important to be here to stand with Ukraine and to stop the aggression that Russia is bringing on to Ukraine.”

She said she felt she needed to stand up for what she believes in.

“And peace is what we believe ​in. And peace is at the forefront of all of this,” she said.

“We need to teach our children kindness and we need to teach our children that when it comes to things like this — this is wrong — and through the power of being together and uniting together we are a stronger force.”

Speaking at Nathan Phillips Square, Consulate General of Ukraine in Toronto Oleksander Shevchenko, said it is difficult to watch the invasion of Ukraine from afar.

“But what warms my heart is what Canada is doing to support Ukraine, to support Ukrainian people and (the) Ukrainian military in this time of hardships,” he said.

Shevchenko thanked Toronto Mayor John Tory and Ontario Premier Doug Ford, and the rest of Canada for the “great support” that has been shown.

“It’s very important to know that Canada is ready to provide assistance,” he said.

Shevchenko called on the Canadian government to support and accommodate any Ukrainian refugees who seek asylum in Canada.

Those protesting against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have gathered in Toronto since Thursday, holding Ukrainian flags and singing the national anthem.

Earlier on Sunday, the federal government announced it has closed Canada’s airspace to all Russian airlines.

The federal government also announced it will be sending an additional $25 million worth of protective gear to Ukraine.

The move comes after Ottawa imposed sanctions on a number of Russian individuals and entities, including on Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Canada has also said it will match all donations to the Red Cross’s Ukraine Humanitarian Crisis Appeal up to $10 million.

The Ontario government has announced it will be donating $300,000 in humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

The money will be donated to the Canada-Ukraine Foundation and used to “support humanitarian purposes” including “providing medical aid, emergency shelter and food security” in Ukraine.

The province said it will also be “ready to assist” anyone fleeing the country who may require settlement services.

On Thursday, the Ukraine flag was raised at Toronto City Hall in solidarity with the Ukrainian people.

In a video posted to Twitter Thursday afternoon, Toronto Mayor John Tory, said if there was “unprovoked military action taken against one of our provinces,” Canada would “expect the rest of the world to line up and support us.”

“That’s why I’m here as mayor of Toronto to express my solidarity with Ukraine,” he said.

“And also at the same time to raise this flag to show solidarity with our wonderful Ukrainian community — our Ukrainian Canadian community here in the city of Toronto.”

Tory attended the march on Sunday.

In a tweet, the mayor said Toronto “stands in firm solidarity with Ukraine and the local Ukrainian-Canadian community.

Also in attendance was Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.

While one Freedom Convoy fell apart, a few dozen truckers respectfully took to the streets of Chicago over something that matters: Supporting Ukrainians and their struggle against Russian invasion.

First, the good news: There are truckers in this country who recognize an actual threat to freedom and democracy when they see it. At least 100 semis took to Grant Park in Chicago to demand more help from the U.S. to Ukraine. The protest stretched for three miles as truckers and fellow supporters made their way to the park, CBS Chicago reports.

Drivers and organizers are demanding the U.S. do more than just place sanctions on Russia.

Cabs of semis lined Columbus Drive from Ida B. Wells Drive to Roosevelt Road on Saturday. They headed three miles down the Kennedy Expressway in the southbound lanes toward their destination in Grant Park – where organizers of the Freedom Convoy said the United States has an obligation to help Ukraine. We want from the U.S. government to support Ukraine – to support Ukraine, like they have to support Ukraine,” said organizer Stefan Nojek. “They feel completely left behind and abandoned by what is happening politically by our leaders here in the West,” said Ros Saciuk, president of the Suburban Council of Ukrainian Voters – based in Palatine.﻿

The protest allowed for thru traffic and ended after a few hours because, you know, this is serious and directed political action and not a fucking block party.

Now, the also good news: A trucker convoy that left Los Angeles Friday arrived in Las Vegas Saturday with only five semis. This is the second American convoy to fizzle out. The disappointing turn out meant organizers disbanded the convoy before they even made it out of the American west. Organizers encouraged participants to join any of the seemingly dozen or so similar protests doing similar gimmicks right now, from the New York Times:

“We are making the decision to send any truckers planned to meet at our routes to start heading to D.C. for the event on the National Mall, or to join the convoys named above as they are about to merge into one,” the organizers wrote. The decision drew mixed reactions. “I spent days trying to coordinate a rally in support of our truckers. I have three tiny kids and work a full-time job and stretched myself thin then made myself look so stupid. I’m pretty hurt by all this,” one person commented on the post.﻿

There are so, so many reasons a U.S. Freedom Convoy won’t work, but the complete lack of cohesion in planning a Convoy is number one. While the Ottawa convoy seemed like a spontaneous grassroots movement, it was actually planned and propelled by people with years of experience in organizing in the far right arena of Canadian politics. It seems American organizers jumped in assuming the entire thing would be a wild success, but that’s just not been the case so far.

The Ottawa Freedom Convoy was also helped by the Trans-Canadian Highway. While America has a sprawling Interstate system, Canada has two main east-west highways that thread through every major city in the country, so it was far easier for truckers and supporters to join up and build momentum. And while Canada, like the U.S., never had a national shutdown, Canadian providences were far more strict with COVID-19 health measures and Canadians were far more likely to follow those measures than in America. It’s a little more difficult to get a protest going when your supporters mainly live in U.S. states that barely changed during the pandemic, or let its population ignore health measures entirely.

Plus I don’t think one of the ways to get Americans on your side is to mess with the already fragile supply chain. Empty shelves tend to make people lose their shit. And D.C. is now way more prepared for this sort of thing following Jan. 6: There will already be 700 National Guard troops protecting the Capitol building and surrounding streets have been barricaded and blocked since last week.



Throw in the fact that it’s just easier to take time away from your job when your healthcare isn’t tied to it, and you’ve got a recipe for a pretty disappointing showing for American trucker convoys.

The People’s Convoy, currently traveling through the Great Plains with plans to reach D.C by March 5 — four days after President Biden’s State Of The Union address — seems to have gathered a larger convoy, but there aren’t any reliable reports on just how large. Honestly, with how quickly things are developing in Ukraine, by the time they arrive, I have a hard time imagining anyone will give a shit.",https://jalopnik.com/truckers-protest-in-support-of-ukraine-as-second-americ-1848601245
