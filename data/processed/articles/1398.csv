For many ordinary Serbs, the memory of NATO's bombing of strategic targets in Serbia to bring an end to the Balkan wars of the 1990s is still all too fresh, an action that was strongly opposed by Russia at the U.N. Security Council.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, facing an election next month in which he needs to retain the support of Russian-leaning citizens, has in recent days also repeatedly pointed to Moscow's long-time backing in the United Nations where it has refused to recognise the independence of Serbia's former breakaway province of Kosovo.

Some 4,000 people joined the march after gathering in front of a monument of Russian Tsar Nicholas II in central Belgrade, where they played Russian and Serbian anthems and hailed the two countries as brethren nations.

""This is about saving mankind,"" said an elderly man carrying a Russian flag. ""This is a struggle between good and bad, and we know, thank God, that Mother Russia will win.""

A younger man wearing a cap with a red star symbol said he came to support Russia in everything it does.

""This is the only right thing to do,"" he said.

Among the protesters were also local members of Russia's ""Night Wolves"" motorcycle club, known to have close ties to Putin and with a history of fighting in Ukraine on the side of pro-Russian separatists during the 2014 Crimea crisis and war over the Donbass region.

The political views of many in Serbia are influenced by tabloids close to Vucic, which have echoed Moscow's view of the war in Ukraine, with one carrying the headline 'Ukraine attacked Russia!' on the first day of the invasion.

But there is also support for Ukraine, with dozens protesting Russia's invasion in front of its embassy earlier this week and more events expected over the weekend.

Russia calls its actions a 'special operation' designed not to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

Many protesters carried placards with the letter Z on them - the symbol that has been seen on Russian tanks in Ukraine.

Earlier on Friday, Vucic told Ukraine's ambassador in Serbia that Belgrade respects international law and the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and that it stands ready to provide humanitarian aid and accept refugees.

Serbia, which relies on Moscow for its energy needs, also joined the U.N. General Assembly's condemnation of Russia's attack but has declined to introduce sanctions against Moscow.

Vucic has said the country is coming under intense pressure to harmonise its foreign policy with that of the European Union, which it aims to join. read more

The country's flag carrier Air Serbia continues to fly between Belgrade and Moscow, even adding capacity as the EU and Russia issued tit-for-tat airspace bans.

Serbian demonstrators chanted pro-Russia slogans as they marched through central Belgrade, lighting road flares and waving Russian flags.

A Serbian far-right group held a rally in the capital, Belgrade, in support of Russian people.

The People’s Patrols started out as a group hostile to migrants and refugees crossing Serbia en route to Europe, claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin is fighting a ''Nazi and pro-Western government.''

The rally had a large number of protesters from several right-wing groups.

The crowd chanted messages of support for Russia.

Damnjan Knezevic, of the People's Patrol, and Mladen Obradovic, of Obraz, addressed demonstrators from a stage.

They said if Serbia imposes sanctions on Russia after elections next month, twice as many people will take to the streets.

""Russia, no matter how much they attack us and offer us light, is all a drop in the ocean for one Slavic soul. There is no Serb who will impose sanctions on Russia and Belarus,'' said Knezevic.

Obradovic said: ""Russia is freeing the whole world from NATO threats"" and that today ""Putin has shown who is the strongest and bravest statesman in the world.”

Russia's influence in Serbia

Russia effectively controls the Balkan country's oil and gas industry and wields veto power at the United Nations that has helped block formal recognition of Serbia's breakaway region of Kosovo.

Kosovo declared independence after NATO carried out a bombing campaign in 1999 ⁠— the alliance's first intervention against a sovereign state ⁠— which effectively ended the war between Serbia and ethnic Albanian fighters.

Vucic has been successfully juggling Serbia's relations with eastern and western powers for years, scoring substantial financial aid from the European Union alongside major business deals with China.

Critics and rights groups have accused Vucic of eroding democracy, including curbing media freedoms and undermining institutions in a similar manner to Moscow.

Russia's Ukraine invasion

The demonstration began with the playing of the anthems of Serbia and Russia, with protesters carrying Russian and Serbian flags and shouting, ""Russia, Russia"" and ""Serbs and Russians are brothers forever.""

Protesters then walked to the Russian Embassy.

Russia's war on Ukraine has led to international outrage, with the EU, US, UK, and others implementing tough financial sanctions on Moscow. The West is also supplying Kiev with weapons and humanitarian aid.

But Putin said the ""special military operation"" will last until all goals set are achieved. He started the war Feb. 24 to ""demilitarise"" and ""denazify"" Ukraine.

According to the UN human rights office, at least 331 civilians have been killed and 675 injured in Ukraine since the start of the war.

More than 1.2 million people have also fled Ukraine to neighboring countries, according to the UN Refugee Agency.

BELGRADE, Serbia -- A Russian man burned his passport to show his anger over the invasion of Ukraine. Others held up Ukrainian flags while chanting slogans against the war and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A group of Russian citizens living in Serbia were among dozens of people on Sunday who braved freezing weather and a late winter blizzard to gather in central Belgrade in support of Ukraine and against the war that in the past 11 days has claimed scores of lives and driven about 1.5 million people from their homes.

“I don’t want to have anything to do with what Russia is doing on the territory of Ukraine and in the world,” Vladimir Nesimov said after burning his passport. ""I don’t want to bear any moral or physical responsibility for something that does not depend on me ... I don’t want to be a citizen of that country.”

Nesimov and his wife Evelina Nesimova traveled to Belgrade from the western Serbian town of Loznica to attend Sunday's gathering attended by Serbia's peace activists and the Russians in Serbia. Evelina Nesimova said the couple moved from Moscow to live in Serbia back in 2014, after the Russian invasion of Crimea.

“We did not want to live in a country where Putin is the president,” she said. “We were ashamed.”

Nesimov's action came days after a Russian woman burned her passport during a vigil for the people of Ukraine in Edinburgh, Scotland.

While the Russians at Sunday's rally were firmly against the war, many in Serbia support Putin and his invasion, largely blaming what they view as the anti-Russia policies of NATO and the West for the conflict. Hundreds of right-wing followers marched in Belgrade last week in a rare show of support for Putin in Europe, while several young men also on Sunday chanted pro-Russia slogans during the peace rally.

“I am sorry there is so much ‘Putinofilia’ in Serbia,"" Nesimova said.

Later, the protesters spread a big Ukrainian flag in a central pedestrian street before heading for a march through downtown Belgrade. Several police officers followed the protest to make sure there were no incidents.

The populist authorities in Serbia, a fellow-Slavic and Orthodox Christian nation, have criticized the attack on Ukraine but have refused to join Western sanctions against Russia, reflecting historically close relations. Serbia is a rare Russian ally in Europe despite seeking European Union membership, and pro-Russia propaganda is the country is strong.

On Sunday, Serbia President Aleksandar Vucic met with Russian Ambassador Alexander Botsan-Kharchenko to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the two countries' bilateral ties. Vucic said that Serbia will observe its “vital political and economic interests and preserving peace and stability.”

There have been fears that tensions over the war in Ukraine could spill over to the volatile Balkans, which went through a series of ethnic wars in the 1990s. Serbia has relied on Russia to back its opposition to Western-backed independence of the former Kosovo province, which split after a NATO intervention in 1999.

For Irina, a 47-year-old Russian language teacher who has lived in Serbia for the past nine years with her husband and daughter, supporters of Putin in Serbia should be aware that however painful a history between nations may be “no normal person should support the war. ”

“Any normal person is for peace and truth, and Putin is not the truth, truth is not war,” said Irina, who gave only her first name because of fear of repercussions. “There is no reason for our children to die.”

Along with the message “Serbia – Russia – we don’t need the Union”, it was pointed out that Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić showed his “treacherous character” by voting in such a way.

One of the speakers mentioned, pointing out to Vučić’s cabinet that the protest aims to “impose sanctions on this traitor here to impose sanctions on Russia in his manner after the elections.”

It was said that the Serbs are “along with their mother Russia”, which these days “liberates Ukraine from more vampiric neo-Nazism” and that Russia “liberates the world today from the NATO threat”.

The gathering also sent a big greeting to the Russians and Serbian volunteers in Donbas.

After that, a walk towards the Russian Embassy began, led by six men with crosses and icons that some citizens kissed.

During the walk, slogans in support of Russia were heard, such as “Serbs and Russians are brothers forever!” and “Kyiv is Russia, Kosovo is Serbia.”

In a call for protest, the People’s Patrol stressed the need to support the Russian people “in surviving centuries-old hearths” with a message to the Serbian regime that it will “break teeth on sanctions against Belarus and vote against Russia” at the UN.

In addition, the “People’s Patrol” wanted to point out with a protest “to the majority opposition and the NGO sector that Russophobia is a statistical error in Serbia.”

Andrei Rodionov, a Russian propagandist, promoter of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and an advocate of Russian-dominated unification of Slavs, also sent a video message to “People’s Patrol” supporters calling for a “rally in support of Russia, the Russian army and the Russian people.”

In pro-Western, but also some independent media in Serbia, the “People’s Patrol” is described as a group of “right-wingers and extremists”, while some pro-government tabloids use “People’s Patrol” publications in their sensationalist texts about alleged attacks on citizens, especially Serbian citizens.

The appearance of the “People’s Patrol” is related to the care of migrants in Sombor, a town near the borders of Serbia with Croatia and Hungary, in response to “news” that they fled the Middle East to commit war crimes, including attempted rape and rape.

In Belgrade, explaining that Serbian police are doing nothing to prevent or sanction such “behavior” of migrants described in the “news”, the “People’s Patrol” threatened groups of migrants, usually men, seduced them during curfew and explained “rules of conduct”. Serbia.

In addition to “patrolling”, protests were organized throughout Serbia, demanding that the Serbian authorities ban refugees from the Middle East from entering the country.

At these protests, the supporters of the “People’s Patrol” most often expressed “concern over the possible settlement of migrants in Serbia and their return” on the way from the European Union.
