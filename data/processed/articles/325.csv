WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council will convene on Friday at Russia's request, diplomats said, to discuss Moscow's claims, presented without evidence, of U.S. ""biological activities"" in Ukraine, a move Washington described as gaslighting.

The meeting is expected to be in the morning.

""Russian Mission asked for a meeting of #SecurityCouncil for 11 March to discuss the military biological activities of the US on the territory of #Ukraine,"" Dmitry Polyanskiy, First Deputy Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations said in a tweet.

The United States on Wednesday denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biological warfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims ""laughable"" and suggesting Moscow may be laying the groundwork to use a chemical or biological weapon.

""This is exactly the kind of false flag effort we have warned Russia might initiate to justify a biological or chemical weapons attack,"" Olivia Dalton, spokesperson, U.S. Mission to the United Nations said on Thursday.

""Russia has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons and has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law...We’re not going to let Russia get away with gaslighting,"" she added.

Late on Tuesday, Russia repeated its accusation of several years that the United States is working with Ukrainian laboratories to develop biological weapons. Such assertions in Russian media increased in the run-up to Moscow's military move into Ukraine and were made as recently as Wednesday by foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.

In a statement, also released on Wednesday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said Russia ""is inventing false pretexts in an attempt to justify its own horrific actions in Ukraine.""

Like many other countries, Ukraine has public health laboratories researching how to mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases affecting both animals and humans. Its laboratories have received support from the United States, European Union and World Health Organization.

Russia accused the United States at the United Nations on Friday of supporting a biological weapons program in Ukraine, a fact Moscow said it uncovered as its forces pressed deeper into Ukraine. The claim was vehemently denied by the United States’ U.N. ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s U.N. representative, told the U.N. Security Council that Russia had discovered “truly shocking facts” related to what he said were at least 30 Ukrainian laboratories working on diseases including anthrax, cholera and “the plague,” with funding and oversight by the U.S. military.

He said the “reckless” activity included research related to diseases born by birds, lice and fleas. “We call on you to think about a very real biological danger to the people in European countries which can result from an uncontrolled spread of bio-agents from Ukraine,” he said.

Russia requested the meeting Thursday amid its allegations of U.S.-supported bioweapons research. U.S. officials have denied all such charges and suggested that Moscow may be making the allegations as a pretext for its own use of chemical or biological warfare in Ukraine.

Thomas-Greenfield said that Russia had asked the Security Council for Friday’s meeting “for the sole purpose of lying and spreading disinformation.”

“Russia is attempting to use the Security Council to legitimize disinformation and deceive people to justify President Putin’s war of choice against Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,” she said, adding that China has also been spreading disinformation supporting Russia’s claims.

“Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program, and there are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States — not near Russia’s borders, not anywhere,” she said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also denied the Russian accusations in a video address to his war-torn nation, posted Thursday on Facebook. “No chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction were developed on my land,” he said. “The whole world knows that.”

“They accuse us … that we are allegedly developing biological weapons, allegedly we are preparing a chemical attack. This makes me really worried,” he added, noting that he is the father of two children.

“It is they who are capable of this,” he said, referring to Russia. “They have already done such things in other countries … and they will do so again,” he added.

Zelensky said laboratories in Ukraine were “engaged in ordinary science … not military technology.” He also warned that if Russia does deploy such chemical weapons, it should prepare for the “most severe sanctions response.”

“We’ve been repeatedly convinced — if you want to know Russia’s plans, look at what Russia accuses others of,” he added.

A U.S. defense official, speaking to reporters Thursday on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, said that Ukraine had five biological research centers that were focused on disease prevention and treatment.

For years, Russia has been laying the groundwork for such allegations, claiming that the United States has installed biochemical labs in Ukraine and other former Soviet republics. This disinformation campaign, now being peddled by Russian authorities amid the Ukrainian invasion, has been endorsed by Chinese and Russian state media and notable far-right U.S. figures such as former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon and QAnon figure Ron Watkins.

Kremlin spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters Wednesday that Russia had concluded that “in Ukrainian laboratories close to our borders, components of biological weapons were being developed.”

While China claims it has not taken sides in the conflict — neither denouncing the Russian invasion nor overtly endorsing it — state media and Chinese Foreign Ministry officials regularly echo Russian propaganda, and the Russian biolab claims have quickly spread online, racking up millions of views on the social media platform Weibo.

“This Russian military operation has uncovered the secret of the U.S. labs in Ukraine, and this is not something that can be dealt with in a perfunctory manner,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Thursday, according to the Associated Press.

There are labs in Ukraine and other former Soviet republics that receive funds from the United States, and their existence is not a secret. After the Soviet Union collapsed, emerging republics with little expertise on how to handle biohazards found themselves in possession of sophisticated laboratories, thanks to the Soviet Union’s robust biological weapons program. The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency was established in 1998, aiming at containing and destroying pathogens that can be used as biological weapons.

The program was extremely successful at “defanging the Soviet monster,” Thomas Moore, who worked with Sen. Richard Lugar (D-Ind.), one of the leaders of the initiative, said in an interview with Foreign Policy. The agency was able to destroy significant amounts of biochemical agents in former Soviet states.

Moore said that claims that the United States is supporting biohazard research close to Russia’s borders are not new and that the Kremlin has been asserting this for decades. The funding is aimed at destroying and controlling infectious diseases instead of creating them, Justin Ling writes in Foreign Policy.

Thomas-Greenfield said Friday that Ukraine owns and manages public health laboratories focusing on detecting and diagnosing diseases such as covid-19. “The United States has assisted Ukraine to do this safely and securely,” she said.

Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesman for the U.N. secretary general, told reporters Thursday that “the use of chemical weapons in any conflict, in any context, is a grave violation of international law.” A day earlier, Dujarric told reporters that the World Health Organization has been working with the Ukrainian government and is “unaware of any activity on the part of the Ukrainian government which is inconsistent with its international treaty obligations, including on chemical weapons or biological weapons.”

Elsewhere, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also suggested Thursday that Russia’s accusations could be a “cynical” pretext for its own actions.

“The stuff that you’re hearing about chemical weapons, this is straight out of their playbook,” Johnson told Sky News. “They start saying that there are chemical weapons that are being stored by their opponents or by the Americans. And so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of a maskirovka, a fake story, ready to go.”

The White House warned this week that Russia could use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted that Russia “has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law” and cited its military intervention in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and its suspected poisoning of Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny in 2020 with a Novichok-like nerve agent.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted Thursday: “The manic obsession with which various Russian officials fantasize about non-existent biological or chemical weapons or hazards in Ukraine is deeply troubling and may actually point at Russia preparing another horrific false flag operation.”

The event incited heated discussion. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, evoked the specter of an “uncontrolled spread of bio agents from Ukraine”. His American counterpart, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, warned that Russia’s claim could be a pretext for launching its own biological weapons attack on Ukraine.

So what is the dispute all about, and what is actually happening inside Ukraine?

How did ‘bio labs’ become the latest front in the Ukraine information war?

Earlier in March, the Russian ministry of foreign affairs posted a tweet accusing the US and Ukraine of running a secret “military-biological programme” inside the stricken country. Moscow claimed its invading forces discovered evidence of an “emergency clean-up”.

Moscow went on to claim that it had found documents related to the secret US operation in laboratories in Kharkiv and Poltava.

The allegations were quickly amplified by China, which supported the claims during the UN security council debate. The theory took on a life of its own on social media under the hashtag #usbiolabs, and found a welcome home among rightwing outlets in the US including the War Room podcast of Donald Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon and the Fox News primetime show hosted by Tucker Carlson.

How have the US and Ukrainian governments responded?

Both the US and Ukraine have categorically denied they are developing biological weapons inside the country. Thomas-Greenfield said: “I will say this once: ‘Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program.’” She went on to turn the accusation back on Moscow. “It is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapon program in violation of international law.”

Ukraine’s ambassador to the world body, Sergiy Kyslytsya, called the idea being advanced by Russia “a bunch of insane delirium”.

This week, speaking to business leaders in Washington, Joe Biden warned that Vladimir Putin could use biological weapons.

“His back is against the wall,” said Biden, mentioning the false claims about US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. “Now he’s talking about new false flags he’s setting up, including he’s asserting that, we, in America, have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe. Simply not true, I guarantee you.”

What are independent world bodies saying?

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is unaware of activity by Ukraine violating any international treaty, including the ban on biological weapons.

The UN high commissioner for disarmament, Izumi Nakamitsu, confirmed that the UN was not aware of any biological weapons programmes in Ukraine. Nakamitsu pointed to the Biological Weapons Convention, which has prohibited the development and use of biological weapons since 1975. The convention was backed by Richard Nixon, who in 1969 also put a stop to the US developing its own offensive biological weapons.

So do bio labs exist inside Ukraine, and is the US supporting them?

Yes, and yes. Ukraine does operate biological laboratories that receive US funding. The US undersecretary of state Victoria Nuland affirmed those facts in a Senate foreign relations committee hearing this week, in which the Republican senator Marco Rubio asked directly if Ukraine had biological weapons.

Nuland did not answer the question head on. “Ukraine has biological research facilities,” she said, adding that there was concern that Russian forces were trying to gain control of the labs. “We are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces.”

Nuland’s comments were seized upon by far-right commentators as evidence of a secret plot. In fact, US funding to the laboratories had its roots in the fall of the Soviet Union, after which money was pumped into Ukraine and other countries to help them transfer scientific skills away from weapons towards public health.

The scheme was originally known as Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) but is now more commonly referred to as biological engagement. It has been successful in helping former Soviet and other countries fulfill public health obligations.

“This is one of the best things that we do,” Dr Gigi Gronvall, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Guardian.

Most of the work of the Ukraine labs today, Gronvall said, involves surveillance of diseases in animals and people as an early-warning system for illnesses such as African swine fever, which is endemic in the region.

“We know pathogens don’t respect borders, so helping to put out public health fires before they become too big is an advantage to all of us,” she said.

Do the Ukraine laboratories store dangerous biological agents?

As part of their work the labs do seem to hold dangerous pathogens. We know that because WHO is urging Ukraine to destroy any highly dangerous agents to avoid the risk of a disastrous outbreak should one of the labs be hit by Russian forces.

“As part of this work, WHO has strongly recommended to the ministry of

health in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threat

pathogens to prevent any potential spills,” the UN health agency said.

The WHO has worked in Ukraine for several years helping bio labs improve safety and security, so it knows what it is talking about.

If Russian claims of a secret bioweapons programme are fake news, does that mean there is nothing to worry about?

No. In addition to the threat of pathogens held in Ukrainian labs leaking or falling into the hands of Russian forces, there is the threat of Russia launching its own biological weapons attack. The assessment of the US state department is that Russia continues to maintain an offensive biological weapons programme in violation of the convention it signed.

Earlier this week, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, accused Russia under Putin of having a “long and well-documented track record” of using chemical weapons, pointing to the poisoning of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny and Russia’s support of the Syrian regime while it deployed chemical weapons.

She warned that Moscow’s claim of a secret biological weapons programme in Ukraine could in fact be laying the foundations for a Russian chemical or biological weapons assault.

On Monday, Biden said Russia was “also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine … That’s a clear sign he is considering using both of those.

“He’s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what’s about to come. He knows there’ll be severe consequences because of the united Nato front but the point is: it’s real.”

That possibility leaves even seasoned experts rattled.

“I hope that this is more of a disinformation talking point than an actual thing,” Gronvall said. “I guess we shall see.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-biological-weapon-claim-us-un-ukraine-bio-labs-explainer

The meeting is expected to be in the morning.

“Russian Mission asked for a meeting of #SecurityCouncil for 11 March to discuss the military biological activities of the US on the territory of # Ukraine,” Mr Dmitry Polyanskiy, First Deputy Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations said in a post on Twitter.

The US on Wednesday denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biological warfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims “laughable” and suggesting that Moscow may be laying the groundwork to use chemical or biological weapon.

“This is exactly the kind of false flag effort we have warned Russia might initiate to justify a biological or chemical weapons attack,” said Ms Olivia Dalton, spokesman for the US Mission to the UN.

“Russia has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons and has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law... We’re not going to let Russia get away with gaslighting,” she added.

Late on Tuesday, Russia repeated its accusation of several years that the US is working with Ukrainian laboratories to develop biological weapons. Such assertions in Russian media increased in the run-up to Moscow’s military move into Ukraine and were made as recently as Wednesday by foreign ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova.

Western states have accused Russia of employing a ruse by accusing their opponents and the US of developing biological and chemical weapons to lay the ground for their possible use in Ukraine - something Moscow has been accused of doing in Syria.

""The Russian Federation has repeatedly spread disinformation regarding Syria's repeated use of chemical weapons,"" said Ambassador Richard Mills, the deputy US envoy to the UN.

""The recent web of lies that Russia has cast in an attempt to justify the premeditated and unjustified war it has undertaken against Ukraine, should make clear, once and for all, that Russia also cannot be trusted when it talks about chemical weapon use in Syria.""",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/at-moscows-request-un-security-council-to-meet-on-biological-weapons-allegation

Security Council meeting Friday for “lying and spreading disinformation” as part of a potential false-flag operation by Moscow for the use of chemical or biological agents in Ukraine.

Watch Thomas-Greenfield’s remarks in the player above.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was playing out a scenario put forth in the council last month by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken — that President Vladimir Putin would “fabricate allegations about chemical or biological weapons to justify its own violent attacks against the Ukrainian people.”

“The intent behind these lies seems clear, and is deeply troubling,” she said. “We believe Russia could use chemical or biological agents for assassinations, as part of a staged or false-flag incident, or to support tactical military operations.”

Russia had requested the council meeting to address its allegations of U.S. “biological activities” in Ukraine — a charge made without any evidence and denied by both Washington and Kyiv.

Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward, called the allegations “utter nonsense” and said “Russia is sinking to new depths today, but the council must not get dragged down with it.”

U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu told the council she was aware of media reports about allegations of biological weapons programs and said: “The United Nations is not aware of any biological weapons programs.”

Thomas-Greenfield said Ukraine doesn’t have a biological weapons program or biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States, as Russia claimed. Ukraine does own and operate its own public health laboratory facilities which make it possible to detect and diagnose diseases like COVID-19 which the U.S. has assisted Ukraine in doing “safely and securely.”

Thomas-Greenfield said that ever since Russia began building up forces near Ukraine’s borders, Washington’s strategy has been to counter Moscow’ tactics and share what it knows with the world.

“We’re not going to let Russia get away with lying to the world or staining the integrity of the Security Council by using it as a venue for legitimizing Putin’s violence,” she said.

“We do not sit in this chamber to be an audience for Russia’s domestic propaganda,” Thomas-Greenfield added. “And we should not allow Russia to abuse its permanent seat to spread disinformation and lies nd pervert the purpose of the Security Council.”

The U.N. human rights office has received “credible reports” that Russian forces are using cluster munitions in Ukraine, including in populated areas which is prohibited under international humanitarian law, Undersecretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo told the Security Council.

“Indiscriminate attacks, including those using cluster munitions, which are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction, are prohibited under international humanitarian law,” DiCarlo said. “Directing attacks against civilian and civilian objects, as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages, are also prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes.”

Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia replied that the allegations are “refuted repeatedly by our Ministry of Defense.”

The Russian request for the Security Council meeting, tweeted Thursday by its first deputy U.N. ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, followed a U.S. rejection of Russian accusations that Ukraine is operating chemical and biological labs with U.S. support.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova had made the accusation earlier this week, following a warning from White House press secretary Jen Psaki that Russia might use chemical or biological weapons against Ukraine in the invasion.

Psaki called Russia’s claim “preposterous” and tweeted: “This is all an obvious ploy by Russia to try to justify its further premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also denied Russia’s accusation. Like Psaki, he said the accusation itself was a bad sign.

“That worries me very much because we have often been convinced that if you want to know Russia’s plans, they are what Russia accuses others of,” he said late Thursday. “No chemical or any other weapon of mass destruction has been developed on my land. The whole world knows this.”

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby called the Russian claim “a bunch of malarkey.”

Olivia Dalton, spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said “Russia has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons and has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law” as well as “a track record of falsely accusing the West of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.”

U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu and U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo also were scheduled to brief the council Friday.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric reiterated Thursday that the World Health Organization, which has been working with the Ukrainian government, “said they are unaware of any activity on the part of the Ukrainian government which is inconsistent with its international treaty obligations, including on chemical weapons or biological weapons.”

The United States for months has warned about Russian “false flag” operations to create a pretext for the invasion, which began Feb. 24.

The White House warning, and Dalton’s statement Thursday, suggested Russia might seek to create a pretense for further escalating the 2-week-old conflict that has seen the Russian offensive slowed, but not stopped, by stronger-than-expected Ukrainian defenders.

The international community for years has assessed that Russia used chemical weapons in carrying out assassination attempts against President Vladimir Putin’s opponents such as Alexei Navalny, now in a Russian prison, and former spy Sergei Skripal, who lives in the United Kingdom. Russia also supports the Syrian government, which has used chemical weapons against its people in an 11-year civil war.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-u-s-accuses-russia-of-using-u-n-council-to-spread-disinformation-about-bioweapons-in-ukraine
