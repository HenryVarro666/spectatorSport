WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday a limited no-fly zone over humanitarian corridors to allow safe evacuations from Ukrainian cities hit hard by Russian forces could still escalate the conflict, leading the United States into war with Russia.

Briefing reporters en route to Texas, Psaki said such a move would still require shooting down Russian planes if they fly into the zone, even if it covered a smaller area. ""We would still have concerns about that being an escalatory action that could lead us into a war with Russia, which is not something the president intends to do,"" she said.

1,7a6ab34b-ea1b-4843-b8a1-4f787aa44814,"['Katelyn Caralle', 'U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com']",2022-03-08 15:53:58+00:00,"More than two dozen U.S. foreign policy experts are urging the Biden administration to establish a 'limited' no-fly zone for Russia over Ukraine after international warnings that the move would lead to a more large-scale war in Europe.

Since President Joe Biden and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries have vowed not to send ground troops to fight President Vladimir Putin's forces in Ukraine, the 27 experts are imploring the White House to further deter aerial Russian attacks.

'President Biden and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg have stated that neither the United States nor NATO will engage Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine,' the open letter reads. 'What we seek is the deployment of American and NATO aircraft not in search of confrontation with Russia but to avert and deter Russian bombardment that would result in massive loss of Ukrainian lives.'

The letter and campaign to create the 'limited' no-fly zone is led by co-founder of the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation Robert McConnell and is signed by 26 former diplomats and other foreign policy experts.

Some notable co-signers include Kurt Volker, who was U.S. ambassador to NATO under Barack Obama and special representative for Ukraine negotiations under Donald Trump; George W. Bush-era ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst; Trump-era ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor; Eric Edelman, who was undersecretary of Defense under Bush Jr.; and Bush-era deputy assistant secretary of Defense Ian Brzezinksi, who is brother of MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski.

NATO and U.S. lawmakers and experts have warned that any no-fly zone establishment over the former Soviet nation would likely lead to World War III.

'We, the undersigned, urge the Biden administration, together with NATO allies, to impose a limited No-Fly Zone over Ukraine starting with protection for humanitarian corridors that were agreed upon in talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials on Thursday,' they wrote. 'NATO leaders should convey to Russian officials that they do not seek direct confrontation with Russian forces, but they must also make clear that they will not countenance Russian attacks on civilian areas.'

To effectively set up a no-fly zone, pilots would have to destroy Russian air defenses and to enforce that zone, NATO allies would have to shoot down any Russian aircraft that venture into the airspace.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said any country that takes action to help Ukraine develop a no-fly zone would be considered 'participants in a military conflict', leading warnings that the move would lead to another World War and drag the U.S. into the active fighting it is trying to avoid.

'President Biden and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg have stated that neither the United States nor NATO will engage Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine,' the open letter reads, urging for more action by the creation of the no-fly zone

The letter was signed by 27 experts in defense and foreign policy and comes as others within the filed warn a no-fly zone would cause World War III

The letter released Tuesday from U.S. foreign policy leaders states: 'Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine has caused massive devastation and loss of life for Ukrainians. His premeditated, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression has

created the greatest crisis on the European continent since the end of World War II.'

'The international community has responded swiftly through an unprecedented array of

sanctions and a significant increase in lethal military assistance to help Ukraine defend

Itself,' they lauded, adding, 'But more must be done to prevent more widescale casualties and a potential bloodbath.'

'The refrain 'never again' emerged in the wake of the Holocaust, and Ukrainians are wondering whether that pledge applies to them,' they continued. 'It is time for the United States and NATO to step up their help for Ukrainians before more innocent civilians fall victim to Putin's murderous madness.'

The letter concluded: 'A U.S.-NATO enforced No-Fly Zone to protect humanitarian corridors and additional military means for Ukrainian self-defense are desperately needed, and needed now.'

Ukraine has pled with NATO and the U.S. to help them develop a no-fly zone over the country in the midst of Russian invasion, which has led to thousands of deaths and injuries and millions of displaced Ukrainians.

'A no-fly zone has become a catchphrase,' Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio told ABC's This Week host George Stephanopoulos on Sunday morning.

'I'm not sure a lot of people fully understand what that means,' he insisted.

'It's not some rule you pass that everybody has to oblige by,' Rubio said. 'It's the willingness to shoot down the aircrafts of the Russian Federation, which is basically the beginning of World War III.'

He explained that establishing a no-fly zone above Ukraine would mean the U.S. would be agreeing to 'shoot down and engage Russian airplanes in the sky' in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.

'So basically a no fly zone, if people understand what it means, it means World War II. It means starting World War III,' Rubio said.

Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, said Sunday: 'If I were President Zelensky, I would be asking for a no-fly zone.'

'The problem is, there is no such thing as a no-fly zone over Ukraine,' he added.

The comments come the day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked the U.S. Congress to help him establish a no-fly zone over the former Soviet nation.

Trump-era ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Sunday that she is not in favor of the no-fly zone route, insisting instead that the Biden administration should hit Russia's energy to give Putin a 'punch in the gut.'

'You sound like somebody then that would be in favor of a no-fly zone over Ukraine right now,' NBC's Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Haley on Sunday.

'No, I'm not in favor of a no-fly zone right now,' the Republican former UN ambassador said. 'What I am in favor of is the Biden administration stepping up and doing the things that will matter.'

'We know that the one thing that punches Putin in the gut is to hit his energy sector,' she added. 'There is no reason we should be taking money from an enemy. We should go ahead and sanction all of those energy companies right now. We should remove him from the international banking system. We should be coordinating intelligence in real time with the Ukrainians, we should be leading with NATO, telling them to give the planes to Ukraine. We should be making sure that we're moving forward on giving them the missiles they need.'

Haley lamented that Ukraine still doesn't have what they need and the U.S. should be working to get them the necessary defenses against Russia.

'They need javelins, they need stingers, they need anti-air and anti-tank missiles to be able to do this,' she continued. 'We've got to give it to them. We should have done all this before Putin did his first move. We were late to the game. We're still late to the game. It's not too late now, but we've got to get on the ball.'

Senator Murphy had a remedy for this during his interview on Sunday, claiming that he believes Congress is on track to approve $10 billion for additional funding for Ukraine.

'My belief is that next week congress is going to pass an emergency funding bill for Ukraine, putting 10 billion into both defensive equipment for Ukraine but also humanitarian assistance to get civilians out,' the Connecticut senator said.

Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova reiterated on Sunday Zelensky's urge to get a no-fly zone established.

Fox News's Shannon Bream asked Markarova how she feels about the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's analysis that a no-fly zone establishment would lead to full-fledged war in Europe. Markarova responded by claiming if Russia attacked Ukraine unprovoked, what other countries can truly feel safe from the wrath of Putin.

'Well, let's all remember that Ukraine did nothing to provoke this attack,' Markarova said. 'Ukraine was always and is a peaceful country. We never attacked Russia, we're no threat to Russia unless being a democracy and living peacefully in your own country is a threat.'

'So if the situation, you know, happened to Ukraine, who is safe? What democracy can feel safe right now?' she posed.

'So I think, you know, the events of the past 11 days clearly shows that we have to act together, and that Russia can attack anyone being totally unprovoked like they did with Ukraine,' Markarova continued. 'So, it's time for all of us to step up.'

Zelensky met virtually with the US Congress on Saturday, and once again pressed for a no-fly zone that has been met with widespread bipartisan resistance. He also asked the U.S. to ban imports of Russian oil and transfer fighter jets to Ukraine's air force.

How can America support Ukraine without sparking a wider war with Russia that could turn into World War III? The United States is trying to avoid nuclear escalation with Russia, while attempting to support Kyiv after Ukraine urged president Joe Biden to impose a no-fly zone. The US and its NATO allies have so far sent 17,000 anti-tank missiles to Ukraine, as part of a $350million aid package that was agreed on February 26 - day two of the conflict. But as Ukrainian president Zelensky has called on Joe Biden to do more, there are increasing fears that any direct US involvement could lead to nuclear involvement and put the West at war with Russia - prompting World War III. If Russia attacks one NATO country, all other members of the transatlantic alliance, including the US, would be obligated to come to its aid militarily under Article 5 of the treaty that unites them, which Biden has pledged to respect. The US military is walking a tightrope to balance Ukraine's demands while preventing further escalation, according to public statements by American leaders and AFP interviews with several officials. Even before Russia's invasion, president Biden warned any direct US involvement in Ukraine would provoke a 'world war', and Biden has given directives to avoid such a spiral, by limiting the capacity of American intervention. As Russia continues its bid to surround and besiege the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Ukraine's military said its defensive operations continue in the north, east and south of Ukraine. Kherson last week became the first major city to fall to Russian troops, with all other cities remaining under Ukrainian control. Ukrainian forces claim to have retaken Chuhuiv. Kyiv claimed today that 12,000 Russian troops have now died fighting in Ukraine, while 300 tanks have been destroyed along with more than 1,000 armoured vehicles, 48 planes, 80 helicopters and three boats. Moscow has acknowledged taking losses but has not given a recent update. Ukraine's losses are unknown. The United Nations has recorded at least 1,120 civilian casualties so far across Ukraine, with 364 killed and 769 injured, including scores of children. The real toll is likely to be significantly higher. As Russia's invasion of the Ukraine enters its thirteenth day, how can the US help Ukraine without sparking a wider war? INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT ON THE GROUND The US's first priority is to keep providing major assistance to Ukraine's resistance so it can hold on, even if some cities begin to fall. This could come in the form of intelligence support as Russia's invasion continues, in particular to enable anti-aircraft defenses to thwart some of Russia's attacks. The US have put in place 'robust information and intelligence sharing with Ukraine', one diplomat explained. One US official said the need to 'contain the president of Russia' has become a prime directive, while Blinken cautioned that the suffering 'is likely to get worse before it gets better'. But Blinken also insisted Putin is 'destined to lose' while US officials are believed to have said, in private, that the Russian leader has already lost as they adapt their strategy. BOOSTING MILITARY AID A $350million package of military aid was approved by Congress on February 26, two days into the conflict, and 70 percent of it was delivered in five days. By contrast, a $60 million arms package to Ukraine agreed to in August was not completed until November, the Pentagon said. The $350m package came in the form of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and portable Javelin anti-tank missiles to assist the Ukraine with its defense. The US and its allies have delivered 17,000 anti-tank missiles to Ukraine so far. There is 'no limit' to military assistance, one senior US official stressed, so long as it does not involve offensive heavy weapons. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that the 'green light' had been given to a plan for Ukraine to be given Poland's MIG fighter jets, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly. Kyiv on Monday rejected Russia's offer of 'humanitarian corridors' to evacuate civilians after it emerged several of them led to Russian territory or its close ally Belarus (top). Red Cross workers in Mariupol also said one of the routes Russia identified for civilians to leave the city had been covered with land mines Forces continue to work to surround the capital Kyiv, though progress has been slow. Attacks on civilian areas on the outskirts have increased In return, the US would replace the Soviet-era planes with modern F-16 American fighter jets. But Poland quickly said they had not agreed any plan after president Andrzej Duda voiced concern about the proposal, believing it would drag his country into open conflict with Russia. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki admitted there were 'challenges' to a proposal to have Poland transfer MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, then have the U.S. 'backfill' the losses with US-made F-16s. 'It is not as easy as just moving planes around,' she said on Monday. Washington is now examining ways in which is can help provide further military support to Ukraine. Earlier this week, it sent anti-aircraft stinger missiles. Despite Ukraine's fierce resistance, US military believes that Russia's massive and superior military capacity could eventually overwhelm Kyiv, with one senior US defense official arguing that the US should not 'underestimate' Moscow's 'firepower'. Russian president Vladimir Putin has now sent about 100 percent of his invasion forces into Ukraine, a senior US defense official said on Monday. Washington is bolstering the preventive and deterrent deployments of soldiers in allied countries that are on Russia's doorstep, which have been visited by Blinken and US Chief of Staff General Mark Milley. US troops were pictured in Romania on Sunday, having been sent there several weeks ago by president Joe Biden. Kyiv has claimed 12,000 Russian troops have now died fighting in Ukraine, while 300 tanks have been destroyed along with more than 1,000 armoured vehicles, 48 planes, 80 helicopters and three boats. Moscow has acknowledged taking losses but has not given a recent update. Ukraine's losses are unknown. Russian troops continue to try and surround Kyiv ahead of what is expected to be an attack on the city, with intense fighting reported in the north west including hand-to-hand combat with Russian forces UPPING FINANCIAL AND HUMANITARIAN AID Following the unprecedented $350million of emergency military aid that was sent to Ukrainian forces, Washington plans to release a massive $10billion humanitarian relief package to aid Ukraine and assist allies in Eastern Europe. The Biden administration initially asked lawmakers to provide $6.4billion in aid to Ukraine, but both parties quickly called for more spending and the administration agreed. The $10billion request would aid in training Ukraine's military, provide food and other humanitarian aid and boost cybersecurity defense, as well as fortify the electric supply. As cities continue to be shelled, the UN reported that 1.7million people have fled Ukraine, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II. America's fear is that Putin, should he feel provoked, will extend the conflict beyond Ukraine, risking a direct, and potentially nuclear, confrontation with the US and its NATO allies. President Biden also held a virtual meeting with allies to keep up pressure on Moscow, as they underscored their commitment to providing more humanitarian aid. Biden, French president Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson 'underscored their commitment to continue providing security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine,' the White House said in a statement. And leading US lawmakers on trade issues reached a deal Monday on legislation that would ban the import of Russian oil and energy products into the US and suspend normal trade relations with Moscow, amid indications the administration is willing to go along. The trade leaders in the House and Senate announced the deal in a statement, after the White House in public comments sought to balance a desire to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine while seeking to avoid sending U.S. energy prices still higher. 'Taking these actions will send a clear message to (Vladimir) Putin that his war is unacceptable and the United States stands firmly with our NATO allies,' the lawmakers said. The statement was issued by House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal and Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, both Democrats, and their Republican counterparts, Representative Kevin Brady and Senator Mike Crapo. On Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki would not state unequivocally that Biden would sign legislation to ban Russian oil products – following reports of outreach to heavily-sanctioned Venezuela and other producers. Russia has now committed all of the forces it massed on the Ukrainian border before the invasion, and has made only limited territorial gains - capturing just one major city, Kherson. Others, including Sumy and Kyiv, are slowly being surrounded but in some places the Ukrainians have managed to thwart Russian attacks or successfully counter-attack CREATING A NO-FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly called for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but this has been so far rejected by Washington and NATO. A no-fly zone would bar all unauthorized aircraft from flying over Ukraine. Western nations imposed such restrictions over parts of Iraq for more than a decade following the 1991 Gulf War, during the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1993-95, and during the Libyan civil war in 2011. Ukrainians want a broader intervention like the one that occurred in Libya, when NATO forces launched attacks on government positions, said Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. It is not likely to happen when the opponent is Russia. 'They want to see the West kind of sweeping in and taking out the rocket artillery that's pummeling Ukrainian cities,' Bronk said. 'We're not going to go to war against the Russian army. They are a massive nuclear-armed power. There is no way that we could possibly model, let alone control, the escalation chain that would come from such an action.' Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky (pictured in Kyiv yesterday) has called the US to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but this has been rejected by Washington and NATO In addition to fighter planes, NATO would have to deploy refueling tankers and electronic-surveillance aircraft to support the mission. To protect these relatively slow, high-flying planes, NATO would have to destroy surface-to-air missile batteries in Russia and Belarus, again risking a broader conflict. Analysts say there is no chance that the US, Britain and their European allies will impose a no-fly zone because it could easily escalate the war in Ukraine into a nuclear confrontation between NATO and Russia. Blinken himself has warned that a no-fly zone would mean NATO planes would have to be prepared to shoot down Russian fighters, and 'that could lead to a full-fledged war'. While NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday: 'The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO fighter planes into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes.' 'We understand the desperation, but we also believe that if we did that, we would end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe.' 'We have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine,' he said. Zelensky, asked about concern widely expressed of the dramatic escalation, brushed off the fears and insisted it was the best way for the US to help Ukraine. He spoke to Joe Biden on Saturday night for 40 minutes, and pressed the issue with the US leader. 'I told him that for us, the most important thing today is the security in the sky,' Zelensky said. 'We cannot allow Russia to be active there only, because they're bombing us, they are shelling us, they are bombing us, they are sending missiles, helicopters, jet fighters - a lot of things. 'But we are not doing this because we don't have the sky. 'We don't control our sky.' Predictions that Russia would quickly control the skies over Ukraine have not come to fruition, leaving military experts wondering why Russia has chosen to leave most of its fixed-wing combat aircraft on the ground during this massive land offensive. One explanation may be that Russian pilots aren't well trained in supporting large-scale land operations, engagements that require coordination with artillery, helicopters and other assets in a fast-moving environment. 'I think that maybe they're a little bit worried that that is a very constrained area. It's not like the Middle East, where there's all kinds of space to roam around in the air,' said Robert Latif, a retired U.S. Air Force major general who now teaches at the University of Notre Dame. 'They could very easily stray over borders,' he explained. 'With both Ukrainian and Russian air defense systems and Ukrainian, what little they have, and Russian airplanes all flying around - that could be a very confusing. I think maybe they're a little bit worried about actually being able to pull it off.' Putin has threatened 'colossal and catastrophic consequences' for Europe and the wider world if a no-fly zone is implemented. Given such tensions, Washington has blown hot and cold on the possible delivery to Kyiv, via countries like Poland, of Soviet-made fighter jets on which Ukrainian pilots have trained. MORE SANCTIONS TO INCREASE THE STRANGLEHOLD ON RUSSIA'S ECONOMY Joe Biden's administration has admitted that it was 'actively' studying an 'off-ramps' plan but has offered no timetable or firm commitment on the prospect. There were concerns in Washington that this could still be enough to bring US confrontation with Moscow to a head, without even significantly changing the balance of power in Ukraine's skies. US leaders hope ramping up pressure on the Kremlin with sanctions will eventually cause Putin to conclude that prosecuting his war is more costly than withdrawing. But this would require keeping diplomatic channels open to offer the Russian leader some kind of 'off-ramps'. Having ceased all high-level contact with the Russians since February 24, the Americans are encouraging others to talk to Putin. It came after Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett flew in for a secret meeting with Vladimir Putin and later phoned Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss the war in Ukraine. Bennett's meeting took place 'with the blessing of the US administration,' his office said, to discuss the safety of Ukraine's Jewish population and Iran's nuclear program. Bennett said his country had a 'moral obligation' to help stem fighting in Ukraine even if chances of success were 'not great', after shuttle diplomacy that saw him visit the Kremlin. The Israeli PM had offered last week to act as a mediator between the two countries, to which Putin had replied that he was 'ready for negotiation. The Israeli premier, acting after Kyiv requested him to launch a dialogue with Moscow in the wake of Russia's invasion, has also held three phone calls in 24 hours with Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky. Bennett has so far walked a cautious line on the Ukraine conflict, seeking to preserve delicate security cooperation with Russia, which has a large military presence in Israel's northern neighbour, Syria. Similarly, Blinken's phone call to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, at a time when Beijing boasts of its 'rock-solid' friendship with Moscow, did not exclude the possibility of China playing an intermediary role. Foreign minister Wang Yi has offered Beijing's help in mediating peace between the two countries, and backed ties with Moscow despite international condemnation of Russia's actions. He added that China would send humanitarian aid to Ukraine and was 'willing to work with the international community to carry out necessary mediation'. Beijing has repeatedly said it would play a 'constructive role in calling for negotiations' to resolve the crisis, but has not previously committed to joining or hosting any peace talks. Wang also described the China-Russia relationship as 'the world's most crucial bilateral relationship', which 'is conducive to world peace, stability and development'. Advertisement

Retired Admiral James Stavridis told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that the U.S. should 'give the Ukrainians the ability to create a no-fly zone', but said the U.S. should not directly assist in its creation 'yet.'

'I implemented a no-fly zone. I know how to do this. I did it in Libya in 2011,' Stavridis said.

'Can we do it? Sure. Should we? Not yet,' he weighed in.

The full Senate and House were invited to participate in the Zoom meeting with Zelensky Saturday that lasted roughly an hour, as Putin 's forces pushed toward the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and the invasion entered its second week.

In the meeting, Zelensky again asked for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which NATO has rejected over fears it would trigger World War Three, and asked the US to ban imports of Russian oil and transfer fighter jets to Ukraine's air force.

The full Senate and House were invited to participate in the Zoom meeting that lasted roughly an hour, as Vladimir Putin's forces push toward the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and the invasion enters its second week.

In the meeting, Zelensky repeated his plea for NATO to impose a no-fly zone over his country to blunt Russian air superiority, according to sources familiar with the matter.

However, the Biden administration and lawmakers from both parties have expressed strong opposition to the idea of a no-fly zone, because enforcing it would require shooting down Russian planes, drawing NATO into direct conflict with Russia.

Putin on Saturday underlined the stakes involved, saying that any country trying to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine will be considered a participant in the conflict.

In Saturday's meeting, Zelensky also described alleged war crimes unfolding in his country and called for Putin to be designated an international war criminal. Zelensky is seen meeting with members of Congress in a Zoom call on Saturday

In Saturday's meeting, Zelensky also asked for tougher sanctions on Russia, including a ban on oil and gas exports, an option the White House is currently weighing.

Cutting off Russian oil would be costly for the US, where it accounts for 7 percent of imports, but not insurmountable. The issue is more delicate in Germany, which is now dependent on Russian energy.

Zelensky also requested the transfer of Soviet-era fighter jets currently stationed in Eastern Europe to his own air force to use in the fight against Russia, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat, said on Twitter after the Zoom meeting that he supported transferring fighter jets to Ukraine from NATO allies in Eastern Europe.

'Without engaging U.S. pilots in direct conflict with Russians, we can facilitate Ukrainian access to aircraft with which Ukrainian pilots are already trained and which are held in other Eastern European countries,' he wrote.

'I support getting Ukraine access to the fighter jets needed to confront Putin in the skies,' added Doggett.

Zelensky also described alleged war crimes unfolding in his country and called for Putin to be designated an international war criminal, according to Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican.

Zelensky's meeting with Congress comes as Russian forces press a grinding advance toward key population centers, including Kyiv, were Zelensky and his forces appear ready to make a final stand.

In the key southeastern port city of Mariupol, a limited ceasefire broke down, and Ukrainian officials said that Russia resumed shelling near humanitarian evacuation corridors.

In a bitter and emotional speech late on Friday, Zelensky lashed out at NATO powers for refusing to impose a no-fly zone over his country, warning that 'all the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you'.

NATO has rejected the request, saying that such a move would draw the alliance into a direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.

But Zelensky claimed the West's hesitancy will fully unleash Russia's invasion as it escalates its air attack. He called NATO 'weak' and 'confused' in emotional remarks.

'The alliance has given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages,' Zelensky said, warning that 'the history of Europe will remember this forever'.

In a separate video message to anti-war protesters in several European cities, Zelensky said: 'If we fall, you will fall'.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had earlier ruled out the possibility of a no-fly zone, saying Western planes would have to shoot down Russian aircraft.

'We are not part of this conflict,' Stoltenberg said in denying Ukraine's request.

'We have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering,' he said following a NATO meeting in Brussels.

Despite the risk of nuclear war with Russia, a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Friday found that a majority of Americans support a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

Some 74 percent of Americans - including solid majorities of Republicans and Democrats - said the United States and its allies in NATO should impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine, the poll found.

It was not clear if respondents who supported a no-fly zone were fully aware of the risk of conflict it would involve, and majorities opposed the idea of sending American troops to Ukraine or conducting air strikes to support the Ukrainian army.

The poll, conducted Thursday and Friday, suggests that U.S. outrage is growing over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which in recent days has increasingly involved Russian bombing of urban areas.

It puts pressure on President Joe Biden to take more aggressive actions against Moscow, although he has dismissed the notion of no-fly zones because of the risk of open conflict between NATO and Russian forces.

An equally bipartisan 80 percent of Americans said the United States should stop buying Russian oil, which accounts for about 7 percent of US oil imports.

The White House on Friday said it was weighing cuts to U.S. imports of Russian oil, though it is proceeding cautiously, concerned about a spike in gasoline prices that would add to high inflation.

Meanwhile, Russia said its forces had stopped firing near two besieged Ukrainian cities on Saturday to allow safe passage to civilians fleeing fighting, but officials in one of the cities said Moscow was not fully observing the limited ceasefire.

The Russian defense ministry said its units had opened humanitarian corridors near the cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha which were encircled by its troops, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine entered into its 10th day.

But in Mariupol, the city council said Russia was not observing the ceasefire and asked residents to return to shelters and wait for further information on evacuation.

Russia's defense ministry accused Ukrainian 'nationalists' of preventing civilians from leaving, RIA news agency reported.

The southeastern port has endured heavy bombardment, a sign of its strategic value to Moscow due to its position between Russian-backed separatist-held eastern Ukraine and the Black Sea Crimean peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.

'This night the shelling was harder and closer,' a staff member from Doctors without Borders/Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) said, according to the aid agency, adding there was still no power, water, heating or mobile phone links and food was scarce.

2,7a6ab34b-ea1b-4843-b8a1-4f787aa44814,[],,"More than two dozen foreign policy experts have called for the United States and NATO to institute a partial no-fly zone over Ukraine, which would serve as an escalation of the conflict with Russia.

In a letter first reported by Politico on Tuesday morning, the 27 officials urged “the Biden administration, together with NATO allies, to impose a limited No-Fly Zone over Ukraine starting with protection for humanitarian corridors that were agreed upon in talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials on Thursday.”

“NATO leaders should convey to Russian officials that they do not seek direct confrontation with Russian forces, but they must also make clear that they will not countenance Russian attacks on civilian areas,” they added.

While a partial no-fly zone for humanitarian purposes may sound anodyne, it risks the same conclusion that caused a broader action to be rejected by top officials in the U.S. and Europe when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made the ask in the early days of the invasion: shooting down Russian planes and starting a direct war between the U.S. and a nation with an estimated 6,000 nuclear weapons. The U.S. and its allies have implemented multiple no-fly zones in recent decades over countries with much less powerful militaries, such as Bosnia and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in the 1990s, as well as Libya in 2011.

“President Biden and NATO Secretary General [Jens] Stoltenberg have stated that neither the United States nor NATO will engage Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine,” continued the letter. “What we seek is the deployment of American and NATO aircraft not in search of confrontation with Russia but to avert and deter Russian bombardment that would result in massive loss of Ukrainian lives.”

With hundreds of civilian deaths and a refugee crisis the United Nations is calling the largest since World War II, there has been continued pressure from Ukraine for NATO to intervene. In a New York Times op-ed last week, Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak called for a no-fly zone while acknowledging what it would mean.

“We are calling on the West to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine,” Yermak wrote. “We recognize that this would be a serious escalation in the war and that it could bring NATO into direct conflict with Russia. But we firmly believe that Russia won’t stop at just Ukraine, which would potentially drag NATO into this conflict anyway.”

“Close the sky over Ukraine! Close it for all Russian missiles, Russian combat aircraft, for all these terrorists. Make a humanitarian air zone, without rockets, without air bombs,” Zelensky said Sunday via Twitter.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a Feb. 28 briefing that implementing such a zone would require “deploying U.S. military to enforce, which would be ... potentially a direct conflict, and potentially a war with Russia, which is something we are not planning to be a part of.” She reiterated the position on Thursday.

“The reason why that has not been a step the president has been willing to take or we have been interested in taking is because a no-fly zone requires implementation,” Psaki told reporters. “It would require, essentially, the U.S. military shooting down Russian planes and prompting a potential direct war with Russia, the exact step that we want to avoid.”

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the same on Sunday in an interview with NBC News.

“The president’s been very clear about one thing all along as well, which is we’re not going to put the United States in direct conflict with Russia, not have, you know, American planes flying against Russian planes or our soldiers on the ground in Ukraine, because for everything we’re doing for Ukraine, the president also has a responsibility to not get us into a direct conflict, a direct war with Russia, a nuclear power, and risk a war that expands even beyond Ukraine to Europe,” Blinken said on “Meet the Press.”

“That’s clearly not our interest. What we’re trying to do is end this war in Ukraine, not start a larger one,” he said.

In Congress, two Republican legislators — Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois — have called for a no-fly zone to be implemented, while Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said on Sunday that the option should be kept on the table.

However, the idea has been nearly unanimously rejected, with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., saying it would mean “World War III” and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., calling the idea “the U.S. and Russia at war. It’s a bad idea and Congress would never authorize it.”

“Military equipment for Ukraine, humanitarian support for Ukraine, crippling sanction on Russia, movement of U.S. troops to the eastern flank of NATO — these are all the right moves,” he continued. “But direct war between the world’s two nuclear powers should be a non-starter.”

On Friday, NATO leadership again denied Zelensky’s request.

“We are not part of this conflict,” Stoltenberg said at a meeting of the alliance in Brussels. “We have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine, because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering.”

Zelensky criticized the decision in a televised address late that evening, saying, “Today there was a NATO summit, a weak summit, a confused summit, a summit where it was clear that not everyone considers the battle for Europe’s freedom to be the No. 1 goal. Today the leadership of the alliance gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages, having refused to set up a no-fly zone.”",https://news.yahoo.com/foreign-policy-experts-call-for-limited-no-fly-zone-over-ukraine-142427349.html

In an open letter to the Biden administration that was first reported by Politico, 27 foreign policy experts urged for a “limited No-Fly Zone over Ukraine starting with protection for humanitarian corridors that were agreed upon in talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials on Thursday.”

“What we seek is the deployment of American and NATO aircraft not in search of confrontation with Russia but to avert and deter Russian bombardment that would result in massive loss of Ukrainian lives. This is in addition to the request from Ukrainian leaders for A-10 and MIG-29 aircraft to help Ukrainians defend themselves, which we also strongly support,” the group later added.

The foreign policy experts noted that a rapid number of people were fleeing Ukraine and said that the country was facing a “severe humanitarian disaster.”

“The refrain ‘never again’ emerged in the wake of the Holocaust, and Ukrainians are wondering whether that pledge applies to them,” the group wrote. “It is time for the United States and NATO to step up their help for Ukrainians before more innocent civilians fall victim to Putin’s murderous madness.”

The letter to the Biden administration was led by U.S.-Ukraine Foundation co-founder Robert McConnell.

Other notable signatories include former NATO supreme allied commander Gen. Philip Breedlove, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has lobbied the U.S. and NATO for a no-fly zone, but is has been ruled out by the Biden administration because its enforcement would require U.S. and NATO jets to attack Russia jets that violate it.

This would create direct military conflict between the U.S. and Russia, inching the world closer to a nuclear war.

The United States and its NATO allies are facing forceful calls to impose a “no-fly zone” over Ukrainian skies, with the idea of countering Russian aggression in the region, easing humanitarian suffering, and protecting Ukrainian civilians trying to flee the fighting. Ukraine has requested a no-fly zone repeatedly. In the United States, polling shows this is a popular idea: three-quarters of Americans support a NATO-imposed no-fly zone. But a no-fly zone does not equate to a no-combat zone. Quite the opposite. Enforcing a no-fly zone requires the use of military force, and in Ukraine, that would likely mean confronting the Russian military head-on.

While I sympathize with the no-fly zone’s animating idea—to protect human lives—a NATO no-fly zone simply presents an unacceptable, escalatory risk to the United States and its allies – indeed, perhaps to the whole planet. It opens a Pandora’s box of anticipated and unintended consequences. Even if the no-fly zone is narrowly tailored with the express purpose of protecting humanitarian corridors—as signatories to a recent open letter suggested—it would fundamentally turn on U.S. and NATO military engagement with Russia, a nuclear power with an enormous nuclear arsenal. Its leaders have already hinted at potentially using them in exactly this context.

Why would a no-fly zone over Ukrainian territory so significantly escalate NATO and U.S. involvement? A “no-fly zone” doesn’t just magically occur by declaring it so. It requires a massive military presence and military enforcement—a point eloquently articulated by Professor Michael Schmitt. Are the United States and NATO willing to use force against Russian assets on the air and ground? Putin has already made clear that no-fly zone participants would immediately be considered part of the armed conflict. And NATO leaders simply declaring to Putin “that they do not seek direct confrontation with Russian forces” would hardly change his view of the incoming aircraft and firepower that would be sent into the combat zone that his forces are directly contesting.

I approach this question from both an operational and a legal perspective. Twenty years ago, I served as a tactical jet aviator with the U.S. Navy, playing a small role in helping to enforce the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. From personal experience, I can attest that no-fly zones are not benign air patrols. Even in instances where the U.S. enjoys immediate air superiority­ over the skies, we should anticipate that U.S. and NATO planes will be fired upon. In what follows, I address a host of questions that should be answered and understood well before this is viewed as a remotely credible policy option.

What is a no-fly zone and what would it require in Ukraine?

At its most basic level, a no-fly zone is an aerial occupation of a designated, three-dimensional geographic space where certain types of flights are prohibited. A no-fly zone is different from the more benign aerial operations that can sometime occur to help enforce economic sanctions or prevent drugs or illegal smuggling.

To enforce a no-fly zone, military air superiority is a prerequisite to protect NATO pilots. This must be established upfront. This will entail destruction of any land-based air defense systems and aerial combat when allied fighters are challenged by Russian fighters. Because of the S-400’s extraordinary range and Russia’s long border with Ukraine, allied fighters would be exposed from surface-to-air threats from both Russia and Ukrainian territory. Failure to destroy the surface-to-air threat exposes U.S. and allied pilots to extraordinary risk. This fundamental point was reinforced by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates at a congressional hearing in 2011, when he was asked about a proposed no-fly zone in Libya to protect human lives. He stated:

A no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses . . . and then you can fly planes around the country and not worry about our guys being shot down. But that’s the way it starts.

If the United States and its NATO allies are not willing to attack Russian assets upfront, including assets within Russia, their aircraft patrolling the no-fly zone would be heavily exposed to Russian air and ground attacks. Again, this presents a significant and unacceptable risk to American and allied pilots and runs the risk of massive conflict escalation.

Even beyond the need to establish air superiority by attacking Russian assets, enforcing a no-fly zone would require a 24-hour commitment of allied planes. And this includes not just fighter planes from different participating countries that have surface-to-air acquisition radar with comparable advantages in speed and stealth technology. It encompasses much slower early warning E-3 AWACS aircraft and more vulnerable tanker aircraft to keep the fighters airborne without time-intensive ground refueling. A no-fly zone would necessitate the establishment of a new, multinational Joint Forces Air Component Command (JFACC) to help coordinate the campaign. This would conceivably be headquartered in a NATO country or on a NATO command vessel such as the USS Mount Whitney.

Would Russia treat this as a new belligerent power and target the JFACC and NATO fighters accordingly? Putin has already said that a no-fly zone is tantamount to NATO entering the war. While Putin’s words can’t be trusted, his full-scale attack on Ukraine demonstrates a shocking brazenness in his willingness to use force. We simply can’t assume that Putin will back down. Again, a no-fly zone is a significant and extraordinary escalation that could entail a broadening of the conflict beyond Ukraine borders.

Some officials have called on NATO and the United States to implement a “limited” or “humanitarian no-fly zone” to protect fleeing Ukrainians. Don’t be fooled. While I understand and share the noble, human desire to alleviate human suffering, there is not a meaningful difference between a “no-fly zone” and a “humanitarian no-fly zone” in terms of their escalatory risk and implementation. And do we expect that Putin will respect such linguistic nuances? Regardless of a no-fly zone’s label, implementation requires the credible threat of military force where the risk of catastrophic escalation and miscalculation cannot be wished away.

What has been the U.S. experience in recent No-Fly Zones?

Part of the appeal of the no-fly zone course of action may stem from the somewhat successful implementation of no-fly zones in four military operations in Southern Iraq (Operation Southern Watch), Northern Iraq (Operation Provide Comfort/Northern Watch), Bosnia (Operation Deny Flight), and Libya.

But in all four instances, force was used against allied aircraft enforcing the no-fly zones, and allied aircraft used force in response. These were not benign military operations. All four can be characterized as dynamic, kinetic, and deadly. Critically, three of these four no-fly zones were instituted after hostilities had ended, when the United States and its allies enjoyed clear air superiority over the skies. The one exception—Libya—occurred prior to a much broader NATO escalation against Muammar Qaddafi’s regime.

Operation Southern Watch & Northern Watch (1991-2003). These two no-fly zones took place in northern and southern Iraq over a 12-year period. Here, the United States and its allies enjoyed air superiority following the cessation of major hostilities in the First Gulf War. Following the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991, the Kurdish population in the north and the Shia population in the south revolted against Saddam Hussein’s rule. Saddam responded in a brutal manner, attacking Kurds in the north and Shia in the south with airborne attacks from helicopters.

Soon thereafter, the United Nations established a “security zone” in the north, and the Security Council issued Resolution 688 to “prevent the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of Iraq.” While no single Security Council resolution expressly authorized these no-fly zones, the United States and its allies pointed to Security Council Resolutions 678, 687, and 688 in the aggregate as a legal basis to implement the no-fly zone and protect the Iraqi civilian population. The southern no-fly zone prevented Iraqi flight operations below the 33rd parallel of southern Iraq. The northern no-fly zone was established in northern Iraq, north of the 36th parallel, in an effort to protect the Kurdish population. These no-fly zones were patrolled by American and British aircraft, and were at times helped by the French and Turkish air forces. Both no-fly zones remained in place for 12 years—until March 2003—when the Second Gulf War commenced. The zones were successful to a degree in preventing Saddam Hussein from using force against his people. But despite U.S. and allied air superiority in Iraq, airplanes charged with enforcing the no-fly zone were repeatedly fired upon by Iraqi surface-to-air missiles. Professor Schmitt, a onetime legal advisor on the no-fly zone effort, wrote in the Yale Journal of International Law that “force was employed repeatedly.” I share his recollection.

Bosnia-Herzegovina (1992,1995): As part of an effort to facilitate humanitarian assistance during the war in Bosnia, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 781, which prohibited all military flights in the area. Following repeated Serb violations of the no-fly zone, the Security Council in March 1993 issued Resolution 816 which authorized member States “acting nationally or through regional organizations . . . to take all necessary measures to enforce the ban.” In response, NATO launched Operation Deny Flight, which lasted through 1995. This mission also involved U.S. fighter jets on patrol shooting down aircraft violating the zone.

Libya (2011). This is the most recent no-fly zone and was put in place to protect Libyan civilians from Qaddafi’s military-backed forces. It was specifically requested by the head of the Libyan National Transitional Council, who were fighting Qaddafi for control over Libya. The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1973, which provided broad legal authorization to impose an international no-fly zone. It is a particularly strong no-fly zone in both its geographic coverage and its legal enforcement authorization.

What are some lessons learned from these recent no-fly zones?

First, in each no-fly zone, the U.S. and allied fighters had air superiority or were able to achieve air superiority in short order. That is not the case in Ukraine, where NATO is left with a terrible choice at the outset. To establish an effective no-fly zone, it must either achieve air superiority upfront by attacking Russian air defenses or place allied aircraft into an area to enforce a no-fly zone without air superiority. This would expose NATO aircraft to deadly Russian fire. The Russians, for example, have a S-400 mobile weapons system with a range of 400 kilometers that could operate in Ukraine or within Russian territory to strike NATO and Ukrainian aircraft.

Second, despite controlling the skies over Iraq, Libya, and Bosnia, U.S. and allied planes were still fired upon and engaged with hostile forces throughout their enforcement missions. For example, an American and a French fighter were shot down in Deny Flight, and Iraq repeatedly fired at aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones through 2003. We should expect the same to occur over Ukrainian skies, but much more intensely and likely with much deadlier effects. After all, Russian air-to-ground capabilities and its Air Force far outpace Iraqi, Libyan, and Serbian capabilities.

Third, these previous no-fly zones showcased the difficulty of operating in a dynamic airspace where “friendly fire” incidents can occur. This is particularly the case if there is a malfunction in a transponder or other equipment that helps identify friend or foe. Tragically, in 1994, the U.S. Air Force shot down two U.S. Army Blackhawks in the northern Iraqi no-fly zone. From an operational perspective, Russian air capability outpaces Ukraine’s. Would the introduction of new aircraft for a no-fly zone make it more difficult for Ukrainian fighters on the ground to identify friendly or enemy aircraft?

A snapshot of the recent U.S. no-fly zone experience:

Operation Year Legal Basis U.S./Allied Air Superiority? Kinetic Action? Iraq – Southern Watch 1991-2003 Security Council Resolutions 678, 687, 688* Yes Yes Iraq – Northern Watch 1991-2003 Security Council Resolution 678, 687, 688* Yes Yes Bosnia-Herzegovina – Deny Flight 1992, 1995 Security Council Resolution 781, 816 Yes Yes Libya- Odyssey Dawn 2011 Security Council Resolution 1973 Yes Yes Proposed in Ukraine (TBD) 2022 Ukraine permission/Collective self-defense? No ?

* There remains some disagreement about whether these resolutions authorized a no-fly zone.

What laws apply to no-fly zones and what are the rules of engagement?

Ukraine and Russia are engaged in a traditional, international armed conflict. It is certainly lawful for Ukraine to request that other countries come to its aid in collective self-defense against Russia’s aggression. So what would be the status of the no-fly zone participants? As noted, Putin has already made clear that he would consider such an operation as equivalent to NATO entering the war – and in reality, that would be the effect.

Under their rules of engagement (ROE), the U.S. military and allied partners use deadly force in response to a hostile act or demonstrated hostile intent. So many difficult questions flow from just the prospect of placing NATO aircraft in Ukraine’s skies. What if a ground-based Russian S-400 locks onto a U.S. fighter over Ukrainian skies with its fire control radar? This would appear to meet the threshold of hostile intent, justifying a response. Would the United States withdraw or disengage from its mission? Doing so would defeat the purpose of the no-fly zone. Or would it be authorized to fire upon the Russian launcher? Consider, too, that the S-400 could be placed in either Russian or Ukrainian territory—would that matter in the NATO ROE calculus?

Further, what is the outer scope of the mission, and would this include collective self-defense of Ukrainian civilians and military assets, regardless of the threat? For example, would NATO aircraft be authorized to use immediate force – against Russian land or air forces – in defense of Ukrainian civilians who were under attack? What if this threat was occurring outside the no-fly zone? These are just a few of the questions that should be posed, discussed, and debated before any serious discussion continues on a no-fly zone for Ukraine.

What are the conditions for ending a no-fly zone?

While this question may seem premature, the U.S. experience with recent no-fly zones and military operations more generally showcases that the United States usually does not put enough thought into exiting before it enters a military operation. Once no-fly zones are imposed, they are extraordinarily difficult to end. Three of the four no-fly zones discussed above only ended with the commencement of major combat operations. The no-fly zones in southern and northern Iraq lasted 12 years, keeping a constant U.S. presence in the Middle East. For the U.S. Navy, this required a permanent aircraft carrier presence in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. experience with previous no-fly zones as well as our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan highlight the need to think through the exit strategy before even considering the entry strategy.

To be clear, I am horrified at Putin’s actions and what he is doing to the Ukrainian people. And I appreciate the instinct to do something in the face of such horrors. The international community must stand up to Putin, something that it failed to do after his purported Crimean annexation. But the world must stand up to him in ways that do not unduly risk widening the war. A no-fly zone represents an unacceptable risk to the U.S. and NATO of further, massive escalation and miscalculation. This could lead to the unthinkable: direct, prolonged military engagement between Russia and the United States—two major nuclear powers.

The international response to date has been encouraging. The United States and its allies and partners should allow some time for the punishing economic sanctions to take effect while supplying the brave Ukrainians with the weapons and resources they need to continue their heroic fight. But unless conditions in Ukraine fundamentally change, U.S. and allied policymakers should remove any discussion of a Ukraine no-fly zone from the table as a credible policy option.

“What we seek is the deployment of American and NATO aircraft not in search of confrontation with Russia but to avert and deter Russian bombardment that would result in massive loss of Ukrainian lives,” the group wrote. ""It is time for the United States and NATO to step up their help for Ukrainians before more innocent civilians fall victim to Putin’s murderous madness. Ukrainians are courageously defending their country and their freedom, but they need more help from the international community.""

Last month, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki called such a decision “definitely escalating” and said it could put the U.S. “in a military conflict with Russia.”

NATO indicated last week that it has no intentions of establishing a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace as well.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the alliance was ""not part of"" the warfare between Ukraine and Russia, signaling an unwillingness to escalate the conflict to involve other countries.

Zelensky cited the no-fly zone as the most important request of the U.S. when asked by ABC’s David Muir in an interview that aired on Monday.

“For us, the most important today is the security in the sky. We cannot allow Russia to be active there only because they’re bombing us … [Russian planes] need to be shot down, you have to preserve lives.”

The Department of Defense has made numerous overtures to ensure that the Kremlin cannot claim DOD’s actions are escalatory or threatening.

Last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin decided to postpone a ballistic missile test scheduled for this week to avoid the possibility that the test could be used as a way for Russia to justify war maneuvers. The two sides also have a deconfliction line between them to prevent misunderstandings and unintended escalations.
