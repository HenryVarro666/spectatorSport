0,4f23d3d4-afad-4dc2-bfb5-5c4dd3ce4b8a,['Current Time'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Sanctions on Russia should not affect Iran deal: US

New US sanctions imposed on Russia are not related to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and should not have any impact on a potential revival of that agreement, a US State Department spokesperson said.

Ceasefire call by Russia a ‘fiction’: Writer

A UK-based author says Russia’s announcement of the ceasefire in Mariupol was a “fiction”, adding Moscow was following a “script” similar to its actions in Syria.

“Russia has repeated a very familiar script to set these [ceasefires] up and entice people into leaving the city into evacuating through what was supposed to be a safe corridor, and then tried to shell them in order to bottleneck as many people as possible into an area that was going to come under attack,” Keir Giles of the Conflict Studies Research Centre in London told Al Jazeera from Northamptonshire.

“Fortunately, it appears that Ukrainian authorities – who already let’s not forget have been at war with Russia for eight years, and probably knew what was coming, held back from actually launching all of their civilian evacuees down this humanitarian corridor,” he added.

Analyst: Russia yet to bring full military force to Ukraine

Military Analyst Mason Clark, of the Institute for the Study of War, explains why Russia has not used its full military force against Ukraine.”It’s frankly miraculous that they have allowed the Ukrainian Air Force to remain operational … when they should have theoretically had the capabilities to ground it very early on in operations,” he told Al Jazeera.

“So a lot of those higher-end Russian capabilities that we would expect, we haven’t actually seen used yet. It doesn’t, of course, mean that they won’t ever be used, and we are beginning to see some indications of Russians using greater tactical airpower,” he said.

“And of course, as is rightly getting a lot of attention, using possible thermobaric munitions and rocket artillery against civilian targets in Kharkiv and elsewhere.”

‘Putin won’t stop’: Ex-Russian deputy foreign minister

Andrei Fedorov, a former deputy foreign minister of Russia, told Al Jazeera Russian President Vladimir Putin’s objective is to surround Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and then give President Volodomyr Zelenskyy an ultimatum.

“He declared a very clear goal that Ukraine, as it is today, should be changed,” Fedorov said from Moscow. “I’ve known him for many years, he will not stop. Most probably, in the next 5-6 days, the military operation will be extended to much more territory, including Odesa,” he predicted.

“The Russian army will surround Kyiv, and then there will be a kind of ultimatum for maybe 24 hours for Zelenskyy to resign, for the government to resign, to declare something like an interim government or something like this, because from military point of view, it’s very dangerous to start a military attack on Kyiv – it can bring a lot of damages,” Fedorov added.

“Also, let’s not forget that Kiev is playing a very important role in Russia’s history; in Russia it’s called the mother of all Russian cities.”

Russia accuses Ukrainian ‘nationalists’ of thwarting humanitarian corridors: RIA

Stoicism is Kyiv’s new normal

Kyiv, Ukraine – “If you switch off the emotions, the scale of damages is minimal,” a woman who lives on the 15th floor of a new apartment building in central Kyiv, told Al Jazeera.

Kremlin-backed RT America lays off staff RT America, the U.S. cable news network widely seen as one of Putin's mouthpieces in the West, plans to halt production and lay off its employees, according to a memo from T&R Productions, the production company that operated the channel. Misha Solodovnikov, the general manager of T&R Productions, told employees that it will be ""ceasing production"" because of ""unforeseen business interruption events."" (NBC News obtained a copy of the memo. The news was first reported by CNN.) “Unfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&R employees at all locations,” Solodovnikov wrote. An RT America employee who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concern about professional repercussions, said staff members were told they would receive two months of severance. RT America is part of the Moscow-based RT network, which U.S. intelligence agencies have described as ""Russia's state-run propaganda machine."" In late 2017, T&R Productions registered as a foreign agent for the Russian government, according to a Justice Department release.

Ukraine presses U.S. to sanction Russian oil and gas exports Ukraine is calling on the Biden administration to sanction Russia’s oil and gas exports, arguing that it's the only way to put real pressure on Putin to stop the invasion. Andriy Kobolyev, the former head of Ukraine’s state-owned gas company, Naftogaz, flew to Washington this week to make the case for limiting Russia’s fossil fuel exports, meeting with more than a dozen lawmakers from both parties, as well as senior White House and State Department officials. Putin has convinced the ruling elite in Moscow that “the West cannot survive without Russia’s energy supply,” Kobolyev told NBC News. Casting doubt on that premise would shake the foundation of his power, he said. “That sounds like a very hard and painful step, but I don’t see any other way for the West to stop the invasion,” said Kobolyev, who has negotiated with Kremlin officials and Russia’s state-owned Gazprom in his former role. “Eight years ago, everybody was saying Ukraine would not survive without Russian gas. We proved we could.” Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also called for a ""full embargo"" of Russian oil and gas exports this week. Energy analysts say placing sanctions on the world’s third-largest oil producer could trigger a spike in oil prices and wreak havoc on the global economy. But Kobolyev argues that there's sufficient oil production capacity in the U.S. and the global market to withstand the blow. The Biden administration hasn't moved to ban Russian oil in the U.S. or issue sanctions for such products despite growing calls from lawmakers in both parties to cut off Russian imports. However, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week that Biden hasn't ruled out the idea. Share this -







U.S. TV producer charged with violating 2014 sanctions against Russian oligarch Federal prosecutors in New York City have charged a U.S. television producer with violating sanctions by helping a Russian oligarch set up a TV network. The charges against John “Jack” Hanick stem from his work for Konstantin Malofeyev, whom the U.S. sanctioned in 2014 over allegations that he helped finance the promotion of Russian separatists in Crimea. “Malofeyev is closely tied to Russian aggression in Ukraine, having been determined by OFAC to have been one of the main sources of financing for the promotion of Russia-aligned separatist groups operating in the sovereign nation of Ukraine,” U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement, referring to the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The indictment says Hanick worked for Malofeyev from 2013 until at least 2017 to create a Russian cable TV network and a Greek TV network. In addition to violating sanctions, Hanick is accused of making multiple false statements to FBI agents in an interview last month. Prosecutors said he was arrested in London, where he had been living, on Feb. 3. Share this -







U.K. announces more sanctions against Russian oligarchs The United Kingdom announced a “full asset freeze and travel ban” Thursday against Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov, who were described as two of ""Russia’s leading oligarchs with significant interests in the UK and close links to the Kremlin.” According to a statement from the U.K. government, Usmanov has had significant interests in English football clubs Arsenal and Everton, as well as owning luxury real estate. Shuvalov also has two luxury apartments in central London and is a “core part of Putin’s inner circle, and headed up Russia’s bid for the 2018 Football World Cup,” the statement said. “Our message to Putin and his allies has been clear from day one — invading Ukraine would have serious and crippling economic consequences. Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and individuals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war,” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in the statement. “We won’t stop here. Our aim is to cripple the Russian economy and starve Putin’s war machine.” The U.S. government also joined the sanctions against Usmanov and others. Usmanov's superyacht and private jet were among his assets blocked. Usmanov owns one of the world's largest superyachts, known as Dilbar, named after Usmanov's mother. U.S. Dept. of Treasury The superyacht ""has two helipads and one of the world’s largest indoor pools ever installed on a yacht,"" according to the Treasury Department's statement. Usmanov owns a business jet with tail number M-IABU. The aircraft's moniker, Bourkhan, is Usmanov's father's name.

Life under siege: Inside Ukraine's southern cities facing the Russian assault Each morning since Russian forces invaded Ukraine a week ago, Irina Khabaluk has awakened alongside her husband and their two young children feeling anxious about what fresh pain the day will bring. From her apartment in the port city of Kherson, Khabaluk is on the front lines of the fierce fight for Ukraine’s south. Days of intense shelling have left residents like her terrified to leave their homes, feeling helpless while food supplies run low. “There is just shock and disbelief,” Khabaluk, a project manager, said by phone from Kherson, a city of almost 300,000 people, where she has lived all her life. “We stopped saying ‘Good morning’ to each other when we open our eyes, because the morning is never good anymore.” Kherson Mayor Ihor Kolykhaev said Thursday that Russian troops had captured the city, which sits on the strategically important Dnieper River.

U.S. military sets up channel to communicate with Russian military The U.S. military has established channels to communicate directly with the Russian military as a way to deconflict tactical movements around Ukraine, a senior defense official said Thursday. U.S. forces do not have any aircraft flying over Ukraine or ships near where Russia's navy is operating in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, but the U.S. military has assets all around Ukraine. The amount has increased in the past few weeks as the Biden administration has sent more troops and assets to Ukraine's neighbors as a way to shore up NATO ally defenses. With the U.S. military operating in the area, concerns persist of a possibility of a close encounter that leads to a miscalculation and an escalation. To mitigate that, the U.S. European Command has set up a deconfliction mechanism with its counterparts at the Russian ministry of defense. The senior defense official said there is more than one channel and this communication has been operable for about the past day. Share this -







'Historic': E.U. gives temporary protection to those fleeing Ukraine The European Union will give temporary protection to those fleeing the war in Ukraine, it said Thursday.

Unaccompanied children and teenagers will be entitled to legal guardianship. The move was welcomed by Roberta Metsola, the president of the European Parliament, who tweeted that it was “solidarity in action.” I welcome today’s @EUCouncil decision granting temporary protection to people fleeing Putin’s bombs.

Ukrainian government websites briefly defaced with false claims of surrender Some regional Ukrainian government websites were briefly defaced with false claims that the areas have surrendered to Russia, the Security Service of Ukraine said Thursday. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly said the country will not surrender despite Russia's military assault. The announcement of website defacements comes after Ukraine publicly warned that Russia would conduct a disinformation campaign to falsely claim that major Ukrainian political and military leaders had surrendered.

Putin says military operation in Ukraine going to according to plan Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that the military operation in Ukraine was going according to schedule and that objectives have been met. Putin, whose speech was translated into English, spoke with members of his Security Council in a video call and once again claimed that the Russian military was fighting “neo-Nazis” in Ukraine, an accusation experts say is slanderous and false. Putin has long sought to falsely paint Ukraine as a Nazi hotbed, which is a particularly jarring accusation given that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish and lost three family members in the Holocaust. Putin also said Thursday that those fighting in the Russian military were heroes and ordered payment to the families of soldiers who had been killed. Share this -

Putin and Macron share 'not-so-friendly' phone call In a 90-minute phone call Thursday with President Vladimir Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron warned the Russian leader that ""he was committing a serious mistake"" by invading Ukraine, and that ""his actions would punish his own country,"" according to an Élysée Presidential Palace source. Putin initiated the call with Macron, the source said, describing it as ""not-so-friendly.""

Russian and Belarusian athletes barred from the Paralympic Games The International Paralympic Committee has decided to refuse the entry of athletes from Russia and Belarus for the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Games, it said on Thursday. This comes after IPC had earlier on Wednesday allowed the Russians and Belarusians to compete “as neutral athletes”. “In taking our decision yesterday we were looking at the long-term health and survival of the Paralympic Movement,” said the IPC President Andrew Parsons in a statement on Thursday. “However, what is clear is that the rapidly escalating situation has now put us in a unique and impossible position so close to the start of the Games.” Multiple countries had threatened to boycott the games which would put the Games in grave danger – the impact of which would be far reaching, Parsons said. A total of 83 Para athletes have been affected by this decision, he said. “To the Para athletes from the impacted countries, we are very sorry that you are affected by the decisions your governments took last week in breaching the Olympic Truce. You are victims of your governments’ actions,” he said. Share this -







Russian tanks have made 'little discernible progress' towards Kyiv, British defense ministry says A column of tanks advancing towards Kyiv has made ""little discernible progress"" since Tuesday and remains more than 18 miles from the centre of the capital, according to the British Ministry of Defence.

Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol remain under Ukrainian control despite continued heavy Russian shelling, it continued, while the situation in Kherson remains unclear after Russian forces entered the city. Russia had claimed it had seized control over the southern port city.

6,4f23d3d4-afad-4dc2-bfb5-5c4dd3ce4b8a,['Voa News'],,"Ukraine says Russian forces are shelling agreed-upon evacuation routes from Mariupol, as well as the city itself, breaking a cease-fire that was to have gone into effect Saturday at 7 a.m. UTC, as the southern coastal city continued to endure days of relentless aerial attacks.

“We are simply being destroyed,” Mayor Vadym Boichenko said of his city of nearly 450,000 people on his Telegram channel.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a broadcast video that, ""Today, March the fifth, from 10:00 a.m. Moscow time (0700 GMT), the Russian side declares a cease-fire and the opening of humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to leave Mariupol and Volnovakha. Humanitarian corridors and exit routes have been agreed upon with the Ukrainian side.""

Mariupol officials said they are delaying the evacuation plans that called for routes to be open to vehicular traffic for five hours, and they urged residents to take shelter.

Volnovakha, a southern city of about 21,000, also was targeted with Russian “heavy artillery” attacks during the temporary cease-fire, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Saturday in a broadcast video.

Russia’s defense ministry, however, accused Ukrainian “nationalists” of preventing civilians from fleeing Mariupol, according to RIA, Russia’s state-owned news agency. They cited no evidence to substantiate these claims.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Saturday with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau in Rzeszow, one day after declaring Russian forces ""are increasingly using brutal methods in Ukraine, including going at civilian populations.""

His comments followed a Russian attack on a Ukrainian nuclear plant — the largest facility of its kind in Europe — that had sparked a fire in a building at the plant compound, which was said Friday to be extinguished.

After the meeting with his Polish counterpart, Blinken reiterated at a news conference that the U.S. “will defend every inch of NATO territory"" and announced the Biden administration is preparing to allocate an additional $2.75 billion in humanitarian aid for Ukrainian refugees.

Blinken also praised Poland for assisting hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have fled their home country, saying “The people of Poland know how important it is to defend freedom.” He added, “Poland is doing vital work in response to this crisis.”

Polish Foreign Minister Rau said he and Blinken discussed Polish-American bilateral relations, allied cooperation with NATO and the coordination of political activities in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. “Poland will never recognize territorial changes brought about by unprovoked, unlawful aggression,"" he declared.

Speaking to reporters Friday before a meeting with his European Union counterparts in Brussels, Blinken said, ""We are faced together with what is [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin's war of choice: unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences.""

""We're committed to doing everything we can to make it stop,"" he added, but he ruled out imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying such an action could lead to a broader conflict.

""We have a responsibility to ensure the war does not spill over beyond Ukraine. … A no-fly zone could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe,"" he said.

The meeting in Brussels came after Ukraine accused Russia of ""nuclear terror"" for shelling and starting a fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant before taking control of it. The plant is in the city of Enerhodar in the country's southeast.

Ukraine's nuclear inspectorate said that no radiation had leaked at the plant and that personnel were continuing to operate the facility safely. Firefighters were able to get the blaze under control, Ukrainian officials said.

The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting Friday to discuss the attack at the request of Britain, France, Ireland, Norway and Albania.

""The world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,"" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during the meeting. ""We've just witnessed a dangerous new escalation that represents a dire threat to all of Europe and the world.""

Konashenkov blamed the attack on a Ukrainian ""sabotage group"" that he said had occupied the plant's training building, attacked a Russian patrol and set the building on fire as it left. He offered no evidence, and no other country appeared to take the claim seriously.

On the ground

Despite its heavy shelling of Mariupol and Volnovakha, there were fewer Russian aerial and artillery attacks in Ukraine over the past 24 hours compared to previous days, the British defense ministry tweeted Saturday on the 10th day of Russia’s attack on its western neighbor.

The ministry said Ukraine continued to control the northern cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, as well as Mariupol in the southeast. The ministry cited reports of street fighting in the northeastern city of Sumy and said “It is highly likely that all four cities are encircled by Russian forces” as they advance toward the southwestern city of Odessa.

On Friday, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said that Russian ground forces are attacking a Ukrainian town near Odesa and the U.S. is watching to see what it means for the city.

A Russia convoy outside the capital, Kyiv, was still trying to reach the city, he said, but the ""actions by the Ukrainians have in fact stalled that convoy … stopped it in some places.""

Ukraine's use of its air and missile defenses has been ""quite extraordinary,"" Kirby said.

A Russian diplomat said Friday that Russia has no intention of occupying Ukraine should its invasion be successful, and that its troops will withdraw once it has fulfilled its objective.

Speaking to reporters at U.N. headquarters in Geneva, Russian Ambassador Gennady Gatilov called the invasion a ""military operation with limited objectives,"" which he said were to ""denazify the regime and demilitarize Ukraine.""

Ukraine is a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust. Many historians and political observers view Russia's invocation of World War II as disinformation.

Possibility of more sanctions

Blinken said Friday the United States was considering additional sanctions against Russia and had not ruled out anything.

""Nothing is off the table. We are evaluating the sanctions every day,"" he said.

The number of Ukrainians seeking refuge in other countries could reach 1.5 million by the end of the weekend, the head of the United Nations refugee agency said Saturday, an increase from the 1.3 million who already have fled.

U.N. Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad, who is meeting in Ukraine with local and international officials, said in a statement Saturday that efforts are underway “to urgently find operational modalities to scrape up operations across lines and from outside into areas impacted by the conflict.”

Bent on restoring the might of the Soviet empire, this narrative goes, the Russian autocrat audaciously invaded Ukraine to fulfill a revanchist desire for some combination of land, power and glory.

In a typical account operating under this framing, Politico described Putin as “the steely-eyed strongman” who proved immune to “traditional tools of diplomacy and deterrence” and had been “playing Biden all along.” This telling suggests that the United States exhausted its diplomatic arsenal and that Russia’s horrifying and illegal invasion of Ukraine, which has involved targeting civilian areas and shelling nuclear plants, could never have been prevented.

But according to a line of widely overlooked scholarship, forgotten warnings from Western statesmen and interviews with several experts — including high-level former government officials who oversaw Russia strategy for decades — this narrative is wrong.

Many of these analysts argue that the U.S. erred in its efforts to prevent the breakout of war by refusing to offer to retract support for Ukraine to one day join NATO or substantially reconsider its terms of entry. And they argue that Russia’s willingness to go to war over Ukraine’s NATO status, which it perceived as an existential national security threat and listed as a fundamental part of its rationale for the invasion, was so clear for so long that dropping support for its eventual entry could have averted the invasion.

Recognizing this possibility does not excuse Moscow’s actions, which are heinous. Nor does it mean Russia’s insistence on regional hegemony is fair or ethical. And ultimately, it is no guarantee that Putin would not have invaded anyway. There are other factors — including, but not limited to, Putin's general anger over Kyiv drifting away from Russian influence and domination and his isolation as a decision-maker — that may have been sufficient to drive the invasion.

But the abundance of evidence that NATO was a sustained source of anxiety for Moscow raises the question of whether the United States’ strategic posture was not just imprudent but negligent.

Ukrainians might be paying with their lives for the United States’ reckless flirtation with Ukraine as a future NATO member without ever committing to its defense.

The fact that the NATO status question was not put on the table as Putin signaled that he was serious about an invasion — so plainly that the U.S. government was spelling it out with day-by-day updates — was an error, and potentially a catastrophic one. It may sound cruel to suggest that Ukraine could be barred, either temporarily or permanently, from entering a military alliance it wants to be in. But what’s more cruel is that Ukrainians might be paying with their lives for the United States’ reckless flirtation with Ukraine as a future NATO member without ever committing to its defense.

Analysts say it’s widely known that Ukraine had no prospect of entering NATO for many years, possibly decades, because of its need for major democracy and anti-corruption reforms and because NATO has no interest in going to war with Russia over Ukraine’s Donbas region, where Russia has meddled and backed armed conflict for years. But by dangling the possibility of Ukraine’s NATO membership for years but never fulfilling it, NATO created a scenario that emboldened Ukraine to act tough and buck Russia — without any intention of directly defending Ukraine with its firepower if Moscow decided Ukraine had gone too far.

But for the West to offer to compromise on Ukraine’s future entry into NATO would have required admitting the limitations of Western power.

“It was the desire of Western governments not to lose face by compromising with Russia,” Anatol Lieven, senior research fellow on Russia and Europe at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and the author of “Ukraine and Russia: A Fraternal Rivalry,” told me. “But it was also the moral cowardice of so many Western commentators and officials and ex-officials who would not come out in public and admit that this was no longer a viable project.”

The West didn't want to set limits on NATO's enlargement and influence or lose face. So what it did was gamble.

“The choice that we faced in Ukraine — and I'm using the past tense there intentionally — was whether Russia exercised a veto over NATO involvement in Ukraine on the negotiating table or on the battlefield,” said George Beebe, a former director of Russia analysis at the CIA and special adviser on Russia to former Vice President Dick Cheney. “And we elected to make sure that the veto was exercised on the battlefield, hoping that either Putin would stay his hand or that the military operation would fail.”

What's happened has happened, and there’s no going back. But it still matters.

The U.S. must do everything it can do to end this war — which is already brutalizing Ukraine, rattling the global economy, and could quite easily spiral into a nuclear-armed confrontation between the U.S. and Russia, if things get out of hand — as swiftly as possible, including negotiating on Ukraine's NATO status and possible neutrality with an open mind. And over the longer term, Americans must realize that in an increasingly multipolar world, reckoning with the limits of their power is critical for achieving a more peaceful and just world.

Expanding NATO was always hugely controversial

NATO was originally formed as a military and political alliance between the U.S., Canada and several Western European nations in 1949. It was meant to serve as a collective defense organization to contain the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and its most important provision, Article 5, held that an attack on one member of the alliance was an attack against all of them.

In 1990, the West led the Soviets to believe NATO would not expand further eastward across Europe in exchange for Germany reunification and the agreement that the new Germany would be a NATO member. Most famously, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker once assured Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that the NATO alliance would move “not one inch eastward” in exchange for this agreement, but as the late Princeton University scholar Stephen Cohen pointed out in 2018, this pledge was in fact made multiple times by several Western countries.

These assurances were not honored, and NATO has expanded eastward over the years to include many more countries, all the way up to Russia’s borders.

“It is the broken promise to Gorbachev that lingers as America’s original sin,” Cohen said then.

NATO’s expansion was hugely controversial in policy circles in the 1990s. As foreign policy commentator Peter Beinart has noted, around the time the Clinton administration was considering NATO in the '90s to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic — a debate that almost caused President Bill Clinton's Secretary of Defense William Perry to resign — many influential voices dissented:

George Kennan, the living legend who had fathered America’s policy of containment against the Soviet Union, called NATO expansion “a strategic blunder of potentially epic proportions.” Thomas Friedman, America’s most prominent foreign policy columnist, declared it the “most ill-conceived project of the post-Cold War era.” Daniel Patrick Moynihan, widely considered the most erudite member of the US Senate, warned, “We have no idea what we’re getting into.” John Lewis Gaddis, the dean of America’s Cold War historians, noted that, “historians—normally so contentious—are in uncharacteristic agreement: with remarkably few exceptions, they see NATO enlargement as ill-conceived, ill-timed, and above all ill-suited to the realities of the post-Cold War world.”

The major concern was that expansion would backfire — that it would, as Kennan put it in 1997, “inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion.” Indeed, Russia hated it. As Lieven previously told me, for decades the Russian political establishment and commentators have vociferously objected to NATO expansion and “warned that if this went as far as taking in Georgia and Ukraine, then there would be confrontation and strong likelihood of war.”

Russia perceives NATO as an existential threat

Russia is no longer at the helm of a global superpower, but it is still, at the very least, a regional great power, and as such it devotes considerable resources to exerting its influence beyond its borders and using the states around it as buffers. Russia views Ukraine, a large country to which it has long-running cultural and historical ties, as a particularly critical buffer state for protecting its capital.

The issue that Russia saw in NATO was not just an expanding military alliance, but one that had shifted gears to transforming and proactively intervening in global affairs. After the end of the Cold War, NATO’s raison d’être no longer existed, but instead of disbanding, its mission shifted to democracy promotion. The carrot of membership in NATO was used to encourage countries to adopt liberalization and good governance and align with U.S. political, economic and military interests.

It is imperative that America develops a clearer understanding of its adversaries and behaves more judiciously in an increasingly multipolar world.

Of particular concern to the Russians have been NATO’s operations outside of NATO countries. The Russians were shocked by NATO’s bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, where NATO not only intervened in the affairs of a non-NATO country, but took sides against the Serbs, allies of the Russians, and did so without United Nations Security Council approval. NATO has also been involved in regime change and nation-building projects in places like Libya and Afghanistan.

“NATO is a defensive organization; I don't think it had any plans on Russia,” Thomas Graham, a former special assistant to the president and senior director for Russia on the National Security Council staff from 2004 to 2007, said regarding NATO’s expansion of territory and widening scope of operations. “All that said … if you put yourself in the position of people in the Kremlin, you can see why they came to that conclusion.”

Things turned up a notch in 2008, when NATO declared that Ukraine and Georgia “will become members” of NATO. It did not specify a timeline, and it was assumed that it was conditional on the countries adopting political reforms, but it infuriated the Russians.

As a way to reassert its dominance in the region, Russia invaded Georgia later that year. In another sign of Russia’s intolerance of losing out to Western influence in those countries, Putin annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea in 2014 in the wake of the protest-spurred ouster of Ukraine’s Russia-friendly president, which the West favored.

John Mearsheimer, an international relations scholar at the University of Chicago, argued that a number of factors, including Ukraine’s potential integration into the Western European economy, played a role in Russia’s concerns in 2014, but NATO enlargement was the “taproot” of the crisis and Russia wanted to make sure that, among other things, a NATO base couldn’t be set up in Crimea as Ukraine drifted toward the U.S.

Mearsheimer also warned that this was foreshadowing, and Ukraine’s pseudo-membership status was going to bait Moscow and result in catastrophe. “The West is leading Ukraine down the primrose path, and the end result is Ukraine is going to get wrecked,” he said in a lecture.

Russia has grown concerned again about Ukraine for a number of reasons. Analysts like Lieven and Beebe point out that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has taken a number of sharp measures to eradicate Russian influence in Ukraine recently by doing things like banning the use of Russian language in schools and state institutions, shutting down Kremlin-linked television stations and arresting some of the most prominent Russo-sympathetic leaders in the country — all while cooperating on the ground with NATO. Russia read this as a sign that Kyiv was throwing its lot in with the U.S. and the prospect of an agreement ensuring autonomy for the separatist-held Donbas region, crucial to Russia’s plan to thwart Ukraine’s NATO entry, might be dead.

Our current crisis

All this brings us to the crisis at hand. The takeaway of this very quick survey is not to convince you to agree with Russia’s assessment that NATO posed an existential threat to it or that it is justified in its great power politicking. As Beebe put it, whether or not Russia’s perception is accurate or justified “is immaterial to whether that perception is genuinely held and to whether they will act on that perception.” What matters is that there is clear evidence that Russia sees NATO as destabilizing, pro-democratic and anti-Russian — and clear evidence that it was willing to use force to counter NATO's enlargement.

Moreover, Putin sent clear signals that he was serious about pulling the trigger if he didn't get something. Shifting some 150,000 troops along Ukraine’s border for weeks was a real cost, and it placed pressure on him to not back down without extracting a major concession and risk losing face in front of Russia’s political elite.

“I thought, and continue to think, that we should have made a deal, that there was a deal to be had — not a deal that we liked, obviously, but a deal that the realities of the situation that we're facing required,” Beebe said.

Graham, the former NSC official, also said the U.S. made a mistake in its approach. Ukraine’s future NATO membership didn’t necessarily have to be permanently taken off the table, but the U.S. “had to be prepared to talk about it in a serious way,” he said.

Justice is circumscribed by practical matters that require us to contemplate the possibility of making things worse through imprudent action.

Emma Ashford, resident senior fellow with the New American Engagement Initiative in the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, wrote in an email that it was a “pity” that “NATO’s open-door principle was not up for debate.” Though she was skeptical about the political ability of the West to “promise to close NATO’s open door, particularly in a way that would have been credible to Moscow,” she said there were potential ways to deal with Moscow’s concerns, such as “a moratorium on NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia, conventional arms control agreements limiting the scope of NATO military integration and cooperation with Ukraine, or some form of negotiated Ukrainian neutrality.”

The idea behind a moratorium — of, say, 20 years — is to provide a way for the West to propose to Russia that the issue can be taken up by a future generation of leaders, at a time when Russia's political class has changed and geopolitics may have shifted.

Whether or not opening up on the question of Ukraine’s NATO status or neutrality in some way would’ve been enough to stop Putin from pursuing war is unknowable, every expert I spoke to stressed. After all, maybe by this point changing Ukraine’s NATO status would not have allayed Putin’s concern that Ukraine was irrevocably slipping out of Russia’s sphere of influence and overcome his conception of Ukraine as Russia’s lost property. There are also always unprovable and unfalsifiable explanations for his behavior — including, but not limited to, a concern with securing his legacy, paranoia and a lack of access to accurate information due to his accumulation of power within the Kremlin.

All we do know is that the NATO element mattered a great deal to Russia’s political establishment, and there’s reason to think it could’ve changed the course of negotiations. When things looked dicey, it was worth trying.

It seems unjust that Ukraine might not be let into an alliance it wants to be part of to protect itself from a country like Russia. I would say it is. But alliances choose their own members and must weigh the geopolitical consequences of expanding them — the enhanced possibility of war chief among them. As with so many issues in politics, justice is circumscribed by practical matters that require us to contemplate the possibility of making things worse through imprudent action.

As Stephen Wertheim, a senior fellow in the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told me, NATO’s oft-touted “open door” policy is supposed to be based on Article 10 of the treaty, but the meaning is often misunderstood.

""In recent decades, the open door has instead come to entail dangling the possibility of membership to other states, never foreclosing that possibility, and sometimes speaking as though states have a right to join NATO if they so choose (when in fact they have a right merely to ask to join),"" he wrote.

That dangling is incredibly dangerous, and it's possible that it just caused Ukraine to experience the worst of all worlds: not receiving NATO protection while also enduring one of the most aggressive forms of Russian domination possible.

Many of the experts I spoke to said Ukraine's neutrality or some kind of altered NATO status should be part of the discussion in diplomatic backchannels. Critics will say this constitutes “appeasement” of Putin. But as Biden has already made clear, the U.S. is not willing to wage war with Russia, and it certainly isn't going to allow Ukraine into NATO when Russia is attacking it, since that would require all of NATO to go to war with Russia. The issue now is to think clearly about how to end a conflict that could spiral into World War III.

It is imperative that America develops a clearer understanding of its adversaries and behaves more judiciously in an increasingly multipolar world. It is not difficult to imagine the U.S. making a miscalculation over what China would be willing to do to secure its domination of the South China Sea. The U.S. may want to be the only great power in the world, free to expand its hegemony with impunity, but it is not. Refusing to see this is dangerous for us all.",https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/russia-s-ukraine-invasion-may-have-been-preventable-n1290831
8,4f23d3d4-afad-4dc2-bfb5-5c4dd3ce4b8a,"['Analysis Nathan Hodge', 'Tara John', 'Josh Berlinger']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"Moscow (CNN) Russia's assault on Ukraine is just a week old, but its consequences have already been catastrophic.

In the seven days since Russian troops invaded their western neighbor, hundreds of people have been reported dead and one million have fled for their lives . Energy prices are skyrocketing and food prices could be next

No one can say for sure what will happen in the coming days and weeks, but years of relative peace and stability in Europe have already been ruptured, and should the fighting stretch on for months, the crisis could have even greater ramifications.

What happens to Kyiv?

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been very clear about his basic goals in invading: He wants to disarm Ukraine, sever its ties to the NATO military alliance and end the Ukrainian people's aspirations of joining the West.

He has also said he wants to rid the country of what he calls the ""gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people,"" a baseless and highly-charged reference to Ukraine's democratically-elected government and its Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelensky

Russian forces are encircling the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in an apparent push to topple the government, and a 40-mile-long military convoy is edging toward the city, which has been targeted by multiple rocket and missile attacks in recent days.

Zelensky has vowed to keep fighting, but he is under no illusions that Putin's forces ""want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.""

Should those forces take the capital, Ukraine does have other politicians who might be eager to fill the ranks of a pro-Russian puppet regime.

One of Putin's top allies in Ukraine is Viktor Medvedchuk , a prominent politician and oligarch. He faces allegations of treason in Ukraine and has been under house arrest, but his exact whereabouts are unclear.

Territorial goals

Russian forces are also waging campaigns far from Kyiv, attempting to take control of key cities in Ukraine's south and southeast, including Kherson.

The mayor of Kherson effectively admitted that Ukrainian forces had ceded control of the city on Wednesday, saying in a statement on his Facebook page that residents would have to accept the direction of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- in other words, Russian forces.

One former NATO Commander told CNN: ""It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea."" Richard Shirreff, NATO's former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, said the land corridor was ""an obvious objective.""

""He's had Crimea in the Russian Federation since 2014, he's only been able to supply it across the Kerch Strait bridge, and so of course he's looking to establish that land corridor down off the Sea of Azov,"" Shirreff added.

If Russian forces capture the port city of Odessa, it is possible to imagine Moscow creating a land bridge extending all the way across southern Ukraine, potentially even linking Transnistria -- a separatist enclave in Moldova, where Russian troops are stationed -- to Odessa, Crimea and southern and eastern Ukraine.

A partitioned Ukraine

Parts of modern-day Ukraine previously belonged to interwar Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania -- and before that, to the Austro-Hungarian empire. If Putin has partition in mind, Galician Ukraine and the city of Lviv -- close to the Polish border -- could potentially be a part of a sort of rump Ukrainian state, while Russia focuses its attentions on the east of the country.

A division along these lines could make Ukraine ""look like Germany in the Cold War era, with western Ukraine more dependent on Europe, and the Eastern part"" sucked into the Russian spheres of influence, which include Belarus, Russian historian and author Alexander Etkind told CNN.

That kind of redrawing of borders may be an expansionist fantasy, but it could separate out what Moscow -- justifiably or not -- perceives as a more nationalist part of Ukraine.

Scorched earth battle tactics

So far, Ukrainian forces have managed to hold their own against the bigger and much better equipped Russian military

US officials have noted how stretched Russia's supply lines have become even in the early stages of invasion. As one senior US official explained to CNN, Russia anticipated a fast victory and may have neglected to plan for sufficient resupply of its forces.

But US administration officials expect Russia to ramp up its operations in Ukraine, and Putin has previously shown scant regard for human rights or the rules of modern warfare.

Russia's air force backed President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war, providing overwhelming firepower to crush the country's armed opposition groups and flattening entire neighborhoods in the process.

Experts fear the Kremlin could resort to this kind of scorched earth policy in Ukraine, should resistance efforts continue to thwart their plans.

Former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus said Monday that the Russian military had already started using such tactics, including cluster bomb munitions. He also said the Kremlin was bringing in thermobaric munitions -- sometimes known as vacuum bombs -- which create a prolonged pressure wave that can suck the oxygen out of a room or a person's lungs. Use of such weaponry in civilian areas is proscribed by international humanitarian law.

""I fear we'll see more of that,"" Petraeus said. ""They will rubble some cities, I suspect, because in some ways they almost have to depopulate areas or they are not secure in them, and we've seen them do that in the past.""

The US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Wednesday that Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine: ""We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield.""

US President Joe Biden said Wednesday he believes Russia is intentionally targeting civilians in Ukraine -- but declined to say whether he believed war crimes were being committed.

Sanctions

The Kremlin acknowledged Wednesday that Russia's economy is taking ""serious blows,"" as unprecedented sanctions and the country's growing isolation piles pressure on its tottering financial system.

International companies have begun shutting down or suspending their Russian operations.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, announced Tuesday it had stopped selling all of its products in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine, while Boeing and Airbus are suspending their support for Russian airlines.

Russia's energy riches haven't been directly targeted by Western sanctions, but many of the world's biggest oil companies are quitting the country or halting new investments. Moscow is also finding it harder to sell shipments of Russian crude oil to traders and refineries worried about being caught in the net of financial sanctions.

But experts say Putin has overseen a push to wean Moscow's oil-dependent economy off the dollar in recent years, and has limited government spending and stockpiled foreign currencies.

Putin's economic planners have sought to boost domestic production of certain goods by blocking equivalent products from abroad. Moscow has meanwhile amassed a war chest of $630 billion in international reserves -- a huge sum compared to most other countries -- that can be spent if sanctions bite.

It remains to be seen whether such measures will help Russia avoid economic calamity as its invasion continues.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/what-happens-next-russia-ukraine-cmd-intl/index.html
