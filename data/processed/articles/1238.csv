*This figure refers to the number of civilians killed or injured by explosive weapon use in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 Feb 2022, gathered using incident-specific English language media reporting. See AOAV’s methodology.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the 24th of February 2022, hundreds – if not thousands – of civilians have been killed and injured across the country. Russian air strikes, missile strikes, and artillery shelling have targeted densely populated urban centres, apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, military bases and vital infrastructure nationwide. The UN estimates that over a million people, mostly women and children, have fled Ukraine into neighbouring Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, and the number of internally displaced people continues to grow. Humanitarian corridors of evacuation have been attacked, lines of traffic stretch kilometres at border crossings and out of major cities, and a fuel crisis and freezing temperatures compound the struggle to find safety. Men between the ages of 18 and 60 have been banned from leaving the county, and millions of civilians remain in Ukraine, sheltering from the violence of the Russian advance, providing essential goods and services, and fighting alongside Ukrainian armed forces.

Civilian casualties have been reported in the nation’s capital Kyiv, eastern Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, as well as Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Zhytomyr, and Odessa, among others.

Since the start of the recent fighting, Ukraine’s interior ministry estimates that at least 2,000 civilians have died as of 3 March, though emergency services say this number is just an estimation as many people remain trapped under rubble and ongoing bombardments. Ukraine’s government has said that at least 11,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, while Russia’s Defence Minister Igor Konashenkov claims that 498 Russian troops have been killed and more than 1,500 wounded. Konashenkov said that among Ukrainian troops, 2,870 have been killed, around 3,700 injured and 572 captured.

As of 6 March 2022, the OHCHR said that 1,123 civilian casualties in Ukraine have been verified: 364 killed, including 25 children, and 759 injured, since the Russian invasion began.

Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) – which takes its sources from reputable English language media – has recorded 585 casualties from explosive weapon use since the Russian invasion began (24 Feb – 10 Mar), across 64 incidents. 339 civilian casualties were recorded (249 killed, 200 injured), and 136 armed-actor casualties (102 killed, 34 injured). Among the civilian casualties are at least 39 children, 18 women and 43 men.

97% (434) of civilian casualties have occurred in populated areas. Of the total recorded casualties (including armed-actors), 97% (569) have occurred in populated areas.

Air-launched explosive weapons (specifically air strikes) have caused 51% (229) of civilian casualties. Ground-launched explosive weapons (missile strikes, artillery shelling, and rockets) have caused 48% (215) of civilian casualties. >1% (5) of civilian casualties have been caused by naval-launched weapons and landmines.

Civilian casualties from explosive weapons have been recorded in Kyiv (108 civilians), Kharkiv (88), Chernihiv (80), Donetsk (71), Sumy (34), Zhytomyr (29), Mykolaiv (11), Odesa (10), Luhansk (8), Vinnytsia (6), Kherson (3), and Cherkasy (1).

The location-types in which civilian casualties have been reported are urban residential areas (174 civilian casualties), Multiple urban spaces (74 civilians), villages (43), hospitals (39), public buildings (30), schools (24), commercial premises (18), other (13), armed bases (9), town centres (6), transport related infrastructure (5), no location information (5), roads (3), hotels (3), agricultural land (2), and markets (1).

AOAV’s casualty figures represent the lowest of estimations in terms of the number of people killed and injured by explosive weapon use. In an effort to quantify the explicit harm caused by specific explosive weapons, AOAV solely records incident-specific casualty figures, as reported in English-language media. Much of the casualty reporting since the beginning of the invasion has focussed on cumulative or region-specific casualty figures, making it unclear precisely when and where these deaths and injuries occurred. Each recorded incident of civilian harm from the use of explosive weapons since the beginning of the Russian invasion is listed below.

Civilian Casualties in Ukraine, 2014-2021

Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) has monitored an escalation in violence in the Donbas region, which borders Russia, and where violence between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists has occurred since 2014.

Between 2014 and 2021, AOAV recorded 5,242 deaths and injuries in Ukraine, including 2,704 civilians and 2,538 armed actors and security personnel. Of the civilian casualties recorded, 2,381 (88%) were caused by explosive weapon use in populated areas.

Ground-launched weapons, such as shelling, mortars, rockets, or grenades, for example, have accounted for 2,459 civilian casualties since 2014 – 91% of total civilian casualties.

Of the civilian casualties, the vast majority occurred in 2014 and 2015, with 1,428 and 862 civilian deaths and injuries in these years respectively. Despite continued sporadic shelling across the line of control, which divides the region of Donbas, civilian casualties have fallen quite consistently since 2014, with 28 recorded last year. Fewer civilian casualties are also likely to have occurred as numerous civilians have fled the worst impacted areas in Donbas since 2014, leaving an aging population, many of whom cannot leave.

In many instances of shelling since 2014, the perpetrator has not been identified, but where they have, Ukrainian separatist forces have been responsible for at least 667 civilian casualties and Ukraine for 783.

In the days preceding the Russian invasion, there was an increase in shelling across the line of control, which has resulted in seven civilian casualties. At least three civilians were injured on February 17th when separatist shelling hit a school in Luhansk. On the same day, separatist shelling left another woman injured in Marinka as she waited for a bus. Shelling by Ukrainian forces was also reported to have left one woman injured on February 17th. On February 20th, 2 civilian deaths were reported due to Ukrainian shelling in occupied areas of Luhansk. And, on February 21st, a civilian was killed and homes damaged by separatist shelling on Donetsk.

This escalation in violence and the Russian invasion is likely to be disastrous for civilians, as highlighted by the statement released today by the International Network on Explosive Weapons (INEW), of which AOAV is a founding member.

AOAV condemns the use of violence against civilians and the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. AOAV encourages all armed actors to stop using explosive weapons with wide-area affects where there is likely to be a high concentration of civilians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-casualty-monitor-aoav-data-harm-civilians-explosive-weapons

The Russian military has continued its unsuccessful attempts to encircle Kyiv and capture Kharkiv. The Russians continued to attack piecemeal, committing a few battalion tactical groups at a time rather than concentrating overwhelming force to achieve decisive effects. Russian commanders appear to prefer opening up new lines of advance for regiment-sized operations but have been unable to achieve meaningful synergies between efforts along different axes toward the same objectives. They have also continued conducting operations in southern Ukraine along three diverging axes rather than concentrating on one or attempting mutually supporting efforts. These failures of basic operational art—long a strong suit of the Soviet military and heavily studied at Russian military academies—remain inexplicable as does the Russian military’s failure to gain air superiority or at least to ground the Ukrainian Air Force. The Russian conventional military continues to underperform badly, although it may still wear down and defeat the conventional Ukrainian military by sheer force of numbers and brutality. Initial indications that Russia is mobilizing reinforcements from as far away as the Pacific Ocean are concerning in this respect. Those indications also suggest, however, that the Russian General Staff has concluded that the forces it initially concentrated for the invasion of Ukraine will be insufficient to achieve Moscow’s military objectives.

Operations to envelop Kyiv remain Russia’s main effort. Russian troops are also continuing three supporting efforts, one to seize Kharkiv, one to take Mariupol and secure the “land bridge” connecting Rostov-on-Don to Crimea, and one to secure Kherson and set conditions for a drive west toward Mykolayiv and Odesa.

The Russian attack on Kyiv likely consists of a main effort aimed at enveloping and ultimately encircling the city from the west and a supporting effort along the axes from Chernihiv and Sumy to encircle it from the east.

Russian forces in the south resumed offensive operations toward Mykolayiv on March 3 after securing Kherson on March 2, but do not appear to pose an imminent danger to Odesa. Russian forces likely seek to force Mariupol to capitulate by destroying critical civilian infrastructure and killing civilians to create a humanitarian catastrophe—an approach Russian forces have repeatedly taken in Syria.[1]

Key Takeaways

Russian forces opened a new line of advance from Belarus south toward Zhytomyr Oblast, west of Kyiv, as Russian forces attempting to encircle Kyiv from the northwest were driven further west by determined Ukrainian resistance and counterattacks. Russian forces will struggle to complete an encirclement of Kyiv at all if they have to advance along ring roads as far from the city center as those they are now using.

Russian forces on the east bank of the Dnipro River remain unable to secure the important town of Chernihiv or to break through Ukrainian defenses in the northeastern outskirts of Kyiv.

Russian ground forces have remained relatively static near Kharkiv as Russian artillery, air, and missile bombardments wreak devastation in the city. The Ukrainian military indicates that a regiment-sized Russian formation will try to envelop or bypass Kharkiv in the coming days. Similar Russian attempts at such operations elsewhere in Ukraine render the success of such an undertaking at that scale unlikely.

Russian forces are attempting once again to open a line of advance through northern Luhansk Oblast, possibly to assist efforts at Kharkiv or, as the Ukrainian General Staff assesses, to drive on Dnipro and Zaprozhya. The Russian forces currently reported as engaging in that drive are far too small to attack either city successfully and are probably insufficient to sustain a long drive on their own.

Russian troops have surrounded Mariupol and are attacking it brutally to compel its capitulation or destroy it.

The mayor of Kherson conditionally surrendered to the Russians, allowing Russian forces to renew their advance on Mykolayiv, which they have done. The Ukrainian military nevertheless reportedly defeated an attempted Russian air assault to take an airfield near Mykolayiv.

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis consist of a main effort aimed at enveloping and ultimately encircling the city from the west and supporting efforts along the Chernihiv and Sumy axes to encircle it from the northeast and east.

The Ukrainian General Staff published an assessment of Russia’s likely plan to encircle Kyiv on March 3. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at 6:00 am local time on March 3 that Russian forces are attempting to conduct offensive operations in the area of Kozarovychi (40km north of Kyiv) on the west bank of the Dnipro River toward Vyshhorod (15km north of Kyiv); Fastiv (70km southwest of Kyiv and approximately 50km south of Russia’s current furthest point of advance west of Kyiv); and Obukhiv (40km directly south of Kyiv).[2] The Ukrainian General Staff likely assesses that Russian forces seek to encircle Kyiv from the west along a line running through these towns. Russian forces remain far from all four towns except Kozarovychi and likely will require further combat power to complete the encirclement of Kyiv. The Ukrainian General Staff reported at noon local time on March 3 that Russian forces committed an additional battalion tactical group (BTG) to operations against Kyiv along an unspecified axis.[3]

Ukrainian Airspace Remains Contested

Russia has not achieved air superiority over Ukraine as of March 3. The Ukrainian Air Force continues operating a week after the invasion began, with the Ukrainian General Staff reporting that Ukrainian Su-24s and Su-25s conducted airstrikes in Kyiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, and Kharkiv oblasts in the last 24 hours.[4] Ukrainian air defenses reportedly intercepted a Russian missile targeting Kyiv’s main railway station, which remains packed with refugees, the night of March 2.[5] Russian failures to secure air superiority likely reduce the effectiveness and extent of Russian air and missile attacks, increase the risk to Russian airborne and air assault operations, and force Russian ground combat units to face periodic air attack, likely degrading their operations to some extent. Russia’s failures in the air superiority fight are very surprising; ISW cannot offer any explanations for them at this time.

Russia Continues Clandestine Operations and Prepares More Disinformation

Russian efforts within and in the immediate vicinity of Kyiv have reportedly relied on saboteurs and reconnaissance elements, often out of uniform or wearing Ukrainian uniforms, rather than on attacks by regular combat forces. ISW cannot confirm any new developments in central Kyiv on March 3. Ukraine’s Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) warned Ukrainians that Russian forces may employ a deepfake video depicting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s surrender to Russia on March 3.[6] The GUR warned that Russia could use such a deepfake video to demoralize the Ukrainian population and convince Ukrainians to surrender.

Russia Likely Mobilizing Reinforcements from the Far East and Donbas

Russian social media users observed new trains loaded with combat vehicles likely of the Eastern Military District (EMD) in Khabarovsk, far eastern Russia.[7] These elements will likely deploy to Belarus to reinforce the EMD’s existing axis against Kyiv from the northwest. Ukraine’s commander in chief claimed on March 3 that Russia mobilized residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR) and is transporting them to Belgorod via mainland Russia to support assaults on Kyiv.[8] Ukraine’s commander in chief also claimed that Russia is transporting DNR and LNR citizens via Krasnodar to Crimea to support a Russian assault on Odesa.[9]

Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro

Ukrainian forces halted Russian efforts to extend their western envelopment of Kyiv into Zhytomyr Oblast directly west of Kyiv. The Ukrainian General Staff reported halting Russian forces in Pirozhky, Rizniya, and Ukrainka as of noon local time on March 3.[10] These towns are just west of Makariv, where Ukrainian forces halted Russian advances on March 2. Ukrainian forces additionally likely shot down a Russian Su-30 over Irpin on March 3.[11] Russian forces are likely unsuccessfully attempting to extend their envelopment of Kyiv westward to bypass Ukrainian forces around Makariv.

Russian forces additionally opened a new line of advance into northern Zhytomyr Oblast from Belarus, advancing roughly 20km into Ukraine toward Bihun and Ovruch as of noon local time on March 3.[12] ISW cannot currently assess the concentration of Russian forces on this new axis of advance. The Ukrainian General Staff reported two Russian BTGs are operating in Zhytomyr Oblast as a whole but did not differentiate between operations west of Makariv and new Russian advances across the Belarusian border.[13]

Russian forces continued to assemble supplies in Borodyanka, Katyuzhanka, and Gavronshchyn, north of Kyiv.[14] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces began assembling logistics camps in these towns on March 2. Russian forces are likely further deploying supplies and munitions forward from Belarus, but heavy cloud cover impeded satellite imagery north of Kyiv on March 2-3.

Subordinate supporting effort — Chernihiv axis

Russian forces did not attempt assaults on Chernihiv on March 3, instead bypassing the city to advance on the outskirts of Kyiv.[15] Elements of Russia’s 41st Combined Arms Army and 90th Tank Division remain concentrated in Lyubech and Mena west and east of Chernihiv, respectively.[16] Russian forces continued to shell Chernihiv on March 3, destroying a school and killing nine civilians.[17]

Ukrainian forces reported that two BTGs of Russia’s 2nd Combined Arms Army are advancing toward eastern Kyiv along the “Peremoha-Brovary” axis.[18] Elements of the Russian 200th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade are additionally participating in this line of advance.[19] Ukrainian forces likely halted Russian forces in Peremoha on March 2.[20] Ukrainian forces additionally halted Russian advances in Korosten, 30km south of Chernihiv.[21]

ISW cannot confirm the presence of any Belarusian forces in operations on the Chernihiv axis. Ukrainian Territorial Defense authorities claimed on March 1 that Belarusian combat troops have entered Chernihiv District in support of the Russian offensive.[22]

Subordinate supporting effort — Sumy axis

Ukrainian forces halted Russian offensive operations towards Nizhyn and Pryluky (approximately 130km northeast of Kyiv) by seven BTGs of Russia’s 2nd and 6th Combined Arms Armies, supported by missile and artillery assets, as of noon local time on March 3.[23]

Russian forces did not attempt assaults on Sumy March 3, instead concentrating on further advances toward Kyiv’s northeastern outskirts.[24] Two BTGs from the Pacific Fleet’s 200th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade continued to keep Sumy, Lebedyn and Okntyrka ”under siege” as of March 2.[25] Ukraine’s 93rd Separate Motorized Brigade reported destroying several Russian tanks near Sumy on March 2 and 3.[26]

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv: Russian forces will likely attempt to encircle Kharkiv in the next 24-48 hours. The Ukrainian General Staff reported six Russian BTGs around Kharkiv “moved to the defense” on March 3, but additionally assessed that three BTGs will “probably make an attempt to surround Kharkiv from the south.”[27] Russian forces likely seek to encircle and bypass Kharkiv before bombarding it to force a capitulation—as Russian forces are currently similarly attempting against Mariupol. Russian forces continued to deliberately target civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv with multiple-launch-rocket systems (MLRS), tube artillery, cluster munitions, and Kalibr cruise missiles on March 3.[28] The Russian air, artillery, and missile barrage may be intended to generate panic and reduce the morale of Ukrainian defenders in Kharkiv and elsewhere. It is not likely to achieve that effect. It is too early to evaluate the likelihood that a renewed Russian ground offensive will succeed in taking the city.

The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 3 that two Russian BTGs will “probably try to advance in the direction of Izum [south of Kharkiv]” from northern Luhansk Oblast with the eventual objective of taking Dnipro and Zaporizhya from the north.[29] If confirmed, this would be a wide Russian enveloping maneuver, likely seeking to cut off all Ukrainian forces in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. Two BTGs would be unable to complete this encirclement, let alone attack two large cities.

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol: Russian forces fully encircled Mariupol as of March 2 and are conducting a deliberate campaign to destroy critical civilian infrastructure and residential areas in a likely attempt to force the city to surrender. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Mariupol is “stable” as of noon local time on March 3, though LNR forces (likely supported by Russia’s 8th Combined Arms Army) continued attacks on the city.[30] ISW cannot confirm the status of Ukrainian defenders or the extent of Russian attacks on the city on March 3.

The LNR announced that it captured the seven towns of Novoaidar, Krasnorichens'ke, Epifanovka, Stepnoy Yar, Havrylivka, Starobilsk, and Andriivka in Luhansk Oblast on March 3.[31] ISW assesses that Russian proxy forces control Havrylivka, Starobilsk, and Krasnorichens'ke, but cannot confirm Russian proxy control over Novoaidar, Krasnorichens'ke, Epifanovka, and Andriivka at this time.[32] Ukraine’s General Staff acknowledged that that LNR forces continued offensive operations near Novoaidar at 6:00 am local time on March 3.[33]

The Ukrainian General Staff additionally published photos on March 2 of a Russian plan Ukrainian forces captured from a battalion of the Black Sea Fleet’s 810th Naval Infantry Brigade.[34] The plans stated that Putin authorized a Russian invasion of Ukraine on January 18, planned at that time to run from February 20 to March 6. The BTG reportedly planned to conduct an amphibious landing at Stepanovka, on the Sea of Azov, before operating with elements of the 58th CAA and 117th Naval Infantry Regiment to surround and seize Melitopol. No such landing occurred.

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and west: Russian forces secured a negotiated surrender of Kherson on March 2 and continued advances toward Mykolayiv on March 3, including a failed airborne landing. The mayor of Kherson confirmed that no Ukrainian forces remain in the city and that ""for the Ukrainian flag to continue flying over us"" he negotiated several conditions with Russian forces, including a strict curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. and forbidding civilians from walking in groups larger than two or confronting Russian forces.[35] Russian forces deployed additional reserves and resumed offensive operations toward Mykolayiv on March 3.[36] Ukrainian forces additionally defeated a heliborne assault by Russian VDV (airborne) or special forces on Balovne, an airport near Mykolayiv.[37]

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces committed reserve elements of the 205th Motor Rifle Brigade of the 49th Combined Arms Army towards both Mariupol and Zaporizhya on March 3.[38] Russian forces will likely struggle to fully resource three simultaneous lines of effort from Crimea – Mikoayiv, Zaporizhya, and Mariupol. Russian forces have not made territorial advances towardsZaporizhya since March 1.

Global crackdown on Russian state-affiliated media continues as Russia blocks Facebook

In response to the invasion of Ukraine, governments and corporations have implemented new regulations and policies to mitigate the reach of Russian state-affiliated media within their borders and on their services.

Notably, the Council of Europe filed a regulatory amendment that effectively bans two Russian state media outlets, RT and Sputnik. In response, Meta, TikTok, and Twitter announced that they would comply, restricting the outlets across their platforms in the European Union. At the same time, YouTube took similar measures, with company officials noting that it will take time to ramp up its efforts. RT and Sputnik content remains accessible on these services outside the European Union, although multiple platforms are taking steps to demonetize, de-rank, or add labels to limit their spread.

In China, popular social media platforms Douyin, Weibo, WeChat, and Bilibili announced they had begun to delete content, accounts, and comments spreading alleged misinformation, calling for war, or making vulgar remarks.

Globally, Apple and Microsoft announced that they would remove RT and Sputnik apps from their app stores outside of Russia, with Microsoft announcing limited distribution through its search and news services, as well as a ban from their advertising services. Spotify also removed these outlets from its platform and closed its Moscow office. Reddit, meanwhile, banned Russian state-media links and ads originating in and targeting Russia, as well as quarantined the subreddits r/Russia and r/Russianpolitics from the platform’s search results.

Online streaming and television providers have also begun to drop RT, with both DirectTV and Roku banning the content on their services, and Skynews halting distribution of programming. Meanwhile, Netflix refused to comply with a Russian government mandate to carry 20 state media channels.

According to a memo obtained by CNN, RT is closing its North American production studios and laying off most of its employees “as a result of unforeseen business interruption events.” In an email, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan insisted on the trustworthiness of the outlet’s reporting and told readers that they are “strong and brave.”

The response from Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media regulator, has been swift. It demanded that Google cease the distribution of allegedly false information about the ongoing invasion, faulted YouTube for sparking protests in the country, and requested that restrictions on the Russian football club PFC CSKA’s channel be removed. Roskomnadzor also called on Telegram to remove content regarding the Russian Armed Forces, and warned citizens against providing or distributing personal data online regarding relatives or friends in the military.

By March 4, Russia officially announced it had blocked Facebook. Roskomnadzor justified its decision by noting, “Since October 2020, 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media and information resources by Facebook have been recorded. In recent days, the social network has restricted access to accounts: the Zvezda TV channel, the RIA Novosti news agency, Sputnik, Russia Today, the Lenta.ru and Gazeta.ru information resources.”

In a statement on Twitter, Nick Clegg, Meta’s president for global affairs, said, “Soon millions of ordinary Russians will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out.”

BBC attempts to circumvent blocking by Russia

Following Russia’s blocking of the BBC’s online Russian service, the broadcaster re-upped its 2019 article on Twitter explaining how to access BBC reporting on the dark web in Ukrainian and Russian via the Tor browser, which helps internet users avoid government censorship and surveillance.

Reports of Russia cutting Web access to the BBC, Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Deutsche Welle, were confirmed on March 4. According to the Guardian, the BBC website is “available at only 17% of normal levels in Russia.” Two days before its blocking, the BBC reported that the audience of its Russian language news website “more than tripled its year-to-date weekly average, with a record reach of 10.7m people.” The report added, “People in Russia are turning to BBC News in their millions for factual independent information about the war in Ukraine.”

RT en Español attempts to circumvent restrictions in Latin America

The Spanish version of Russian state broadcaster RT is trying to circumvent restrictions in Latin America after it was banned in Europe and ceased activities in the United States. On March 2, announced a change in its satellites, saying, “In many [Latin American] countries, TV shows were not available due to the massive restriction of RT’s signal.” Its website published information about the satellite changes for cable operators.

The broadcaster is also trying to teach its audience how to evade possible future restrictions by boosting its social media accounts. Inna Afinogenova, presenter of the YouTube Channel “Ahí Les Va” ( 1.1 million subscribers), suggested audiences should follow RT on traditional social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook, as well as on Telegram, VK, and Odysee. Alternatively, she added, viewers could use VPNs to access RT content. Notably, Afinogenova used the word guerra (“war”) in the video, despite reports of the word being banned by Russian state media.

RT en Español is one of RT’s most popular language services on social media, with more than twice the number of Facebook followers than RT in English – 18 million followers versus 7.4 million followers, respectively. The invasion interrupted a downward trend in the number of RT Facebook followers, which previously peaked in December 2021. RT en Español’s Telegram channel has also experienced an increase in subscribers and views since Russia invaded Ukraine, with more than 160,000 subscribers at the time of publishing.

Belarusian resistance ramps up to oppose war in Ukraine

On March 3, a group of Belarusian protesters from the organization Women of Minsk were photographed openly protesting the invasion of Ukraine. The photo, shared by Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, shows six women with their faces covered, walking in Minsk. It is unclear if they were arrested. On the same day, the independent Belarusian media outlet NEXTA announced that Oleg Gruzdilovich, a Belarusian journalist with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, had been sentenced to one-and-a-half years in a penal colony.

Courageous Belarusian women took a walk around Minsk protesting against the war in Ukraine – despite the risk of arrest.

On March 1, photos surfaced of an anti-war protester and a child in Minsk. Footage showed the protester being detained; the status of the child is unknown. The same day, news emerged of Belarusian protesters working to disrupt Russia’s movements in the country. These protesters, who refer to themselves as partisans, are reportedly former Belarusian policemen. The partisans reportedly burned control stations at Baranavichy and Gomel train stations, and shortened rail chains at Mahiliou station.

On March 2, a video emerged of a lone anti-war protester marching down a traffic-filled road in central Minsk. According to the report, the man was immediately arrested. Also that day, two partisans were arrested due to “terrorist activities,” and now face up to 20 years in prison. Meanwhile, videos of Belarusian volunteers forming military groups and joining the fight in support of Ukraine continue to emerge. The groups are fighting under the country’s former white-and-red flag.

Russian momentum continues in Ukraine’s south while stalling in the north

Russia’s momentum continues in the south while stalling in the north, as Ukrainian forces lose territory in the east. In each region, the impact of the war on civilians continues to worsen. With Russia increasingly reaching the new conclusion that Ukrainian cities will not be taken unopposed, instances of rocket, missile, and artillery attacks against civilian population centers have increased in multiple cities. The DFRLab previously reported on Russia’s use of cluster munitions against Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Other major cities like Chernihiv, Izyum, and Severodonetsk remain under consistent shelling, with graphic social media footage documenting the deaths of dozens of Ukrainian civilians. Russia is also tightening its siege of Mariupol, which will likely lead to a surge in civilian casualties.

Dead and wounded Russian fighters brought to Minsk

On March 2, reports and videos emerged of Russian ambulance convoys bringing wounded soldiers to hospitals in southern Belarus. The Wall Street Journal reported a “constant flow” of wounded Russian soldiers being brought to Belarusian hospitals.

This comes amidst reports that the morgues in Gomel and Mozyr are filled to capacity. Belarusian opposition representative Anna Krasulina alleged that most of the dead are Chechens whose remains are being “stored” to prevent Chechnya from calculating an accurate death toll.

Russian foreign minister and Kremlin media threaten nuclear war

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned that if WWIII were to occur, it would be nuclear and destructive, according to Kremlin-owned outlet RIA. This follows an announcement last week from Russia that its strategic nuclear forces are on alert amid the war in Ukraine. At the same time, Kremlin media has justified the invasion into Ukraine with claims that Ukraine is creating a dirty bomb, intentionally misleading audiences that such a bomb would be the destructive equivalent of a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, a pro-Kremlin outlet published a map identifying potential US targets for a Russian nuclear strike, as other fringe outlets and forums have discussed ways to survive a nuclear explosion.

Russia broadcasts nationwide ‘lesson’ on ‘liberation mission’ in Ukraine

Russia’s Education Ministry broadcast a nationwide lesson titled “Defenders of Peace” on Thursday evening. The goal was to reach young Russians and inform them “in detail about the background of the events unfolding around Ukraine, explain the danger NATO poses to Russia, and help [people] learn to distinguish lies from the truth.”

According to Lenta.ru, more than five million schoolchildren watched the lesson dedicated to the “liberation mission in Ukraine.” The lesson highlighted the “common history, traditions, cultural heritages” between Ukrainians and Russians. In addition, the lesson stated that “residents of Donetsk, Luhansk, and Crimea chose the side of Russia.”

Lenta.ru also reported a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurred during the broadcast, but did not result in any technical issues.

Meanwhile, Meduza reported that prior to announcing the nationwide lesson, the Russian government disseminated teaching guidelines to schools explaining why Russia’s “operation” in Ukraine “is not a war.”

Russian pro-war social media campaign fails to gain traction on Twitter and Facebook

Kremlin–controlled media reported on the emergence of an alleged grassroots campaign in support of Russia’s so-called “military operation” in Ukraine. Campaigners used the hashtag #МнеНеСтыдно (#IAmNotAshamed) to show their support for Russia. This comes after many Russian celebrities and citizens publicly stated that they were ashamed of their country’s invasion of Ukraine. As part of the campaign, people in Russia placed a zig-zag pattern resembling the letter “Z” on their vehicles, sheds, and windows to show support for Russian forces who have used this marking on their military equipment, likely used to avoid so-called friendly fire incidents.

Engagement with the campaign on Twitter was relatively minor, and the hashtag did not trend in Russia. In contrast, the hashtag #НетВойне (#NoToWar) previously trended on the platform, but has steadily dropped in mentions since February 24.

Activity around the pro-Kremlin hashtag on Facebook and Instagram was also modest, in terms of the number of posts published, when compared to anti-war hashtags. At the time of writing, there were only sixteen posts on Facebook and seventy-two posts on Instagram using the #МнеНеСтыдно hashtag. In contrast, there were thousands of posts using the anti-war hashtag #НетВойне, according to a query conducted using the monitoring tool CrowdTangle. On Instagram, however, the pro-Kremlin hashtag had on average more than twice as many interactions as the anti-war hashtag.

Polish extremists attack non-white refugees escaping Ukraine

As thousands of refugees from Ukraine cross the Polish border daily, Polish media reported that Polish far-right activists physically attacked non-Ukrainian refugees on March 1 in the border city of Przemyśl. Right-wing Twitter account @PrawaStronaa posted a video showing how Polish football fans chasing “black immigrants” in Przemyśl.

In parallel with these attacks, various actors on Facebook pushed false claims that non-Ukrainian refugees were committing crimes in eastern Poland. On March 2, the Facebook page Przemyśl Zawsze Polski (“Przemyśl Always Polish”) posted that economic migrants who came from Ukraine to Poland stabbed a young Polish woman and looted several shops. The post claimed that several local groups of football fans joined forces to “clean up the city” of undocumented migrants, supposedly receiving approval from the residents of Przemyśl. On March 4, the Facebook page removed this post. Grzegorz Braun, leader of the far-right party, Confederation in the Polish Parliament, openly supported the creation of such “Citizens Patrols” in Poland.

In response to rumors about crimes committed by non-Ukrainian refugees, Polish police tweeted they had not recorded an increased number of crimes after the refugee influx, and stated that such claims are not true. The DFRLab has previously reported that amid Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, social media accounts in Poland tried to revive anti-Ukrainian sentiments.

Russians fearing sanctions and prosecution seek to leave the country

Independent Russian media outlets Meduza, The Village, and Media Zona reported on the personal stories of Russians seeking to leave the country amid the war in Ukraine. Media Zona wrote about people’s experiences with Russian border control. Four out of six stories on Media Zona reported on involuntary mobile phone searches seeking out pro-Ukrainian Telegram channels, and questions testing travelers’ loyalty to the Kremlin. Meduza discussed the varying reasons for emigrating from Russia, including economic sanctions and fear of being prosecuted for dissent. The Village reported on the limited travel destinations and flights available for Russians due to the stiff sanctions imposed on the Russian aviation industry after Putin invaded Ukraine.

Some Russians have turned to online forums to discuss plans to emigrate. An unofficial poll conducted by the Russian portal TJournal revealed that 68 percent of respondents planned to leave Russia.

Some of the Russians who shared their stories with Meduza and Media Zona had departed for Georgia, Turkey, or Armenia, as these are easily accessible destinations. An increasing number of Russians are seemingly seeking refuge in Armenia and Turkey to escape prosecution, economic hardship, or European restrictions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine.

Additionally, the DFRLab identified many posts on Facebook discussing opportunities to leave Russia. Similar posts were identified on Twitter.

New sanctions tighten grip on Belarus

On March 2, EU diplomats approved new sanctions against Belarus, including its timber, steel and potash industries. The sanctions reportedly will ban around 70 percent of all imports from Belarus to the EU. That same day, the US hit the Belarusian economy with sanctions restricting exports.

On March 3, International Paralympic Committee banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from the Beijing Winter Paralympics. Initially the committee had planned to allow the athletes to compete under no flags, but changed its stance due to public pressure. On the same day, the World Bank announced that it will stop all its programs in Russia and Belarus effective immediately.
