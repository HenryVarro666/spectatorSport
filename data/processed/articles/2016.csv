0,2cf3e56a-7ec1-4b64-8076-dc5d5abd4d1d,['Terry Austin'],2022-03-14 11:32:16+00:00,"Tatiana Perebeinis was a 43-year-old accountant working for a California start-up company in Irpin, Ukraine. She became famous this week as her photo appeared on the front page of the New York Times. It wasn’t a flattering photo. Along with her 9-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son, they were lying face-up on a paved street with armed soldiers kneeling over them attempting resuscitation.

Apparently, they had darted across a damaged bridge into the city of Kyiv when they were hit by a Russian mortar. The photo splashed on newspapers and websites across the country and around the world brought the reality of the war to those of us sitting comfortably in our homes, complaining about the price of gas or the unfairness of mask mandates. There is much suffering out there that most of us reading these words will never experience.

Whenever confronted with suffering like this, one of the most frequent questions people ask is, “Where is Jesus in this?” I’ve often said that if I were to be an atheist, it would be because there is no answer to the problem of how an all-powerful, loving God can allow the atrocities people experience every day. Where is Jesus in all of this?

We have comforted ourselves with the conclusion that “God’s ways are not our ways.” In other words, just accept that we can’t understand it; perhaps God will tell us someday. Some even believe God is using evil men and destructive acts to punish people and accomplish God’s will. Thus, we have screwball TV evangelists proclaiming that when Hurricane Katrina wiped out New Orleans it was God’s punishment on homosexuals, and we have theologians who teach us that God destroyed the Canaanites so God’s people could have the land.

It seems to me this concept is flawed. They support the notion that God is all-powerful, but there doesn’t seem to be much love involved in God’s power. How easy would it be for Sergii Perebeinis, husband and father, to believe in a loving God as he buries his family? Where is Jesus in all this?

I’m confident you’ve asked that question yourself about a personal situation — perhaps a death, sickness, financial struggle, the list is endless. All of us have struggled with the problem in the past two years about the COVID epidemic and the staggering loss of life, probably close to 1 million Americans.

I discovered a book about two years ago that set my mind ablaze with a fire for understanding God that has only grown more intense since. The writer is Jim Palmer. The book is titled Being Jesus in Nashville: Finding the Courage to Live Your Life (Whoever or Wherever You Are).

Palmer’s premise is that we need to stop figuring out what Jesus would do (because we can’t do much of what he did anyway) and focus on simply “being Jesus.” Haven’t we always believed Jesus is omnipresent? He is everywhere. Jesus called out 12 men to go into the world for him. He established the church (you and me) to do the same thing. What Baptist hasn’t memorized Matthew 28, “go into all the world?” We are already Jesus in the world. Wherever we go, he is there.

There is a great TV series on Prime Video that captures this concept. I don’t know if it’s an accident or intentional, but it perfectly depicts what I think it means to be Jesus. The show, As We See It, tells the story of three autistic young people living in an apartment with a caregiver. That caregiver is Mandy. How she relates to the difficult situations posed by these young people is a clear reflection of how Jesus relates to difficult people and those who suffer.

Mandy shows how to love people who seem to be unlovable. She guides when they need help, lifts them after they make a mistake or do something inappropriate, reassures them of her love and presence when they are hurt. She doesn’t fix them (she can’t); she lives with them. She doesn’t judge them (they’ve already been judged); she guides them. She doesn’t scold them (they get that from everyone else); she understands how they feel. She cries when they cry.

As We See It is great writing but not nearly as good as the gospel of Jesus. Yet, we miss the story and don’t see Jesus.

We ask where Jesus is when a woman and her children are stretched out dead on a Ukraine street, and we miss the point. Too often, we answer it by thinking he is with the Ukrainian army as they fire rockets back at the Russians. We thought God was with Israel’s warriors when they annihilated the Canaanites. No! There’s nothing loving about that. God was with the Canaanites. Love means that when someone you love is suffering, you suffer with them.

Every parent knows this about love. How does it feel when your child is sick? It hurts. We suffer. Imagine if it hurts for us, how much more does it hurt for God whose love exceeds ours. The temptation is to believe that God is always with the victors, but the truth is that God loves “the whole world” (John 3:16 and many others).

“The temptation is to believe that God is always with the victors, but the truth is that God loves ‘the whole world.’”

Early in the Ukraine crisis, I watched a news video of women and children on a train, fleeing the bombing. The destination was Poland, across the border. These women had few possessions, only what could be carried by mom and her children. Many of them didn’t know anyone in Poland or any other country. They were running from certain destruction to a place where they didn’t know how they would survive.

As I watched the video, I asked, “Where is Jesus in all this?”

Then I saw him. There were crowds of people waiting for the train. One couple was interviewed. They said they had room for eight at their house, and they brought two cars to get them home. Agencies, Christian and non-Christian, had representatives to take people to shelters. Food and water were distributed. There was a stack of stuffed animals for the kids. Baby strollers were lined up next to an elevator for mothers exhausted from carrying a child. Jesus was clearly visible.

The question was posed to theologian Peter Enns about why the Bible contains “so many bizarre, offensive and un-Christlike images of God.” His response needs to be heard by all of us as we try to figure out how we got our notion that God condones hateful and violent experiences. Enns said, “Because God let his children tell the story.”

From our perspective as God’s children, we always want to associate God with the strong; God is omnipotent, after all. Jesus showed up to teach us that God associates with the lowly. The Apostle Paul understood this: “But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things — and the things that are not — to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him” (1 Corinthians 1:27-29).

Next time you watch a news report with footage of a war-ravaged neighborhood, look for Jesus. He’s also battered, bruised and bleeding, looking much like he probably did hanging on the Cross. That’s how much he hurts when we hurt.

By the way, Jesus also may be seen in the midst of the Russian people, struggling to find food and get access to money, who are suffering economically because of this war. I’ll even suggest Jesus feels your pain as you pump 20 gallons into your Toyota, but it’s not nearly as painful.

Terry Austin says from his first day of life he was taught to love the church. He has lived out that passion in various ways as a pastor, church consultant, author and critic. He is currently a full-time writer and book publisher and actively engaged with house churches.

4,2cf3e56a-7ec1-4b64-8076-dc5d5abd4d1d,"['Yuras Karmanau', 'The Associated Press Via Nexstar Media Wire']",2022-03-12 15:40:42+00:00,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces pounding the port city of Mariupol shelled a mosque sheltering more than 80 people, including children, the Ukrainian government said Saturday as fighting also raged on the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv.

There was no immediate word of casualties from the shelling of the elegant, city-center mosque. Mariupol has suffered some of the greatest misery from Russia’s war in Ukraine, with unceasing barrages thwarting repeated attempts to bring in food and water, evacuate trapped civilians and to bury all of the dead.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Turkey said 86 Turkish nationals, including 34 children, were among the people who had sought safety in the mosque of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and his wife Roksolana. Opened in 2007 and modeled after a mosque in Istanbul, Turkey, the white-walled mosque and its towering minaret were proudly advertised as a popular scenic draw by city authorities before Mariupol became a target of Russian barrages.

Around Kyiv, artillery barrages in multiple areas sent residents scurrying for shelter as air raid sirens rang out across the capital region. Britain’s Defense Ministry said Russian ground forces massed north of Kyiv for most of the war had edged to within 25 kilometers (15 miles) of the city center.

The massive column of Russian fighters also has spread out, likely to support an attempt to encircle Kyiv, the British ministry said.

Ukraine’s military and volunteer forces have been preparing for a feared all-out assault. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has said that about 2 million people, half the population of the metropolitan area, have left and that “every street, every house … is being fortified.”

As artillery pounded Kyiv’s northwestern outskirts, two columns of smoke — one black and one white — rose southwest of the capital after a strike on an ammunition depot in the town of Vaslkyiv caused hundreds of small explosions. A frozen food warehouse just outside the capital also was struck in an apparent effort to target Kyiv’s food supply.

Russia’s slow and grinding tightening of a noose around Kyiv and the bombardment of other population centers with artillery and air strikes mirror tactics that Russian forces have previously used in other campaigns, notably in Syria and Chechnya, to crush armed resistance.

Mariupol, with its strategic Black Sea port, has seen some of the greatest suffering. As of Friday, the death toll in Mariupol passed 1,500 during 12 days of attack, the mayor’s office said. A strike on a maternity hospital in the city of 446,000 this week that killed three people sparked international outrage and war-crime allegations.

The ongoing bombardment forced crews to stop digging trenches for mass graves, so the “dead aren’t even being buried,” the mayor said. An Associated Press photographer captured the moment when a tank appeared to fire directly on an apartment building, enveloping one side in a billowing orange fireball.

Russian forces have hit at least two dozen hospitals and medical facilities since they invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to the World Health Organization. Ukrainian officials reported Saturday that heavy artillery damaged a cancer hospital and several residential buildings in Mykolaiv, a city 489 kilometers (304 miles) west of Mariupol.

The hospital’s head doctor, Maksim Beznosenko, said several hundred patients were in the facility during the attack but no one was killed.

The invading Russian forces have struggled far more than expected against determined Ukrainian fighters. But Russia’s stronger military threatens to grind down the defending forces, despite an ongoing flow of weapons and other assistance from the West for Ukraine’s westward-looking, democratically elected government.

A senior Russian diplomat warned that Moscow could target foreign shipments of military equipment to Ukraine. Speaking Saturday, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow has warned the United States “that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn’t just a dangerous move, it’s an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets.”

Russia’s troops are likely to see their ranks bolstered soon from abroad. Denis Pushilin, the Russia-backed head of a separatist region in eastern Ukraine, said Saturday that he expects “many thousands” of fighters from the Middle East to join the rebels and fight “shoulder-to-shoulder” against the Ukrainian army.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Friday that Russian authorities have received request from over 16,000 people from the Middle East who are eager to join the Russian military action in Ukraine. He added that many of those people have previously fought together with Russia against the Islamic State group.

Thousands of soldiers on both sides of the war in Ukraine are believed to have been killed along with many civilians. At least 2.5 million people have fled the country, according to the United Nations refugee agency.

The Ukrainian chief prosecutor’s office said Saturday at least 79 children have been killed and nearly 100 have been wounded since the start of the war. most of the victims were in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Sumy, Kherson and Zhytomyr regions, the office said, noting that the numbers aren’t final because active fighting continues.

On the ground, the Kremlin’s forces appeared to be trying to regroup and regain momentum after encountering tough resistance and amassing heavy losses over the past two weeks.

“It’s ugly already, but it’s going to get worse,” said Nick Reynolds, a warfare analyst at Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank.

Russian forces were blockading Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, even as efforts have been made to create new humanitarian corridors around it and other urban centers so aid can get in and residents can get out.

Ukraine’s emergency services reported Saturday that the bodies of five people — two women, a man and two children — were pulled from an apartment building that was struck by shelling in Kharkiv.

The Russians also stepped up attacks on Mykolaiv, located 470 kilometers (292 miles) south of Kyiv, in an attempt to encircle the city.

New commercial satellite images appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas that stood between the Russians and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, 33 kilometers (20.5 miles) from Kyiv, the company said.

On the economic and political front, the U.S. and its allies moved to further isolate and sanction the Kremlin. President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. will dramatically downgrade its trade status with Russia and ban imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds.

The move to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status was taken in coordination with the European Union and Group of Seven countries.

“The free world is coming together to confront Putin,” Biden said.

With the invasion in its 16th day, Putin said Friday that there had been “certain positive developments” in ongoing talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators. He gave no details.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared on video to encourage his people to keep fighting.

“It’s impossible to say how many days we will still need to free our land, but it is possible to say that we will do it,” he said from Kyiv.

Zelenskyy also accused Russia of kidnapping the mayor of one city, Melitopol, calling the abduction “a new stage of terror.” The Biden administration had warned before the invasion of Russian plans to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine. Zelenskyy himself is a likely top target.

American defense officials said Russian pilots are averaging 200 sorties a day, compared with five to 10 for Ukrainian forces, which are focusing more on surface-to-air missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and drones to take out Russian aircraft.

The U.S. also said Russia has launched nearly 810 missiles into Ukraine.

Until recently, Russia’s troops had made their biggest advances on cities in the east and south while struggling in the north and around Kyiv. They also have started targeting areas in western Ukraine, where large numbers of refugees have fled.

Russia said Friday it used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in the western cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk “out of action.” The attack on Lutsk killed four Ukrainian servicemen, the mayor said.

Russian airstrikes also targeted for the first time Dnipro, a major industrial hub in the east and Ukraine’s fourth-largest city, with about 1 million people. One person was killed, Ukrainian officials said.

In images of the aftermath released by Ukraine’s emergency agency, firefighters doused a flaming building, and ash fell on bloodied rubble. Smoke billowed over shattered concrete where buildings once stood.

The United Nations political chief said the international organization had received credible reports that Russian forces were using cluster bombs in populated areas. International law prohibits the use of the bombs, which scatter smaller explosives over a wide area, in cities and towns.

5,2cf3e56a-7ec1-4b64-8076-dc5d5abd4d1d,[],,"KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has threatened to break off talks with Moscow should Russian forces wipe out the remaining Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Mariupol as Moscow claimed it had taken control of the besieged and battered port city after a weeks-long battle.

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.
