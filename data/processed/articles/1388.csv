The Ukrainian forces have shown consistently that they are willing to slaughter their own people in order to blame Russia. This has been the one constant. These are the people using human shields.

There was so much of this leaking out on social media and Telegram that even the Washington Post last week was forced to admit that the Ukrainians’ main tactic is human shields.

You can read that. They try to put as much lipstick on as possible, but ultimately do say that the Ukrainian forces are relying heavily on human shields.

And what happened to the Mariupol theatre bombing Russian atrocity war crime? It sure did disappear from the news quick! That’s because every piece of evidence showed that Azov locked the civilians in the theatre and then bombed it themselves to blame Russia. The US refused to release any satellite footage, or anything else that would have implicated Russia.

Conversely, Russia has zero record of targeting civilians.

This is just made up. It’s an atrocity hoax. The Ukraine yet again killed a bunch of its own people – this time in an area where the Ukrainians themselves confirm there were no Russian forces – and blamed it on Russia.

The media is running with it and blowing it all up. But no one who didn’t already believe in the Ukraine hoax is going to believe this.

RT:

Moscow will convene an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council over an incident in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, Russia’s deputy permanent representative to the organization, Dmitry Polyansky, said on Sunday. Ukraine has accused Russia of massacring civilians in the town, while Moscow dismissed the incident as having been staged by the Kiev forces. “In light of the blatant provocation by Ukrainian radicals in Bucha, Russia has demanded a meeting of the UN Security Council to be convened on Monday, April 4. We will bring to light the presumptuous Ukrainian provocateurs and their Western patrons,” Polyansky said in a Telegram post. Graphic footage from Bucha, a town to the northwest of Kiev, emerged over the weekend, showing multiple bodies clad in civilian clothing scattered around. Kiev was quick to blame the Russian military for the incident, with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba alleging it was a “deliberate massacre.” “The Bucha massacre was deliberate. Russians aim to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can. We must stop them and kick them out. I demand new, devastating G7 sanctions NOW,” Kuleba said on Twitter. Top Western politicians were quick to back and amplify Kiev’s claims, with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg branding the incident “a brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades.”

Putin's barbaric killing in Bucha requires new sanctions immediately — oil and gas sanctions; all Russian banks out of Swift; all US companies out of Russia, by the end of the week. — Michael McFaul (@McFaul) April 3, 2022

""We must not turn away from what is happening in Ukraine, or minimize or sanitize this barbarism that is happening on the ground… according to local officials, 100s of residents of Bucha appear to have been massacred.""

“And it’s horrific, and it’s absolutely unacceptable that civilians are targeted and killed, and it just underlines the importance of, that this war must end. And that is President Putin’s responsibility, to stop the war,” Stoltenberg told CNN. A similar stance has been taken by many other officials, with some explicitly pinning the blame for the ‘massacre’ on Moscow. French President Emmanuel Macron said, for instance, that “Russian authorities will have to answer for these crimes.” Moscow, however, has firmly rejected any involvement, accusing Kiev of staging the whole affair to frame Russian troops. The country’s Defense Ministry said Russian troops pulled out of the town on March 30, with the local mayor confirming this in a video address a day later without mentioning “any local residents laying shot in the streets.” The purported “evidence” of the incident emerged only four days after the withdrawal, when Ukrainian intelligence and “representatives of Ukrainian television arrived in the town,” the military added, stressing that multiple inconsistencies show that the affair “has been staged by the Kiev regime for Western media.”

The Western claim is that Russia snuck back into Bucha for the purpose of killing a bunch of civilians for literally no reason other than to be mean.

But they don’t claim that directly, because they know anyone who would believe this gibberish in the first place is too stupid to even know what is going on.

But a UN meeting will have all these people from different countries saying “yes, this is obviously fake.”

The Ukraine needs to be prosecuted for war crimes for slaughtering their own civilians. No one has ever done this before. We posted how many videos of refugees from Mariupol saying Azov and AFU was just slaughtering civilians, often for no reason?

This is some retard shit for babies.

Bucha massacre was deliberate. Russians aim to eliminate as many Ukrainians as they can. We must stop them and kick them out. I demand new devastating G7 sanctions NOW: -Oil, gas, coal embargo

-Close all ports to Russian vessels and goods

-Disconnect all Russian banks from SWIFT pic.twitter.com/oZkCAETCQp — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) April 3, 2022

If Russia wanted to slaughter civilians, why would they not use bombs? Why do these pictures say 1488? Is Russia false flagging Ukrainian Satan-Nazi symbols now?

But yeah, bro – sanction the West further.

Great idea.

Zelensky – who is winning the war, mind you – is whining about this hoax he committed, demanding more weapons, because he is losing.

Powerful, passionate address from Zelensky tonight. Switching from Ukrainian to Russian he addresses mothers of soldiers who committed horrific war crimes in Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel, asking how they raised “butchers,” and he tells Moscow to see how it’s orders are being fulfilled. pic.twitter.com/7UyYxqiY4V — Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) April 3, 2022

Winning is losing.

Who benefits from slaughtering civilians in a random village?

These people are saying “all Russians are evil.”

Well, what about the Germans?

An enormous car parade of cars with mostly Russian flags in Berlin, #Germany, today. Reportedly, the parade in support of Russia gathered 5000 cars. They can't complain about the media blackout in Germany. They have access to information and can see what Russians did in Bucha. pic.twitter.com/20Oco5p3RB — Hanna Liubakova (@HannaLiubakova) April 3, 2022

The Germans saw what happened in Bucha.

I’m sure they indeed did.

They just don’t believe you, Jews.

No normal people believe you anymore.

The jig is up.

You people have lied about every single thing you’ve said for years on end.

The people who would believe something this stupid are simply zombies.

Show us the eyewitnesses, Jews.

Where are the interviews?

And no, I don’t mean fat women in Lviv who speak perfect English – go to Bucha and interview the people. Ask who shot them.

But you won’t.

This Bucha thing has been done in lieu of a gas hoax. And there is no way it is going to work. It is too retarded. They will slowly bury this story, like they did with the Mariupol theatre bombing.

And Hey – Here’s a Question:

If the Russians were willing to just wantonly slaughter civilians, why did they not do that in every suburb of Kiev? Why didn’t they just do a Baghdad-style bombing of Kiev?

Instead, they slaughtered people only in one suburb, which they had already left, just so they could be accused of war crimes? For no benefit to themselves, at all?

If they are were willing to slaughter civilians on a large scale, they could do that with bombs, and just level Kiev.

But instead, these people claim they are executing “a very limited form of genocide.”

Okay.

The same people promoting this Bucha hoax are the same people who are still posting hundreds of tweets like this every day:",https://www.unz.com/aanglin/russia-calls-security-council-meeting-over-bucha-hoax/
