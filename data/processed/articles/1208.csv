France has decided to reposition its nuclear aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, located in the Mediterranean Sea, closer to Romania, in the context of the war in Ukraine, bfmtv.com reports.

The reason why the aircraft carrier will move closer to Romania is to “carry out air police missions, reconnaissance and intelligence gathering,” French Defense Minister Florence Parly told BFMTV.

The planes on Charles de Gaulle will fly “in a northerly direction, towards the territory of Romania, in surveillance and deterrence missions”, Parly said.

At the same time, the French Ministry of Defense announced that the French army would monitor the conduct of the conflict in Ukraine “being prepared for any eventuality”.

The French aircraft carrier cannot enter the Black Sea due to the provisions of the Montreux Convention.

The Montreux Convention, concluded in 1936, which gives Turkey control over the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, authorizes the free passage of ships through the straits, but limits their number and size. The document also limits the duration of their presence in the area in the case of military ships.

As a general rule, warships from countries outside the region, weighing more than 10,000 tons, may not enter the Black Sea. If several vessels of the same country enter the Black Sea, their total tonnage shall not exceed 45,000 tons. In addition, ships from countries outside the region may not remain in the Black Sea for more than 21 consecutive days.

Aircraft carriers – such as the French Charles de Gaulle – have no access, and states sending ships to the Black Sea must announce their intentions to Turkey in advance.",https://www.romaniajournal.ro/society-people/french-nuclear-aircraft-carrier-charles-de-gaulle-currently-in-the-mediterranean-to-be-repositioned-closer-to-romania/

For further security, France is now moving its only aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean. “Our mission is strictly deterrent,” said Secretary of Defense Parly.

In view of the Ukraine war, France has relocated its aircraft carrier “Charles de Gaulle” in the Mediterranean for reconnaissance flights over the Baltic States and Poland. The aircraft carrier, which is currently being used for a counter-terrorism mission in the Middle East, left Cyprus together with its escort on Wednesday, French Defense Minister Florence Parly told BFMTV in the evening. In the Mediterranean, the ship should reach a position that would allow the aircraft to carry out reconnaissance missions.

“Our mission is strictly deterrent, we have no warlike intentions,” said the minister. Rafale fighter jets and reconnaissance aircraft should be deployed from the aircraft carrier as the “police of the sky”. The goal is education and deterrence.

As the French Navy announced, the mission was intended to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank and secure France and the European continent. The aircraft carrier and other units were actually supposed to hold an exercise until April with the aim of fighting structures of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia in the Middle East.

The 260 meter long and 31.50 meter wide “Charles de Gaulle” has a crew of around 2000 and was put into service in May 2001. The aircraft carrier has 14 Rafale and Super Etendard fighter jets, two reconnaissance aircraft and five helicopters on board. Two nuclear reactors provide the drive. The ship, which costs a good three billion euros, is to be retired in 2038.",https://gettotext.com/mission-strictly-deterrent-france-sends-aircraft-carriers-to-the-mediterranean/
