Zelenskyy hints at openness to compromise on eastern Ukraine

Ukraine is prepared to consider a compromise on contested areas in the country’s east, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said, ahead of another round of talks set for Tuesday.

“I realise that it’s impossible to force Russia to fully leave the territory. It could lead to World War III. I understand completely. I’m fully aware of it,” he said. “That is why I’m saying, yes, this is a compromise: Go back to where it all started and then we’ll try to resolve the issue of Donbas, the complex issue of Donbas.”

Zelenskyy added the only way to end the war was a face-to-face meeting with Russia’s leader, a possibility Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed earlier.

Russia to study video of alleged mistreatment of prisoners

The Kremlin has said Russian investigators will look into a video circulated on social media that purported to show Ukrainian forces mistreating captured Russian soldiers.

The footage shared on Sunday shows five of the prisoners tied up and lying on the ground being beaten by soldiers who are likely Ukrainian. Three other captives are shot in their legs without provocation.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the video contained “monstrous images” and needed to be legally assessed, and that those who took part in what he described as torture needed to be held responsible.

Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said the video could not be taken at face value. Military spokesperson Oleksander Motuzyanyk said the veracity of the footage could not be verified.

Biden says ‘I make no apologies’ for Putin remarks

United States President Joe Biden has said he is “not walking anything back” after his weekend comment that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power”.

He dismissed claims that he was calling for regime change in Moscow. “I wasn’t articulating a policy change,” he said. “I was expressing the moral outrage that I felt toward this man.”

The remark about Putin, which came at the end of a speech in Warsaw, stirred controversy in the United States and among some allies in Western Europe.

“This is just stating a simple fact, that this kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable,” Biden said.

REPORTER: Do you believe what you said that Putin can’t remain in power or do you now regret saying that?

Workers say Russian soldiers disturbed radioactive dust in Chernobyl

Russian soldiers who seized the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster have driven their armoured vehicles without radiation protection through a highly toxic zone called the “Red Forest”, kicking up clouds of radioactive dust, workers at the site said.

Two sources told Reuters soldiers in the convoy did not use any anti-radiation gear. One employee said that was “suicidal” for the soldiers because the radioactive dust they inhaled was likely to cause internal radiation in their bodies.

The Red Forest is the most radioactively contaminated part of the zone around Chernobyl, about 100 kilometres north of Kyiv.

Ukraine says it has ‘proof’ of use of banned weapons

Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova has said Ukraine has proof Russian forces used banned cluster bombs in two southern regions of the country.

“We have proof of the [use] of cluster bombes in the Odesa region and in the Kherson area,” Venediktova told journalists. “I can only mention instances where I have very concrete proof, for example … when I have (bomb) fragments or soil samples and analyses.”

Cluster bombs spread dozens of tiny explosive charges across an area, some of which may not immediately explode and in effect become anti-personnel mines that pose a threat to civilians long after a conflict ends.

Pressure groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also said they collected proof of the use of cluster bombs in areas where civilians were present.

US intelligence suggests ‘environmental’ factor sickened Abramovich: Reuters

A US official who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity has said that intelligence suggests the sickening of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators was due to an environmental factor, not poisoning.

The account contradicts an earlier report by the Wall Street Journal and investigative outlet Bellingcat saying Abramovich and the negotiators had suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv.

EU countries look to share effort of hosting Ukrainian refugees

Germany has called for a more even distribution of Ukrainian refugees in the European Union, after some 3.8 million people fled war on their country and crossed into the 27-nation bloc.

“We need to more actively distribute refugees within the EU and show solidarity by taking in refugees,” German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told reporters in Brussels, where interior ministers of all EU countries met to discuss the situation.

The country, the biggest in the bloc with more than 80 million people, says it has registered more than 270,000 Ukrainian refugees, compared with some 30,000 who have entered France, the second-biggest member.

The ministers discussed sharing information and synchronising databases, as well as transporting refugees further west in the EU.

Ukrainian negotiators, Russian oligarch suffered suspected poisoning: WSJ

Ukrainian peace negotiators and Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Symptoms included red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands, the sources said, adding that they blamed the suspected attack on hard-liners in Moscow who want to sabotage talks to end the war in Ukraine.

Abramovich and the Ukrainian negotiators, who include Crimean Tatar lawmaker Rustem Umerov, have since improved and their lives aren’t in danger, WSJ reported.

The Russian oligarch became involved in attempts to end the war despite longstanding links to President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from the American newspaper.

UN chief appeals for humanitarian ceasefire

Guterres says he has directed the world body’s aid chief, Martin Griffiths, “to explore with the parties involved” the possibility of a humanitarian ceasefire in Ukraine.

“Since the beginning of the Russian invasion one month ago, the war has led to the senseless loss of thousands of lives, the displacement of 10 million people, mainly women and children, the systematic destruction of essential infrastructure and skyrocketing food and energy prices worldwide – this must stop,” he said at the UN’s headquarters in New York.

“But let’s be clear, the solution to this humanitarian tragedy is not humanitarian, it is political,” Guterres added.

“I am therefore appealing for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to allow for progress in serious political negotiations aimed at reaching a peace agreement based on the principles of the United Nations charter.”

Guterres said a cessation of hostilities would also allow for “essential humanitarian aid to be delivered and enable civilians to move around safely”.

“It will save lives, prevent suffering and protect civilians,” he added.

EU seeks end to golden passport schemes, halt in sales of visas to Russians

The European Union’s executive arm has called on the bloc’s member states to end national programmes to sell citizenship to investors, also known as golden passport schemes, and urged them to suspend the sale of visas to Russians and Belarusians.

The move by the European Commission follows a new push from the European Parliament to shrink and regulate the multi-billion-euro citizenship and visa industry, which the EU has long considered a security risk.

It urged an immediate end to existing national programmes for the sale of passports. Currently, only Malta, Cyprus and Bulgaria have such schemes and they have all committed to ending them.

Brussels also said governments should check whether sanctioned individuals were holding a golden passport or visa they had issued.

Several EU countries run golden visa schemes, including Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy.

European values are not for sale. We consider that the sale of citizenship through 'golden passports' is illegal under EU law and poses serious risks to our security. All EU countries concerned should end their investor citizenship schemes immediately.#StandWithUkraine pic.twitter.com/oxITL8u5an — European Commission 🇪🇺 (@EU_Commission) March 28, 2022

Ukraine’s prosecutor general accuses Russia of ‘genocide’ in Mariupol

Ukraine’s prosecutor general has said Russian forces’ alleged indiscriminate shelling of residential areas in Mariupol and the reported forced deportation of thousands of Ukrainians from the city to Russia amount to “genocide”.

“What is happening in Mariupol is not just war crimes,” Iryna Venedyktova said during a news briefing.

“War has rules, and this is beyond rules. I look at it from the viewpoint of considering it genocide when an entire city is taken hostage,” she added.

Venedyktova also alleged that under the disguise of “evacuation”, thousands of Mariupol residents – including 2,000 children – had been forcibly deported to Russia in buses and had their passports confiscated.

“More than 2,000 children have been deported from Mariupol alone,” she said. “This is more than a war crime.”

Russian shares slump as all trading resumes

Russian shares have slumped as its stock market resumed trading of all companies after a monthlong halt.

The benchmark MOEX index slid by 2.2 percent after the Moscow Exchange reopened for all of its several hundred listed companies, but with restrictions still in place to limit volatility.

The last full trading session in Moscow was on February 25, a day after the index tumbled by a third after Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine.

Prices whipsawed last week when the exchange tentatively reopened for two days of limited trading, with investors allowed to trade only 33 of the MOEX index’s 50 companies.

Some restrictions have remained in place to prevent another big selloff. The daily session is shortened to four hours and there is a ban on short-selling, which essentially involves betting on stock prices to go down. Foreigners also are unable to sell shares until Friday.

Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper suspends activities

Russia’s top independent newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, says it is suspending its online and print activities until the end of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.

Novaya Gazeta, which has already removed material from its website on Russia’s military action in Ukraine to comply with a new media law, said it had received a second warning from state communications regulator Roskomnadzor on Monday about its reporting, prompting it to pause operations.

The newspaper’s editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov was a co-winner of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize. Muratov announced last week that he was planning to donate his Nobel award to be auctioned to raise funds for Ukrainian refugees.

The Kremlin strictly limits how media outlets can describe events in Ukraine. Several other Russian media outlets have already opted to suspend operations rather than face heavy restrictions on what they can report, and Moscow has also blocked multiple foreign news outlets.

Talks come ‘amid an observable escalation’ in violence: AJE correspondent

Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from the city of Lviv, in Western Ukraine, says “circumstances on the ground” will no doubt affect the outcome of the talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials.

“They [the talks] come amid an observable escalation in the west of the country, as well as elsewhere – we have had air raid sirens going off all morning in Kyiv and shelling in many areas has continued,” Basravi said.

He noted that Ukraine had claimed Russian forces were “unable to advance”, however, adding that Kyiv believed it was in a “position of strength” ahead of further talks with Moscow.

The southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol is on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and must be completely evacuated, its mayor says.

Vadym Boychenko said about 160,000 civilians were trapped in the city without power. Twenty-six buses were waiting to evacuate civilians but Russian forces had not agreed to give them safe passage, he said.

“The Russian Federation is playing with us,” he said. Russia denies targeting civilians and blames Ukraine for the repeated failure to agree on safe corridors for trapped civilians.

12th Russian defeat at Chornobaivka airport

For the twelfth time, Russian forces have been defeated in the southern town of Chornobaivka after trying to seize a strategic airport, a Ukrainian presidential aide has said.

The Chornobaivka airport between the seized city of Kherson and the besieged city of Mykolaiv has become a symbol of Ukraine’s resistance and spawned dozens of memes ridiculing Russia’s blind determination to seize the town by all means necessary.

“A pleasant yet predictable surprise – Chornobaivka, [defeat] number 12, it happened and keeps happening,” Oleksiy Arestovych wrote on Facebook.

Russian general Yakov Rezantsev, who commanded the combined 49th army, was killed in Chornobaivka last week, the Ukrainian defence ministry said.

Zelenskyy insists on territorial integrity as talks loom

Ukraine’s president has insisted on the territorial integrity of his country after earlier suggesting that he was ready for a compromise in peace talks with Russia.

In his video address to the Ukrainian people late on Sunday, Zelenskyy said there was a new round of negotiations coming up in Turkey and that his government’s priorities remained the same.

“Our priorities in the negotiations are known. Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory,” he said.

But in comments to Russian journalists earlier in the day, Zelenskyy had said Ukraine was willing to assume neutral status and compromise over the status of the eastern Donbas region as part of a peace deal.

China’s Sinopec pauses Russia projects: Report

China’s state-run Sinopec Group has suspended talks for a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia, according to Reuters.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the news agenct said the suspension was a response to the Chinese government’s calls for caution as western sanctions on Russia mount.

One of the sources told Reuters that Sinopec had been planning to team up with Sibur, Russia’s largest petrochemical producer, to build a new gas chemical plant in Siberia.

But it hit pause on the project after realising that Sibur minority shareholder and board member Gennady Timchenko had been sanctioned by the West, the source said.

Russia, Ukraine likely hold differing views on concept of neutrality: Analyst

Zachary Paikin, a researcher at the Center for European Policy Studies, says Moscow and Kyiv likely hold differing views on what it means for Ukraine to be a neutral state.

“There’s the question of whether or not neutrality means being able to join NATO or not, versus being able to join the EU or not,” he told Al Jazeera.

“The central theme in the lead up to this invasion was Ukraine’s status in NATO, and that’s how Russia more or less explicitly chose to frame neutrality during those talks over previous months. But membership in the EU is just as much of a sticking point,” he said.

“Ukraine joining the EU poses certain problems for Russia, because the EU is more of a Western political construct and Russia insists that Ukraine forms part of the Russian world, and EU nominally has a common foreign and security policy as well. This would very much run up against the concept of neutrality from Moscow’s perspective.”

Ukraine restricts reporting on troop movements

‘It would be ridiculous if it wasn’t so funny’: Zelenskyy slams Russian censorship

Ukraine’s president has criticised Russia’s media watchdog after it tried to stop the publication of an interview in which he said Kyiv was prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Moscow.

The interview was conducted by Russian journalists from the Meduza news website, the Dozhd television station, and the liberal business paper Kommersant.

Roskomnadzor, the Russian media watchdog, has urged Russian media not to publish the interview and has launched an investigation into the circumstances under which it had been organised.

“Imagine, they were frightened there in Moscow because of my interview to Russian journalists, to those who can afford to tell the truth,” Zelenskyy said.

“It would be ridiculous if it wasn’t so funny. They destroyed the freedom of speech in their state and they are trying to destroy it in the neighbouring state. They portray themselves as global players and they themselves are afraid of a relatively short conversation with several journalists.”

Ukraine calls for measures to ‘demilitarise’ Chernobyl nuclear plant

A senior Ukrainian official has accused Russia of “irresponsible” acts around the occupied Chernobyl power station that could send radiation across much of Europe, and urged the United Nations to dispatch a mission to assess the risks.

Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian forces were “militarising” the exclusion zone around the station, the site of the world’s worst civil nuclear accident in 1986.

Russian forces, she said, were transporting large amounts of old and poorly maintained weapons, creating a risk of damaging the containment vessel constructed around the station’s wrecked fourth reactor.

Russian forces were also preventing firefighters from bringing large numbers of fires in the zone under control, she said.

“In the context of nuclear safety, the irresponsible and unprofessional actions of Russian servicemen present a very serious threat not just to Ukraine but to hundreds of millions of Europeans,” Vereshchuk said on her Telegram account.

“We therefore demand that the UN Security Council adopt immediate measures to demilitarise the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl station as well as dispatching a special mission to eliminate the risks of any repeat of the Chernobyl accident resulting from the actions of Russian occupying forces,” she said.

Germany eyes buying missile defence system

Germany is considering purchasing a missile defence system to shield against a potential attack from Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said.

“This is certainly one of the issues we are discussing, and for good reason,” he told public broadcaster ARD when asked whether Germany might buy a defence system.

“We need to be aware that we have a neighbour who is prepared to use violence to enforce their interests,” he added.

In the same interview, the chancellor also addressed Germany’s decision to become more energy independent and said it would have to accept higher energy costs.

Scholz said it would not help to keep Germany’s nuclear power plants running longer, but he noted that the timing of the country’s plan to exit from coal was dependent on how quickly it made progress in expanding renewable energy.

Russia's aggression has failed to destabilize Ukraine, Zelenskyy says Russia's armed aggression remains unsuccessful because it has failed to destabilize Ukraine's leadership, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday. The Ukrainian president's comments were posted to his official government website, and appeared to be translated from Zelenskyy's interviews for Russian media. Zelenskyy alleged that Russia had made attempts to initiate early elections in areas where Russia had influence in order to ""provoke political chaos in Ukraine."" ""This destabilization was necessary in order to split the majority with strong regional governance,"" Zelenskyy said. ""Chaos in the economy and instability of the political spirit in Ukraine would lead to escalation on the part of the Russian Federation."" Russian forces were not welcomed as its leaders had predicted, Zelenskyy said, and the ""parallel solution"" became an attempt to ""neutralize"" leadership.

Last passenger train links from Russia into European Union suspended HELSINKI — One of the last remaining passenger train links from Russia into the European Union has been suspended following the departure of the last two Allegro high-speed trains from St. Petersburg to Helsinki. Finland’s state-owned railway company VR said Friday it would suspend services between the Finnish capital and Russia’s second-largest city on Sunday, closing one of the last public transport routes for Russians who want to reach the EU. Citing the sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, the Finnish railway company said it was no longer appropriate to operate the route. It added that Finnish citizens and “people who wanted to depart from Russia have had adequate time to leave.” Only a morning departure from Helsinki to St. Petersburg ran on Sunday, while the afternoon train was cancelled. Two departures from St. Petersburg left as scheduled. Russians wishing to travel to Finland can do so through crossing points on the 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) land border with Russia that remain open for private cars.

Offering Ukraine further military equipment an 'evolving conversation': U.S. ambassador to NATO U.S. Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith said Sunday that the alliance was engaged in ""evolving"" talks with Ukraine about offering additional military equipment following President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's latest plea for more planes, tanks and weapons to support his country's resistance. ""We've spoken with President Zelenskyy many times in recent weeks, we've heard their requests for assistance,"" Smith said on CNN’s “State of the Union."" ""In many cases, we've delivered those anti-aircraft anti-armor capabilities, we are assessing their air defense needs."" On the proposal from Poland that would have made its old Russian-made MiG fighters available to a U.S. base in Germany for potential handover to Ukraine, she said the answer was still no. The Biden administration rejected the idea earlier this month, saying it would be a “high risk” step that could ratchet up tensions with Moscow. ""If any NATO ally wanted to provide those types of pieces of equipment, the fighter jets the MiGs, that is a sovereign decision. They can take that sovereign decision. But right now the United States is very much focused on their air defense needs,"" the diplomat said. She also attempted to walk back Biden's fiery remarks on Putin, which some said were tantamount to calling for regime change in Russia. “The U.S. does not have a policy of regime change in Russia, full stop,"" Smith said, calling Biden's remarks “a principled human reaction” to the stories he heard from Ukrainian refugees during his trip to Europe.

Russian authorities also have shut access to foreign media websites, including BBC, European news network Euronews, the U.S. government-funded Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle and Latvia-based website Meduza. Bild says it has been putting Russian-language reports on Russia’s war in Ukraine and its slide toward “totalitarian dictatorship” on its website, and parts of its live video broadcasts have been subtitled in Russian. It noted that it also has a Russian-language Telegram channel.

Russia could try to break Ukraine in two, says Ukraine’s military intelligence chief KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s military intelligence chief says that Russia could try to break Ukraine in two. Kyrylo Budanov said in remarks released by the Defense Ministry on Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has realized “he can’t swallow the entire country” and would likely try to split the country under “the Korean scenario.” That’s a reference to the decades-old division between North and South Korea. Budanov said that “the occupiers will try to pull the occupied territories into a single quasi-state structure and pit it against independent Ukraine.” He pointed to Russian attempts to set up parallel government structures in occupied cities and to bar people from using the Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia. Budanov predicted that Ukrainian resistance will grow into a “total” guerrilla warfare, derailing Russia’s attempts. Share this -







Russians who live abroad say Moscow is hardening views of those back home The number of Russian expatriates living in the West is growing, but they said conversations with peers and family back home about the war have grown more difficult in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Since President Vladimir Putin suggested Russians who live abroad were “scum” and “traitors” in a speech last week, conversations they manage to have with relatives and friends back home have grown tense or they avoid the topic of the war altogether. Numerous Russians have fled the country as a result of the invasion and the crackdown, likely for good, but the views of those still in Russia have hardened in support of the Kremlin, as years of anti-West propaganda get cemented in the country’s new reality.

Pope steps up pleas for talks to end 'cruel and senseless war' Pope Francis has stepped up his pleas for negotiations to end the fighting in Ukraine. Francis told the public in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday that “this cruel and senseless war” continues after more than a month, representing “a defeat for all.” He lamented that parents are burying their children, and “the powerful decide and the poor die.” Once again, he didn’t cite Russia by name as the aggressor. Referring to reports that about one-half of all the children in Ukraine have been displaced by the conflict, Francis said that “war doesn’t just devastate the present but also the future of society.” The pontiff reiterated his condemnation of war as barbarous and sacrilegious. He said that “humanity must understand that the moment has come to abolish war, to cancel war from the history of man before it cancels man from history.” VATICAN MEDIA / Reuters Share this -







U.K. says sanctions could be lifted if Russia withdraws from Ukraine British foreign minister Liz Truss says sanctions imposed on Russian individuals and companies could be lifted if the country's military withdraws from Ukraine and commits to end aggression, the Telegraph newspaper reported on Saturday. Britain and other Western nations are using economic sanctions to cripple the Russian economy and punish President Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine. In an interview with the Telegraph, Truss held out the possibility the measures could end if Moscow changed course. ""What we know is that Russia signed up to multiple agreements they simply don’t comply with. So there needs to be hard levers. Of course, sanctions are a hard lever,"" she said. ""Those sanctions should only come off with a full ceasefire and withdrawal, but also commitments that there will be no further aggression.

Zelenskyy said Kyiv needed planes, tanks, air-defense and anti-ship systems. ""That is what our partners have, that is what is just gathering dust there,"" he said in the address. ""This is all for not only the freedom of Ukraine, but for the freedom of Europe."" ""We are waiting for 31 days already. So who is governing the Euro-Atlantic community? Is it really still Moscow through intimidation?"" Zelenskyy said. Share this -







Russia says it destroyed a fuel depot near Lviv Russia's defense ministry has said it used “high-precision weapons” to destroy a large fuel depot in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Saturday. Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said the depot provided fuel for Ukrainian troops in western Ukraine as well as near capital Kyiv, according to the state news agency Ria. Ukraine’s state emergency service said it extinguished a fire that resulted from the strike on the depot early on Sunday. Several explosions hit the city on Saturday, with a military factory also hit and five people injured, according to the local officials. Lviv has been a relative safe haven for the millions of Ukrainians escaping fighting elsewhere in the country. The attacks took place just 40 miles from the border with Poland, a NATO ally, shortly before President Joe Biden gave an address there during his visit to the country.

2 'humanitarian corridors' agreed on Sunday, Ukraine says Evacuations from some war-ravaged cities in Ukraine are set to continue on Sunday. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a Telegram video message that two humanitarian corridors had been agreed upon in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Vereshchuk said the corridor from the besieged southern city of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia will be by personal transport only. There will also be an evacuation by bus from the southeastern port city of Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia, Vereshchuk added. In the Luhanks region, Vereshchuk said evacuations will take place from the town of Rubizhne to Bakhmut. Share this -







Invasion could spell end to Russian culture in Ukraine, Zelenskyy says One of the casualties of the deadly Russian invasion of Ukraine will be Russian culture itself within the nation's borders, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address Saturday. Though Russian is the nation's second language, spoken by the president and nearly one third of the country, Zelenskyy argued that when the dust settles, Ukrainians will reject all things Russian. Zelenskyy noted that Russian has been a part of daily life in the cities that are now under siege. ""Russia itself is doing everything to ensure that de-russification takes place on the territory of our state,"" the president said, according to his office's English translation of his remarks. ""You are doing it. In one generation. And forever."" Share this -







Russian forces trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in country's east, U.K. says Russian forces appear to be attempting to encircle Ukrainian forces in the east of the country near the Moscow-backed separatist regions, the U.K.'s defense ministry has said. In its latest intelligence update, the ministry said Russia was concentrating its effort to surround the forces directly facing the two regions by advancing from Kharkiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. In northern Ukraine, the situation remained ""largely static"" with Russian attempts to reorganize their forces stymied by Ukrainian counterattacks, the ministry said. In an earlier briefing released overnight, the ministry said Russia continued to strike targets across Ukraine from the air, including many in densely populated areas, but that it was facing major challenges in the skies as well. Russia has been relying on munitions launched from greater distances to avoid Ukrainian air space, it said, due to Ukrainian anti-aircraft fire. Share this -







Finland to suspend its rail link between Russia and the E.U. Finland's national railway operator has said it will suspend services between Helsinki and St. Petersburg in Russia on Monday, closing the rail link between Russia and the European Union. VR, the operator, said it had been told by the Finnish state it was no longer appropriate to run the service, known as the Allegro, in light of sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Russian Railways said in a short statement they were aware of the Finnish decision due to sanctions. Trains from Russia to Finland's capital Helsinki have been packed with Russians in recent weeks as some used it to leave the country urgently and mutual airspace closures cut off flight connections between Russia and the E.U. The border between Finland and Russia remains open for crossings by private car. Share this -

4,013f9225-efe0-4878-be06-0d68f48551ac,['Cnn Newsource'],2022-03-27 00:00:00,"By Sam Fossum, CNN

A funding shortfall in the latest Ukraine aid package could affect the Internal Revenue Service criminal investigations unit that tracks the luxury yachts, apartments and other hidden assets of Russia’s elite, raising the possibility that the US enforcement of sanctions might have some gaps or pull resources from other priorities.

The Biden administration’s efforts to secure emergency funding for the Treasury Department’s sanctions efforts were met in full — except for one. Republicans balked at the request to infuse the IRS investigations unit (IRS-CI) with $30 million, according to people involved in the negotiations. The objection was tied to concern over the agency, which sits under the Treasury umbrella, diverting focus from its core mission.

But it underscored long-standing wariness from GOP lawmakers about boosting the agency’s enforcement funding, and general Republican opposition to significant funding boosts for the IRS.

That hasn’t stopped the agency’s efforts to plead their case, with officials lobbying lawmakers for more resources in recent weeks and circulating a report on Capitol Hill underscoring what they say is an acute need for additional funding in order to carry out their new sanctions responsibilities, according to two congressional aides with knowledge of the matter.

While the IRS investigations unit spends the vast majority of its time and resources on tax-related investigations, its agents also pursue pure narcotics and high-level money laundering, terrorist financing and national security related matters. Its 2,100 agents are known within the federal enforcement apparatus as specialists when it comes to tracking and investigating complicated money flows.

But whenever new priorities are identified for the agency, like the growing focus on digital assets or sanctioned Russian oligarchs, the agency must reallocate agents and resources from elsewhere, which could slow or hinder other investigations, according to the agency’s chief, Jim Lee.

“Something will suffer,” he told CNN.

In a statement to CNN, an IRS spokesperson argued that the investigations unit and the IRS writ large need more “stable, long-term funding.”

“Underfunding leaves the IRS with impossible decisions across the agency that lead us to rob one essential function to fund another,” the spokesperson said.

While current IRS officials stressed that the IRS-Criminal Investigations unit will continue to fulfill its mandate, they say the rejected funding request could pose potential problems for the agency in the short-term, and that in the long run the agency’s overall funding needs to be increased from its current $636 million dollar budget as they adjust to a changing financial landscape, particularly in the digital space.

Lee told CNN that the unfulfilled $30 million request “just scratched the surface” of what the agency believes it needs. The Associated Press was first to report on Congress’ decision not to include the White House’s $30 million request.

“We need sustained funding over 10 years to really be strategic about how we address the threats that are out there today,” he said.

What the funding would have paid for

The $30 million the administration sought to bolster the IRS’ investigations unit would have increased the number of licenses for a records database that helps agents trace assets around the world from five to 60, fund the training and hiring of more agents to focus on sanctions work and provide more funds for third-party resources and contractors that supplement agents’ investigative work, an IRS official told CNN.

These additional tools would provide the agency further support for tracking the true ownership of assets held by Russian elites who are likely to use everything at their disposal to evade US sanctions and hide their wealth, whether it’s through digital assets like cryptocurrencies, shell companies or other complex corporate structures.

“With all of these, their primary purpose is to continue their way of life, their luxury lifestyle. I mean, whether that’s, you know, purchasing the yachts, the expensive cars, the million-dollar homes, the billions that they have in assets. It’s our job to kind of stay in front of that and unravel those complex activities,” Jarod Koopman, executive director of Cyber and Forensic Services at IRS-CI, told CNN.

The Criminal Investigations unit has faced funding shortfalls for years, according to the IRS, and since 2010 the number of employees working for the unit has fallen by 25%.

But despite its shrinking size, the agency’s responsibilities have continued to grow beyond holding American tax cheats or financial criminals accountable. Agents for the unit have undertaken illicit money laundering investigations against Russian oligarchs since 2017, and more recently they have substantially grown the number of investigations into cryptocurrency transactions or other digital assets involving Russian-based entities through a project called “Sanctions Evaders.”

“How seriously are we really taking the sanctions problem if you’re not properly funding the one agency that can really provide the muscle and horsepower and the experience in financial crimes and following complex money flows?” Don Fort, a former chief of the IRS criminal investigations unit who worked for the agency for nearly 30 years, told CNN.

Fort said that the lack of funding over the years “unfortunately” means the agency has “been forced to become very resourceful” and that it would be hard to precisely measure the impact of not receiving the $30 million funding request, but added that this is a disappointing development and he believes the funds would have significantly aided the US Government’s efforts to enforce sanctions.

“It’s hard to quantify exactly, but they will look no doubt to see what other opportunities exist,” he told CNN. “They’re resilient.”

In the Ukraine Supplemental Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden earlier this month, other Treasury Department divisions received $61 million to reinforce their efforts to implement sanctions against Russia, including $25 million for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, $19 million for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and $17 million for other departmental offices.

Most of the US sanctions against Russian state and private institutions, oligarchs and Putin’s supporters are imposed by the Treasury Department and its regulatory and enforcement arms, like the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and FinCEN, which are part of the Office of Terrorism and Intelligence, as well as IRS-CI. But the IRS investigations arm’s expertise in complicated money laundering and tax evasion schemes sets it apart from other law enforcement and regulatory agencies across the government, all of which are working closely together to enforce sanctions against Russia’s elites as part of the recently announced Kleptocapture Task Force.

The road ahead: Sanctions enforcement

As pressure mounts from American lawmakers and the Ukrainians for the US to further isolate the Kremlin and its cronies, US officials have stressed the importance of enforcing the raft of sanctions that have been rapidly imposed since Russia invaded Ukraine. The US and its allies have frozen a large swath of the Russian central bank’s foreign currency reserves, cut off certain Russian firms from US technology like semiconductors, and disconnected certain Russian banks from the global bank messaging system, known as SWIFT.

“In the period ahead, Russia’s main focus from an economic perspective is going to be to figure out how they can get around, over or under the sanctions that have been imposed. And blocking off those pathways is going to be vital to producing the kinds of cost imposition effects and vital to shaping the thinking in the Kremlin,” said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Friday.

Stuart Levey, who served as under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the US Treasury under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said that tracking the assets of wealthy Russians sanctioned by the US and its allies is going to be a global effort that poses “very complex” financial investigative challenges.

“One can already see from what’s in the public domain that these are very sophisticated financial actors who have had access to financial advice and it will require equally sophisticated forensic work to unwind and identify the sort of assets that we’re talking about here,” he told CNN.

US ramps up sanctions

The US on Thursday announced a slew of new sanctions against hundreds of members of the Russian State Duma, dozens of Russian defense companies, the CEO of Sberbank — Russia’s largest financial institution — and other Putin allies.

The new sanctions target 328 members of the 450-seat Russian State Duma, the lower level of the two-tiered Russian Parliament, cut off 48 Russian defense and materiel companies from Western technology and financing. Herman Gref — the head of Sberbank. who has worked with Putin since the 1990s when both men were in the mayor’s office of St. Petersburg — was also sanctioned.

Long-time Putin associate Gennady Timchenko — his companies, family members and yacht — have also been sanctioned, as well as 17 board members of Russian financial institution Sovcombank, according to the White House.

“They personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies, and they should share in the pain,” Biden wrote on Twitter shortly after the US Treasury officially announced the new measures.

Treasury sanctioned 12 members of the Duma earlier this month for their calls to recognize the Russian-backed separatist regions in Eastern Ukraine, which precipitated Russia’s invasion. Thursday’s measures will also sanction the State Duma as an institution, according to the Treasury.

“The Russian State Duma continues to support Putin’s invasion, stifle the free flow of information, and infringe on the basic rights of the citizens of Russia. We call on those closest to Putin to cease and condemn this cold-blooded war,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a written statement.

5,013f9225-efe0-4878-be06-0d68f48551ac,"['Poonam Jindal', 'Mahima Ghildiyal', 'Mahima Chouhan']",,"Four weeks have passed since Russia began its military invasion of Ukraine. Over the last few months in 2021, Russia was building up its military presence along the border with Ukraine in an overt response to increasing NATO expansion eastwards. It was late in the evening of February 24 when the Russian President announced a special military operation to ‘demilitarize and denazify’ Ukraine. Within minutes of this public declaration, Russian airstrikes struck throughout Ukraine followed by a ground invasion.

In no time this outrageous act was condemned internationally. The UNGA adopted a resolution demanding full Russian withdrawal, however, many countries abstained from the voting process. Council of Europe expelled Russia and the International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend its military operations immediately. There was a widespread international response to the invasion, further, various countries imposed new economic sanctions upon Russia.

SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA

In the words of Vladimir Putin, “Sanctions against such country as Russia are unlikely to be effective” and Sergei Lavrov, “Sanctions are a sign of irritation, they are not the instrument of serious policies.” However, western nations have made it clear that joining in firefights against nuclear-capable Russia is not deterrence instead an economic blockade and sanctions of an unprecedented scale will cripple the Russian economy and a lesson will be taught. There are a series of sanctions targeting individuals, banks, businesses, imports, and exports. Several countries have decided to isolate Russia from the global economy and cut off its financial nexus completely [1].

Following is the list of sanctions imposed on Russia since the commencement of the invasion.

a) The US was the first country to announce a slew of measures including asset freeze of banks as well as restricting individuals and companies to gain access to western exports. The sanctions were aimed at damaging the shipbuilding, aerospace, and defense industries. Further, a ban on all oil and energy imports from Russia was announced. Also, various American conglomerates such as Starbucks, MasterCard, McDonald's, etc. summing up to 40 companies have decided to exit from Russian grounds. Even social media giants including Facebook have declared to suspend their operations affecting the 21st-century lifestyle of the Russian youth.

b) European Union followed the American sanctions with more specific asset and travel bans on hundreds of Russian political figures and entrepreneurs.

c) The UK government denied Russia and Belarus access to Most Favoured Nation (MNF) tariff depriving both countries of the key benefits of global trade. Also, it banned exports of high-value luxury goods to Russia.

d) German Chancellor announced to suspend Nord Stream2 project and stated their decision to overcome dependence on Russian energy sources.

e) Even the countries who have been historically neutral such as Switzerland and Singapore have shown support towards sanctions.

f) Group of countries comprising of Australia, Canada, Japan, and Taiwan mainly those who have close ties with the west have adopted severe sanctions reinforcing the burden on the Russian economy.

The act of inflicting economic sanctions upon Russia is not a new story. After the Crimean annexation by Russia in 2014, there were a number of sanctions in place and are in effect since. Experts suggest that the current round of sanctions is stricter than ever before [2]. Economic sanctions on major Russian banks impede other countries from actively using them for transactions. Another huge blowout was the exclusion of Russian banks from the SWIFT system i.e. the global messaging network for international payments. The economic decoupling of Russia from global economic chains will have a major impact. To put it simply, Russia currently is the world’s most sanctioned country more than other blacklisted countries such as Syria, Iran, and North Korea.

CONSEQUENCES

The expectation behind such unprecedented sanctions on Russia is to immediately halt the bombing of Ukraine and withdraw troops from the country. Moreover, the impact will not be short-term but will have a long-lasting effect. Though President Putin has denied extreme repercussions due to an ‘economic blitzkrieg’ of the Western sanctions in a televised government meeting [3].

a) The government has indicated the possibilities of a high level of inflation and unemployment, however, it will be a temporary phenomenon. Amid this scare, consumer spending in Russia has witnessed a surge as people are in a rush to stock up on food and other staples. The purchasing power of the people is depreciating. Russians are prevented to withdraw more than 10,000 USD as well as can no longer use financial cards issued by MasterCard and Visa as they have suspended their operations [4].

b) The economic fallout is rendering the Russian Ruble quite inferior receding by 40 percent. Russian companies are losing their stock value on the international markets. The situation will turn far worse as long as the global economy is prolonging Russian isolation.

c) Dramatic move to exclude Russia from the SWIFT electronic system will reduce transferring payments time consuming and inefficient.

d) Moscow Stock Exchange remains shut for the third week running to avoid sudden collapse in equity prices [5]. On the other hand, the Russian central bank declared to increase the base interest rate to 20 percent which in turn will make borrowing unprofitable and enhance gold purchases to curb volatility.

e) Economic sanctions are primarily symbolic in nature condemning Russian aggression having a long-term tangible impact on the Russian economy. Russian markets are closed for two weeks now facing extreme shortages of goods. Additionally, the majority of foreign companies are reverting their business from Russia affecting the service industry and the number of jobs available.

f) Russia is a major oil-producing country, hence, the additional sanctions are going to have a negative effect on the Russian oil supply. Especially absolving the operations of the Nord Stream2 from the German side to make Russia accountable for its actions in Ukraine would reduce the export of natural gas from Russia to Europe.

In general, Russia would have anticipated financial hardships in form of economic sanctions, however, what the country could not calculate was that such tough actions will be taken so swiftly. People are living in austerity since the 2014 sanctions. The current economic crisis is so far the most damaging one. The government is obstructing spending on social and physical infrastructure and civilians are the worst sufferers. As the currency plummets, the commodity prices skyrocket disturbing the everyday lives of the people. There are sanctions of different nature causing harm to Russia and its economy such as EU has banned access to its airspace and state-owned Russian media outlets are suspended in many countries.

Russia has retaliated by banning exports of more than 200 products until the end of this year [6]. The basket of goods includes telecom, agricultural products, electrical equipment, timber, and medical commodities. Further, interest payments to foreign investors who hold government bonds are blocked and Russian firms are restricted to pay overseas shareholders. The Russian government has also threatened to seize the assets of the companies leaving Russian markets.

Sanctions make up a powerful technique to curb the aggressor, albeit it severs the economy but does not bring much of a political change. The western countries are practically going all out to restrain Russian devastation but the ignorance and intransigence on part of the Russian leaders will result in wrecking the Russian society.

State news agency Tass said Shoigu met with the country's Ministry of Finance to discuss maintaining the supply of advanced weapons for the conflict.

Those items include ""robotic complexes, information support and electronic warfare equipment, and of course, logistics, as it has always been the case,” Shoigu said, according to TASS.

""With the challenges we are facing today, we are moving according to plan in implementing the state defense procurement contract,"" Shoigu said. ""Considering the fact that the government funding for this year is 15% higher than for the previous year, we must of course take a look at what needs particular attention when fulfilling the state defense procurement contract.”

Shoigu reportedly claimed that despite sanctions on Russia, the level of execution of state contracts is at 85%. Outside observers have expressed skepticism that Russia can continue to produce high-tech weaponry amid severe international sanctions, particularly if procurement of some technology by Russia is restricted.

In addition, Shoigu spoke about legal changes that would guarantee government support to Russian troops who have fought in Ukraine, TASS reported.

""According to these amendments, participants of the special military operation in Ukraine acquire the status of combat veterans. Support will also include relatives of this category of military service members,"" he said.

According to a separate report from TASS, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the law on Saturday. It had been ""unanimously"" adopted by the State Duma and approved by the Federation Council on Wednesday.

The new law means that those who have taken part in Russia's military operations in Ukraine, will have access to the ""social protection system used by veterans of Afghanistan, Syria, and other hot spots,"" which includes additional payments from the state, tax benefits and medical care, the Russian state media outlet reported.

The bigger picture: Speculation has been mounting over Shoigu's whereabouts in recent days, as the Defense Minister has kept a low profile in the last few weeks despite having a leading role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on media reports and speculation that Shoigu had been experiencing health problems.

""The defense minister has a lot on his plate at the moment,"" he said when CNN asked about Shoigu's reported absence. ""The special military operation is going on. Naturally, now is not exactly the time for media activity, this is quite understandable.""

US President Joe Biden unloaded on Russia’s Vladimir Putin in a speech in Poland in one of his most passionate speeches. Here is an edited transcript of what he said:

“Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, if you have a seat, be seated. (Laughter) If you don’t, come up on stage.

The US President, Joe Biden delivers a speech at the Royal Castle on March 26, 2022. Getty

“Be not afraid.” They were the first words at the first public address of the first Polish Pope after his election on October of 1978. They were words that would come to define Pope John Paul II. Words that would change the world.

John Paul brought the message here to Warsaw in his first trip back home as Pope in June of 1979. It was a message about the power – the power of faith, the power of resilience, and the power of the people.

In the face of a cruel and brutal system of government, it was a message that helped end the Soviet repression in the Central land and Eastern Europe 30 years ago. It was a message that will overcome the cruelty and brutality of this unjust war.

When Pope John Paul brought that message in 1979, the Soviet Union ruled with an iron fist behind an Iron Curtain.

Then a year later, the Solidarity movement took hold in Poland. And while I know he couldn’t be here tonight, we’re all grateful in America and around the world for Lech Wałęsa. (Applause.)

It reminds me of that phrase of philosopher Kierkegaard: ”faith sees best in the dark.” And there were dark moments.

In this battle, we need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.

Today, Russia has strangled democracy – has sought to do so elsewhere, not only in its homeland. Under false claims of ethnic solidarity, it has invalidated neighbouring nations.

It’s a lie, it’s just cynical

Putin has the gall to say he’s “de-Nazifying” Ukraine. It’s a lie. It’s just cynical. He knows that. And it’s also obscene.

President Zelensky was democratically elected. He’s Jewish. His father’s family was wiped out in the Nazi Holocaust. And Putin has the audacity, like all autocrats before him, to believe that might will make right.

Time and again, we offered real diplomacy and concrete proposals to strengthen European security, enhance transparency, and build confidence on all sides.

But Putin and Russia met each of the proposals with disinterest in any negotiation, with lies and ultimatums. Russia was bent on violence from the start.

I know not all of you believed me and us when we kept saying, “They are going to cross the border. They are going to attack.”

Repeatedly, he asserted, “We have no interest in war.” Guaranteed he would not move.

Repeatedly saying he would not invade Ukraine.

Repeatedly saying Russian troops along the border were there for “training” – all 180,000 of them.

There is simply no justification or provocation for Russia’s choice of war. It’s an example of one of the oldest of human impulses: using brute force and disinformation to satisfy a craving for absolute power and control.

Swift and punishing costs are the only things that are going to get Russia to change its course.

Rouble reduced to rubble

As a result of these unprecedented sanctions, the rouble almost is immediately reduced to rubble. The Russian economy (applause) that’s true, by the way. It takes about 200 rubles to equal one dollar.

The economy is on track to be cut in half in the coming years. It was ranked -- Russia’s economy was ranked the 11th biggest economy in the world before this invasion. It will soon not even rank among the top 20 in the world. (Applause.)

Taken together, these economic sanctions are a new kind of economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that rivals military might.

These international sanctions are sapping Russian strength, its ability to replenish its military, and its ability – its ability to project power. And it is Putin – it is Vladimir Putin who is to blame, period.

And thanks to the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian people (applause) the equipment we’ve sent and our colleagues have sent have been used to devastating effect to defend Ukrainian land and airspace. Our Allies and partners have stepped up as well.

We have a sacred obligation – (applause) – we have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend each and every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power.

And earlier today, I visited your National Stadium, where thousands of Ukrainian refugees are now trying to answer the toughest questions a human can ask: “My God, what’s going to happen to me? What’s going to happen to my family?

‘Is my brother and my daddy – are they going to be okay?’

I saw tears in many of the mothers’ eyes as I embraced them; their young children – their young children not sure whether to smile or cry. One little girl said, “Mr President” -- she spoke a little English -- “is my brother and my daddy -- are they going to be okay? Will I see them again?” Without their husbands, their fathers, in many cases, their brothers or sisters who stayed back to fight for their country.

I didn’t have to speak the language or understand the language to feel the emotion in their eyes, the way they gripped my hand, and little kids hung on to my leg, praying with a desperate hope that all this is temporary; apprehension that they may be perhaps forever away from their homes, almost with debilitating sadness that this is happening all over again.

But I was also struck by the generosity of the people of Warsaw -- for that matter, all the Polish people -- for the depths of their compassion, their willingness to reach out – (applause) – opening their hearts.

Notwithstanding the brutality of Vladimir Putin, let there be no doubt that this war has already been a strategic failure for Russia already. (Applause.) Having lost children myself -- I know that’s no solace to the people who’ve lost family.

But he, Putin, thought Ukrainians would roll over and not fight. Not much of a student of history. Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance.

Rather than breaking Ukrainian resolve, Russia’s brutal tactics have strengthened the resolve. (Applause.)

Rather than driving NATO apart, the West is now stronger and more united than it has ever been. (Applause.)

Democracies revitalised

Russia wanted less of a NATO presence on its border, but now he has [we have] a stronger presence, a larger presence, with over a hundred thousand American troops here, along with all the other members of NATO.

In fact – (applause) – Russia has managed to cause something I’m sure he never intended: The democracies of the world are revitalised with purpose and unity found in months that we’d once taken years to accomplish.

It’s not only Russia’s actions in Ukraine that are reminding us of democracy’s blessing. It’s our own country – his own country, the Kremlin, is jailing protestors. Two hundred thousand people have allegedly already left. There’s a brain drain – leaving Russia. Shutting down independent news. State media is all propaganda, blocking the image of civilian targets, mass graves, starvation tactics of the Russian forces in Ukraine.

Is it any wonder, as I said, that 200,000 Russians have all left their country in one month? A remarkable brain drain in such a short period of time, which brings me to my message to the Russian people:

I’ve worked with Russian leaders for decades. I sat across the negotiating table going all the way back to Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin to talk arms control at the height of the Cold War.

I’ve always spoken directly and honestly to you, the Russian people.

The Russian people are not our enemy

Let me say this, if you’re able to listen: You, the Russian people, are not our enemy.

I refuse to believe that you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards that, for God’s sake, are being pummeled with Russian missiles and bombs; or cities being surrounded so that civilians cannot flee; supplies cut off and attempting to starve Ukrainians into submission.

Millions of families are being driven from their homes, including half of all Ukraine’s children. These are not the actions of a great nation.

Now, Vladimir Putin’s aggression has cut you, the Russian people, off from the rest of the world, and it’s taking Russia back to the 19th century.

This is not who you are. This is not the future reserve – you deserve for your families and your children. I’m telling you the truth: This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people.

Putin can and must end this war. The American people stand with you and the brave citizens of Ukraine who want peace.

It’s not enough to speak with rhetorical flourish, of ennobling words of democracy, of freedom, equality, and liberty. All of us, including here in Poland, must do the hard work of democracy each and every day. My country as well.

That’s why – (applause) – that’s why I came to Europe again this week with a clear and determined message for NATO, for the G7, for the European Union, for all freedom-loving nations: We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul. We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come. (Applause.)

For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power

It will not be easy. There will be costs. But it’s a price we have to pay. Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere.

Time and again, history shows that it’s from the darkest moments that the greatest progress follows. And history shows this is the task of our time, the task of this generation.

Let’s remember: The hammer blow that brought down the Berlin Wall, the might that lifted the Iron Curtain were not the words of a single leader; it was the people of Europe who, for decades, fought to free themselves.

Their sheer bravery opened the border between Austria and Hungary for the Pan-European Picnic. They joined hands for the Baltic Way. They stood for Solidarity here in Poland. And together, it was an unmistakable and undeniable force of the people that the Soviet Union could not withstand.

And we’re seeing it once again today with the brave Ukrainian people, showing that their power of many is greater than the will of any one dictator. (Applause.)

So, in this hour, let the words of Pope John Paul burn as brightly today: “Never, ever give up hope, never doubt, never tire, never become discouraged. Be not afraid.” (Applause.)

A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people’s love for liberty. Brutality will never grind down their will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia -- for free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.

We will have a different future – a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity, of freedom and possibilities.

For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.

God bless you all. And may God defend our freedom. (Applause.) And may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.afr.com/world/europe/this-man-cannot-remain-in-power-biden-on-putin-20220327-p5a89j
