item by item below. Here are the details.



A new Russian military convoy has been spotted thanks to satellite images, but this time the city in focus is Kharkiv (the second largest in Ukraine), and no longer Kiev. According to the images collected and analyzed by Maxar Technologies, relating to April 8, the queue of military vehicles would be 12.8 kilometers long and would be moving south, through the town of Velkyi Burluk, in eastern Ukraine.

MORE INFORMATION

The images show a convoy made up of ‚Äúarmed vehicles, trucks with artillery trailers and support equipment,‚Äù explains Maxar. A much smaller group than the one spotted at the beginning of the invasion, located outside the capital and instead 60 km long.

The moves of the Russian army

As reported in the morning by the general staff, Russian troops tried to break through the defenses of the Ukrainian armed forces near Izyum, in the Kharkov region, and to establish control over Mariupol. And the President‚Äôs Office said the Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine had already begun.",https://fresno24.com/satellite-images-reveal-the-advance/

If this is the same convoy, it was spotted Apr 8, and could have taken repeated hits. Remember, Ukraine doesn't have any real front lines. 2,000 does seem high, but not impossible, especially if there were troop trucks carrying large numbers.
