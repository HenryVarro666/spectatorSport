Putin represents the section of the Russian neo-liberal racist capitalist oligarchy that didn‚Äôt want to totally sell itself to imperialism and wanted a little bit of respect for itself. Putin leans on the Soviet nostalgia to bolster his rule as a right-wing nationalist.

It‚Äôs dangerous for Putin to play w this Soviet nostalgia cos Russian ppl don‚Äôt just see it as a nationalist project but a social one that delivered for them. Putin has to counter this by constantly trying to repackage Soviet history as right wing nationalism.",https://threadreaderapp.com/hashtag/sovietunion

It‚Äôs also taco Tuesday, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really relevant to this post‚Ä¶

And here‚Äôs President Zelenskyy‚Äôs address to Parliament in case you wanted to watch it and haven‚Äôt had a chance:

Lot‚Äôs of big news today. So if I miss something smaller, but relevant, try to flag it in the comments or tomorrow. Also, for those of you who are read more tag enthusiasts (fetishists?), I simply forgot to toggle it on last night, that‚Äôs why it wasn‚Äôt there. No need to freak out, I just plain forgot to embed it. Remember, there‚Äôs a war on where one side‚Äôs rules of engagement appear to be disregard all laws of war, Geneva conventions, and professional military ethics in order to commit as many war crimes as possible. So maybe if the read more tag isn‚Äôt used you don‚Äôt have anything real to actually bitch about provided no one is dropping 1,000 pound bombs on your home or shooting at you from a tank while you‚Äôre in your car in front of a hospital or invading your city and forcing you to hide with no food, water, electricity, or medical supplies/medicine or you‚Äôre walking however far you have to go to get to safety.

You can let us know there‚Äôs an issue without the drama. If there‚Äôs a legitimate problem with the site, let someone know, otherwise, perspective people, get some!

One last house keeping item: everyone please dial it back a bit in the comments. I get it, everyone is pissed off at Russia. Unfortunately, because of the nature of Putin‚Äôs Russia, we do not have any really good way of knowing how much popular support he has for this war against Ukraine, nor how many people really actually know what is going on. Being pissed at Putin, the oligarchs, siloviki, strongmen, political, and military leaders, as well as the repugnant people licking his jackboots in Russian state controlled media is all well and good. But it is important to keep a bit of perspective here and separate all of those horrible people and the Russian state from the actual Russian people. Because when all of this is over, those people who have been propagandized to believe we‚Äôve been waging war on them for 30 plus years, are going to need a lot of our help, compassion, and charity. And that doesn‚Äôt mean that the Ukrainians are more deserving of any and all of that right now and won‚Äôt need it too.

Let‚Äôs start with everyone‚Äôs favorite: MiG 29s, MiG 29s, who has the MiG 29s? Poland‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs put out the following statement this morning:

Statement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland in connection with the statement by the US Secretary of State on providing airplanes to Ukraine The authorities of the Republic of Poland, after consultations between the President and the Government, are ready to deploy ‚Äì immediately and free of charge ‚Äì all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America. At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes. The Polish Government also requests other NATO Allies ‚Äì owners of MIG-29 jets ‚Äì to act in the same vein.

And everyone started celebrating. Unfortunately no one seemed to have told either the State Department or the Department of Defense!

Undersecretary of State Toria Nuland, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, just said this statement was not pre-consulted with the U.S. Seems to have come as a bit of a surprise. https://t.co/GpjvK7MMwB ‚Äî Amy Mackinnon (@ak_mack) March 8, 2022

‚ö°Ô∏è Pentagon questions Poland's proposal to transfer MIG-29 jets to US. ‚ÄúIt is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,‚Äù Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said. ‚Äî The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) March 8, 2022

I‚Äôm not sure if anyone has any idea what is actually going on with the Polish MiGs right now. This may have just been Poland‚Äôs way of dumping the logistics problem back on the US. So until we can fix it, nothing is actually happening, but Poland looks like it did something so everyone stops pestering them.

I also want to highlight this statement from Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov from earlier today before we get to the read more jump. Especially because the PRC‚Äôs Foreign Ministry seems to be backing it up.

#BREAKING: #Russia's FM Lavrov: ""We have information the #US built two biological warfare labs in #Kiev & #Odessa. They have developed pathogens in those labs in #Ukraine."" Things are going from bad to worse‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.pic.twitter.com/Tp2TJkX7ID ‚Äî Indo-Pacific News ‚Äì Watching the CCP-China Threat (@IndoPac_Info) March 8, 2022

#BREAKING: #China ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe #US has 336 bio labs in 30 countries under its control, including 26 in #Ukraine alone.

Russian military doctrine for setting a theater of operations is to achieve informational dominance prior to conducting actual lethal or kinetic operations. My worry is that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing here with these clearly bullshit accusations. Specifically that the agitprop that Lavrov is spewing and the PRC‚Äôs Foreign Ministry is amplifying is not just misinformation, but intended to establish an informational narrative and context in which Russia undertakes a biological attack against either Russian speakers in Donestk or Luhansk or Russians within Russia proper. This would reinforce their false causus belli, but also serve as a provocation to rally Russians to support Putin and his war against Ukraine. Also, because it is an accusation the US has biological warfare labs, this is intended to be easily digested, repeated and retransmitted, and amplified by the QAnon and anti-Fauci crowd here in the US.

Much, much, much more after the jump!

Biden announced that the US will stop purchasing Russian petroleum:

Britain is doing the same thing on an extended timeline:

The rest of the EU member states so far are not on board. We‚Äôll see if this becomes a major issue between the US, the UK, and the EU.

For those of you that have to have a Coke or a Pepsi, you‚Äôll be happy to know that both companies are suspending sales and operations in Russia for the time being. McDonald‚Äôs is also closing operations at their stores in Russia too.

A lot of people are making maps of the Russian invasion forces, where they are, what they‚Äôve occupied, etc. All of them have flaws and if you all want I can do a technical post on the specifics later, but the bottom line is they‚Äôre both showing that Russia is controlling too much of Ukraine and not enough of Ukraine at the same time. Basically, showing the roads that Russia has convoys of troops and/or supplies on is indicating more control than Russia has in those areas of Ukraine. Not being able to drill into the actual cities or towns or villages may either under or over represent the Russian control in some places. And since everyone is trying to be careful and not give away Ukrainian military positions, the Ukrainian military information is usually completely missing from these maps. Why is this important?

There‚Äôs been a lot talk, reporting, and analysis that Russia will have Kyiv encircled soon, but provided this Ukrainian MOD map is correct, unless something changes, that doesn‚Äôt seem likely:

As long as the Ukrainians can hold their lines in the suburbs, bedroom communities, and towns outside of Kyiv, then they can hold Kyiv. Putin needs to take that capitol as quickly as possible. He needs to be able to get his quislings in place ASAP so they can claim to be the new, real de-NAZIfied Ukrainian government and sign the bogus documents on official letterhead capitulating to Putin‚Äôs demands. Every day the defenses in Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and Gostomel hold is a day that Putin is definitely not winning!

Which is why this reporting is good news!

That is going to leave a mark!

I‚Äôm sure that by now everyone has seen references to twenty-seven senior, experienced foreign policy professionals signing an open letter calling on the Biden administration to establish an aerial exclusion zone over Ukraine. Every signatory knows exactly what that entails including the risks.

Open Letter Calling for Limited No-Fly Zone We, the undersigned, urge the Biden administration, together with NATO allies, to

impose a limited No-Fly Zone over Ukraine starting with protection for humanitarian

corridors that were agreed upon in talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials on

Thursday. NATO leaders should convey to Russian officials that they do not seek direct

confrontation with Russian forces, but they must also make clear that they will not

countenance Russian attacks on civilian areas.

Vladimir Putin‚Äôs decision to invade Ukraine has caused massive devastation and loss of

life for Ukrainians. His premeditated, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression has

created the greatest crisis on the European continent since the end of World War II.

Despite the truly heroic efforts by Ukrainian soldiers and average citizens to resist the

marauding Russian forces, Putin‚Äôs military is poised for further attacks on major cities,

including the capital Kyiv. Targeting residential buildings, hospitals and government

complexes, as well as nuclear power plants, Russian forces will be responsible for an

even higher death toll.

The international community has responded swiftly through an unprecedented array of

sanctions and a significant increase in lethal military assistance to help Ukraine defend

itself. But more must be done to prevent more widescale casualties and a potential

bloodbath. President Biden and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg have stated that neither the

United States nor NATO will engage Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine. What we

seek is the deployment of American and NATO aircraft not in search of confrontation

with Russia but to avert and deter Russian bombardment that would result in massive

loss of Ukrainian lives. This is in addition to the request from Ukrainian leaders for A-10

and MIG-29 aircraft to help Ukrainians defend themselves, which we also strongly

support. Already more than a million Ukrainians have fled their country to escape the brutality

Putin has unleashed. Estimates suggest that that number could reach 5 million, more

than 10 percent of the population. Several thousand Ukrainians have already died from

Putin‚Äôs latest aggression, on top of the more than 14,000 killed following Putin‚Äôs first

invasion of Ukraine starting in 2014. Ukraine is facing a severe humanitarian disaster,

and the effects are being felt across the European continent and beyond.

The refrain ‚Äúnever again‚Äù emerged in the wake of the Holocaust, and Ukrainians are

wondering whether that pledge applies to them. It is time for the United States and

NATO to step up their help for Ukrainians before more innocent civilians fall victim to

Putin‚Äôs murderous madness. Ukrainians are courageously defending their country and

their freedom, but they need more help from the international community. A U.S.-

NATO enforced No-Fly Zone to protect humanitarian corridors and additional military

means for Ukrainian self-defense are desperately needed, and needed now.

The twenty-seven signatories and their affiliations are at the link. I know two of them, but not well. On a personal note, no one ever asks me to sign their open letters to presidential administrations‚Ä¶

We spend a lot of time highlighting what is going on in Ukraine, but not a lot about what is going on in Russian occupied Dohetsk and Luhansk. Largely because there‚Äôs not a lot of coverage of what is going on there. Russian forces have occupied 100 towns, villages, etc. This site has updates:
