Russian forces secured limited advances east of Kyiv and north from Crimea on March 12 but continue to face logistical challenges, mounting casualties, and sustained Ukrainian counterattacks. Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations northwest of Kyiv in the past 24 hours. Russian forces made limited advances around Chernihiv and toward Kyiv’s eastern outskirts after pausing for several days. Continued Ukrainian counterattacks and successful operations by Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Forces continue to threaten Russia’s long line of communication in northeastern Ukraine. Russian forces captured unspecified “eastern outskirts” of Mariupol on March 12 and continue to shell the city in a likely effort to force it to capitulate.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations northwest of Kyiv for the second day in a row.

Russian forces resumed limited attacks toward northeastern Kyiv and renewed efforts to fully encircle Chernihiv.

Ongoing Ukrainian counterattacks in northeastern Ukraine are likely forcing Russia to redeploy forces away from offensive operations toward Kyiv to consolidate its long line of communication.

Russian forces made limited territorial gains in eastern Mariupol and continued to shell the city.

The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces conducted a new advance northeast from Kherson along the western bank of the Dnipro.

The Ukrainian military claimed to have damaged or destroyed 31 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) as of March 11.

The Kremlin likely seeks to deter continuing Western military aid shipments to Ukraine, threatening that Russia will view Western military aid shipments to Ukraine as legitimate military targets on March 12.

The Ukrainian military claimed to have damaged or destroyed 31 Russian BTGs as of March 11, its first numbered claim of damage to Russian forces of the war. Ukrainian military intelligence reported at 6:00 am local time on March 12 that Ukrainian forces have destroyed 13 Russian BTGs and rendered 18 BTGs combat ineffective as of March 11.[1] US intelligence estimated Russia deployed approximately 120 BTGs to Ukraine’s borders prior to February 24.[2] The Ukrainian military has not previously made any official statements on numbers of destroyed Russian BTGs. The Ukrainian General Staff continues to report widespread Russian logistics and morale issues, stating on March 12 that Russia “was forced to change tactics” due to unsuccessful attempts to conduct an offensive, that Russian units continue to abandon equipment, and that the rate of Russian desertions and surrenders to Ukrainian forces is increasing.[3] The General Staff additionally stated that Russia is calling up conscripts from the DNR and LNR, mercenaries from Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and Russian convicted prisoners to offset heavy combat losses and reserve problems.[4] The Ukrainian Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) reported on March 12 that Russian commanders authorized their soldiers to loot civilian businesses and households and move to ”self sufficiency” to offset continued supply problems.[5]

Ukraine updated its previous report that Russian aircraft bombed the Belarusian town of Kopani on March 11 in a likely false-flag attack, adding that Russian aircraft also bombed Bukhlichi and Verkhny Terebezh.[6] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian and Belarusian forces have not conducted any military operations toward western Ukraine but that Minsk is “taking measures to strengthen the protection of the border with Ukraine” and Ukraine cannot rule out Belarus entering the war.[7]

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov claimed that Russia will view Western military aid shipments to Ukraine as legitimate military targets on March 12.[8] Ryabkov claimed Russia previously warned the United States that ”pumping Ukraine with weapons” is dangerous and makes the arms shipments military targets. Ryabkov reiterated Kremlin claims that the United States provoked the war in Ukraine by supplying Ukraine with weapons. The Kremlin likely seeks to deter continuing Western military aid to Ukraine by threatening to target arms shipments, though Russian forces have so far conducted relatively few air and missile strikes in western Ukraine to date and would likely face strong Ukrainian air defenses.

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv; Supporting effort 1a—Luhansk Oblast;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis are aimed at encircling the city from the northwest, west, and east.

Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations northwest of Kyiv in the past 24 hours. Russian forces made limited advances around Chernihiv and toward Kyiv’s eastern outskirts after pausing for several days. Continued Ukrainian counterattacks and successful operations by Territorial Defense Forces continue to threaten Russia’s long line of communication in northeastern Ukraine.

Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro

Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations northwest of Kyiv for the second day in a row.[9] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces continued to regroup and replenish reserves. Russian forces continue to shell Kyiv’s northwestern suburbs but did not launch any ground attacks on March 11-12.[10] Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian loitering munitions-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over downtown Kyiv on March 12, the first Russian use of armed UAVs in Ukraine that ISW has observed.[11] Russian forces are likely deploying new assets to the western Kyiv front as part of ongoing resupply and replenishment efforts.

Subordinate supporting effort—Chernihiv axis

Russian forces resumed limited attacks toward northeastern Kyiv on March 12. The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces attacked toward Zazymya (northwest of Brovary) and Vyshenky with unspecified “partial success.”[12] Russian forces attacked toward Mykhailo-Kotsyubynske and Shestovytsia, roughly 15km west and southwest of Chernihiv, in a likely effort to fully encircle the city.[13] The Ukrainian General Staff additionally reported the deployment of Russian bridging equipment in Mykhailo-Kotsyubynske, Levkovychi, Zhukotka, and Hrodnya, around Chernihiv.[14] Russian forces may be preparing for an operation to cross the Desna River from west to east to further surround Chernihiv.

Subordinate supporting effort—Sumy axis

Russian forces continued to reinforce the Sumy axis on March 12 and did not launch new ground offensives.[15] The Ukrainian General Staff reported at midnight local time on March 11 that Russian forces are shifting reserves in Velyka Pysarivka, Moskovsky Bobryak, and Lebedyn – several towns along Russia’s exposed ground line of communication in northeastern Ukraine.[16] Ukrainian territorial defense forces additionally conducted at least two successful attacks near Sumy on March 11, destroying and capturing several Russian tanks and artillery vehicles.[17] ISW previously assessed that continuing Ukrainian counterattacks in northeastern Ukraine would force Russia to redeploy forces to consolidate this long line of communication.[18]

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv:

Russian forces captured unspecified northern portions of Izyum, 110km southeast of Kharkiv, on March 12.[19] Russian forces additionally launched an unsuccessful attack on Rubizhne, south of Kharkiv.[20] Russian forces continued to shell Kharkiv but did not conduct any major ground attacks on March 12.[21] Russian forces likely seek to bypass Kharkiv from the southeast and advance toward Dnipro and Zaporizhya, but are unlikely to make substantial advances without committing further combat power.

Supporting Effort #1a—Luhansk Oblast:

The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces concentrated additional reserves in Severodonetsk and Svatove but did not conduct any offensive operations in the past 24 hours.[22]

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast:

The Ukrainian General Staff confirmed Russian forces captured the “eastern outskirts” of Mariupol on March 12 but did not provide further details.[23] Ukrainian forces reported repelling a Russian offensive toward Krasna Polyana and Olhynka – two towns north of Mariupol which Russian forces previously claimed to have already captured – as of noon local time on March 12.[24] Russian forces are unlikely to seize Mariupol through a direct assault without a greater concentration of forces (which they remain unlikely to have the ability to assemble). Russia will likely continue to shell the city and maintain gradual ground assaults to force the city to capitulate.

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and west:

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces conducted a new advance northeast from Kherson along the western bank of the Dnipro on March 12, deploying artillery and air defense assets to Mylove.[25] Russian forces have not yet conducted attacks at strength along the west bank of the Dnipro on the southern axis of advance. Russian forces may intend to advance northeast to encircle Zaporizhya, but are unlikely to have the forces necessary to do so while Russian forces in the south remain committed to the encirclement of Mariupol. Russian forces directly south of Zaporizhya conducted limited advances on March 12, capturing Stepove and Shcherbaky (approximately 40km south of Zaporizhya).[26]

Russian forces did not conduct any new attacks toward Mykolayiv on March 12 and reinforced their existing positions.[27] Russian forces are unlikely to resume major offensive operations toward Odesa in the next 48-72 hours.

Immediate items to watch

The Kremlin likely seeks to pressure Belarus to join the war in Ukraine and will deploy Syrian fighters to Ukraine in the near future;

Ukrainian counterattacks and operations by Territorial Defense Forces in northeastern Ukraine threaten Russia’s exposed line of communication, requiring Russia to redeploy forces away from the offensive toward eastern Kyiv;

Russian forces are undertaking another operational pause to prepare for renewed efforts to encircle Kyiv from east and west and/or to seize the city center itself following their failures of March 8-9;

Russian troops may drive on Zaporizhya City itself within the next 48-72 hours, likely to try and block it on both banks of the Dnipro River and set conditions for subsequent operations after Russian forces take Mariupol, which they are currently besieging.

Russian forces again conducted few ground offensives on March 13, only securing new terrain in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces predominantly took measures to restore combat readiness and regrouped combat units as of noon local time on March 13.[1] Russian forces continue to assemble reinforcements and attempt to improve logistical support in both the Kyiv and southern operational directions. Russian forces may intend to resume larger-scale attacks on both axes of advance in the coming week, but will likely take longer to (or may never) cohere the combat power necessary to complete the encirclement of Kyiv.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations northwest of Kyiv for the third day in a row.

Russian forces did not conduct attacks toward northeastern Kyiv and prioritized reinforcing their lines of communication and logistics routes.

Russian and proxy forces successfully captured several towns north of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast on March 13, the only offensive ground actions of the day.

Ukrainian protests in occupied Kherson are likely expanding.

Russia is diluting its international deployments in Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh to reinforce operations in Ukraine and pulling additional forces from Russia’s far east.

Ukrainian intelligence reported Russia will deploy preexisting pro-Assad Syrian units to Ukraine, in addition to previously announced plans to recruit new Syrian and Libyan mercenaries. These forces are unlikely to enable Russia to favorably change the balance of forces around Kyiv in the next week but may provide a longer-term pool of low-quality replacements.

Russian ballistic missiles killed 35 Ukrainians at the Yavoriv military training center near Poland in a likely effort to interdict Western aid deliveries to Ukraine—following up on the Kremlin’s March 12 announcement it will treat international aid shipments as military targets.

Russia is increasingly pulling forces from its international deployments to reinforce operations in Ukraine, though these deployments are unlikely to shift the balance of forces in the coming week. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on March 13 that 800 personnel from Russia’s 102nd Base in Armenia deployed to an unknown location in Russia on March 9-10 in preparation to deploy to Ukraine.[2] They also reported that Russia is recalling elements of its peacekeeping deployment in Nagorno-Karabakh to replenish losses in Ukraine.[3] Russia will likely draw further forces from its international deployments in Armenia, Tajikistan, and Syria to replace losses in Ukraine. The Ukrainian General Staff separately reported that Russia plans to deploy 1,500 troops from Russia’s 40th Naval Infantry Brigade (of the Pacific Fleet) to Belarus via rail at an unspecified time.[4]

Ukrainian intelligence provided further details on Russia’s initiative to deploy existing pro-Assad units to Ukraine and recruit additional Syrian and Libyan mercenaries on March 13. Ukraine’s Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported that Russia is recruiting mercenaries from Syria and Libya and will pay them around $300-$600 monthly.[5] Russia reportedly opened 14 recruitment centers in Syria and will transport mercenaries to the Chkalovsky airbase in Moscow Oblast after they receive training. The GUR reported that Russia has already gathered “thousands” of Syrian troops, mainly those specialized in heavy artillery and sniper weapons, from the National Defense Forces and 5th Corps—two Russian-backed pro-Assad units. Russia can likely redeploy its established Syrian proxy forces in the National Defense Militia and 5th Corps on relatively short notice, dependent on its airlift capacity. However, even hurriedly trained Syrian and Libyan mercenaries will likely take weeks or months to deploy to Ukraine and will likely be of lower quality than the already poor Russian forces in Ukraine. Russia is unlikely to successfully mobilize the reinforcements and replacements necessary to favorably change the balance of forces around Kyiv in the next week but may successfully generate a longer-term pool of low-quality replacements.

The Kremlin may be seeking to take direct control of Belarusian units to deploy them in Ukraine but faces Belarusian resistance. Independent Ukrainian media reported on March 13 that Russian commanders are taking control of Belarusian units to suppress Belarusian soldiers’ efforts to resist going to war in Ukraine and reported “riots” in some Brest-based units.[6] ISW cannot independently confirm these reports through other sources at this time; if confirmed, the reports support ISW’s previous assessment that the Kremlin seeks to bring Belarus into the war but faces resistance from both Belarusian soldiers and Belarusian President Lukashenko. The Ukrainian General Staff additionally reported that Russian forces established a base for repairing and restoring military equipment in Kulichikha, Belarus, (17 km from the border) on March 13.[7]

Russian ballistic missiles struck the Yavoriv military training center, northwest of Lviv, and less than 10 kilometers from the Polish border, and killed at least 35 Ukrainian personnel on March 13.[8] The United States and NATO conduct the majority of their joint training with Ukrainian forces at Yavoriv, and Ukraine is likely using Yavoriv as a primary staging ground for military aid deliveries through Poland. The Kremlin announced on March 12 that it will treat Western aid deliveries to Ukraine as legitimate military targets and will likely conduct further strikes on western Ukraine in the coming week to interdict Ukrainian supplies.[9] Russian forces are increasingly using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Ukraine, including an armed Forpost-R UCAV on March 13.[10] The Ukrainian air force and air defenses remain active, however, and claimed to shoot down two Ka-52s helicopters, one Su-34 fighter bomber, an unidentified Sukhoi jet, and two drones on March 13.[11]

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv; Supporting effort 1a—Luhansk Oblast;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis are aimed at encircling the city from the northwest, west, and east.

Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations northwest of Kyiv in the past 24 hours for the third day in a row. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces prioritized reconnoitering Ukrainian positions in preparation for resuming attacks on Kyiv.

Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro

Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations northwest of Kyiv for the third day in a row.[12] The Ukrainian General Staff specified that Russian forces concentrated on reconnaissance and “clarifying Ukrainian positions” northwest of Kyiv, the first time the Ukrainian General Staff has specified reconnaissance as a Russian daily focus.[13] Fighting continued in Irpin, a western Kyiv suburb, and Russian forces killed American journalist Brent Renaud in the town on March 13.[14]

Subordinate supporting effort—Chernihiv and Sumy axis

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces northeast of Kyiv “moved to the defense” in the last 24 hours and focused on replenishing supplies and conducting reconnaissance.[15] The General Staff reported that Russia deployed forward additional units from the Central Military District. Russian forces likely intend to reinforce their exposed line of communication in northeastern Ukraine against counterattacks prior to resuming offensive operations toward northeastern Kyiv.

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv:

Russian forces launched an unsuccessful attack on Izyum, southeast of Kharkiv, on March 13.[16] Russian forces likely seek to bypass Kharkiv from the southeast and advance towards Dnipro and Zaporizhia but are unlikely to make substantial advances without committing further combat power. The Ukrainian General Staff additionally reported at noon local time on March 13 that a BTG of the 6th Combined Arms Army withdrew to Belgorod to restore combat capability after fighting in the Kharkiv city area.[17]

Supporting Effort #1a—Luhansk Oblast:

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces are gathering reserves in Luhansk Oblast for a renewed offensive on Severodonetsk.[18] The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that Russian forces captured the eastern and southern outskirts of Severodonetsk on March 13.[19]

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast:

Russian and proxy forces launched several successful assaults north of Mariupol in Donetsk Oblast on March 13.[20] The Ukrainian General Staff confirmed that Russian forces captured Staromlynivka, Yevhenivka, Pavlivka, and Yegorivka as of noon local time on March 13. Ukrainian forces repulsed Russian attacks on Volnovakha.[21] The Russian MoD claimed its forces advanced 14km on March 12.[22] Russian forces additionally heavily shelled civilian infrastructure in Donetsk Oblast on March 12-13.[23]

Russian forces continued sporadic assaults on Mariupol on March 13. Ukrainian forces claimed to kill 15 Russian servicemen and stated Ukrainian forces remain in high spirits despite poor communications.[24] Russian forces are unlikely to seize Mariupol through a direct assault without a greater concentration of forces (which they remain unlikely to have the ability to assemble). Russia will likely continue to shell the city and maintain gradual ground assaults to force the city to capitulate.

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and west:

Russian forces did not conduct any offensive actions toward Mykolayiv or Zaporizhia on March 13.[25] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces are gathering reserves, including additional VDV (Airborne) forces, south of Zaporizhia for a likely offensive toward the city but did not conduct any attacks on March 13.[26] Russian forces may intend to advance to encircle Zaporizhia but are unlikely to have the forces necessary to do so while Russian forces in the south remain committed to the encirclement of Mariupol.

Ukrainian protests in occupied Kherson are likely expanding. The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian troops fired in response to a large protest (reported by independent Ukrainian media to be in the low thousands) in Kherson on March 13 but did not report any casualties.[27] Ukrainian residents also protested in occupied Berdyansk and Melitopol on March 13.[28] Kherson Mayor Igor Kolikhayev announced that he rejected a Russian attempt to force Kherson residents to pass a referendum announcing a ”Kherson People’s Republic.”[29] If confirmed, this Russian effort may indicate a possible Russian approach to governing occupied Ukraine—dividing it up into several separate proxy ”People’s Republics” modeled on the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics.

Immediate items to watch

The Kremlin likely seeks to pressure Belarus to join the war in Ukraine and will deploy Syrian fighters to Ukraine in the near future;

Ukrainian counterattacks and operations by Territorial Defense Forces in northeastern Ukraine threaten Russia’s exposed line of communicating, requiring Russia to redeploy forces away from the offensive toward eastern Kyiv;

It was where families living further east sent their children to keep them safe.

Vasyl Kunets, a driver who lives in Novoyavorivsk, a town about 20 miles from Lviv, said that up until now, when the sirens indicating a potential air raid went off, he wasn’t too worried. He’d go to safety, but perhaps not as fast as he should have.

The war was still far away.

That all changed when Russian strikes hit the Yavoriv military training ground at the edge of Novoyavorivsk and killed 35 people, the Lviv regional administration said Sunday.

More than 30 missiles fired from warplanes over the Black and Azov seas had hit the military base, said Maksym Kozytsky, head of the Lviv regional military administration, in a statement posted to Facebook Sunday.

Suddenly, the war was on Kunets’ doorstep.

The training base is intertwined with the life in the town. Many of its residents are employed there, or in services supporting it. Those who don’t work for it directly know someone who does.

Kunets saw the damage they’ve inflicted first hand.

""I saw when the rocket hit the ground, I've seen the explosion and the smoke, a mushroom cloud of smoke and fire,"" he told CNN.

""It lasted 30 minutes and I heard maybe eight strikes, maybe some rockets crashing or part of rockets exploding separately, I don’t know.""

Kunets told CNN the attack against the base ""changed everything.""

""We are worried now. I'm not worried for myself but for my kids. People are worried about the safety of their families and some of them are considering moving somewhere else,"" he said.

Kunets said he is now thinking about sending his two children away from Ukraine -- something he didn’t necessarily consider before.

""It feels less safe and more dangerous. Yesterday and the day before yesterday we were more relaxed and when we heard the alarms we didn't move so quick, we didn't take it too seriously. But today we are packing and being ready to leave very fast when we hear the alarm,"" he said.

The occupiers are cynically killing even journalists in the international media who are trying to show the truth about the atrocities of Russian troops in Ukraine.

Today, a 51-year-old correspondent of world-famous media New York Times was killed in Irpin. Another journalist was injured. Now they are trying to take the victim out of the combat zone.

Of course, the profession of a journalist involves risk, but US citizen Brent Renaud paid with his life for trying to expose the aggressor's insidiousness, cruelty, and brutality.

Another journalist was wounded. He was taken to the largest children's hospital - Okhmatdyt.

The injured 46-year-old American journalist Juan Diego Herrera Arredondo was conscious. The man received a shrapnel wound to the thigh. Right now, he is being operated on by Okhmatdit's doctors. He does not yet know the fate of his colleague. The last thing he remembers is that his partner was shot in the neck at a Russian roadblock.

Russian war criminals carry out rocket bombings and artillery damage to civilian infrastructure in Ukrainian cities of Chernihiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Mariupol, Avdiivka, Volnovakha and suburbs of large settlements throughout Ukraine, as well as groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

The military leadership of the Republic of Belarus continues taking measures to gather troops on its border with Ukraine. The possibility of direct participation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus in the military operation against Ukraine on the side of the occupiers in the Volyn direction still remains high.

The enemy is conducting air reconnaissance of military and civilian objects on the territory of Ukraine.

The opponent continues the aggressive operation against Ukraine in the Polish, Siversky, Slobozhansky, Donetsky, Tavriysky and South Buzky directions. The occupants are conducting measures to restore combat and regrouping the troops, as well as preparing for the continuation of offensive actions.

In the process of regrouping the enemy's troops, the preparation of additional units for fighting on the territory of Ukraine is carried out. Yes, according to the available information, during March 9-10, 800 soldiers of the 102nd military base (Gumri, Armenia) of the Southern military district were deployed to the Russian Federation for further transfer to the war zone. Up to 1500 people of the 40th separate marine brigade (Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky) of the Pacific fleet by railway eschelons are sent to the Republic of Belarus. In the 820 missile attack warning center (Solnechnogorsk) a selection of personnel to participate in combat actions against Ukraine is being held.

For the purpose of the urgent replenishment of the losses of the occupation troops of the Russian Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, part of the ""peaceful"" contingent from Nagirny Karabakh (Azerbaijan) to Ukraine. Also, according to the available information, a large number of militants from other countries are involved (Syria, Serbia).

In the Volyn direction, the opponent did not conduct offensive actions. The military leadership of the Republic of Belarus continues measures to strengthen border security with Ukraine. The probability of the direct participation of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus in the military operation against Ukraine on the side of the occupiers in the Volyn direction.

In all directions of the entry, the opponent is actively covered by civil infrastructure and civilians.

Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine

The defense of the city of Mariupol continues. The city is of strategic importance to the Russian enemy in order to provide a corridor by land to the occupied Crimea from the occupied territory of the south of the Donetsk oblast, which is controlled by the Russian Federation. During the 12 days of the siege of the city and the relentless shelling of residential areas, 1,582 peaceful Mariupol residents were killed by Russian occupation forces. This is revenge for the steadfastness of residents who have been expressing their pro-Ukrainian position since 2014.

The shelling continues in Kharkiv region. Enemy troops continue to attack the settlements from the ground and the sky. Kharkiv continues its strong defense and is not going to give up.

Russian terrorist forces destroy peaceful Ukrainians and Ukrainian cities.

As a result of heavy enemy shelling of settlements in Luhansk region: Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Rubizhne, about 22 high-rise and 33 private houses, 1 government building, 2 educational institutions, 1 state organization, 1 trade establishment, 1 enterprise were damaged.

One person was killed and another was injured.

In Kreminna, the occupiers fired from a tank at a house for the elderly.

All night Russian planes and artillery struck in the north of Donetsk region. On the night of March 12-13 near the station Brusyn in the Donetsk region was hit by wreckage during the shelling of the Kramatorsk-Lviv passenger train. It was going on an evacuation to the city of Lyman to pick up residents of Luhansk and Donetsk regions who were in the zone of fierce fighting.

One of the conductors of this train was killed and another was injured and taken to Slovyansk Hospital, where she is currently being treated.

In Chernihiv as a result of a night air strike and shelling - previously 4 people died. One person died as a result of an air strike on a high-rise building. The fire after that killed 3 people.

Near Bucha in the Kyiv region, the occupiers shot a car under a white flag: the couple was on their way to evacuation. On the highway between Lypivka and Kalynivka, the enemy fired at a car of Makarov residents who were trying to get out of the blockade. A 63-year-old man and his 31-year-old wife died on the spot.

Dymerska, Ivankivska, Poliska communities in Kyiv region have been under blockade since the second day of the war. No light, heating, food and water. People haven't seen humanitarian aid, it just doesn't reach them.

Over the past day, racist troops fired about 50 times using artillery and missile shells to Kharkiv region.

The missiles completely destroyed the civilian airport in Ivano-Frankivsk.

By killing civilians and shelling Ukrainian cities, the aggressor's army is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine, in violation of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and its additional protocols.

I call on the international community to take decisive action to deter the aggression of the Russian Federation and to force the aggressor country to immediately cease hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.

Adviser to the Head of the Office of President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak

Any initiatives in the occupied cities in the south of Ukraine, in Kherson, Kakhovka, Henichesk, aimed at holding ""referendums"", fictitious sessions of local councils, distributing passports, are absolutely useless. Russian troops will leave Ukraine, collaborators will be prosecuted.

Liudmyla Denisova, Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights

The occupiers of the Russian Federation plan to hold a referendum in occupied Kherson for the creation of the ""Kherson People's Republic"" against the will of the people.

Currently, the invaders are calling the deputies of the local regional council and offering to cooperate to create an ""independent republic"" in the Kherson region.

I emphasize that, in accordance with the 1907 Hague Convention, the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and Additional Protocol 1 to the 1977 Geneva Convention, the occupying power does not acquire sovereignty over the occupied territory and must comply with the laws in force in that territory.

In the case of any election or referendum, it is the Constitution of Ukraine, Article 73 of which stipulates that issues of the territory of Ukraine are resolved exclusively by an all-Ukrainian referendum.

The occupier's initiation of a referendum on the secession of Kherson, obviously without the consent of the local population, is a gross violation of the right to choose and participate in governing their country, established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966, Protocol № 1 on the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of 1950.

I appeal to the world community to increase the sanctions pressure on the aggressor state of the Russian Federation and to take all measures to withdraw the occupying racist troops from Ukraine.

https://www.facebook.com/100044138451142/posts/500992834715327/?d=n

In the occupied Kherson and Berdyansk, thousands of people protested against the occupiers, stating that “Kherson is Ukraine” and “Berdyansk is Ukraine”. In Kherson, the invaders opened fire at the rally.

ENERGY

GTS Operator of Ukraine

State of operation of the Ukrainian GTS on March 13, 10 a.m.

Employees of GTSOU work on localizing the damage caused by shelling and resume gas transportation to Ukrainian consumers:

In the Donetsk region, repair crews of GTSOU joined in repairing damage to the city’s gas distribution networks in Vuhledar town, which is currently under fire from the occupiers. Together with the staff of Donetskoblgaz, our colleagues try to minimize emergencies and maintain gas supplies to the town.

In the Luhansk region, our team managed to launch the Popasna GDS, and 20,000 residents of the city are again with gas. However, as a result of a fire due to hostilities at the Rubizhne CPP (cardboard and packaging plant), the section of the Rubizhne GDS leading to the plant was shut down.

In the Mykolaiv region, enemy shells damaged objects of the GTS and a network of the regional gas distribution company. The Bashtanka and Prybuzke gas distribution stations were shut down. At the Bashtanka GDS, a projectile was hit, and due to active hostilities, the GDS operator could not approach the station. At GDS Prybuzke, the shell damaged automatic equipment; at the request of Mykolaivoblgaz, the station was stopped because of destruction in the city gas distribution networks. Also, at the request of the direct consumer gas, GTSOU stopped gas supply through GDS-1 Nikolaev, which feeds “Zorya”-”Mashproekt” research and production complex. From 3789 of the gas distribution stations – the last links of the gas transmission infrastructure leading to Ukrainian consumers – 37 remain disconnected at 10:00 on March 13.",https://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/ukraine-war-bulletin-march-13-430-pm-est
4,ad666784-0324-4efd-bff1-2883058e95a8,"[""Rfe Rl'S Ukrainian Service""]",,"KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has threatened to break off talks with Moscow should Russian forces wipe out the remaining Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Mariupol as Moscow claimed it had taken control of the besieged and battered port city after a weeks-long battle.

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

WATCH: A Ukrainian woman has given RFE/RL a detailed account of how she was raped by a Russian Army soldier. To protect her privacy, we have pixelated her face and we are not disclosing her name. Ukrainian police have been informed of the case.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.

Today, March 14, is the nineteenth day Russia's military attack on Ukraine continues. We're reporting about all the current news. The article will be constantly updated.

What is today?

Key points.

The Command of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs: During the past 24hrs, four planes, three helicopters, and an unmanned aerial vehicle of the occupiers were hit by the air defense forces of the state.

In one of the strategic directions in the Kyiv region, a group of enemy aircraft of the Su-35, Su-34, and Su-25 types tried to launch missile and bomb strikes on the defensive redoubts of Ukrainian defenders. And while the Air Force fighters were in a positional air confrontation with the overwhelming forces of the occupiers, the air defenses fired anti-aircraft missiles at enemy air targets. Three hits on enemy planes were previously recorded.

Anti-aircraft missile forces also report the destruction of three Russian helicopters and one UAV.

The air defense of the North Operational Command destroyed another plane of the occupiers in the morning!

Total combat losses of the enemy from 24.02 to 14.03:

personnel – more than 12,000 people;

tanks – 389;

armored combat vehicles – 1249;

artillery systems – 150;

MLRS – 64;

air defense means – 34;

aircraft – 77;

helicopters – 90;

automotive equipment – 617;

ships / boats – 3;

fuel tanks – 60;

UAV of operational and tactical level – 8.

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has started using the face recognition system of the American company Clearview AI, which has access to a database of 10 billion photos. 2 billion of them are from the VKontakte social media. The system will help identify Russian assailants, fight misinformation and identify the dead.

The enemies will not be able to eat at the expense of Ukraine in captivity. All Russian prisoners of war will either be exchanged for captured Ukrainians, or will serve their sentences in Ukraine and work to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure.

""We are going through the worst ordeal in our history, in our lives. We protect the most precious thing we have. We must hold on, we must fight. And we will win. I believe in that,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Today is Volunteer Fighter Day! Ukrainian volunteers are a symbol of heroism, patriotism, and courage. We will win! Glory to Ukraine!

Important! Rescuers once again ask not to spread the exact coordinates of the impact of Russian missiles immediately after the shelling and not to help the occupiers ""finish"" certain objects. This also applies to those in power. Being the first doesn't always mean being useful, says Svitlana Vodolaha, a spokeswoman for the State Emergency Service in Kyiv.

The UN Security Council is convening an extraordinary meeting on the activities of the OSCE Mission to Ukraine. Last week, the OSCE monitoring mission evacuated all its international members from Ukraine and suspended its activities since 2014.

And President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy plans to address the United States Congress on Wednesday, March 16. The Wall Street Journal reported this.

He warned residents of Kherson and nearby settlements: don't believe the information spread in Viber chats. ""To date, the opening of no humanitarian corridor in the Kherson region has been agreed.

13:30 – in the next hour, the occupiers, who captured the Zaporizhzhia NPP, plan to begin ""disposal"" of ammunition right on the site of the station near the ruins of the ZNPP training center, Energoatom reports. In other words, crazy Russians are going to blow up ammunition right in front of Unit 1 of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant!

""6,366 sanctions have been imposed against Russia. It has become a toxic country. The ruble has flown into the abyss. They are trying to stabilize it with tricks, but it will not work,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in his address.

Kuleba called on large Western companies that have not yet left Russia to do so

He listed the companies that continue to work in Russia:

– retail chains Leroy Merlin, Metro, Auchan, Spar;

– Pirelli and Bridgestone Tires automotive products;

– Accor and Intercontinental hotels

– Engineering companies: OTIS Worldwide, Honeywell, Mohawk Industries, Arconic;

– cosmetic companies: Oriflame, Kimberly-Clark, Koti, Ecco, Salvatore Ferragamo;

– company engaged in tobacco products: Philip Morris;

– Papa John's and Kellogg food industry and restaurants;

– Bayer Medical Company.

It also turned out that Coca-Cola did not leave the Russian market, despite loud statements.

The State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting of Ukraine has suspended the permits for the import of publishing products from Russia. That is, it will now be impossible to import books from Russia legally into Ukraine. Isolation from the world and Ukraine continues.

And EU countries are going to impose new sanctions against Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft, Transneft, and Gazprom Neft, according to Reuters. According to EU media sources, the ban will apply to ""all investments, technology transfers, financial services, etc. related to exploration and production,"" but countries will continue to buy oil from companies. Strange ""sanctions,"" but, well.

Otis, one of the largest manufacturers of lifting equipment, will not accept new orders for elevators and escalators in Russia and will suspend new investments in the country.

What's in Russia?

Last night, there was a report that Russia had turned to China for military assistance, the Financial Times was the first to write, ""the Mordor is running out of resources.""

This attempt to ""feed"" the drowning army at the expense of the eastern neighbor caused great unrest among Ukrainians. But the Chinese embassy was quick to say that no requests for help had been received from Russia, according to Reuters.

Interestingly, even a quick reaction did not save China from trouble. Amid the aggressor's appeal to China for military aid, today on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the index of Chinese companies fell by 11% and they lost $2.1 trillion in one day. This is the level of toxicity!

Russia will not ask the United States and Europe to lift sanctions, Western pressure will not change Moscow's course. This was reported in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. Excellent decision! The USSR also said so and where is it now?

The main Russian propagandist Solovyov is planned to be declared internationally wanted. He was informed about the suspicion of public calls to change the state border of Ukraine, which led to the death of people.

Another problem in Russia is that women's hygiene products have disappeared en masse from store shelves. After all, as it turned out, there are almost no sanitary pads in Russia. Even such a trifle came to the Mordor from abroad.

""The Russian armed forces don't rule out the staging of large settlements in Ukraine under full control to ensure maximum security of the population,"" said Putin's spokesperson Peskov. We listen to his delusion, but we are not afraid. In fact, the Armed Forces reject the enemy's columns, not allowing them to move inland.

У комітеті держдуми з оборони хочуть заборонити зворотний в'їзд зіркам, бізнесменам, журналістам, які виїхали з росії. Вони, звісно, поки що і самі не хочуть повертатися, але ситуація стане цікавішою, коли країни, в яких зараз окопалася бігла ""російська еліта"" приймуть рішення о примусовій депортації всіх росіян.

The State Duma Committee on Defense wants to ban the entry of stars, entrepreneurs, and journalists who have left Russia. Of course, they do not want to return yet, but the situation will become more interesting when the countries where the fleeing ""Russian elite"" is now entrenched decide to forcibly deport all Russians.

Russia may block YouTube in the near future if video hosting does not comply with the requirements of Roskomnadzor to unblock the channels of Russian propagandists.

And this is a message for those Russians who tried to circumvent the ban on Instagram and Facebook via VPN. The motherland will catch you here too, son!

There is a military camp in Belgorod, Russia, which holds servicemen who have refused to fight against Ukraine. This was announced by the officer of the Center for Operational Information of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Leonid Matiukhin.

What can we hear about Belarusians?

Russia wants to dress Belarusians in Russian uniform. This was announced by Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Danilov. According to him, today a special operation of the Russian Federation is being developed on the territory of Belarus. ""Today they really want to put Russian uniforms on the Belarusian military. Some of them refuse to fight against our country. But now the Russian FSB and the special services on the territory are persuading Belarusians to change into Russian uniforms and enter our territory according to Russian standards."" Ukrainian troops are ready for such a development.

But now large parts of the seven-story shopping center have gone quiet after Western brands from Apple to Victoria's Secret closed their Russian operations in the two weeks since the country invaded Ukraine.

Hundreds of companies have similarly announced plans to curtail ties to Russia, with the pace accelerating over the past week as the deadly violence and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine worsens, and as Western governments ratchet up economic sanctions.

Russian President Vladimir Putin responded Thursday by saying that if foreign companies shut down production in Russia, he favored a plan to “bring in outside management and then transfer these companies to those who want to work.”

A draft law could allow Russian courts to appoint external administrators for companies that cease operations and are at least 25% foreign-owned. If the owners refuse to resume operations or to sell, the company's shares could be auctioned off, the ruling United Russia party has said, calling it “the first step toward nationalization.”

Chris Weafer of Macro-Advisory, a consultancy specializing in Russia, said the Russian government ""is adopting a carrot-and-stick approach to foreign business,” with talk of nationalization balanced out with government help for those who stay. A key reason, Weafer said, is the Kremlin's desire to avoid mass unemployment.

“When it comes to social pressures or potential public backlash, what they understand, I guess, is that people will not take to the streets because they cannot buy a Big Mac,” Weafer said. “But they might take to the streets if they have no job and no income.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki criticized “any lawless decision by Russia to seize the assets of these companies,” saying that it “will ultimately result in even more economic pain for Russia.""

“It will compound the clear message to the global business community that Russia is not a safe place to invest and do business,” she said in a tweet, adding that ”Russia may also invite legal claims from companies whose property is seized.""",https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-news-live-updates-war-day-17-zelensky-putin-us-biden-sanctions-students-trapped-operation-ganga-12th-march-2022-2022-03-12-763931
