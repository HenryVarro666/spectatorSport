The office said in a statement on Facebook that Maxim Levin had been covering the Russian invasion, citing investigation data. Officials found his body in the Guta Mezhyhirska village. He had reportedly been struck by two gunshots from Russian forces.

An investigation into the journalist‚Äôs death is ongoing, the office said, noting that he had worked with news outlets such as The Associated Press, BBC, Reuters and TRT World.

Journalists commemorated the fallen reporter on social media following the news.

‚ÄúAwful. Reports our colleague, photojournalist Max Levin was killed by Russian forces while on assignment north of Kyiv. I worked with Max in Eastern Ukraine over 2014-15. He was talented and fearless. I don‚Äôt want to say RIP because I can‚Äôt believe it,‚Äù Oliver Carroll, a correspondent for The Economist, tweeted.

‚ÄúMax Levin was a wonderful photojournalist. But was also thoughtful and a talented writer. He talked about peace more than war. He wrote a lot as a correspondent for @lb_ua over the years,‚Äù Christopher Miller, a correspondent at BuzzFeed News, tweeted.

The development comes more than five weeks into Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, amid which other journalists have been killed or injured, including from Fox News, which saw one of its consultants and a cameraman die, while another correspondent was injured.

Zelenskyy criticizes West for holding back on weapons deliveries

In a video message late on Saturday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country needs more modern weapons to continue fighting Russia's invasion ‚Äî and that Western allies have been holding back in their support.

""Unfortunately, Ukraine has not yet received enough modern Western anti-missile systems. Has not received aircraft. Hasn't received what the partners could provide. Could ‚Äî and still can!"" he said in an official English transcript of the video.

""Every Russian missile that hit our cities and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended. [The] decision whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons,"" Zelenskyy added.

In the video, the Ukrainian leader also praised troops in the embattled port city of Mariupol, saying their defense has helped ""hold back a significant part of the enemy forces"" and bought Ukraine ""invaluable time.""

Zelenskyy said more 'modern weapons' were needed to combat Russian forces

Scholz warns of global impact of war in Ukraine

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has called for the Russian war in Ukraine to come to an end ""quickly.""

Speaking in the western German city of Essen, Scholz said Russian President Vladimir Putin is pursuing ""territorial claims that stem from the imperialist visions of earlier centuries"" which he said were now ""destroying the future of Russia.""

""He [Putin] did not expect Ukraine to defend itself. He believed that there would be people standing there waving flags and applauding. That is not the case. Everyone is defending themselves,"" the chancellor said.

Scholz blames Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine

""All the difficulties that the world economy is facing today, which were already great enough because of the coronavirus pandemic and its economic and social effects, are now becoming even greater because of this war.

Russian troop mobilization reports in Transnistria 'untrue'

Sanctions could imperil ISS, says Russian space chief

The future of the International Space Station (ISS) is at risk after Western space agencies missed a deadline by Moscow to lift sanctions, the head of Russia's space program has said.

Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, implied on Russian state TV that the sanctions, some of which predate Russia's invasion of Ukraine, could disrupt the operation of Russian spacecraft servicing the ISS with cargo flights.

Rogozin stressed that the Western partners need the space station and that ""no one but us can deliver fuel to the station."" Only the engines of Russian cargo craft are able to correct the ISS's orbit, keeping it safe from space debris, he added.

Space is one of the last remaining areas of cooperation between Moscow and Western nations.

A NASA astronaut caught a Russian ride back to Earth on Wednesday after a US record 355 days at the ISS, returning with two cosmonauts.

Rogozin later wrote on his Telegram channel that Western counterparts had vowed to promote ""further cooperation on the ISS and its operations.""

Pope Francis also took direct aim at Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Ukrainian orphans will overwhelm state social services: Bavarian minister

The family minister in the southern German state of Bavaria has criticized the federal government for its policy on Ukrainian orphans arriving from the war zone, saying state youth welfare services would not be able to cope.

Ulrike Scharf told the DPA news agency that Berlin's categorization of groups of orphans arriving in Germany as unaccompanied minors meant that such services would not manage to take proper care of all the children, some of whom were disabled.

She said Federal Family Affairs Minister Anne Spiegel had overruled the states' unanimous objections to this system.

The groups of orphans arriving together with their carers would have to be separated, which would not be in the best interests of the children, she argued.

Red Cross to make a fresh attempt at Mariupol evacuation

A Red Cross team will make a fresh attempt on Saturday to help evacuate thousands of civilians from the port city of Mariupol after its earlier try failed due to ""conditions that made it impossible.""

The international aid organization appealed for all sides to provide security guarantees so that the evacuation mission can proceed.

""For the operation to succeed, it is critical that the parties respect the agreements and provide the necessary conditions and security guarantees,"" the Red Cross urged.

Russian and Ukrainian officials had previously agreed to a humanitarian corridor, but it was unclear whether the message had been received by troops on the ground.
