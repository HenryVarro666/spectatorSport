However, the governor said he did not know the reason behind the withdrawal, even as Russia had earlier said it planned to scale back its military activity around Chernihiv.

“Thanks to our armed forces, the enemy is leaving the Chernihiv region. But only they know why they are doing it,” Chaus said.

He said he hoped that the Russian troops were leaving the region forever and would not return after regrouping.

Chaus said all the communities in the region were working to restore their livelihoods after days of Russian bombardment of the besieged city.

“Our armed forces are dedicated to the removal of mines from the settlements where the enemy was found,” said the governor.

However, he warned that air and missile attacks could still take place as Russia did not announce to stop such operations.

Chaus urged the people to go to shelters in case of an alert.

“It is too early for us to relax. We still have a lot of work to do and we still have a war, the enemy is in our land in Chernihiv, in the Ukraine.”

On Thursday, the British defense ministry said “significant Russian shelling and missile strikes have continued” in Chernihiv despite Moscow announcing to reduce its military activity around the city.

Russian negotiators pledged to reduce attacks on both Chernihiv and the capital Kyiv during peace talks in Istanbul. EFE

April 1 (Reuters) - Russia is pulling back some of its forces in the northern Ukrainian regions of Kyiv and Chernihiv, the two regions' governors said on Friday.

Russia said during negotiations on Tuesday that it would scale down operations in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. Fighting has continued in both regions and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said Russian forces are not withdrawing but regrouping.

""We are observing the movement of joint (Russian) vehicle columns of various quantities,"" the Kyiv region's governor, Oleksandr Pavlyuk, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

Pavlyuk said some of the troops were heading towards the border with Belarus, a Russian ally.

He said Russian forces had left the village of Hostomel, which is next to an important airport, but were digging in at the town of Bucha. Reuters was unable to verify the information.

Chernihiv Governor Viacheslav Chaus said some Russian troops had pulled back but some remained in his region.

""Air and missile strikes are (still) possible in the region, nobody is ruling this out,"" he said in a video address.

Ukraine pushed back Russian forces around Kyiv on Friday, retaking control of some areas near the capital amid fierce battles, Ukrainian officials said.

Russia said during negotiations on Tuesday that it would scale down operations in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions, both of which are in northern Ukraine, but officials in both regions say fighting has continued in some areas.

“Our troops are chasing them both to the northwest and northeast [of Kyiv], pushing the enemy away from Kyiv,” said Oleksiy Arestovych, a political adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Friday.

He said Russia was also carrying out a partial troop rotation and sending some of its forces to fight in eastern Ukraine.

Kyiv regional governor Oleksandr Pavlyuk said Russian forces had withdrawn from Hostomel, a northwestern suburb that had seen intense fighting.

Later, local officials said the northern Kyiv region towns of Bucha and Ivankiv had been retaken by Ukrainian forces and Ukraine’s armed forces said the nearby town of Borodyanka had also been liberated, sharing a photo of Ukrainian troops they said was taken in the town.

“March 31 will go down in the history of our town … as the day of its liberation from Russian [forces],” Bucha Mayor Anatolii Fedoruk said in a video that appeared to be filmed outside the town hall.

Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Kyiv, said that there was a “muted celebratory mood” among Ukrainian forces.

“First of all, there is [the reported capture of] Hostomol airport … it has been under Russian occupation for a number of days. That was an absolutely crucial strategic point for the Russians – if they’d managed to hang on to it. It would have been a staging ground along with the other towns for any invasion into Kyiv itself,” he said. ”

[Hostomel] has now been completely liberated say the Ukrainian forces.”

‘Huge’ battles

Meanwhile, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said Russian forces are not withdrawing but regrouping.

The mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko urged residents not to head back to Kyiv yet because “huge” battles were being fought to the north and east of the capital. He did not indicate that these were new battles.

“The risk of dying is pretty high, and that’s why my advice to anyone who wants to come back is: Please, take a little bit more time,” he said.

The governor of Chernihiv region, where Russian has also pledged to pull back, said some Russian troops had withdrawn but some remained in his region.

“Air and missile strikes are [still] possible in the region, nobody is ruling this out,” Governor Viacheslav Chaus said in a video address.

Fighting in Mariupol

Ukrainian officials also said the southern port city of Mariupol was still holding out after weeks of bombardment by Russian forces and that fighting continued in eastern Ukraine.

The International Committee of the Red Cross says a team intending to help people leave the besieged city of Mariupol was unable to reach the port city on Friday.

The Red Cross said in a statement that the team hopes to try again Saturday.

“Arrangements and conditions made it impossible” for the convoy of three vehicles to get safely to Mariupol and they returned to Zaporizhzhia, it said.

“For the operation to succeed, it is critical that the parties respect the agreements and provide the necessary conditions and security guarantees,” the organisation said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/1/ukraine-says-russian-forces-pushed-back-around-kyiv

Those developments came as another round of peace talks failed to produce a breakthrough and the threat of Russian aggression forced aid workers to call off a plan to evacuate desperate civilians from the shattered southern city of Mariupol.

For the record: An earlier version of this article said Ukraine’s armed forces took responsibility for a strike on an oil depot inside Russia. They haven’t.

Ukraine’s rapid recovery of parts of its northern territory has sparked cautious optimism, although officials have warned citizens and soldiers to remain on guard.

The Ukrainian military said Friday that its troops had retaken control of about 30 settlements in the north near Chernihiv and the capital, Kyiv. In a video message, Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of the Chernihiv region, said Russian forces had begun to vacate the area, in some cases leaving behind mines that local authorities were trying to remove.

Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, said that while Russian troops had retreated from some areas around the capital, fighting has continued in many parts. He told Sky News on Friday he could hear the sounds of explosions “nonstop during the day and night.”

The Russian military said this week that it would “drastically” reduce its operations in the north in order to boost peace talks and concentrate on its campaign in the east, where pro-Moscow separatists have declared independence from Ukraine. But both Western and Ukrainian officials have cast doubt on that statement, suggesting that in reality the Kremlin wants to resupply and reposition its forces in the northern areas.

In a potentially significant development, the Ukrainian military was accused of taking the fight briefly into Russian territory.

The governor of the Russian city of Belgorod, about 20 miles north of the border with Ukraine, said that a pair of Ukrainian helicopter gunships had fired missiles at an oil depot, sparking a large blaze Friday morning, and that shells had been launched from a nearby Ukrainian village. Military officials in Ukraine — whose own energy facilities have been the frequent target of Russian strikes — have not claimed responsibility for the strike..

If Ukraine did carry out the attack, it would call into question Moscow’s boast to have fully disabled Kyiv’s aerial capabilities. Ukrainian forces have had some success with drones, but President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly — without success — appealed to the U.S. and allied countries to supply his country with fighter jets.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the purported airstrike did not create “comfortable conditions” for the continuation of Russia-Ukraine talks, the latest round taking place virtually Friday.

Five previous negotiation sessions, including one in person in Istanbul this week, proved inconclusive, with mixed messages emerging on whether they achieved any progress. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, on a trip to India, said the talks showed some promise and should continue, but Western officials have warned that the negotiations could be merely for show — a delaying tactic by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Global divisions over the war in Ukraine continued to flare as leaders from China and the European Union met for a virtual summit, where China blamed the conflict in part on U.S. efforts to expand the NATO military alliance closer to Russia’s borders. China also renewed its criticism of sweeping Western sanctions against Russia.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said after the talks that she expected China to not interfere with Western sanctions, and expressed hope that China would use its influence to help convince Russia to end its invasion.

Diplomatic peace-building efforts have produced little relief for the hardest-hit parts of Ukraine, including Mariupol, where weeks of relentless Russian bombardment have laid waste to large sections of the city and left residents with little access to food, water, power and medicine. Several agreements between Kyiv and Moscow to establish safe corridors for the evacuation of residents and delivery of aid have fallen apart.

“We are running out of adjectives to describe the horrors that residents in Mariupol have suffered,” Ewan Watson, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said in Geneva. “The situation is horrendous and deteriorating, and it’s now a humanitarian imperative that people be allowed to leave and aid supplies be allowed in.”

Russia and Ukraine had agreed the day before to a temporary truce in the area to allow the Ukrainian chapter of the Red Cross to conduct evacuations, but Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of reneging on the deal and blocking dozens of buses from ferrying residents to safety, as well as seizing 14 tons of food and medical supplies being sent in.

Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to Mariupol’s mayor, said trying to leave remained “very dangerous.”

“We do not see a real desire on the part of the Russians and their satellites to provide an opportunity for Mariupol residents to evacuate to territory controlled by Ukraine,” Andryushchenko wrote on Telegram, adding that Russian forces were “categorically not allowing any humanitarian cargo, even in small amounts, into the city.”

Although the strategic port city remains nominally under Ukrainian control, Russian troops have been reported throughout Mariupol. Destruction has been widespread, with Russian attacks causing at least $10 billion in damage to infrastructure, according to officials. Seizure of the city would be key to blocking Ukraine’s access to the Sea of Azov and establishing a staging post for a westward push along the coast to the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, and Odesa on the Black Sea.

Mykolaiv, a shipbuilding hub about 80 miles east of Odesa, has already come under increasing fire. Ukrainian media said Friday that the death toll from a Russian strike that hit an administrative building there earlier in the week had risen to 28. The number could not be independently verified.

Ukrainian authorities also said Russian troops had mostly withdrawn from Chernobyl, outside of Kyiv, the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986. Russia had wrested control of the area early in the war but has now apparently returned the decommissioned nuclear plant to Ukrainian management. Although the ruined facility no longer generates power, workers still conduct safety procedures to prevent radiation leaks.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, whose chief intends to visit Chernobyl “as soon as possible,” has requested more information from Ukrainian authorities who say that some Russian troops were exposed to significant amounts of radiation at the site.

Zelensky, Ukraine’s leader, cautioned against any complacency over news that invading troops were being pulled back from some areas.

“We know their intentions,” he said late Thursday in his nightly video address to the nation. “We know that they are moving away from those areas where we hit them in order to focus on other, very important ones where it may be difficult for us. … There will be battles ahead.”

Although Western officials and observers have spoken of disarray, disorganization and disillusionment within Russian military ranks, Zelensky made a rare disclosure of dissension or problems within Ukraine’s forces. He said two generals had been stripped of their rank for violating “their military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people.”

One of them was in charge of internal security at Ukraine’s principal intelligence agency and the other headed intelligence around the southern city of Kherson, the first officially to fall to Russian forces.

“Something prevented them from determining where their homeland was,” Zelensky said, without elaborating.

Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out an air strike against a fuel depot in the Russian city of Belgorod on Friday, an incident the Kremlin said could affect peace talks, but a top Kyiv security official denied responsibility.

Russia's defence ministry said two Ukrainian helicopters struck the facility in Belgorod, some 35 km (22 miles) from the border with Ukraine, after entering Russia at extremely low altitude at around 5 a.m. Moscow time (0200 GMT).

The Red Cross said it was ""not yet clear"" that the evacuation of civilians from the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol would go ahead as planned on Friday.

""We remain hopeful, we are in action moving towards Mariupol ... but it's not yet clear that this will happen today,"" Ewan Watson, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told reporters in Geneva, as an ICRC team of three cars and nine staff headed towards the city.

09:05am: Ukraine air strike on petrol depot in Russia's Belgorod, says local official

“There was a fire at the petrol depot because of an air strike carried out by two Ukrainian army helicopters, who entered Russian territory at a low altitude,” Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on his Telegram channel.

Two employees at the storage facilities were injured as a result of the fire, he said in another post. Some 170 personnel were trying to put out the blaze, according to Russia's emergencies ministry. Rosneft, which owns the facility, told Russian news agencies that it had evacuated staff from the premises.

On Wednesday, explosions could be heard from an arms depot in Belgorod but the authorities did not provide any explanation for the blasts.

Belgorod lies some 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Russia's border with Ukraine and some 80 kilometres from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, which has been pummelled by Russian forces since Moscow launched its war on February 24.

08:54am: French actor criticises Putin’s 'crazy, unacceptable excesses' in Ukraine

French actor Gérard Depardieu, who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past, has criticised his “crazy, unacceptable excesses” in Ukraine.

Depardieu, who took up Russian nationality in 2013, told Agence France Presse on Thursday: “the Russian people are not responsible for the crazy, unacceptable excesses of their leaders like Vladimir Putin.”

Depardieu also said he would give all the proceeds from three nights of concerts in Paris from April 1 to “Ukrainian victims of this tragic fratricidal war"".

08:14am: Russia preparing for 'powerful strikes', says Zelensky

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Russia is consolidating and preparing “powerful strikes” in the country’s east and south, including besieged Mariupol, where a new attempt will be made Friday to evacuate civilians from the devastated city.

Russia meanwhile threatened to turn off its gas taps to Europe if payments are not made in rubles, as US President Joe Biden ordered a record release of strategic oil reserves to ease soaring US prices.

Over a month into Russia's invasion of its neighbour, Vladimir Putin's troops have devastated cities like Mariupol with shelling, killing at least 5,000 people in the port city alone.

In peace talks this week, Russia said it would scale back attacks on the capital Kyiv and the city of Chernigiv, but Ukrainian and Western officials have dismissed the pledge, saying Moscow's troops were merely regrouping.

“This is part of their tactics,” said Zelensky in a late-night address.

07:15am: EU to push China at virtual summit to not support Russia

Chinese President Xi Jinping will hold the videoconference with EU leaders Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, carrying through on an annual exercise that was skipped last year as tensions simmered.

""The meeting will focus on the role we are urging China to play, to be on the side of the principles of international law without ambiguity and exert all the necessary influence and pressure on Russia,"" said French European affairs minister Clement Beaune, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency.

“This was not the initial purpose of the summit but it necessarily became one,” Beaune said, though he insisted other topics such as climate and trade “would not disappear”.

The EU-China summit is usually an effort to deepen trade ties. But, last year's exchange of tit-for-tat sanctions over the plight of China's Uyghur minority, followed by Beijing's trade coercion of EU-member Lithuania over Taiwan, soured preparations for the meeting.

8,15e84532-3990-465b-a9e9-e9db17bbafbe,"['Nebi Qena', 'Associated Press', 'Yuras Karmanau']",2022-04-01 15:34:19-04:00,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Talks to stop the fighting in Ukraine resumed Friday, as another desperate attempt to rescue civilians from the shattered and encircled city of Mariupol failed and Russia accused the Ukrainians of launching a helicopter attack on a fuel depot on Russian soil.

The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said a fiery cross-border raid by two helicopter gunships left two people wounded, though state oil company Rosneft denied anyone was hurt.

“Certainly, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, five weeks after Moscow began sending upwards of 150,000 of its own troops across Ukraine’s border.

The Russian claim could not immediately be verified, and Ukraine denied responsibility.

“For some reason they say that we did it, but in fact this does not correspond with reality,” Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, said on Ukrainian television.

Russia has reported cross-border shelling from Ukraine before, including an incident last week that killed a military chaplain, but not an incursion of its airspace. The Rosneft depot is about 35 kilometers (21 miles) from the Ukraine border.

WATCH: Russia shifts focus to Ukraine’s south amid stiff resistance

Meanwhile, Russia continued withdrawing some of its troops from areas around Kyiv, three days after Moscow said it would reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital and the northern city of Chernihiv to promote trust at the bargaining table.

While Russian forces kept up their bombardment of those two zones, Ukrainian troops exploited the pullback on the ground by mounting counterattacks and retaking a number of towns and villages.

Still, Ukraine and its allies warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating but resupplying its troops and shifting them to the country’s east for an intensified assault on the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region, which includes Mariupol.

The latest negotiations, which took place by video, followed a meeting Tuesday in Turkey, where Ukraine reiterated its willingness to abandon a bid to join NATO and declare itself neutral — Moscow’s chief demand. In return, Ukraine proposed that its security be guaranteed by several other countries.

The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, said on social media that Moscow’s positions on retaining control of the Crimean Peninsula — seized from Ukraine in 2014 — and expanding the territory in eastern Ukraine held by Russia-backed separatists “are unchanged.”

The invasion has left thousands dead and driven more than 4 million refugees from Ukraine.

On the outskirts of Kyiv, where Russian troops have withdrawn, damaged cars lined the streets of Irpin, a suburban area popular with young families, now in ruins. Emergency workers carried elderly people on stretchers over a wrecked bridge to safety.

Three wooden crosses next to a residential building that was damaged in a shelling marked the graves of a mother and son and an unknown man. A resident who gave her name only as Lila said she helped hurriedly bury them on March 5, just before Russian troops moved in.

“They were hit with artillery and they were burned alive,” she said.

An Irpin resident who gave his name only as Andriy said the Russians packed up their equipment and left on Tuesday. The next day, they shelled the town for close to an hour before Ukrainian soldiers retook it.

“I don’t think this is over,” Andriy said. “They will be back.”

To the south, the International Committee for the Red Cross said it was unable to carry out an operation to bring civilians out of Mariupol by bus. It said a team had been on its way but had to turn back.

City authorities said the Russians were blocking access to Mariupol.

“We do not see a real desire on the part of the Russians and their satellites to provide an opportunity for Mariupol residents to evacuate to territory controlled by Ukraine,” Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

He said Russian forces “are categorically not allowing any humanitarian cargo, even in small amounts, into the city.”

The strategic port city on the Sea of Azov has seen some of the worst suffering of the war, with weeks of heavy fighting and shortages of water, food, fuel and medicine. Around 100,000 people are believed left in the city, down from a prewar 430,000.

“We are running out of adjectives to describe the horrors that residents in Mariupol have suffered,” Red Cross spokesperson Ewan Watson said.

On Thursday, Russian forces blocked a 45-bus convoy attempting to evacuate people from Mariupol, and only around 600 people were able to leave in private cars, the Ukrainian government said. Russian forces also seized 14 tons of food and medical supplies bound for Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

In other developments Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy’s office said 86 Ukrainian service members were freed in the Zaporizhzhia region as part of a prisoner swap with Russia. The number of Russians released was not disclosed.

Over the past week, the Kremlin, in a seeming shift in its war aims, said its “main goal” is gaining complete control of the Donbas.

The Donbas is the industrial region of eastern Ukraine where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014. The separatists have declared two areas independent republics.

Mariupol’s capture, in particular, would be a major prize for the Russians, giving them an unbroken land bridge to Crimea.

Amid the Russian pullback on the ground and its continued bombardment, Ukraine’s military said it had retaken 29 settlements in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions.

Russian forces in the northeast also continued to shell Kharkiv, and in the southeast sought to seize the cities of Popasna and Rubizhne as well as Mariupol, the Ukrainian military said.
