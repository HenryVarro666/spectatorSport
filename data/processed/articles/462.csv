The situation can get worse, and it will. It can be stopped and must be stopped. Putin will not use his mass destruction weapons, of that I am positive

After Monday’s visit to the city of Bucha near Kiev, Zelenskiy told members gathered in New York that “there is not a single war crime that has not been committed there.” “The Russian military conscientiously searched for and killed everyone who served our state. Women were executed at the doors of their homes, entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn their corpses, ”said the Ukrainian president.

“We remember the memory of civilians who were injured in the neck or in the eye after being tortured. That they were thrown into a well to die there in torment. (…) They were crushed by tanks on civilian vehicles in the middle of the road. To have fun,” he said. “Those who had their limbs cut off had their throats cut. Those who were raped and killed in front of their own children. Who had their tongues torn out just because they didn’t hear from them what they wanted to hear. How is this different from what the ISIS terrorists did? But we’re talking about a member of the Security Council.”

What happened in Bucha, he points out, is “just one of many examples” of what Russia has been doing in the country over the past 41 days. “The world is now seeing what the Russian army has done in Bucha, but has not yet seen what they have done in other cities. The geography may be different, but the cruelty is the same. Same crimes.

“Where is the security that the Security Council should guarantee? No. So where is the peace for which the United Nations was created? It is obvious that the key global institution, which should guarantee the enforcement of any aggressor to peace, simply cannot function effectively,” he said.

“The most heinous war crimes of all time since the end of World War II are being committed,” he said. “Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities with artillery and air strikes. They deliberately blockade the cities, creating mass starvation in them. They deliberately fire at the columns of civilians on the roads who are trying to escape from the combat zone.”

Russian leaders, Zelenskiy said, “feel like they were colonizers, just like in ancient times. (..) Russia wants to turn Ukrainians into silent slaves. The Russian military openly plunder the cities and towns they have captured. This is robbery to the highest degree. They steal everything from food to gold earrings, which they rip off with blood.”

The Ukrainian leader demanded that Russia be held accountable and brought before an international tribunal. “The Russian army and those who give orders must face a Nuremberg-like trial.”

Zelensky pointed to the impossibility for the UN to take any action against Russia, given its permanent seat on the Security Council and therefore its veto power and what he believes “allows them to go unpunished and allows them to destroy everything they can.” “Do you think that international law no longer makes sense? If your answer is no, then act immediately.”

The President of Ukraine called for a fair representation of all regions of the world and a transformation of the United Nations system “so that the right of veto does not become an imposition of the right to die.” “All participants must be equal before international law.”

“We need Security Council decisions. For peace in Ukraine,” Zelensky asked. “If they don’t know how to make that decision, they can do two things. Not to allow Russia, as an aggressor and source of war, to block decisions on its own aggression, its own war. And then do whatever the world can fix. Or show how you can actually reformat and work for the good of the world. Or, if your current format is unchanged and there is simply no way out, then the only way out is a complete dissolution.

Zelensky’s speech to the Security Council was made public by the United Kingdom’s (current Council President) representation at the UN in a tweet in which he said the meeting would serve to “ensure that the truth about Russian war crimes is heard.” The United States, for its part, has said it will seek Russia’s removal from the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC).

Zelenskiy, who has advocated continued peace talks, has said in recent days that Russian forces are likely to try to “cover up their crimes” and announced an investigation, saying he only had information on more than 300 people killed and tortured. in Bucha. Ukrainian authorities report that the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv and seized by Ukrainian forces.

International journalists visited the city of Bucha in recent days and counted dozens of lifeless bodies, dressed in civilian clothes and apparently unarmed, scattered through the streets, many of which were shot at point-blank range, and some with their hands tied, as well as bodies heaped into a mass grave . They also spoke to survivors and collected testimonies about the horrors experienced under Russian occupation.

The tough photos of Bucha are marked by discussions at the UN, where Russia unsuccessfully tried to call an emergency meeting of the Security Council on Monday to discuss what it called “the horrific provocations of Ukrainian radicals in Bucha”, which was opposed by Russian representative Vasyl Nebenzya. at the beginning of the meeting in New York on Tuesday. “I want to make it clear that we are not refusing to hold a meeting,” the British representative replied.

Without providing evidence to support their claims, the Russian authorities deny responsibility, assuring that “not a single local resident was harmed by violent actions” and claiming that the information is false and rigged to discredit Moscow, or that the death occurred after the attack on the withdrawal of Russian troops. The representative of Russia repeated these statements in the Security Council.

However, satellite imagery shows that many bodies lay in the open for several weeks while Russian troops were in Bucha, according to analysis by international media outlets such as the New York Times. The Kremlin also spread hoaxes that were exposed by international inspectors.

Following Bucha’s images, several European countries such as Spain announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats, and the European Commission submitted a proposal to 27 member states that includes energy sanctions against Russia for the first time.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the war resulted in “senseless” loss of life, massive destruction in urban centers and destruction of civilian infrastructure. “I will never forget the horrific pictures of civilians killed in Bucha,” said Guterres, who said he was “equally appalled by the personal testimony of rape and sexual violence” now emerging from the conflict.

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has documented the deaths of 1,480 civilians in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24.
