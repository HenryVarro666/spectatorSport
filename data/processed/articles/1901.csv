Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY A THIRD PARTY.

LVIV, Ukraine, March 31 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday said the situation in the south and the Donbas region remained extremely difficult and reiterated that Russia was building up forces near the besieged city of Mariupol.

And in a rare sign of internal dissent, Zelenskiy also said in a video address that he had sacked two senior members of the national security service on the grounds they were traitors.

Zelenskiy, who often uses colourful imagery, said the Russians were so evil and so keen on destruction that they seemed to be from another world, ""monsters who burn and plunder, who attack and are bent on murder"".

Russia says it is carrying out a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Moscow also denies Kyiv's accusations that Russian forces are targeting civilians.

Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces had pushed back the Russians from Kyiv and Chernihiv - two cities Moscow had announced would no longer be the focus of attacks as they seek to secure the separatist Donbas and Luhansk regions in the south-east.

""There will be battles ahead. We still need to go down a very difficult path to get everything we want,"" he said.

""The situation in the south and in the Donbas remains extremely difficult.""

Zelenskiy also said he had fired two top officials at the national security service - the overall head of internal security as well as the head of the agency's branch in the Kherson region.

""I do not have time to deal with all the traitors, but they will gradually all be punished,"" he said, adding that the two men had betrayed their oath to defend Ukraine. He did not give specific details.

The occasion marked the first time Zelenskiy has announced high-profile sackings of those involved in Ukraine's defence.

From The New York Times, I’m Sabrina Tavernise. This is The Daily.

[music]

Today, as Russia tries to reset its war in Ukraine, one city has become central to Moscow’s strategy. My colleague, Valerie Hopkins, on what’s happening inside Mariupol and what the fight there tells us about the wider war. It’s Friday, April 1st. Valerie, this is a pretty dizzying week of news out of Ukraine. Catch me up on what happened.

valerie hopkins

So over the past week, we saw a series of moves by the Russians that sent pretty mixed signals. First, about a week ago, the defense ministry in Moscow announced that they were shifting their strategy. They said that the first phase of the war was over, that they were going to be reducing their combat in the west while consolidating their military gains in the east. But at the same time that they said that, they started sending missiles to the west, and they continued their assault on Kyiv. So it was pretty unclear if they would stick to their word. And then, in the middle of the week, we saw another round of talks between the Russians and the Ukrainians, where it kind of looked, for a minute, like some kind of deal could happen. But then the Russians actually came out and said they were a very long way from the agreement, and they would just continue their campaign.

sabrina tavernise

OK, so it sounds like things on the ground are in flux, at least when it comes to territory. But the bombings and the fighting are continuing. So what’s the upshot here? Are the Russians losing?

valerie hopkins

Well, I mean, the Russians have been losing territory around Kyiv. They say that they’re sort of preparing to withdraw from that area, but NATO officials have pretty much concluded that they’re actually regrouping rather than retreating. There’s just so much skepticism from Western officials. The bottom line is they say they’re watching what Russia does rather than what it says.

sabrina tavernise

So Valerie, you’ve been in Ukraine now since the war began. You’ve been covering it every day. I’m wondering what you’re focusing on now.

valerie hopkins

Well, one of the places I can’t take my eyes off is Mariupol, where Russia’s claims definitely don’t match with reality. Russia has waged a brutal siege campaign around this port city for more than a month. They’re portraying their efforts as key to their war of liberation, of helping Ukrainians who they think want to be part of Russia become part of Russia. But in reality, it’s a brutal campaign against a city that’s critical to Russia’s strategy for taking and growing its territorial gains.

sabrina tavernise

Explain that. Why is Mariupol so critical?

valerie hopkins

So Mariupol is a big port city that was, before the war, home to about half a million people. It’s really close to the Russian border. And it’s also very close to Russian-occupied territory in Eastern Ukraine. Right now, it’s the last sliver of Ukrainian territory along the strategic body of water, the Sea of Azov. So controlling Mariupol would not only mean controlling its port but it would also create what we call a land bridge from the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014, to these territories in the east that Russia also controls. So it would be a crucial resupply route and just this kind of strategic symbol of victory for Russia.

sabrina tavernise

Got it. So taking Mariupol would mean that they really gained this important stronghold. It’s like the last puzzle piece in this whole part of Ukraine South.

valerie hopkins

Exactly, Sabrina.

sabrina tavernise

So what’s actually happening in Mariupol?

valerie hopkins

Well, we know it’s being heavily bombed. But beyond that, it’s really hard to tell. The siege of the city started very early in March. Over the last four weeks, the power and the water got shut off. The communications went down at the very beginning of March. And around that same time, the Russians effectively encircled the city. Around mid-March, some people were able to get out as part of a humanitarian corridor. But since then, the situation has grown more dire by the day and by the week. People are running out of food and water. People have been sheltering in basements. However, it’s very difficult to be able to get accurate, up-to-date information while it’s happening from there, simply because of the lack of connection to the city.

sabrina tavernise

Right. I wanted to ask, how do you report on a place you can’t talk to?

valerie hopkins

It’s pretty hard. But occasionally, people inside Mariupol are able to get a signal. There’s a few spots inside the city, and they’re able to post something on Facebook or Telegram or Instagram about the situation. And a big part of what I do is just scouring social media, watching these videos, trying to get a sense of what the situation is on the ground and how much it’s changed from day to day or week to week. And—

[phone rings]

—I’ve also spent a lot of time on the phone, talking to people who’ve somehow managed to make it out. Hello?

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

One woman whose story really stuck out to me was this woman, Kristina.

sabrina tavernise

Tell me about Kristina.

valerie hopkins

Kristina is 28. She’s married. She has two young kids who are six and eight years old. I talked to her on the phone some days after she had escaped from Mariupol.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she told me in great detail, and with tremendous pain, about what the past few weeks have been like for her there.

[music]

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She started out describing what it was like for her when the siege began in early March, when the Russians cut off the phone service and the electricity while continuing, and actually intensifying, their airstrikes. She described this moment when the airstrikes hit the building right next to her. And the war had basically arrived in her front yard.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she said she was standing near a window in her apartment, looking outside, talking with her husband. It was really quiet, she said. Then suddenly—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—a bomb hit right next to her building.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She said, suddenly, three houses were just gone. She said her neighbors ran outside and found the body of an 11-year-old girl and her grandfather.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And this airstrike also shatters the windows of Kristina’s building. So she and her family moved to the corridor of her building, where they think they’ll be safer from more shelling. And this begins a period where they’re, for the most part, too afraid to go out. Because she’s afraid that the shelling will hit them.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

So she tells me about what it was like for her and her family to be essentially living now in their hallway. They have to live without windows and without heat. And it’s actually minus 7 degrees Celsius, which is really, really cold.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And they’re also starting to run out of food. So she’s going into her pantry. She’s trying to make what little food she had last for a long time. And—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—she said there was no gas, so they had to build a fire right inside the entrance to the building and cook their meals there, over an open flame.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And for a while, they had had one meal a day. But as the bombing increased, people were sometimes scared to go to that entrance to light the fire and cook even that one meal.

kristina [SIGHS] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And fairly early on, they started rationing the water supplies. Her husband would go out and try to collect it. People in Mariupol, some of them were walking six miles every day to get a few liters of water from wells or other sources. They were collecting rainwater and melting snow. And—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—she told me about how they had this tiny teapot. And they had a family meeting and agreed that the first half of the day, between her, her husband, her two kids, and her mother-in-law, they would share this tiny teapot of water. And in the evening, they would also all drink about a teapot of the water.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she said, after the first week, those two teapots a day between five people became one. And after a while—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—some days, there was also just no water. She would say how her kids would cry because of hunger and thirst. And they were sort of fading. And as they sat in this corridor, she said she tried to distract them with books and reading fairy tales and—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—even teaching math.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

But she said that they were so hungry and tired that—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—the fire had left their eyes.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she said, every day they would sit in the corridor and pray and, essentially, prepare to say goodbye to their lives.

[music]

It went on like this for a couple of weeks. And then—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—in mid-March, her own apartment building took a direct hit. The strike killed three children and two adults.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

They were her neighbors.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she decided, right there and then, that, even though it was incredibly dangerous, to try to get out of the city in that moment, while it was under siege and under such intense shelling. It would be even more dangerous to stay. She felt they had to leave, or they would die there. But there was a problem.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

They had two cars, enough to take their whole family. But they only had enough gas for one of them.

[music]

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. Valerie, you told us that Kristina and her family were facing this impossible decision. They didn’t have enough gas for everybody to leave Mariupol. So what did they do?

valerie hopkins

Well, there was enough space in the car for her father but not for his parents. And he doesn’t want to leave them alone.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

So the older family members decide to stay in Mariupol. And Kristina and the kids and her husband go. And as Kristina and her family start driving,

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—that’s when she told me she saw the full extent of what had happened her city.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She said it was a terrible picture, that there were no roads left, utility poles lying on their sides, shells and shrapnel everywhere, and lots of dead people.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she told me how she felt guilty as a mom that she wasn’t able to cover her children’s eyes and prevent them from seeing the destruction and the corpses. And as they’re driving in this long, slow line of cars, there’s so much ordnance on the road, actually, that she talks about how lots of people have tire blow-outs. And there’s broken bridges and all these other obstacles. But the main obstacle, for them, actually, are these Russian checkpoints that are pretty common. I think she mentioned passing, like, 15 of them. And at the final checkpoint—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—she mentions these Russian soldiers who are sort of showing off.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

They’re trying to look as if they are these liberating, benefactor good guys—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—handing out candy and chocolate to her kids. And Kristina is really conflicted. On the one hand, she’s livid. These are the forces that have just bombed her city to destruction and forced her to leave her home. But on the other hand, she doesn’t want her kids to be scared. She says she has to lie to her children.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

She told them they’re actually Ukrainian soldiers, and she allows them to take the candy.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

So after 12 hours of driving, Sabrina, they reach the city of Zaporizhzhia, which is usually a three-hour drive. And she told me that she and her family arrived and went inside a center for people displaced from Mariupol and saw food and water and supplies and just burst into tears. She said—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—it would seem like such a simple thing—

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

—a cup of tea and a piece of bread.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

But they were like miracles.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

And she told me that, on the one hand, she realized that she’d arrived, and she was safe, and she had gotten out.

kristina [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

valerie hopkins

But all of her feelings about that were tempered because of the people that she’d left behind. And she’s since left Ukraine and gone to the Czech Republic. But she’s still trying to stay in touch with her father and her grandparents, who remain back in Mariupol. Shortly after she left, she got a message from her dad saying they were now living with no roof and no food and no water. And then, a few days later, he got in touch again to ask how he could leave. And then, finally, the last time she’s heard from him was a while ago. And he said that they’d run out of medicine for her grandma and that they still can’t find any gas and that Russian troops had taken control of their part of the city.

[music]

sabrina tavernise

Valerie, Kristina’s story is so wrenching. But she left two weeks ago. So I guess I’m wondering, where do things stand now in Mariupol? How much of the city do the Russians control?

valerie hopkins

Well, Sabrina, it’s really difficult to tell. Because there’s so little information coming out, and the fighting seems to still be raging. But I recently spoke to the mayor, who said he did estimate that about 50 percent of the city is under Russian control.

sabrina tavernise

And how many people are left in the city, and who are they?

valerie hopkins

I’ve heard so many different estimates, from 100,000 people left to 160,000 people left. The mayor is calling for a full evacuation of the city. And it’s going to be difficult. Because most of the people who are left are older, elderly, infirm people. And the pictures and videos that we’ve seen coming out of Mariupol in recent days, including with people who have been embedded with Russian forces, tend to confirm that. But one reason that the estimates are also tricky is that we don’t really know what’s happening to people who are in neighborhoods that are being taken by Russian forces. There are hundreds and hundreds of reports of Russian forces coming in to a neighborhood, finding the bomb shelters or the collective centers where people are sheltering, and taking them out of the city and bringing them either to Russia-held territory further east and then directly to Russia.

sabrina tavernise

Wait, taking them?

valerie hopkins

Well, it’s very unclear. The Russians, of course, are trying to present themselves as liberators. And they need to show evidence of the people that they’ve liberated. So that’s why they’re handing out chocolate to kids. And that’s why they are encouraging people to come to Russian-held territory and possibly to Russia. But then there are other stories that are more horrific, of people being taken places, having their fingerprints taken, photographed, and then having their documents taken away from them. And they are waiting to find out what’s going to happen to them.

sabrina tavernise

Wow, effectively, prisoners.

valerie hopkins

Well, that is certainly what the city administration of Mariupol is saying. And they actually estimate that between 20,000 and 30,000 people may have had this happen to them. And they also estimate that 2,000 kids have had this fate. And I spoke to a grandfather who’s been trying to get his 12-year-old granddaughter back, who was taken to Donetsk, a Russian-held city now. And he has no way of communicating with the authorities there or organizing her transfer.

sabrina tavernise

So Valerie, the picture you’re painting here is incredibly dark. And this is a very, very bleak situation for Ukrainians in Mariupol. And I guess what I’m wondering is, what would a Russian victory in Mariupol mean for the future of the war?

valerie hopkins

Well, Sabrina, of course, territorially, it would be a victory for Russia, even if the whole city is completely destroyed. But I think that, in many ways, whether or not Mariupol falls, it’s not really the point.

[music]

This brutal campaign has already sent a message to Ukraine and to the world and, especially, definitely, to the people of Mariupol about just how far Putin is willing to go. We talked about looking at what Russia does and not what it says. And Mariupol is what Russia is doing.

sabrina tavernise

Valerie, thank you.

valerie hopkins

Thank you, Sabrina.

[music]

sabrina tavernise

On Friday morning, a convoy from the International Committee of the Red Cross that had been on its way to Mariupol to facilitate a large-scale evacuation of civilians had to turn back after, quote, “arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed.” Separately, a limited number of buses with civilians made it out of the city. But it was not clear if more would be allowed to leave. Kristina said she did not know whether her father and grandparents were among those able to get out. We’ll be right back.

[music]

Here’s what else you need to know today.

archived recording (joe biden) Today, I want to talk about one aspect of Putin’s war that affects and has real effects on American people, Putin’s price hike that Americans and our allies are feeling at the pump.

sabrina tavernise

On Thursday, President Biden said he would release up to 180 million barrels of oil from the U.S. Strategic Reserves over the next six months in an effort to lower gas prices that have surged as a result of the war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia’s energy industry.

archived recording (joe biden) There isn’t enough supply. And the bottom line is if we want lower gas prices, we need to have more oil supply right now.

sabrina tavernise

It is the largest release of oil from the emergency stockpile since the Strategic Reserve was created in the early 1970s. And a lower court in New York state ruled that the state’s newly drawn congressional maps were unconstitutional, a decision that could block their use in this year’s midterm elections. A judge ruled that the map drawing process, overseen by the Democratic majority, had been tainted. He gave the legislature until April 11 to come up with fairer maps for U.S. Congress and the state legislature. The ruling is likely to be appealed, but if it stands, it could endanger a major achievement by Democrats over the past few years— the creation of an even congressional map that no longer favors Republicans.

European buyers of Russian gas faced a deadline to start paying in roubles on Friday (Saturday AEDT), while negotiations aimed at ending the five-week war were set to resume even as Ukraine braced for further attacks in the south and east.

Fighting

Ukrainian forces are preparing for new Russian attacks on the Donbas region in the south-east after they repelled Russia’s assault on the capital Kyiv, President Zelensky said.

He said the situation in the south and the Donbas remained extremely difficult and Russia was building up forces near the besieged southern port of Mariupol.

Nearly 5000 people have been killed in Mariupol, the mayor’s office estimates, and about 170,000 people remain trapped amid ruins without food, heat, power or running water. Reuters has been unable to verify the figures.

Russian forces had killed 148 children during shelling and air strikes, fired 1370 missiles and destroyed 15 Ukrainian airports since the start of the invasion, Ukraine’s defence ministry said. Reuters could not independently verify the information.

The Ukrainian state nuclear company said all the Russian forces occupying the Chernobyl nuclear power station had withdrawn from the territory of the defunct plant.

Economy

European governments rejected Putin’s energy ultimatum, with the continent’s biggest recipient of Russian gas, Germany, calling it “blackmail”.

US President Joe Biden announced the largest release from the US emergency oil reserve to bring down petrol prices that have soared during the war.

The war also threatens to disrupt global food supplies, with a US government official sharing images of what they said was damage to grain storage facilities in Ukraine, the world’s fourth-largest gain exporter in the 2020/21 season.

Diplomacy

Russia and Ukraine are to resume peace talks online on April 1, a senior Ukrainian official said.

Humanitarian concerns

The Russian defence ministry said it would open a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia on Friday, Tass news agency reported.

What they said

“We spent 30 days in the basement, with small children. The children are shaking, even still. They ask: ‘When will we go to kindergarten? When will we go to school?’ They don’t understand what has happened,” said a woman named Larisa in Trostyanets, a town in the country’s east recaptured by Ukrainian forces.",https://www.afr.com/world/europe/after-failing-to-take-kyiv-russia-focuses-on-south-east-20220331-p5a9ww

More from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been addressing the Ukrainian people from his office in Kyiv.

Zelensky accused Russian forces of killing and torturing more than 300 civilians in the formerly occupied city of Bucha, where evidence of alleged Russian war crimes have been discovered.

The BBC cannot independently verify this claim.

""We have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done,"" Zelensky said.

""We know that they are moving away from the areas where we are beating them to focus on others that are very important... where it can be difficult for us,"" he said.

""This is part of their tactics,"" said Zelensky in a late-night address.

In peace talks this week, Russia said it would scale back attacks on the capital Kyiv and the city of Chernigiv, but Ukrainian and Western officials have dismissed the pledge, saying Moscow's troops were merely regrouping.

Russia meanwhile threatened to turn off its gas taps to Europe if payments are not made in rubles, as U.S. President Joe Biden ordered a record release of strategic oil reserves to ease soaring U.S. prices.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Russia is consolidating and preparing ""powerful strikes"" in the country's east and south, including besieged Mariupol, where a new attempt will be made Friday to evacuate civilians from the devastated city.

""In Donbas and Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, the Russian army is accumulating the potential for attacks, powerful attacks,"" he said.

Washington echoed that assessment, with a senior U.S. defense official saying Russia's focus on Donbas could herald a ""longer, more prolonged conflict.""

Military experts believe that Moscow is ditching efforts to advance simultaneously along multiple axes in the north, east and south, after struggling to overcome stronger-than-expected Ukrainian resistance.

Instead it wants to establish a long-sought land link between Crimea, which Moscow occupied in 2014, and the two Russian-backed Donbas statelets of Donetsk and Lugansk.

'Civilians desperately wanting to flee'

Mariupol is the main remaining obstacle to that ambition, and Russian forces have encircled and relentlessly bombarded the city to try to capture it.

Instead, it has been reduced to rubble, with tens of thousands of civilians trapped inside with little food, water or medicine.

Previous attempts to evacuate residents have collapsed, though some have made the dangerous dash to freedom alone, but on Friday Russia says it will allow a humanitarian corridor organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

The ICRC's Ukraine delegation said on Twitter it was in nearby Zaporizhzhia, where buses from the encircled city are meant to arrive.

""We hope to be able to facilitate safe passage for civilians desperately wanting to flee Mariupol. We are also here with two trucks of assistance, hoping that we can also get assistance in,"" the organisation's Lucile Marbeau said in a video.

""In these trucks there is food, medicine, relief items, for those civilians who decide to stay,"" she added.

Russia has moved about 20% of its troops from around Kyiv but its strikes have continued and troops are likely ""going to be repositioned, probably into Belarus, to be refitted and resupplied and used elsewhere in Ukraine,"" said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby.

Russian troops have also pulled back from the Chernobyl nuclear plant after weeks of occupation, but have taken a number of captive Ukrainian servicemen with them, according to officials in Kyiv.

And in a sign that the war could be expanding in scope, a Russian official said Friday that Ukrainian helicopters had carried out a strike on a fuel depot in the Russian town of Belgorod, some 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the border with Ukraine.

Western intelligence has claimed Putin's advisors may be ""afraid to tell him the truth"" and Biden suggested some advisors may even have been placed under house arrest, though he cautioned ""there's a lot of speculation.""

'I hope all this will end soon'

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov hit back, saying Western officials ""don't understand President Putin, they don't understand the mechanism for taking decisions and they don't understand the style of our work.""

With his economy crippled by unprecedented international sanctions, Putin has sought to leverage Russia's status as an energy power, and warned Thursday that EU members will need to set up ruble accounts from Friday to pay for his country's gas.

""If such payments are not made, we will consider this a breach of obligations on the part of our buyers"" and existing contracts would be stopped, Putin said.

The EU has joined the United States in imposing sanctions, and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola is expected in Kyiv soon in a show of support.

But the bloc has not imposed an energy embargo, and Germany, which imported 55% of its gas supplies from Russia before the war, insisted it will pay in euros or dollars as stipulated in contracts.

Berlin and Paris were also ""preparing"" for Russian gas to simply stop flowing, France's economy minister said.

Biden meanwhile moved to mitigate rising domestic fuel prices by announcing a release from strategic US reserves of a million barrels daily for six months.

The record release amounts to augmenting global supplies by about one percent.",https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/04/01/russia-regrouping-for-powerful-strikes-zelensky-warns-a77174

1 Apr 2022 22.26 Russian troops have reportedly taken an unspecified number of captive Ukrainian servicemen hostage after leaving Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear power plant, according to officials. State nuclear agency Energoatom released a statement on Telegram, citing plant workers: As they ran away from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the Russian occupiers took members of the National Guard, whom they had held hostage since Feb 24, with them.” The Guardian is unable to verify these claims and it remains unclear how many, if any, Ukrainian servicemen were taken away.



1 Apr 2022 22.02 The Biden administration has approved the drawdown and sale of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) citing a severe energy supply interruption. In a recently published memorandum, Biden said Russia’s invasion on Ukraine “has had a profound impact on global oil markets” prompting the International Energy Agency Governing Board to agree to a collective release of petroleum reserves. He said the United States committed to a drawdown and sale of 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The Secretary is authorised and directed to draw down and sell petroleum from the SPR at public sale to the highest qualified bidder at a rate the Secretary may determine, in accordance with section 161 of EPCA and the SPR competitive sales procedures in 10 CFR Part 625,” the statement read.



1 Apr 2022 21.40 Russia will respond to European Union sanctions and says the 27-nation bloc might realise that a confrontation with Moscow is not in its interests, Russian state media agency RIA Novosti cited a senior foreign ministry official as saying on Friday. Nikolai Kobrinets said in an interview with the news agency: The actions of the EU will not remain unanswered ... the irresponsible sanctions by Brussels are already negatively affecting the daily lives of ordinary Europeans. Are they ready from their own pocket to pay for further killings of civilians in Ukraine, the transformation of Europe from a region of cooperation and stability into a zone of conflict? I don’t think so.”

It always gets worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas.” ""President Putin is not the force he used to be"".

1 Apr 2022 21.00 Russian troops leave Chernobyl after radiation exposure - Ukraine reports Russian troops began leaving the Chernobyl nuclear plant after soldiers contracted “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site, Ukraine’s state power company has alleged. Ukraine’s state agency in charge of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, Energoatom, published an update late on Thursday confirming Russian troops had left the site. According to the staff of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, there are currently no outsiders at the NPP site. It will be recalled that today the Russian occupation forces left the territory of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the satellite city of Slavutych.” Energoatom said Russian troops had dug in the forest inside the exclusion zone around the now-closed plant. “It should be noted that the information about fortifications and trenches that the [Russians] built right in the Red Forest, the most polluted in the entire Exclusion Zone, was also confirmed,” Energoatom said in a Telegram post. So it is not surprising that the occupiers received significant doses of radiation and panicked at the first sign of illness. And it manifested itself very quickly.” The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had not been able to confirm reports of Russian troops receiving high doses and was seeking more information in a statement on Thursday. The IAEA has not been able to confirm reports of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation while being in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and is seeking further information in order to provide an independent assessment of the situation.” Energoatom said Russian troops had dug in the forest inside the exclusion zone around the now-closed plant. Photograph: EyePress News/REX/Shutterstock Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, told the Associated Press it “seems unlikely” a large number of troops would develop severe radiation illness, but it was impossible to know for sure without more details.

He said contaminated material was probably buried or covered with new topsoil during the cleanup of Chernobyl, and some soldiers may have been exposed to a “hot spot” of radiation while digging. Others may have assumed they were at risk too, he said. Russian troops on Tuesday left Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear power plant after weeks of occupation, officials said on Thursday. Energoatom said Russian troops began leaving the station and other exclusion zones, which they had occupied since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February. The IAEA also released a statement, saying: “Ukraine informed IAEA today that Russian forces that had been in control of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant since 24 February have, in writing, transferred control of the nuclear power plant to Ukrainian personnel and moved convoys of troops.” #Ukraine informed IAEA today that Russian forces that had been in control of #Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant since 24 Feb have, in writing, transferred control of the NPP to Ukrainian personnel and moved convoys of troops. https://t.co/DkBXEJpDu8 pic.twitter.com/guITblxwXP — IAEA - International Atomic Energy Agency (@iaeaorg) March 31, 2022

31 Mar 2022 19.39 EU and Chinese leaders will meet for a first summit in two years on Friday with Brussels keen for assurances from Beijing that it will neither supply Russia with arms nor help Moscow circumvent western sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. EU officials close to the preparations of the summit said any help given to Russia would damage China’s international reputation and jeopardise relations with its biggest trade partners - Europe and the United States. The presidents of the European Commission and European Council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, will hold virtual talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and later President Xi Jinping. An EU official said China’s stance towards Russia would be the “million-dollar question” on Friday, as reported by Reuters. Another pointed out that over a quarter of China’s global trade was with the bloc and the United States last year, against just 2.4% with Russia. “Do we prolong this war or do we work together to end this war? That is the essential question for the summit,” the official said. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated China’s call for peace talks this week, adding the legitimate concerns of all sides should be accommodated.

31 Mar 2022 19.12 In another busy day of diplomacy Zelenskiy confirmed he addressed the parliaments of Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium. “I felt total support. I am waiting for concrete steps. I called for tougher sanctions against Russia. We have to put pressure on the aggressor until the aggression is over,” he said.

In a discussion with President of the European Council, Charles Michel, Zelenskiy said the pair discussed additional sanctions on Russia, economic support for Ukraine and financing of priority projects. “The dynamics of our movement towards full membership in the EU,” he added. Zelenskiy said he was grateful for the new package of sanctions against Russia imposed by the United States. “We are grateful. It will not allow the current sanctions to be circumvented - we have already noticed such attempts. It will also limit the work of sensitive sectors of the Russian economy - its defence sector.” Finally, Zelenskiy said he also held talks with President of Turkey Erdoğan. “We spoke very specifically. In particular, about the prospects of negotiations in Turkey with the Russian Federation. And also about the creation of an effective system of guarantees for our state. About the security we have always needed and to the real provision of which we have come closer. “I am grateful for Turkey’s readiness to become a guarantor of security for Ukraine.”



31 Mar 2022 19.03 Zelenskiy also provided an update on Ukraine’s military defence, confirming Russian troops continue to leave the country’s north but describing the move as a tactical withdrawal. To the north of Kyiv, in the Chernihiv direction, in the Sumy region, the expulsion of the occupiers continues. They themselves are aware that they can no longer withstand the intensity of hostilities they could have maintained in the first half of March ... But we must also realise that for the Russian military, this is part of their tactics. All this is not occasional. We know their plans. We know what they are planning and what they are doing. We know that they are moving away from the areas where we are beating them to focus on others that are very important. On those where it can be difficult for us. Describing the “extremely difficult” situation in Ukraine’s south and in Donbas, Zelenskiy claimed Russian forces are accumulating in the temporarily occupied areas of region of Kherson. They are trying to organise some of their incomprehensible structures there, they are trying to figure out how to consolidate their presence there,” he said. Also in Donbas, in Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes. Powerful strikes.”



31 Mar 2022 18.57 Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as we continue to deliver all the latest from Ukraine. As expected, Zelenskiy has delivered another late-night address. They [Russia] said - three or five days. They thought that this would be enough for them to seize our entire state. And it’s already 36. And we are standing. And we will continue to fight. Until the end.”
