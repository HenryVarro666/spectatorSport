A huge explosion in a Ukrainian city has been captured in harrowing video footage.

The terrifying blast is understood to have struck Chuguev airfield in the Kharkiv region of the city.

In a number of clips of the incident shared across social media, a huge bright orange blast wave, which lingers in the air, is seen erupting over the night sky, as reported by The Mirror.

Stunned citizens, filming from apartment blocks, jump backwards as the wave pans out.

Thermobaric or vacuum explosives, dubbed as the 'father of all bombs', suck oxygen from the surrounding air to generate high-temperature explosions.

They can vaporise a human body and were first developed by the Soviet Union and the US in the 1960s.

The blast comes after the Ukrainian ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova said yesterday the Kremlin had used the devastating bombs - banned by the Geneva Convention - during air strikes.

""They used the vacuum bomb today, which is actually prohibited by the Geneva convention,"" Markarova said after briefing members of the U.S. Congress.

""The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large.""

UK defence chiefs warned of an ever-increasingly more ruthless Russian assault on Ukraine’s civilians as its commanders became desperate to gain ground.

In another day of bloodshed, missiles hit Kyiv’s TV tower, killing five people and sending black smoke billowing over the capital’s centre- an attack branded “barbaric” by Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry.

But, despite the onslaught, defiant President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government remains in control of the capital with its brave combined force of soldiers and civilians ready to fight street by street.

Embattled Ukrainian troops held on ferociously to every city throughout the country, helped by Molotov Cocktail-hurling civilians, armed with AK47 assault rifles and bottles of petrol.

But despite the amazing spirit and bravery of Ukraine, rising numbers of civilian deaths over the last two days were an ominous sign that frustrated Russian commanders are resorting to even more lethal tactics.

After being repulsed on multiple fronts by the Ukrainian Army, the Russian military appears to have moved to attacking highly urban areas with artillery barrages. At the same time, a massive convoy is creeping towards Kyiv from the north in what can only be assumed to be preparations for an all-out assault on the capital. You can get up to speed by checking out our prior rolling coverage of this conflict here.

Now let's get to the most recent developments.

The Latest:

UPDATED—

We have finished our updates to this story, but you can find our continuing rolling coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine here.

UPDATED: 10:30 AM EST—

As fears of a possible renewed Russian offensive against Kyiv continue to grow, Russian state news agency TASS reports that the Russian Ministry of Defense has warned residents of the Ukrainian capital to leave their homes, before it strikes targets there. The Russian Ministry of Defense has said it plans to conduct “high-precision strikes” against the “Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the 72nd Center for Information and Psychological Operations (PSO)“ in Kyiv. “We urge Ukrainian citizens involved by Ukrainian nationalists in provocations against Russia, as well as Kyiv residents living near relay stations, to leave their homes,” the ministry has said.

Recent videos from the city suggest that Russian forces may already have begun this latest series of attacks, apparently targeting the 1,200-foot Soviet-era TV tower in the city:

UPDATED: 8:00 AM EST—

There have been reports that the Russian airbase at Taganrog has come under attack from Ukrainian forces. Details at this stage are limited but, if true, this would mark an impressive effort by Kyiv's forces to strike beyond their borders. Taganrog is a port city in Rostov Oblast, on the Sea of Azov. Although less than 40 miles from the Russian border, this would represent one of the very few successful counterattacks by Ukraine directed against Russian territory. There were previous reports of a Ukrainian attack on Millerovo Air Base in Russia on the first day of fighting, February 24, but this has not been confirmed by either Russian or Ukrainian officials.

Videos and photos appear to show a Russian Il-76 Candid transport aircraft burning on the ground at Taganrog Air Base, which is home to the 708th Military Transport Aviation Regiment, as well as the Beriev company.

UPDATED: 6:00 AM EST—

Ukraine has announced the loss in aerial combat of one of its most celebrated fighter pilots, Col. Oleksandr Oksanchenko. The circumstances of his death are unclear, but he was a renowned Su-27 Flanker pilot, who had won an award for best solo flying display at the Royal International Air Tattoo in the United Kingdom in 2017. A now-deleted tweet from the President's Office said that “He diverted enemy aircraft,” suggesting he was engaging other aircraft at the time he was killed, reportedly somewhere near Kyiv, on February 25. This would also be one of the few confirmed aircraft losses on the Ukrainian side. While Kyiv has posted significant claims for Russian aircraft destroyed in combat, so far those claims have not been reciprocated and physical evidence of Ukrainian aircraft losses has been strictly limited.

Posted: 4:15 AM EST—

In possibly another glimpse of what's to come unless this war is stopped, Russian forces struck the Kharkiv Regional State Administration Building, creating a massive explosion and crater and a wave of destruction in the vicinity of the building:

It isn't clear exactly what weapon was used in the attack. It looks like a large artillery rocket, such as a 300mm Smerch, or possibly a land-attack cruise missile (LACM) in the freeze-frame. Regardless, it was a big unitary warhead let loose on a civilian and highly urban target.

The following analysis, using open-source intelligence, does seem to suggest that a Kalibr LACM may have been used. In this case, the particular weapon would have been a 3M14 Kalibr, rather than the 3M54 anti-shipping variant indicated, although both weapons look broadly similar. To read more about the Russian standoff weapons used during the campaign so far, click here.

Latest overall intel assessment from the U.K. Ministry of Defense:

UK MOD

The massive convoy has grown from 17 miles to now around 40 miles. This is probably more of a developing supply line than just a convoy at this point. Regardless, this is literally an army in itself bearing down on Kyiv:

Reports state that as many as 70 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in another Russian artillery or missile strike, this time directed against a military base in Okhtyrka, a city located roughly between Kharkiv and Kyiv. The strike, which may have involved a ballistic missile, appears to have targeted a four-story building, leaving an enormous crater in its wake.

We are also increasingly seeing some of the weapons that are proving critical to Ukraine's ability to repulse the Russian invasion forces. The following images show troops armed with British-supplied Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapons, or NLAWs, onboard a Ukrainian Army Aviation Mi-8 helicopter. The second image, the provenance of which is unknown, shows an apparently civilian vehicle filled with shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles, as well as another NLAW.

Ukraine MOD

Video has also emerged of a dramatic helicopter assault, reportedly over the Kyiv Reservoir, perhaps taken during the first day of fighting, on February 24. A formation of Russian helicopters comes under ground fire, resulting in two of the helicopters — apparently Mi-8 or Mi-24/35 types — impacting the water. While one of these rotorcraft is brought down, the other appears to make a remarkable recovery and continues flying.

We will continue to update this post with new developments until stated otherwise.

The mushroom cloud is understood to have struck Chuguev airfield in the Kharkiv region and it comes a day after it was claimed Russia used a thermobaric bomb

An enormous explosion in Ukraine's second city region has been captured in chilling video footage.

The blast, inflicted by the Russian military, is understood to have struck Chuguev airfield in the Kharkiv region.

In multiple clips of the incident shared on social media, a mammoth bright orange blast wave, which hangs in the air, is seen erupting over the night sky.

“Our task for today is encircle Mariupol,” he said.

Pushilin claimed without offering any evidence that nationalist elements in Mariupol were terrorizing the civilian population and were using them as a human shield. The city has a population of some 400,000.

Separately, the deputy head of the Donetsk People’s Militia, Eduard Basurin, said the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), along with Russian forces, would organize humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to leave Mariupol.

The corridors would be open through Wednesday, he said.

Basurin said several towns in the region had already fallen to the militia of the DPR.

Vadym Boichenko, the mayor of Mariupol, said on Ukrainian television that residential areas had been shelled for five days – with heavy artillery, rockets and aircraft.

“There are many wounded, dead local residents, women, children.”

Ukraine's president has accused Russia of war crimes after Vladimir Putin's forces launched what were believed to be cluster and vacuum bomb attacks in an attempt to turn the tide of a conflict that they have so-far been losing.

In a late night address directed at Russia, Volodymyr Zelensky said there would 'definitely be an international tribunal' for what he said was a 'violation of all conventions' and added that 'no one in the world will forgive you for killing peaceful Ukrainian people.' Prosecutors at The Hague say they intend to open a probe 'as soon as possible.'

Zelensky spoke after what appeared to be a cluster bomb attack on the city of Kharkiv on Monday which killed at least 11 people and wounded scores more, and after Ukraine's ambassador to the US accused Putin's forces of using a banned thermobaric bomb on the capital of Kyiv overnight.

The bombardment of Kharkiv continued Tuesday morning with a rocket landing just in front of the civilian public administration building, destroying the road outside and blowing the windows out of the building itself. Footage from inside shows the building was heavily damaged, with ceilings collapsing and rubble strewn around.

It came as Russia's invasion of Ukraine - which met with heavy defeat in its initial plan to seize key targets and infrastructure in precision strikes - entered a new phase, with the aim seemingly to surround and besiege cities such as Kharkiv, Kyiv, Mariupol, Sumy and Kherson which have so-far put up fierce resistance - and bomb them into submission using indiscriminate weapons in echoes of tactics Russia used against rebel forces in Syria while fighting alongside dictator Bashar al-Assad.

Fears that Kyiv will be hard-hit have been growing and reached new heights on Tuesday as satellite images revealed a column of Russian vehicles heading towards the capital is actually 40 miles long, as opposed to the 4 miles that were reported on Monday.

The most-advanced units in the column are now just 15 miles from the city, having been significantly slowed by Ukrainian resistance but never-the-less inching closer day by day. Russia's plan appears to be using the heavy armour to encircle and shell the city, before troops move in for street-to-street fighting.

A taste of what was to come struck Kharkiv on Monday when bombs rained down on the most Russia-friendly city in Ukraine – which sits 25 miles from the border and is home to 1.5million people – in a bid to break its will to resist.

The hail of bombs, shells and rockets which began falling at lunchtime left at least 11 dead, including three children, with homes and even a school reduced to rubble.

A military source told MailOnline that videos of the onslaught showed 'cluster' munitions - which are illegal under international law - had been used.

'The BM-21 Grad is a multiple launch rocket system used for ""area denial"", dropping cluster bombs on a concentrated area,' the expert said. 'It's mainly used on enemy troops before an offensive. Used against civilians, it's not only a war crime, but has only one purpose – to spread terror and alarm among the civilian population.'

Later on Monday, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S. claimed that Russia used a devastating vacuum bomb on Ukraine.

Oksana Markarova, speaking after briefing members of the U.S. congress, said: 'They used the vacuum bomb today, which is actually prohibited by the Geneva convention. The devastation that Russia is trying to inflict on Ukraine is large.'

The vacuum bombs, which are also known as thermobaric weapons, can vaporise bodies and crush internal organs. They use oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion, typically producing a blast wave of a significantly longer duration than that of a conventional explosive.

They are among the most powerful non-nuclear weapons ever developed.

Ms Markarova's comments came after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he plans to open an investigation 'as rapidly as possible' into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

As Russia's attempt to overwhelm Ukrainian forces continued, security sources said that, 96 hours in to the invasion, Putin had 'stirred up a hornets' nest' by 'underestimating the strength of the resistance' and the 'will of the people to fight'.

However, in a concerning statement that further signalled the ramping up tensions between the West and Putin, Russia's foreign ministry promised that it would hit back against the EU after the bloc imposed sanctions.

A spokesman also warned that 'EU citizens and structures' involved in sending weapons to Ukraine would be 'responsible for any consequences'.

Amid the ongoing fighting, it was announced that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will on Tuesday fly to Poland to visit British troops manning Nato's eastern border with Russia.

It comes after huge explosions rocked a suburb of Kyiv on Monday evening, just hours after the attack in Kharkiv.

Dramatic video showed the moment that the night sky lit up with an enormous fire ball that reportedly stemmed from a military radar communication center in the Brovary suburb of the capital.

Kharkiv was struck by more Russian rockets on Tuesday morning, with one striking outside the civilian public administration building which was heavily damaged in the blast. The rocket can be seen a split second before it slams into the building, triggering a massive blast

The new explosion took place hours after the Kremlin warned civilians to leave the city via a 'safe route' to the south-west, amid fears that the city was about to come under further heavy attack.

Russia used similar tactics in Syrian cities while fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad before its forces heavily bombed them.

Russian armour was working to surround Kyiv with tanks manoeuvering to cut it off from the west, after attacks by advanced forces failed to penetrate the outskirts.

New satellite images also showed how a military convoy that stretched more than 17 miles (27km) was moving closer to the capital, a private U.S. company said.

U.S. company Maxar Technologies Inc said the convoy on the eastern edge of Antonov airport contained hundreds of armoured vehicles, tanks, towed artillery and logistics support vehicles and continued to move south towards Kyiv. Other images showed also Russian ground forces close in Zdvyzhivka, northeast of Kyiv.

Colonel General Alexander Syrsky said early Monday that Kyiv had survived another night while inflicting 'heavy losses' on Russian attackers.

In the attack in Kharkiv, 44 people are believed to have been injured.

Graphic images and video revealed streets littered with the bodies of dead and badly wounded civilians, with other images showing showing spent BM-21 Grad rocket cartridges laying in the streets and having fallen through apartment roofs.

Cluster munitions were also to destroy a school in Okhtyrka, activist group Amnesty said, in which three people including a child were killed. The attack 'appears to have been carried out by Russian forces, which were operating nearby, and which have a record of using cluster munitions in populated areas,' Amnesty said.

'There is no possible justification for dropping cluster munitions in populated areas, let alone near a school,' secretary Agnes Callamard added.

The blasts mark some of the most serious attacks on civilians since the war began five days ago, and came after the first round of Ukraine-Russian peace talks - held in Belarus - ended without resolutions.

A a second round of negotiations is set to be held in the coming days.

Ukraine said ahead of the negotiations that it was seeking a ceasefire and total withdrawal of all Russian forces from its country, with President Zelensky saying he was not hopeful of results but had to try. Moscow would not be drawn on what its ambitions are.

Observers warned that the talks could pre-sage an increase in violence, as Putin increasingly deploys heavy weaponry that was absent from early fighting in an attempt to force a victory that he has been unable to achieve by subtler means.

Putin himself dashed many hopes for the talks on Monday when, in a call with Emmanuel Macron, he said that he is willing to negotiate with Ukraine - but on the basis that it is disarmed, 'de-Nazified', recognises Crimea as Russian soil and declares neutrality. Kyiv is highly unlikely to accept those terms.

US intelligence believes around 75 per cent of Russian forces positioned on the borders with Ukraine are now inside the country.

Though Russian advanced forces have been fighting in Kyiv's outskirts for several days, the bulk of Putin's assault force is still located around 20 miles away having been slowed up by determined resistance fighters - with satellite images revealing a huge column of vehicles headed for the city.

The cities of Zhytomyr, Zaporizhzhia, and Chernihiv were also bombed overnight, with air raid sirens sounding in other areas.

In the south, Russians reported capturing the port city of Berdiansk with troops and armoured vehicles shown rolling through the centre, and were closing in on the city of Mariupol which was in danger of becoming surrounded - though remained under Ukrainian control as of the early hours.

Speaking on Monday morning, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for Ukraine to be 'immediately' admitted to the EU - after the alliance stepped up to supply hundreds of million of dollars of military aid to Ukraine, a first in the bloc's history - saying his country had 'earned' the right. He also said Russia's attack had so-far killed 15 children, and wounded dozens more.

U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet says her office has confirmed that 102 civilians, including 7 children, have been killed, and 304 others injured in violence in Ukraine since Thursday, as she cautioned that the tally was likely a vast undercount.

It came amid reports that Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko is poised to throw his own troops into the fighting, which US intelligence said could come as soon as Monday. The move follows on from Chechen forces being thrown into battle, which led to the almost-immediate destruction of a column of armoured vehicles and the death of one of their top generals.

Belarus on Sunday also voted to amend the country's constitution allowing them to host Russian nuclear weapons, which came after Vladimir Putin's chilling order to his defence chiefs to put the country's nuclear weapons on 'alert' in response to 'threats' from the West.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday that Russia's decision to raise the nuclear alert was 'a reckless, dangerous decision'. He added: 'There's no reason for that. NATO is no threat to Russia. We don't seek confrontation with Russia.'

In his address on Monday evening, Zelensky said that, since the beginning of Russia's invasion, 56 missile strikes and 113 cruise missiles had been launched in Ukraine by Putin's forces.

What are thermobaric 'vacuum' bombs? Thermobaric weapons - also known as vacuum bombs - are high-powered explosive that use the atmosphere itself as part of the explosion. They are among the most powerful non-nuclear weapons ever developed. The bomb works by using oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion, making it far deadlier than a conventional weapon. A thermobaric bomb dropped by the US on Taliban in Afghanistan in 2017 weighed 21,600 pounds and left a crater more than 300 meters (1,000 feet) wide after it exploded six feet above the ground. Thermobaric weapons were developed by both the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the 1960s. In September 2007, Russia detonated the largest thermobaric weapon ever made, which created an explosion equivalent to 39.9 tons. The U.S. version of the weapon reportedly costs over $16 million each. Last week, it emerged that Russia may use the weapons if their assault in Ukraine became bogged down. A western official said: 'My fear would be that if they don't meet their timescale and objectives they would be indiscriminate in their use of violence. 'They don’t adhere to the same principles of necessity and proportionality and rule of law that Western forces do.' Advertisement

He added: 'Today, Russian forces brutally fired on Kharkiv from jet artillery. It was clearly a war crime.'

'Kharkiv is a peaceful city, there are peaceful residential areas, no military facilities. Dozens of eyewitness accounts prove that this is not a single false volley, but deliberate destruction of people: the Russians knew where they were shooting.'

'There will definitely be an international tribunal for this crime — it's a violation of all conventions. No one in the world will forgive you for killing peaceful Ukrainian people,' he said.

On the eve of his visit to Poland, the PM said the UK will 'continue to bring maximum pressure to bear' on Russia as he pledged that Putin would 'feel the consequences' for invading Ukraine.

He said international leaders were united in agreeing that the Russian president 'must fail' after his decision to send troops into the neighbouring country.

Mr Johnson is due to meet with Warsaw and Tallinn leaders and visit British troops serving in Estonia, which shares a border with Russia.

Speaking before his visit to the two eastern European members of Nato, the Prime Minister said: 'Today I will visit Poland and Estonia, two countries that are acutely affected by the current crisis in Ukraine.

'We have shared values that are more important than ever to protect, as the humanitarian situation gets worse.

'Alongside all our international allies the UK will continue to bring maximum pressure to bear on Putin's regime to ensure he feels the consequences of his actions in Ukraine.

'We speak with one voice when we say, Putin must fail.'

Officials said Mr Johnson will meet Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to underpin the UK's financial and diplomatic support for central Europe as it faces the prospect of a humanitarian crisis, with Ukrainian refugees continuing to head for the Polish border.

The Prime Minister will then travel on to Estonia, where he will speak with Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg.

They will jointly visit British troops serving 'on the front line of Russian aggression' in Tapa, No 10 officials said.

Mr Johnson will also meet Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas and Estonian President Alar Karis to discuss European security and stability.

The trip comes after Poland and Romania joined a G7, European Union and Nato leaders' phone call on Monday to discuss the crisis in Ukraine.

Downing Street said the leaders 'agreed to pursue every avenue to ensure that Putin fails in his ambitions'.

During the call, Mr Johnson stressed the need for allies to continue to provide Kyiv with defensive weapons and the requirement to support Ukraine's neighbours, which include Poland, in dealing with 'large numbers of Ukrainians escaping violence in the country'.

It came as the ICC's chief Karim Khan said he is planning a war crimes investigation.

Mr Khan said in a statement that its investigation will look at alleged crimes committed before the Russian invasion, but added that 'given the expansion of the conflict in recent days, it is my intention that this investigation will also encompass any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of my office that are committed by any party to the conflict on any part of the territory of Ukraine'.

Russia promises EU will face 'harsh response' for its support of Ukraine – and warns West against supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine Russia promised on Monday that it would hit back against the EU following its support of Ukraine and warned the West against supplying weapons to the country. A spokesman for the country's foreign ministry said the steps the bloc has taken against it following its invasion of Ukraine, which include sanctions, will 'not go unanswered'. It also warned that 'EU citizens and structures' involved in sending weapons to Ukraine would be 'responsible for any consequences'. The threat came after the EU closed off its airspace to all Russian planes - which later saw Russian carrier Aeroflot suspend all flights to Europe - and banned Kremlin propaganda outlets Russia Today and Sputnik. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said last night that this was the first time the EU had done this for a country under attack. EU defence ministers were also set to discuss plans to send defensive weapons to Ukraine. The bloc's foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said: 'Half a billion euros [$560 million] will be devoted to providing defensive arms, high-calibre arms, and anti-tank [equipment] — all kinds of agreements in order to repel the aggression. 'We have to coordinate what we are doing and what we can do additionally with these resources,' he added. Advertisement

The court already has conducted a preliminary probe into crimes linked to the violent suppression of pro-European protests in Kyiv in 2013-2014 by a pro-Russian Ukrainian administration and allegations of crimes in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and eastern Ukraine, where Russia has backed rebels since 2014.

In December 2020, then-ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said the probe uncovered indications that 'a broad range of conduct constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity within the jurisdiction of the Court have been committed' in Ukraine.

However, the court's prosecutors had not yet sought permission from judges to open a full-scale investigation.

Mr Khan says he now wants to open the investigation envisaged by his predecessor and broaden it to include crimes committed in fighting since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last week.

Mr Khan said he would continue to monitor developments in Ukraine, where there have been reports of civilian casualties, and he called for 'restraint and strict adherence to the applicable rules of international humanitarian law'.

UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet says her office has confirmed that 102 civilians, including seven children, have been killed in the Russian invasion and 304 others wounded in Ukraine since Thursday.

She cautioned that the tally was likely a vast undercount.

Neither Russia nor Ukraine is among the court's 123 member states, but Ukraine has accepted the court's jurisdiction, which empowers Mr Khan to investigate.

Mr Khan has told his team to explore how to preserve evidence of crimes and said that the next step is to seek authorisation from the court's judges to open an investigation.

However, he added that the process would be speeded up if a member nation of the court were to ask for an investigation in what is known as a referral.

That 'would allow us to actively and immediately proceed with the (prosecution) Office's independent and objective investigations,' Mr Khan said.

He said he also would seek support from the court's member states and the international community to fund the investigation.

'I will be calling for additional budgetary support, for voluntary contributions to support all our situations, and for the loan of gratis personnel,' he said.

'The importance and urgency of our mission is too serious to be held hostage to lack of means.'

The blast in Brovary is said to have left people wounded, the area's mayor said in a Facebook post on Monday night.

Monday's peace talks ended without resolutions and a second round of negotiations will be held in the coming days, with a member of the Ukrainian delegation saying the discussions were difficult and the Russian side was biased.

Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter: 'The Russian side, unfortunately, still has a very biased view of the destructive processes it has launched.'

Russian officials, meanwhile, said: 'We have identified certain points from which we can predict general positions.'

Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Putin, said another round of talks had been agreed to.

'Another round of talks was agreed to,' he said.

'Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, gave few details except to say that the talks, held near the Ukraine-Belarus border, were focused on a possible cease-fire and that a second round could take place 'in the near future.'

'The next meeting will take place in the coming days on the Polish-Belarusian border, there is an agreement to that effect.'

Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky earlier admitted he was not confident of a positive resolution, adding that he owed it to his people to at least try and engage.

He had been reticent to agree to talks in Belarus, a country used as a staging ground for the Russian invasion and which is now poised to join the war, offering instead to meet in Istanbul, Warsaw or Baku.

Ukraine had indicated it would request a ceasefire and full withdrawal of Russian forces but Moscow remained tight lipped over what the negotiations, held at noon in Gomel in southeastern Belarus, would entail.

Some observers warned the talks could be a pretext for Moscow to ramp up its attacks on Ukraine if Kyiv's officials refuse Russian demands.

Among those present at the talks were the Ukrainian defence minister, a lead advisor to the President's office and the deputy minister of foreign affairs.

Run on the Russian banks: Queues at ATMs as central bank hikes interest rate to 20% in bid to stop rouble crash Vast queues have been seen outside Russian ATMs despite the country's central bank hiking interest rates in a bid to stop a run on the rouble. Pictures show people in Saint Petersburg queuing around the corner to use nearby cash machines, as fears rise of an economic collapse due to biting Western sanctions imposed following Russia's floundering invasion of Ukraine. In a bid to stop a run on the rouble, Russia's central bank, The Bank of Russia, is hiking interest rates from 9.5 per cent to 20 per cent this morning. Its board of directors blamed a 'drastic change' on the 'external conditions for the economy' behind the massive interest rate hike. Top economists and the finance ministry also ordered exporting companies to sell 80 per cent of their foreign currency revenues on the market to try to support the rouble - the value of which continued to collapse against the dollar and the euro on the Moscow Stock Exchange on Monday. It comes as the Russian economy plummeted 30 per cent overnight to an all-time low as the West's sanctions over the Ukraine war start to squeeze the economy. The European Central Bank also warned on Monday that the European subsidiary of the Russian state-owned Sberbank - one of the Russian banks under UK sanctions - was facing bankruptcy. The dramatic changes have already seen Russians racing to cash machines and queuing for hours to try to withdraw their savings. Western nations imposed sanctions on Vladimir Putin's country after he launched a brutal war on neighbouring Ukraine last week, with the UK, US and EU cranking up restrictions in recent days. Meanwhile the Russian President's forces have so far failed to swiftly take over the country after a ferocious fightback from President Volodymyr Zelensky's troops. Advertisement

But while Ukraine sent its defence minister and other top officials, the Russian delegation was led by Putin's adviser on culture - an unlikely envoy for ending the war and perhaps a sign of how Moscow views the talks.

Russia's defence minister Sergei Shoigu has reported to Mr Putin that command posts of all of Russia's nuclear forces have been boosted with additional personnel.

The Russian defence ministry said that the high alert status applies to all components of Russian nuclear forces, the strategic missile forces that oversee land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Northern and Pacific Fleets that have submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the long-range aviation that has a fleet of nuclear-capable strategic bombers.

While the exact effect of Putin's order is unclear, it is likely to mean Russian nuclear warheads being moved close to launch systems such as missiles to allow them to be deployed at shorter notice. The two are usually stored separately to avoid the risk of a weapon accidentally being fired.

It could also mean mobile weapons being dispersed around the country to make them harder to track down and destroy, and bombs being loaded on to aircraft though not armed - again to reduce the time it would take to mount an attack.

Putin's order, while short of raising nuclear tensions to the levels seen between East and West during the Cold War, will add to fears that the war in Ukraine could rapidly escalate into a more far-reaching and devastating conflict - or that an accident could occur sparking potentially lethal consequences.

The Russian president gave the order to Shoigu on Sunday - drawing a quizzical look from his usually-stoic defence minister, who is a veteran of every Russian president since the fall of the Soviet Union.

And a senior White House official described it as 'yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step'. They said in a statement: 'At every step of this conflict, Putin has manufactured threats to justify more aggressive actions.

'He was never under threat from Ukraine or from Nato, which is a defensive alliance that will not fight in Ukraine.

'The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons.'

Max Bergmann, a former State Department official, called Putin's talk predictable but dangerous sabre-rattling. 'Things could spiral out of control,' he warned.

The Russian leader is 'potentially putting in play forces that, if there's a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous,' said a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss rapidly unfolding military operations.

Putin's directive came as Russian forces encountered strong opposition from Ukraine defenders.

Russian invasion forces seized two small cities in southeastern Ukraine and the area around a nuclear power plant, the Interfax news agency reported on Monday, but ran into stiff resistance elsewhere as Moscow's diplomatic and economic isolation deepened.

Having launched the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two, President Vladimir Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert on Sunday in the face of a barrage of Western-led reprisals for his war on Ukraine.

Blasts were heard before dawn on Monday in the capital of Kyiv and in the major city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian authorities said. But, Russian ground forces' attempts to capture major urban centres had been repelled, they added.

Russia's defence ministry, however, said its forces had taken over the towns of Berdyansk and Enerhodar in Ukraine's southeastern Zaporizhzhya region as well as the area around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, Interfax reported. The plant's operations continued normally, it said.

Ukraine denied that the nuclear plant had fallen into Russian hands, according to the news agency.

As Western governments mustered more support for sanctions against Moscow, diplomatic manoeuvring continued with the Vatican joining efforts to end the conflict by offering to 'facilitate dialogue' between Russia and Ukraine.

Ukraine said negotiations with Moscow without preconditions would be held at the Belarusian-Ukrainian border. Russian news agency Tass cited an unidentified source as saying the talks would start on Monday morning.

Liz Truss will launch savage broadside at Russian leader and accuse him of 'murdering Ukrainians indiscriminately' in UN address Vladimir Putin has 'blood on his hands', Liz Truss will say on Tuesday at a UN summit. In a speech in Geneva, the Foreign Secretary will condemn Putin's brutal tactics and accuse him of 'murdering Ukrainians indiscriminately'. Miss Truss will say: 'The consequences of Vladimir Putin's unjustified aggression are horrific. 'Russian troops are laying siege to once peaceful cities. Tanks are tearing through towns while missiles barrage homes and hospitals. 'Putin is murdering Ukrainians indiscriminately. There is blood on his hands, not just of innocent Ukrainians but the men he sent to die.' She will hint at potential war crimes prosecutions, accusing the Russian president of 'violating international law, including the UN Charter'. The Foreign Secretary will continue: 'He is violating human rights on an industrial scale and the world will not stand for it. 'There are no shades of grey. It is about right and wrong. This is Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war against a sovereign nation.' Advertisement

U.S. President Joe Biden was to host a call with allies and partners on Monday to coordinate a united response, the White House said.

The United States said Putin was escalating the war with 'dangerous rhetoric' about Russia's nuclear posture, amid signs Russian forces were preparing to besiege major cities in the democratic country of about 44 million people.

British defence minister Ben Wallace said that he does not expect Russian President Vladimir Putin to use nuclear weapons.

As missiles rained down, nearly 400,000 civilians, mainly women and children, have fled into neighbouring countries, a U.N. relief agency said.

A senior U.S. defence official said Russia had fired more than 350 missiles at Ukrainian targets since it launched the invasion last week, some hitting civilian infrastructure.

'It appears that they are adopting a siege mentality, which any student of military tactics and strategy will tell you, when you adopt siege tactics, it increases the likelihood of collateral damage,' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson by telephone on Sunday that the next 24 hours would be crucial for Ukraine, a Downing Street spokesperson said.

So far, the Russian offensive cannot claim any major victories. Russia has not taken any Ukrainian city, does not control Ukraine's airspace, and its troops remained roughly 19 miles from Kyiv's city centre for a second day, the official said.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a 'special operation' that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

Western-led political, strategic, economic and corporate sanctions were unprecedented in their extent and coordination, and there were further pledges of military support for Ukraine's badly outgunned armed forces.

The rouble plunged nearly 30% to an all-time low versus the dollar, after Western nations on Saturday unveiled harsh sanctions including blocking some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system.

China's foreign ministry voiced disapproval of the use of sanctions, saying it opposed unilateral, illegal action. Regarding Putin's order to put its nuclear deterrent on high alert, it said that all sides should remain calm and avoid escalation. Japan and South Korea said they would join in the action to block some banks from SWIFT. South Korea, a major exporter of semiconductors, said it would also ban exports of strategic items to Russia.

Singapore, a financial and shipping hub, said it intended to impose sanctions and restrictions on Russia, the Straits Times newspaper reported.

Japan said it was also considering imposing sanctions against some individuals in Belarus, a key staging area for the Russian invasion.

A referendum in Belarus on Sunday approved a new constitution ditching the country's non-nuclear status.

In the Baltic state of Latvia, the parliament gave its blessing to any citizen who wanted to fight in Ukraine against the Russian invaders.

Several European subsidiaries of Sberbank Russia, majority owned by the Russian government, were failing or were likely to fail due to the reputational cost of the war in Ukraine, the European Central Bank said.

Britain said on Monday it was taking further measures against Russia in concert with the United States and European Union, effectively cutting off Moscow's major financial institutions from Western markets.

Russia's central bank scrambled to manage the broadening fallout of the sanctions saying it would resume buying gold on the domestic market, launch a repurchase auction with no limits and ease restrictions on banks' open foreign currency positions.

It also ordered brokers to block attempt by foreigners to sell Russian securities.

That could complicate plans by the sovereign wealth funds of Norway and Australia, which said they planned to wind down their exposure to Russian-listed companies.

Corporate giants also took action, with British oil major BP BP, the biggest foreign investor in Russia, saying it would abandon its stake in state oil company Rosneft at a cost of up to $25 billion.

The European Union on Sunday decided for the first time in its history to supply weapons to a country at war, pledging arms including fighter jets to Ukraine.

Germany, which had already frozen a planned undersea gas pipeline from Russia, said it would increase defence spending massively, casting off decades of reluctance to match its economic power with military clout.

EU Chief Executive Ursula von der Leyen expressed support for Ukraine's membership in an interview with Euronews, saying 'they are one of us.'

The EU shut all Russian planes out of its airspace, as did Canada, forcing Russian airline Aeroflot to cancel all flights to European destinations until further notice. The United States and France urged their citizens to consider leaving Russia immediately.

The EU also banned the Russian media outlets RT and Sputnik.

In New York, the U.N. Security Council convened a rare emergency meeting of the U.N. General Assembly, or all the United Nations' 193 member states, for Monday.

Rolling protests have been held around the world against the invasion, including in Russia, where almost 6,000 people have been detained at anti-war protests since Thursday, the OVD-Info protest monitor said.

Tens of thousands of people across Europe marched in protest, including more than 100,000 in Berlin.

Nearly, 71,000 Ukrainians had crossed into Romania since the invasion began, a Romanian government spokesman said.

Meta Platforms said it had removed a network of about 40 fake accounts, groups and pages across Facebook and Instagram that operated from Russia and Ukraine targeting public figures in Ukraine, for violating its rules against coordinated inauthentic behaviour.

Twitter said it had also suspended more than a dozen accounts and blocked the sharing of several links for violating its rules against platform manipulation and spam.

Moscow has so far failed to win full control of Ukraine's airspace, despite advances across the country. U.S. officials say they believe the invasion has been more difficult, and slower, than the Kremlin envisioned, though that could change as Moscow adapts.

The conflict - seemingly more quiet overnight Sunday than in past nights - could evolve significantly if Russia gets military help from neighboring Belarus, which is expected to send troops into Ukraine as soon as Monday, according to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of current U.S. intelligence assessments who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to speak publicly.

The official said that whether Belarus enters the war depends on Ukraine-Russia talks set to happen in coming days.

Amid the mounting pressure, Western nations said they would tighten sanctions and buy and deliver weapons for Ukraine, including Stinger missiles for shooting down helicopters and other aircraft. European countries will also supply fighter jets to Ukraine, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, meanwhile, announced plans for a meeting with a Russian delegation at an unspecified location on the Belarusian border.

It wasn't immediately clear when the meeting would take place, nor what the Kremlin was ultimately seeking, either in those potential talks on the border or, more broadly, from its war in Ukraine. Western officials believe Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine's government and replace it with a regime of his own, reviving Moscow's Cold War-era influence.

The fast-moving developments came as scattered fighting was reported in Kyiv. Battles also broke out in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, and strategic ports in the country's south came under assault from Russian forces.

By late Sunday, Russian forces had taken Berdyansk, a Ukrainian city of 100,000 on the Azov Sea coast, according to Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to Zelenskyy's office. Russian troops also made advances toward Kherson, another city in the south of Ukraine, while Mariupol, a port city on the Sea of Azov that is considered a prime Russian target, is 'hanging on,' Arestovich said.

With Russian troops closing in around Kyiv, a city of almost 3 million, the mayor of the capital expressed doubt that civilians could be evacuated. Authorities have been handing out weapons to anyone willing to defend the city. Ukraine is also releasing prisoners with military experience who want to fight, and training people to make firebombs.

In Mariupol, where Ukrainians were trying to fend off attack, a medical team at a city hospital desperately tried to revive a 6-year-old girl in unicorn pajamas who was mortally wounded in Russian shelling.

During the rescue attempt, a doctor in blue medical scrubs, pumping oxygen into the girl, looked directly into the Associated Press video camera capturing the scene.

'Show this to Putin,' he said angrily. 'The eyes of this child, and crying doctors.'

Their resuscitation efforts failed, and the girl lay dead on a gurney, her jacket spattered with blood.

Nearly 900 kilometers (560 miles) away, Faina Bystritska was under threat in the city of Chernihiv.

'I wish I had never lived to see this,' said Bystritska, an 87-year-old Jewish survivor of World War II. She said sirens blare almost constantly in the city, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) from Kyiv.

Chernihiv residents have been told not to switch on any lights 'so we don't draw their attention,' said Bystritska, who has been living in a hallway, away from any windows, so she could better protect herself.

'The window glass constantly shakes, and there is this constant thundering noise,' she said.

Meanwhile, the top official in the EU outlined plans by the 27-nation bloc to close its airspace to Russian airlines and buy weapons for Ukraine. The EU will also ban some pro-Kremlin media outlets, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The U.S. also stepped up the flow of weapons to Ukraine, announcing it will send Stinger missiles as part of a package approved by the White House on Friday. Germany likewise plans to send 500 Stingers and other military supplies.

Also, the 193-member U.N. General Assembly scheduled an emergency session Monday on Russia's invasion.

Putin, in ordering the nuclear alert, cited not only statements by NATO members but the hard-hitting financial sanctions imposed by the West against Russia, including Putin himself.

'Western countries aren't only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country,' Putin said in televised comments.

U.S. defense officials would not disclose their current nuclear alert level except to say that the military is prepared all times to defend its homeland and allies.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told ABC that Putin is resorting to the pattern he used in the weeks before the invasion, 'which is to manufacture threats that don't exist in order to justify further aggression.'

The practical meaning of Putin's order was not immediately clear. Russia and the United States typically have land- and submarine-based nuclear forces that are on alert and prepared for combat at all times, but nuclear-capable bombers and other aircraft are not.

In Kyiv, terrified residents hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault. Food and medicine were running low, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

'Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,' Klitschko said.

In downtown Kharkiv, 86-year-old Olena Dudnik said she and her husband were nearly thrown from their bed by the pressure blast of a nearby explosion.

'We are suffering immensely,' she said by phone. 'We don't have much food in the pantry, and I worry the stores aren't going to have anything either, if they reopen.' She added: 'I just want the shooting to stop, people to stop being killed.'

Russia's failure thus far to win full control of Ukraine's airspace is a surprising lapse that has given outgunned Ukrainian forces a chance to slow the advance of Russian ground forces. Normally, gaining what the military calls air superiority is one of the first priorities for an invading force.

But even though Russian troops are being slowed by Ukrainian resistance, fuel shortages and other logistical problems, a senior U.S. defense official said that will probably change. 'We are in day four. The Russians will learn and adapt,' the official said.

The number of casualties from Europe's largest land conflict since World War II remained unclear amid the confusion.

Ukraine's Interior Ministry said Sunday that 352 Ukrainian civilians have been killed, including 14 children. It said an additional 1,684 people, including 116 children, have been wounded.

Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov gave no figures on Russia's dead and wounded but said Sunday his country's losses were 'many times' lower than Ukraine's.

Along with military assistance, the U.S., European Union and Britain also agreed to block selected Russian banks from the SWIFT system, which moves money around thousands of banks and other financial institutions worldwide.

Russia's economy has taken a pounding since the invasion, with the ruble plunging and the central bank calling for calm to avoid bank runs.

The Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine added that it was unable to visually inspect the site because of military activity in the city.

Ukraine is one of the major transmission routes for Russian gas to Europe. Concerns about a disruption from fighting or by intent have driven European gas prices to high levels, putting pressure on consumers and energy-intensive businesses.

Even before the fighting, Russian gas flows through Ukraine had dropped as Gazprom, the Russian monopoly, kept volumes low by historical standards.

Chris Cassidy, a British expat who lives in Kharkiv, said he saw the rocket in flight from his window before it struck.

Mr Cassidy, a football agent, left the city with his wife Yulia and their eight-year-old daughter immediately afterwards.

""At first I heard it – it was like a jumbo jet,"" he said. ""I was standing in the window and I hear this screeching noise and I see it coming at me. Our room was on the fifth floor and I thought it was coming straight for us.

""It came from nowhere and no one was expecting it because most of the fighting had been on the ring road. It screamed past the window and then there was just this massive boom. The building was shaking.""

Six dead and at least 20 wounded were later pulled from the rubble.

Later, heavy rocket barrages rained down on Kharkiv, lighting up the night sky as they hit residential areas at the end of the city's fifth day under artillery attack.

Unconfirmed footage also showed a gigantic explosion that threw up a mushroom cloud across Kharkiv in what observers said may have been a Russian strike on an ammunition base.

For the residents of the eastern city, close to Russia's border, the barrage heralded another day of shelling – and for the world perhaps a glimpse of what to expect as the tactics of Vladimir Putin's frustrated forces become more aggressive.

7,90729f4b-1ed6-4ea3-8b58-2ce806abd884,[],2022-02-27 00:00:00,"Missiles hit an oil facility near Kyiv and a gas pipeline in Kharkiv as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine intensifies.

Russia has unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine, targeting fuel facilities and airfields in what appears to be the next phase of an invasion that has been slowed by fierce resistance.

Huge explosions lit up the sky early on Sunday south of the capital, Kyiv, where people hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations and the government maintained a 39-hour curfew in anticipation of a full-scale assault by Russian forces.

Flames billowed into the sky before dawn from an oil depot near an airbase in Vasylkiv, near Kyiv, where there has been intense fighting, according to the town’s mayor. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office said another explosion was at the civilian Zhuliany Airport.

Zelenskyy’s office also said Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, prompting the government to warn people to protect themselves from the smoke by covering their windows with damp cloth or gauze.

“We will fight for as long as needed to liberate our country,” Zelenskyy said.

The curfew in Kyiv is set to last through Monday morning. The relative quiet of the capital was sporadically broken by gunfire.

Russian-backed separatists in the eastern province of Luhansk said a Ukrainian missile had blown up an oil terminal in the town of Rovenky.

More than 150,000 Ukrainians have fled for Poland, Moldova and other neighbouring countries, and the United Nations warned the number could grow to four million if fighting escalates.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has not disclosed his ultimate goal, but Western officials believe he is determined to overthrow Ukraine’s government and replace it with a regime of his own, redrawing the map of Europe and reviving Moscow’s Cold War-era influence.

To help Ukraine resist, the US pledged an additional $350m in military assistance, including anti-tank weapons, body armour and small arms. Germany said it would send missiles and anti-tank weapons to the besieged country and that it would close its airspace to Russian planes.

Meanwhile, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States have agreed to block “selected” Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system, which moves money between banks and other financial institutions worldwide, part of a new round of sanctions aiming to impose a severe cost on Moscow for the invasion. They also agreed to impose ”restrictive measures” on Russia’s central bank.

It is unclear how much territory Russian forces have seized or to what extent their advance has been stalled. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said: “The speed of the Russian advance has temporarily slowed, likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.”

Fighting on the city’s outskirts suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces. Small groups of Russian troops were reported inside Kyiv, but Britain and the US said the bulk of the forces were 30km (19 miles) from the city’s centre as of Saturday afternoon.

Russia claims its assault on Ukraine from the north, east and south is aimed only at military targets, but bridges, schools and residential neighbourhoods have been hit.

Ukraine’s health minister reported Saturday that 198 people, including three children, had been killed and more than 1,000 others wounded. It was unclear whether those figures included both military and civilian casualties.

Ukraine’s ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, said troops in Kyiv were fighting Russian “sabotage groups.” Ukraine says some 200 Russian soldiers have been captured and thousands killed.

Markarova said Ukraine was gathering evidence of shelling of residential areas, kindergartens and hospitals to submit to The Hague as possible crimes against humanity.

Putin sent troops into Ukraine after denying for weeks that he intended to do so, all the while building up a force of nearly 200,000 troops along the countries’ borders.

He claims the West has failed to take seriously Russia’s security concerns about NATO, the Western military alliance that Ukraine aspires to join. But he has also expressed scorn about Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent state.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/27/russia-ukraine-oil-gas-fuel-airport-attacks
