On the same day, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian legislature) approved the presidential decree allowing imposition of the legal regime of martial law for a period of 30 days. (Decree art. 1.)

The presidential decree said that the decision had been proposed by the Council of National Defense and Security of Ukraine because of the military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The decree is in accordance with article 106, paragraph 20 of the Constitution of Ukraine and with the Law of Ukraine on the Legal Regime of Martial Law. (Art. 2.)

According to the decree, the military command, together with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, other national and regional executive authorities, and local self-government bodies, must ensure Ukraine’s defense, public safety, and state interests as prescribed by the Law on the Legal Regime of Martial Law.

The decree requires the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine to start implementing measures of the Law on the Legal Regime of Martial Law and provide appropriate funding. (Art. 2.)

The decree mandates the State Emergency Service to work with regional state administrations and other government bodies, institutions, enterprises, and organizations of all forms of ownership on ensuring that the unified state civil protection system is functioning properly. (Art. 2.)

The decree also assigns the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform the U.N. Secretary-General and foreign officials of the imposition of martial law in Ukraine; restrictions on human and civil rights and freedoms, which is a deviation from the commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and the limit of these deviations and the reasons for such a decision. (Art. 7.)

Provisions of the Law

The Law on the Legal Regime of Martial Law, which was passed in 2015, regulates the mechanism of imposing temporary restrictions on the constitutional rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests of individuals and legal entities. (Law on the Legal Regime of Martial Law art. 1(1).) The special legal regime converts civilian authorities into military administrations at all levels of government. These military administrations are to include state emergency personnel, representatives of law enforcement agencies, and leaders of military formations located in the territory of the region or district. For military purposes, these administrations are subordinated to the chief of staff of the Ukrainian armed forces; for all other issues they are to follow orders issued by the Cabinet of Ministers. (Art. 4.) The president of Ukraine remains the head of the state and conducts strategic oversight of the armed forces during the period of martial law. (Art. 11.) The legislature cannot be dissolved during the legal regime of martial law. If the term of the Verkhovna Rada expires during the period of martial law, it continues its work until a new legislature is elected after the martial law regime is cancelled. (Art. 12.)

The imposition of military control over the country envisages the call of capable citizens for public works in support of the armed forces, other military formations, law enforcement, and civic protection, if the citizens were not mobilized for defense activities or reserved as essential employees for enterprises. The law allows the government to use the capacities and workforce resources of public and private enterprises for defense needs. A curfew can be ordered, and individuals may be subjected to a “special screening regime.” (Art. 8, paras. 1–6.)

This “screening regime” allows for restricting freedom of movement; conducting stricter ID checks; and inspecting belongings, vehicles, luggage, cargo, and residential and business premises. (Art. 8, paras. 6–10.) During the period of martial law, amending the Constitution, conducting referendums, organizing strikes, and holding public demonstrations and other mass gatherings are prohibited. (Art. 19.) Among other measures, the law gives the government the right to control the media; ban the sale of weapons, alcoholic beverages, and other toxic substances; regulate the production of medicines; and seize radioactive materials. (Art. 8, paras. 11–15.)

The law prohibits male citizens of Ukraine ages 18–60 from leaving their place of permanent residency without the approval of the local military administration. (Art. 8, para. 16.)

On February 23, 2022, before the invocation of martial law, the Ukrainian parliament approved a declaration of a state of emergency in the entire territory of Ukraine, except for the two eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

The move to declare a state of emergency came after the president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, signed decrees recognizing the two secessionist regions in eastern Ukraine as independent states.",https://www.loc.gov/item/global-legal-monitor/2022-03-03/ukraine-martial-law-introduced-in-response-to-russian-invasion/

Associated Press, CNN

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ordered a full military mobilization to counter the Russian invasion.

Explosions have been heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv as Russian forces continued their assault Thursday night.

In a decree issued Thursday, Zelensky said the the mobilization would last 90 days.

He tasked the military’s general staff with determining the number of people eligible for service and the number of reservists as well as the order of the call-up. The president’s cabinet has been tasked with allocating money for the mobilization.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order. Ukraine’s government pleaded for help as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee.

Scores of Ukrainians, civilians and service members alike, were killed in the first full day of fighting, and the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv appeared to be increasingly threatened. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the government had information that “subversive groups” were encroaching on the city, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege.”

What’s happened so far:

Russian troops launched a broad assault on Ukraine from three sides on Thursday, an attack that began with explosions before dawn in the capital Kyiv and other cities.

President Joe Biden on Thursday announced a new round of sanctions targeting Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, charging that Russian leader Vladimir Putin “chose this war” and that his country will bear the consequences of his action.

The Russian Defense Ministry has confirmed that its ground forces have moved into Ukraine from Crimea, the first confirmation from Moscow that its ground forces have moved in.

Ukraine’s health minister said at least 57 Ukrainians have been killed and 169 more wounded.

Shocked Russians turned out by the thousands to decry the invasion and emotional calls for protests grew on social media.

A presidential adviser says Ukraine lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site, where Ukrainian forces had waged a fierce battle with Russian troops.

NATO has agreed to beef up its land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank near Ukraine and Russia.

In a televised address as the attack began, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would “lead to consequences you have never seen in history.”

World leaders Thursday condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “barbaric” and moved to slap unprecedented economic sanctions on Moscow and those close to President Vladimir Putin.

Stocks tumbled worldwide Thursday after Russia’s attack of Ukraine sent fear coursing through markets and upped the pressure on the high inflation already hurting people and businesses around the world. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 tumbled 2.6% at the open of trading before erasing the drop and flipping to a gain of 0.6%. The heaviest losses hit stocks in Europe.

Russia’s expanding invasion of Ukraine has opened a new and perilous chapter in Joe Biden’s presidency, testing his aspirations to defend democracy on a global level and thrusting him into a long-term struggle to restore European security.

It’s a far different trajectory than he imagined when his administration began last year with the goals of countering China’s growing influence in the world and reinvesting at home as the United States tried to turn the page on a deadly pandemic.",https://www.koamnewsnow.com/i/ukraine-orders-full-military-mobilization-to-counter-russian-invasion/

According to the decree, this decision was taken due to “Russian military operation against Ukraine and ensuring the defense of the state, maintaining the combat readiness and mobilization of the Ukrainian armed forces and auxiliary military formations.”

Also, Daniil Menshikov, head of the Border Guard Service in Lvov announced that males between the ages of 18 and 60 were banned from leaving the country.

“Due to the state of war, Ukrainian males between the ages of 18 and 60 will not be allowed to leave the country. Please do not panic and do not try to cross the border without permission,” Menshikov wrote on Facebook.

In a speech to the Ukrainians after midnight, Zelensky, who appeared gloomy, said that “enemy sabotage groups have entered Kiev” and urged residents to be vigilant and adhere to the rules of the curfew.

On Thursday, Zelensky announced the imposition of emergency law across Ukraine after the start of the Russian military operation in his country.
