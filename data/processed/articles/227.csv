The mayor of Kiyv says a missile has hit an apartment building in Ukraine’s capital, as fighting between Ukrainian and invading Russian forces raged – but no deaths or injuries were immediately reported.

Vitali Klitschko said emergency and rescue services had rushed to the scene after the missile slammed into the residential tower block on the southwestern outskirts of Kyiv, near Zhuliany airport, on Saturday.

He posted an image on a messaging app, showing a gaping hole on one side of the building that ravaged apartments on several storeys.

Klitschko urged Kyiv residents to stay in shelters. “The enemy will attack from the air,” he warned.

Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons said the high-rise structure was one of the “many buildings” that were hit overnight.

“The levels of violence raining down from the sky, through the streets of this city, it’s reaching its highest level,” he said. “Crescendos of sounds, crescendos of fear,” he added, as “the clock is ticking on the next stage of this Russian invasion, which is an attempt to take the capital.”

The Russian military said on Saturday it had targeted Ukraine’s military infrastructure using cruise missiles fired from the air and sea.

Russia has repeatedly insisted its assault on Ukraine is aimed only at military targets.

“Let me stress once again that only infrastructure sites of the Ukrainian Armed Forces are being targeted, ruling out damage to residential and social infrastructure,” Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told a briefing on Saturday.

‘Another night under attacks’

Meanwhile, Klitschko said that as of 6am local time (04:00 GMT), 35 people, including two children, had been wounded in overnight fighting. It was not clear if he was referring only to civilians.

He insisted that there were no regular Russian troops in Kyiv, but said they were trying to enter from several directions and added that saboteur groups were “active”.

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, posted a picture on Twitter of the damaged apartment block.

“Kyiv, our splendid, peaceful city, survived another night under attacks by Russian ground forces, missiles. One of them has hit a residential apartment in Kyiv,” he wrote.

He called on the international community to “fully isolate Russia, expel ambassadors, (introduce an) oil embargo, ruin its economy”.

Street fighting has broken out in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, as Russian forces advanced on the city and Ukrainian officials urged residents to take shelter.

As dawn broke in Kyiv on Saturday, it was not immediately clear how far the soldiers had advanced. Ukrainian officials reported success in fending off assaults, but fighting persisted near the capital. Skirmishes reported on the edge of the city of nearly three million people suggested that small Russian units were probing Ukrainian defences to clear a path for the main forces.

Saturday marked the third day of a massive land, sea and air invasion ordered by President Vladimir Putin in what turned out to be Russia’s biggest military deployment since World War II and has resulted in hundreds of casualties.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy refused an American offer for him to evacuate, insisting that he would stay in Kyiv. “The fight is here,” he said on Saturday.

Zelenskyy renewed assurances that the country’s military would stand up to the Russian invasion and said that claims that the Ukrainian military would put down arms were false.

“We aren’t going to lay down weapons. We will protect the country,” he said. “Our weapon is our truth, and our truth is that it’s our land, our country, our children. And we will defend all of that.”

Vitali Klitschko, Kyiv’s mayor, said on Saturday that Russian troops had so far been prevented from entering the city by Ukrainian forces that included military police, national guards and volunteers.

“Now subversive groups are acting in Kyiv, there were several clashes, firefights,” he said.

“As of 6am, 35 people were wounded, including two children. I ask everyone to keep calm, and stay in shelters. The enemy will attack from the air.”

The street clashes followed Russian strikes that pummelled bridges, schools and apartment buildings.

A missile that struck a residential building in Kyiv on Saturday did not kill anyone, an adviser to the interior minister said. Anton Herashchenko also said Russia was lying about not shelling civilian infrastructure. According to the adviser, at least 40 such sites had been hit and Russian troops were shelling civilian sites.

“It was an extraordinarily awful night,” said Al Jazeera’s Andrew Simmons, reporting from the capital. “Missiles just raining down on Kyiv, ballistic missiles shuddering the city and relentless bombardments by the air force of the Russian Federation.”

He said that there was fighting across the country, but in the capital “the force of the conflict has reached a seismic level”.

“The trauma, the pain is just so immeasurable, very hard to narrate what has been happening,” Simmons added.

He said many civilians sought refuge in underground shelters, as Kyiv officials urged residents to take shelter, to stay away from windows and to take precautions to avoid flying debris or bullets. Klitschko said that the city’s critical infrastructure and the metro were working and that checkpoints had been set up around Kyiv.

Zelenskyy has also urged Ukrainian citizens to defend the country and said that weapons would be given to everyone coming forward. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since Thursday, Ukrainian authorities said.

The defence ministry also told Kyiv residents to make petrol bombs to repel the Russian attacks.

“Wherever you go, whoever you speak to, there are stories of bravery of people committed to trying to repel an overwhelming force,” Simmons said.

“It’s very terrifying, but we are coping,” a young boy, sitting in a shelter underground next to his mother, told Al Jazeera. “I am sure in about a few days it should be fine, it should settle a little bit”.

It was unclear how many people overall had died in the largest ground war in Europe since World War II.

Health Minister Viktor Lyashko said on Saturday that 198 Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed during the Russian invasion. A further 1,115 people have been wounded, including 33 children, he wrote on his Facebook page.

His statement did not make it clear whether the figures included both military personnel and civilians.

Ukrainian officials said earlier that more than 3,500 Russian soldiers have been killed. Al Jazeera could not independently verify casualty figures.

Russian authorities released no casualty figures.

United Nations officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and air strikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes. They estimate that up to five million could flee if the fighting escalates.

On Friday, the train station in the capital was packed with masses of people trying to find a way to leave the city.

In an interview with NBC Nightly News, Blinken said Putin's goal all along was to ""get Ukraine back into his orbit"" and to ""subjugate countries on his border to his will.""

When asked by NBC's Lester Holt if Russia could directly threaten NATO countries, Blinken reiterated U.S. commitment to Article Five of NATO's founding treaty. A cornerstone of the 30-member alliance is the principle of collective defense, known as Article 5, which states that an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all allies.

To date, the alliance has only invoked Article 5 once — in defense of the United States in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Holt also asked about the new round of White House sanctions that President Joe Biden said would ""exceed anything that's ever been done.""

Blinken responded, ""If President Putin decided to pursue the path of diplomacy and dialogue, we were ready for that and prepared to engage on that, but equally if he pursued the path of aggression, which tragically is exactly what he's done, we're prepared on that too and as a result, we have responded in a united way, swiftly and with real consequence to impose very severe costs on Russia for the aggression it's committing on Ukraine.""

Evacuation of civilians - whether by the state or self-organised - does not appear to be safe. Reports of civilians targeted in their cars or on the pavements come from the different regions of Ukraine. In Mariupol, the evacuation collapsed twice as Russian shelling did not stop - according to the Ukrainian authorities.

Many families in Ukraine and abroad are looking for their loved ones in towns like Mariupol, Irpen, Hostomel, Bucha, Sumy, Chernihiv but can't reach them. There is no light, heating or running water in most of those areas. Reports reveal civilians lacking drinking water, food and medication. The mayor of the town of Izum near Odesa reports that its centre has been essentially destroyed.

1.5 million refugees have now left the country, while many others are looking for safe corridors to be able to do so.

Western allies to kick major Russia banks off SWIFT system

Russia says its forces advancing 'on all sides'

KYIV, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Western allies announced sweeping new sanctions against Moscow on Saturday, including kicking key Russian banks off the main global payments system, as a defiant President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces were repelling Russian troops advancing on Kyiv.

Seeking to ratchet up economic punishment for Russian President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine, the United States and its European partners also said they would impose restrictions on Russia's central bank to limit its ability to support the rouble and finance his war effort.

The announcement came as fighting continued across Ukraine. Reuters witnesses in Kyiv reported occasional blasts and gunfire in the city on Saturday evening, but it was not clear exactly where it was coming from. The capital and other cities have been pounded by Russian artillery and cruise missiles.

Putin launched what he called a special military operation on Thursday, ignoring weeks of Western warnings and saying the ""neo-Nazis"" ruling Ukraine threatened Russia's security - a charge Kyiv and Western governments say is baseless propaganda.

Russia's assault is the biggest on a European state since World War Two and threatens to upend the continent's post-Cold War order.

A U.S. defence official said Ukraine's forces were putting up ""very determined resistance"" to the three-pronged Russian advance that has sent hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing westwards, clogging major highways and railway lines.

""As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies,"" the Western allies said as they escalated their punitive response.

""We will implement these measures within the coming days,"" according to a joint statement from the United States, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Britain and the European Commission. read more

After initially shying away from such a move largely because of concern about the impact on their own economies, the allies said they committed to ""ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system."" They did not name the banks that would be expelled but an EU diplomat said some 70% of the Russian banking market would be affected.

The move - which the French finance minister had earlier called a ""financial nuclear weapon"" because of the damage it would inflict on the Russian economy - deals a blow to Russia's trade and makes it harder for its companies to do business.

SWIFT, or the ""Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication"", is a secure messaging network that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making it a crucial mechanism for international trade.

Sanctions on Russia's central bank could limit Putin's use of his more than $630 billion in international reserves, widely seen as insulating Russia from some economic harm.

The new measures will prevent Russia from ""using its war chest,"" according to Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the European Union's executive.

'THE FIGHTING GOES ON'

Clay Lowery, executive vice president for the Institute of International Finance, said the new sanctions ""will most likely exacerbate ongoing bank runs and dollarization, causing a sharp sell-off, and a drain on reserves.""

But because Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, new sanctions imposed on them, such as cutting them off from SWIFT, could have a spillover effect, hurting trading partners in Europe and elsewhere.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said in a Twitter post early on Sunday: ""Thanks to our friends ... for the commitment to remove several Russian banks from SWIFT.""

The Kremlin said its troops were advancing again ""in all directions"" after Putin ordered a pause on Friday. Ukraine's government said there had been no pause.

""We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on,"" Zelenskiy said in a video message from the streets of Kyiv posted on his social media.

The crisis has galvanised the NATO Western military alliance, which has announced a series of moves to reinforce its eastern flank. While NATO has said it will not deploy troops to Ukraine, a string of countries are sending military aid.

U.S. President Joe Biden approved the release of up to $350 million worth of weapons from U.S. stocks, while Germany, in a shift from its long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones, said it would send anti-tank weapons and surface-to-air missiles. read more

Amid a barrage of cyberattacks blamed on Moscow, Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said his government will create an ""IT army"" to fight back. Kyiv already has quietly called on its hacker underground to help against Russian forces, Reuters exclusively reported. read more

Fedorov also called on Saturday on SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk to provide Ukraine with the company's Starlink satellite broadband service. Musk responded on Twitter: ""Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route."" read more

Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, won independence from Moscow in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union and wants to join NATO and the EU, goals Russia opposes.

Putin has said he must eliminate what he calls a serious threat to his country from its smaller neighbour, accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine - something Kyiv and its Western allies reject as a lie.

A Ukrainian presidential adviser said about 3,500 Russian soldiers had been killed or wounded. Western officials have also said intelligence showed Russia suffering higher casualties than expected and its advance slowing.

Russia has not released casualty figures and it was impossible to verify tolls or the precise picture on the ground.

""We know that (Russian forces) have not made the progress that they wanted to make, particularly in the north. They have been frustrated by what they have seen is a very determined resistance,"" the U.S. official said, without providing evidence.

Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said there was no major Russian military presence in the capital but that saboteur groups were active. Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, later told Germany's Bild tabloid the city was ""nearly encircled"".

Authorities have handed thousands of assault rifles to residents and told citizens to make petrol bombs.

At least 198 Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed and 1,115 people wounded so far, Interfax quoted Ukraine's Health Ministry as saying.

Interfax later cited the regional administration in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, saying 17 civilians had been killed and 73 wounded by Russian shelling.

Moscow says it is taking care not to hit civilian sites.

U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said more than 150,000 Ukrainian refugees have crossed into neighbouring countries - half to Poland and many to Hungary, Moldova and Romania.

Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces had captured Melitopol, a city of 150,000 in southeastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials did not comment and Britain cast doubt on the report.

If confirmed, it would be the first significant population centre the Russians have seized.

Several European countries, including Russia's Baltic neighbours Lithuania and Latvia, said they were closing their airspace to Russian airliners. read more Germany said it was preparing to follow suit.

EU and Britain to freeze assets of Putin and Lavrov

KYIV, Feb 25 (Reuters) - The Russian and Ukrainian governments on Friday signalled an openness to negotiations even as authorities in Kyiv urged citizens to help defend the capital from advancing Russian forces in the worst European security crisis in decades.

Ukraine and Russia will consult in coming hours on a time and place for talks, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's spokesman Sergii Nykyforov said on social media, offering the first glimmer of hope for diplomacy since the invasion began.

The Kremlin said earlier it offered to meet in the Belarusian capital Minsk after Ukraine expressed a willingness to discuss declaring itself a neutral country, but that Ukraine had proposed Warsaw as the venue. That, according to Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov, resulted in a ""pause"" in contacts.

""Ukraine was and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace,"" Nykyforov said in a post on Facebook. ""We agreed to the proposal of the President of the Russian Federation.""

But U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Russia's offer was an attempt to conduct diplomacy ""at the barrel of a gun"", and that President Vladimir Putin's military must stop bombing Ukraine if it was serious about negotiations.

The diplomatic overtures stood in stark contrast to events unfolding on the ground and Putin's harsh rhetoric against Ukrainian leaders, including a call for a coup by the country's military.

Kyiv residents were told by the defence ministry to make petrol bombs to repel the invaders, and on Friday evening witnesses reported hearing artillery rounds and intense gunfire from the western part of the city. The sound of frequent artillery fire, apparently some distance from the city center, continued in the early hours of Saturday.

Zelenskiy filmed himself with aides on the streets of the capital, vowing to defend Ukraine's independence.

""Tonight, they will launch an assault. All of us must understand what awaits us. We must withstand this night,"" he said in a video address posted to his Telegram channel. ""The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.""

Some families cowered in shelters after Kyiv was pounded on Thursday night by Russian missiles. Others tried desperately to get on packed trains headed west, some of the hundreds of thousands who have left their homes to find safety, according to the United Nations' aid chief.

After weeks of warnings from Western leaders, Putin unleashed a three-pronged invasion of Ukraine from the north, east and south on Thursday, in an attack that threatened to upend Europe's post-Cold War order.

""I once again appeal to the military personnel of the armed forces of Ukraine: do not allow neo-Nazis and (Ukrainian radical nationalists) to use your children, wives and elders as human shields,"" Putin said at a televised meeting with Russia's Security Council on Friday. ""Take power into your own hands.""

Putin has cited the need to ""denazify"" Ukraine's leadership as one of his main reasons for invasion, accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss the accusations as baseless propaganda.

The United States imposed sanctions on Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov. The European Union and Britain earlier froze any assets Putin and Lavrov held in their territory. Canada took similar steps.

However, the steady ramping-up of economic restrictions has not deterred Putin.

Moscow said on Friday it had captured the Hostomel airfield northwest of the capital - a potential staging post for an assault on Kyiv that has been fought over since Russian paratroopers landed there in the first hours of the war. This could not be confirmed and Ukrainian authorities reported heavy fighting there.

Early on Saturday, Ukraine's air force command reported heavy fighting near the air base at Vasylkiv southwest of Kyiv, which it said was under attack from Russian paratroopers. It also said one of its fighters had shot down a Russian transport plane. Reuters could not independently verify the claims.

The mayor of Kyiv and its 3 million people, former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said on Friday Russian saboteurs had already entered the city. ""The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us,"" he said.

'GLORY TO OUR DEFENDERS'

In New York, Russia vetoed a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would have deplored Moscow's invasion, while China abstained, a move Western countries viewed as proof of Russia's isolation. The United Arab Emirates and India also abstained while the remaining 11 members voted in favor. read more

Amid the chaos of war, a picture of what was happening on the ground across Ukraine - the second largest country in Europe after Russia itself - was slow to emerge.

Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter that there had been heavy fighting with deaths at the entrance to the eastern cities of Chernihiv and Melitopol, as well as at Hostomel.

""Glory to our defenders, both male and female, glory to Ukraine,"" he said, flanked by the prime minister and advisors in a video posted to confirm he was in the capital.

Witnesses said they had heard explosions and gunfire near the airport in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, close to Russia's border. Ukraine's military said Russian troops had been stopped with heavy losses near the northeastern city of Konotop.

Britain's defence ministry said Russian armoured forces had opened a new route of advance towards the capital after failing to take Chernihiv.

Ukraine said more than 1,000 Russian soldiers had been killed so far. Russia did not release casualty figures.

Russia's foreign ministry said the new sanctions reflected the West's ""absolute impotence,"" the RIA news agency reported.

Western countries have announced a barrage of sanctions on Russia, including blacklisting its banks and banning technology exports. But they have so far stopped short of forcing it out of the SWIFT system for international bank payments.

'BURN IN HELL'

U.S. officials believe Russia's initial aim is to ""decapitate"" Zelenskiy's government.

Putin says Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, is an illegitimate state carved out of Russia, a view Ukrainians see as aimed at erasing their more than thousand-year history.

He says he does not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and remove its leaders, but it is not clear how a pro-Russian leader could be installed unless Russian troops control much of the country.

Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and Kyiv hopes to join NATO and the EU - aspirations that infuriate Moscow.

As air raid sirens wailed over Kyiv for a second day, some residents sheltered in underground metro stations.

Windows were blasted out of a 10-storey apartment block near the main airport. ""How can we be living through this in our time? Putin should burn in hell along with his whole family,"" said Oxana Gulenko, sweeping broken glass from her room.

Hundreds crowded into a cramped shelter beneath one building after a televised warning of air strikes.

""How can you wage a war against peaceful people?"" said Viktoria, 35, as her children aged 5 and 7 slept in their winter coats.

Zelenskyy calls on EU to 'do more' after member states refuse to fast-track Ukraine's application to be a member

In a Friday video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed European Union leaders for refusing to fast-track Ukraine's application to join the bloc and called on them to ""do more.""

Leaders of the 27 EU member states met in Versailles, France, on Thursday, and ultimately concluded that the bloc would not speed up Ukraine's application.

Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland were in favor, while France, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands were not, The Guardian reported. Accession to the EU typically takes multiple years.

Zelenskyy said on Friday: ""A very important meeting of the leaders of the European Union took place yesterday ... We know what was said at this meeting. What all leaders said. Who specifically spoke. Who supported. Who remained silent.""

""How do we evaluate the decision made? It's very simple: it must be stronger. This is not what we expect.""

He said: ""The European Union must do more. It must do more for us, for Ukraine. And for itself.""

Notably, Zelenskyy could be seen outdoors in the video. Most of his video addresses were filmed indoors amid multiple reports suggesting he was the target of assassination attempts.

The city was braced for battle heading into the weekends as Russian troops continued to advance and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had issued a desperate plea for help.

“The fate of Ukraine is being decided now,” Zelenskyy said in an address on social media. “Special attention is on Kyiv — we should not lose the capital. The enemy will use all the possible forces they have to break our resistance. They will be mean and hard. Tonight they will begin a full scale storm.”

Russian troops bore down on the city as the global backlash mounted against the unprovoked attack on a European democracy.

Explosions, air raid sirens and the sound of gunfire filled the air over Kyiv on Friday. Officials in Kyiv urged citizens to take shelter and street fighting was occurring. Explosions were heard overnight, and video showed fighting near the Kyiv Zoo.

In the morning, Zelenskyy posted a video standing in front of what appeared to be a building next to the presidential office in Kyiv. “I’m here,” he said.

Zelenskyy denied what he said were false claims of an evacuation. “We won’t put down [our] weapon, we’ll protect our country,” he said in the video, according to an NBC News translation.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Saturday said that Russian troops trying to enter the city have been beaten back, but other sabotage and reconnaissance groups were inside.

“The night was difficult, but there are no Russian troops in the capital,” Klitschko said in a Telegram message Saturday morning, according to an NBC News translation. “The enemy is trying to break into the city.”

As of 6 a.m. 35 people had been injured, including two children, he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday that “no strikes are being made on civilian infrastructure,” The Washington Post reported. And the Russian Ministry of Defence said Friday that it was doing all it could to avoid civilian casualties.

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said on Twitter on Saturday morning that Kyiv ""survived another night under attacks by Russian ground forces, missiles,"" and one hit a residential apartment. NBC News has not independently verified that allegation.

Photos of the building showed heavy damage to several floors with walls and windows blown out and a fire burning inside. The fire was extinguished and the building was being evacuated, according to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine.

Information on injuries was not immediately available early Saturday.

The Ukrainian military said in a Facebook post that Russian troops attacked an army base in Kyiv around midnight on Saturday but were repelled. The military also said there were ""heavy battles"" in Vasylkiv, a city near the capital. NBC News was not able to independently verify the Ukrainian military's accounts.

The mayor of Vasylkiv said Russian paratroopers landed but were repulsed. NBC News has not independently verified that claim.

There is fighting on the outskirts of the capital of Kyiv and in the coastal city of Mariupol, but presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said the situation was under control.

“We knew that tonight was going to be a difficult night,” Podoliak said, adding that Russian attempts to harm Ukrainian cities “didn’t work.”

On Friday, the United States and European Union took the rare step of imposing sanctions on a head of state by targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Biden administration also slapped sanctions on Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and other members of Russia’s Security Council.

Zelenskyy spoke by phone with President Joe Biden for roughly 40 minutes on Friday, the White House said. Ukraine’s leader tweeted that the two discussed “strengthening sanctions, concrete defense assistance and an anti-war coalition.”

At the United Nations, a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Russia's military aggression was vetoed — by Russia. The council voted 11-1 Friday in favor of the resolution, and Russia was the lone vote against it. Three countries abstained.

Putin suggested he might be willing to enter negotiations with Ukraine even as his forces continued their advance across the country. But hours later, the Russian leader urged Ukrainian soldiers to overthrow their government, which he described a ""gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis"" — repeating propaganda Russia uses to justify its actions.

Inside the embattled capital, Zelenskyy refused to leave and instead made a desperate plea for Western governments to take tougher measures against Moscow.

He has already called up any Ukrainians willing to fight and handed out thousands of guns to civilians. And on Friday, Zelenskyy urged anyone with military experience in Europe to travel to Ukraine and help defend its independence or take to their own streets in protest.

“We are defending our independence, our country,” he said in his latest video message. ""It will continue like this. Glory to our defenders, glory to Ukraine.”

The fresh plea from the Ukrainian leader came as the invading Russian troops bore down on Kyiv amid a desperate defense in which hundreds of troops on either side were reportedly killed.

Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., said at a news conference Friday that Russia committed what she characterized as war crimes, targeting civilians, taking nearly 100 people hostage at Chernobyl and striking an orphanage with 50 children inside.

""The Russian propaganda machine says that civilians were not targeted. I want to tell you this is not true,"" Markarova told reporters.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko described Russia's offensive in stark terms.

“The enemy wants to put the capital on its knees and destroy us,"" said Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion. “The city has gone into a defensive phase. Shots and explosions are ringing out in some neighborhoods. Saboteurs have already entered Kyiv.”

Russia is nonetheless meeting “greater resistance” from the Ukrainians than it might have expected, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday.

“They are fighting for their country,” the official said, referring to Ukrainian troops and freedom fighters.

The official said Russian forces are undertaking an amphibious assault to the west of the city of Mariupol, and the United States has indications Russia is placing potentially thousands of naval forces ashore there. American officials assume Russian troops will then attempt to move toward the Donbas region, the official added.

Local officials warned residents in Obolon, a district north of the capital, not to go outside early Friday due to ""the approach of active hostilities."" The military said Russian saboteurs — troops disguised in Ukrainian uniforms — were in the streets.

Meanwhile just outside the capital, Russia claimed it had taken control of the strategic Hostomel Airport, which handles heavy cargo flights and would allow Moscow to airlift troops directly to Kyiv. A day earlier, Ukraine's military said that Russian troops sustained heavy casualties in the fighting there.

NBC News has not verified either side's reports.

Local officials said that Russia had captured the southern city of Kherson despite its “significant forces” suffering “great loses.”

In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, NBC News correspondent Matt Bradley reported around noon local time Friday that car alarms went off across the city as loud, sustained bombardments drew closer.

“Up until now, we understood Russian troops had set up around the ring road of the city. Now we understand they are moving in,” he said from an underground parking garage filled with journalists and local residents, including children.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russia-ukraine-invasion-kyiv-attack-putin-advance-zelenskyy-rcna17660
