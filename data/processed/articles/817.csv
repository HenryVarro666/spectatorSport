“Our information also indicates that Russia plans to threaten killing the family members of Ukrainian soldiers if they do not surrender,” the official said, who also commended the “incredible bravery” that the Ukrainians showed in the first day of fighting.

The State Department did not immediately respond when asked why the US believes that this is what the Russians will do.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken has recently warned of the possibility of widespread human rights abuses against the Ukrainian people carried out by Russia.

“All evidence suggests that Russia intends to encircle and threaten Kyiv, and we believe Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses – and potentially worse – on the Ukrainian people,” he said on Thursday.

Ukraine’s foreign minister echoed US concerns about the possibility of forthcoming human rights abuses on Friday. Citing intelligence, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said there could be Russian false flag operations that would erroneously cast the Ukrainians as the aggressors.

“According to intelligence, Russia plans a massive false flag operation to ‘dehumanize’ Ukrainians and accuse Ukraine of alleged inhuman actions. Don’t trust fakes. Ukraine defends its land in a just and defensive war. Unlike Russia, we don’t target kindergartens and civilians,” Kuleba tweeted.

The US official also said the Kremlin is carrying out a disinformation campaign to suggest a large number of Ukrainian troops have already surrendered to Russian forces.

“We commend the Ukrainian people for showing strength and determination in response to an unprovoked attack by a significantly larger military,” the official said, adding “We are concerned, however, that Russia plans to discourage them and induce surrender through disinformation. Our information indicates Russia is creating a disinformation campaign by publicizing false reports about the widespread surrender of Ukrainian troops.”

Ukraine reported troops pouring across the borders with Russia and Belarus from the north and east, and landing on the coasts from the Black Sea in the southwest and Azov Sea in the southeast on Thursday.

Ukraine's armed forces believe more than 60 Russian battalion tactical groups - the equivalent of 30,000-60,000 troops - have been deployed on Ukrainian territory, according to an update which claimed the ""enemy has an extremely low morale"".

The military said Russia aims to block the capital Kyiv and create a land corridor on Ukraine's southeastern coast towards Crimea - which Moscow annexed in 2014 - and the Transdniestria region of neighbouring Moldova that is held by pro-Russian separatists.

Ukraine 'attacked from Russia, Belarus and Crimea' - latest live updates

President Vladimir Putin's forces have seized control of the former Chernobyl nuclear power station near Pripyat, around 60 miles from the capital Kyiv, following fierce clashes with government forces, according to the Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal.

It was the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986 when a reactor exploded, and an adviser to the presidential office, Mykhailo Podolyak, said: ""It is impossible to say the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe after a totally pointless attack by the Russians.""

And a decree has been signed by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ordering the mass mobilisation of conscripts and reservists over the next 90 days.

Missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities after Mr Putin ordered a ""specialised military operation"" in the early hours.

Explosions were heard in Kyiv, along with Kharkiv in the east, and Odessa in the south.

Russia said its military had destroyed 83 Ukrainian land-based targets, including at least 11 air bases, and had achieved all its goals for Thursday.

The defence ministry in Moscow said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons, claiming that ""there is no threat to the civilian population"".

However, dozens of civilians have reportedly been killed during the offensive. Ukraine's health minister Oleh Lyashko said 57 people had died and 169 others wounded.

At least 203 attacks have been carried out throughout the entire country, according to Ukrainian police.

Ukrainian forces downed two Russian helicopters and seven other Russian aircraft and destroyed several Russian trucks, and a platoon from Russia's 74th Motor Rifles Brigade has surrendered, said Ukraine's US ambassador, Oksana Markarova.

What's happening on the ground

A US official said Russian forces were moving on three fronts - from annexed Crimea to Kherson in the south, from Belarus - north of Ukraine - towards Kyiv, and from the northeast to Kharkiv.

The official said as part of the ""first phase"" of the assault, more than 100 missiles were launched from land and sea, primarily short-range ballistic missiles, but also medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and surface-to-air missiles.

The main targets were barracks, ammunition warehouses, and airfields, before ground forces moved in.

Ukraine reported columns of troops penetrated its borders into Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk in the east, and landed by sea at the cities of Odessa and Mariupol in the south.

Russia' defence ministry said its ground forces moved into Ukraine from Crimea, the first confirmation from Moscow that its ground forces had gone in, advancing towards Kherson.

Border units, border patrols and checkpoints were targeted with artillery, heavy equipment and small arms fire, Ukraine's border agency said.

He warned: ""What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft. This is the sound of a new Iron Curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world.""

Putin's justification

In a television address announcing the ""specialised military operation"" in the Donbas region, Mr Putin claimed the attack was needed to protect people subjected to ""genocide"".

He accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russian demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO.

He claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but was aiming for the country's ""demilitarisation"" and ""de-Nazification"".

The package takes aim at a range of sectors including finance, transport and energy. It imposes export controls, includes new visa measures and adds more Russians to a sanctions list.

“The package of massive and targeted sanctions European leaders approved tonight clearly demonstrates that it will have maximum impact on the Russian economy and the political elite,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a news conference early Friday.

“Our unity is our strength,” she said. “The Kremlin knows this. And it has tried its best to divide us but it has utterly failed.”

More details are expected Friday. But in a series of tweets, von der Leyen said that the sanctions would affect everything from Russia’s ability to upgrade its oil refineries to the ability of businessmen and diplomats to obtain visas.

She said that the sanctions target 70 percent of the Russian banking market and ban the sale of aircraft to Russian airlines.

One question going into the talks was whether the E.U. would heed calls from eastern European countries to cut Russia off from the Swift global payment system. However, President Joe Biden said Thursday Swift was not part of the plan because, “that’s not the position the rest of Europe chooses to take” — suggesting they were overruled.

European leaders have warned for weeks of devastating sanctions, but have been divided on when and how to proceed. Some countries initially hoped to deter a Russian invasion by hitting the country with one big sanctions package, others pressed for an incremental approach.

There has also been public disagreement about whether certain sectors, such as energy, should be excluded because of the potential economic impact on Europe. However, the sight of tanks rolling into eastern Ukraine seemed to quiet the chatter.

On Tuesday, the E.U. announced a first round of penalties that targeted Kremlin officials, lawmakers, three banks and also restricted Russian access to E.U. financial and capital markets.

Putin invaded anyway, sending the bloc scrambling for next steps.

E.U. officials promised that the second tranche would be a tougher blow.

“These events mark the beginning of a new era. Putin is trying to subjugate a friendly European country. He is trying to redraw the map of Europe by force. He must and he will fail,” von der Leyen said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/24/russia-ukraine-attack-news/

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, unleashing air strikes and ordering ground troops across the border in fighting that Ukrainian authorities said left dozens of people dead.

The attack triggered Western warnings of unprecedented sanctions against Russia as NATO, EU and G7 leaders condemned the invasion and vowed to hold Moscow accountable.

Weeks of intense diplomacy failed to deter Putin, who amassed over 150,000 troops on Ukraine's borders in what the West said was the biggest military build-up in Europe since World War II.

""I have decided to proceed with a special military operation,"" Putin said in a surprise statement on television shortly before 6 am.

Shortly afterwards, the first bombardments were heard in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and several other cities.

Russian air strikes hit military installations across the country as ground forces moved in from the north, south and east, forcing many Ukrainians to flee their homes to the sounds of bombing.

Fighting was also seen raging in Chernobyl near the nuclear facility where the 1986 reactor blast leaked radiation, after which Ukraine reported that Russian troops captured the Chernobyl power plant.

Russia's Defence Ministry said its first day of the Ukraine invasion was ""successful"" hours after announcing it had destroyed 74 above-ground military infrastructure facilities, including 11 aerodromes. Ukrainian police said Russia had carried out 203 attacks since the beginning of the day.

PM Modi spoke to Putin today regarding the crisis and called for an immediate end to violence.

Feb 24, 2022 11:44 (IST) Can Ukraine Thwart A Russian Invasion? A Comparison Of Troops

Ukraine's armed forces are heavily outnumbered and outgunned by Russia's, but as Russia begins what may be a large-scale invasion, military experts say they would be capable of mounting significant resistance and inflicting heavy casualties. Ukraine's army is also better trained and equipped than in 2014, when Russia captured the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine without a fight, and is widely seen as highly motivated to defend the country's heartland. Here are some details of Ukraine's military.",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ukraine-crisis-live-updates-un-to-hold-emergency-meeting-on-ukraine-russia-standoff-today-2785839
6,90f0430e-10f3-45fc-a4bb-258b2634a622,[],,"Ukraine says it has restored a broken power line to the Chernobyl power plant, which in 1986 was the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster. The plant is currently held by Russian troops.

Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said ""heroes"" from the national power grid company managed to restore the connection. The power is used to run pumps that keep spent nuclear fuel cool to prevent radiation leaks.

Ukraine said Wednesday that power had been cut to the site but that there was enough diesel fuel to run on-site generators for 48 hours. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) played down concerns, saying it saw little risk of the pools containing the spent fuel overheating even without electricity.

The IAEA said Sunday it had been informed that the power supply line was restored at approximately 6:38 p.m. local time. The plant was to be reconnected to Ukraine's electricity grid on Monday morning, the IAEA said.

But the Reuters news service cited grid operator Ukrenergo as saying in a statement later on Monday that Russian forces had damaged the line again, though it produced no evidence of its claim and didn't say whether all external power to the plant had been cut again. Ukrenergo demanded access to the facility to fix the line anew.

When Halushchenko initially said power had been restored, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi issued a statement calling it ""a positive development as the Chornobyl NPP has had to rely on emergency diesel generators for several days now. However, I remain gravely concerned about safety and security at Chornobyl and Ukraine's other nuclear facilities.""

Part of the problem, the IAEA said, is the health of the more than 200 staff members at the Chernobyl plant who have not been allowed to rotate out of the plant for nearly three weeks.

Russian forces quickly seized the Chernobyl site after launching their invasion on February 24. Ukrainian officials have said the team of plant operators who ensure safe operations at the decommissioned facility have tried to continue carrying out their work, but under the orders of Russian troops and without being allowed to leave the compound at all.

The agency said Sunday that it was told by Ukrainian officials that staff were no longer repairing and maintaining safety-related equipment ""in part due to their physical and psychological fatigue after working non-stop for nearly three weeks.""

On Friday, Ukraine accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering ""the preparation of a terrorist attack"" on the Chernobyl plant. Russian forces in control of the plant ""refused to grant access to the station to Ukrainian repair people,"" Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said in a statement. Among engineers sent from Belarus, it claimed, were Russian ""saboteurs"" pretending to be nuclear scientists who came ""to organize a terrorist attack.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chernobyl-disaster-ukraine-says-power-restored/

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

On the first day of Russia’s violent invasion of Ukraine, its military forces overran the plant and held several staff members of the Chernobyl facilities hostage, Ukrainian authorities said.

The attack was by no means unanticipated. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russian occupation forces were trying to wrest control of the plant. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry warned of another nuclear disaster if Russia continues its invasion. “In 1986, the world saw the biggest technological disaster in Chernobyl,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry tweeted, referring to the Chernobyl disaster that led to the death of thousands of people. “If Russia continues the war, Chernobyl can happen again in 2022.”

So, why did Russia seize the plant, which has largely been devoid of human life for over three decades and still contains radioactive debris? Is there a reason to panic? We explain.

What happened at the Chernobyl power plant?

Located around 16 km away from the city of Chernobyl and a little over 100 km away from Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv, the power plant witnessed the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986.

The disaster occurred between April 25-26, when a group of technicians in what was then Soviet-controlled Ukraine carried out a botched safety test that led to a series of explosions at Chernobyl’s reactor No. 4 and a partial meltdown of its core. The explosions exposed the core and released clouds of radioactive material into the atmosphere.

According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the initial explosion resulted in the death of two workers, while 28 firemen and emergency clean-up workers died within three months of the explosion from Acute Radiation Sickness and one from cardiac arrest. In 2005, the UN predicted that around 4,000 people may eventually die due to radiation exposure, BBC reported.

The radiation also affected neighbouring Belarus as well as parts of Russia and Europe.

From NYT | Russians now see a new side to Putin: Dragging them into war

To put the scale of the tragedy into perspective — it is said to have released 400 times more radiation than the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in Japan. Initially, Soviet officials tried to cover up the disaster. It was only after Swedish officials raised alarms over a sharp increase in radiation levels coming from the Soviet Union, that the Kremlin admitted that the accident occurred. In fact, the catastrophe is considered one of the key factors that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union a few years later.

Since the accident, Chernobyl’s “exclusion zone”— which covers a 32-km radius around the site — has remained largely uninhabited, while the plant’s remaining three reactors were all shut down by 2000. Radiation levels remain higher than normal. A sarcophagus built to cover the reactor after the accident has since deteriorated, resulting in radiation leaks.

Why did Russia capture Chernobyl?

Russia’s attack on Chernobyl was not out of the blue. Since the shortest route from the Russian border to Kyiv passes through Chernobyl, Ukraine had deployed security forces to guard the area months ago, New York Times reported.

As expected, hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin first announced the invasion, Russian special forces attacked the plant. Russian troops were said to have entered the exclusion zone on Thursday, before crossing the border into Ukraine. Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhaila Podolyak said that the power plant was seized after a “fierce battle”. In a Facebook post, another Ukrainian official alleged that several staff members were being held hostage.

According to military analysts, seizing Chernobyl was a strategic decision that gave Russian troops quick and easy access to Kyiv from Belarus, which is an ally of Moscow. The ghost town in which the power plant is located is essentially placed on a direct highway to Kyiv. By capturing Chernobyl, Russia has secured a route into Ukraine for its ground forces.

So, is there a reason to panic?

Reactor 4 now sits under a steel and concrete structure called the New Safe Confinement, which was built to confine the remnants of the reactor and is said to be strong enough to withstand a tornado. Around 200 tonnes of radioactive fuel is believed to be inside the wreckage of the reactor.

Hours after the attack, Ukraine’s nuclear agency said it was recording increased radiation levels around the shuttered power plant, Reuters reported. It said the change was likely due to the movement of heavy military equipment in the area lifting radioactive dust into the air.

According to a report by the Times, soldiers are unlikely to face much harm from radioactive particles as long as they do not spend too much time in areas with high radiation levels. But a Ukrainian official warned that damage to the nuclear waste storage facility could lead to radioactive dust spreading across Ukraine, Belarus and parts of Europe, the Times reported.

While the New Safe Confinement is likely to protect its contents against all natural disasters, a full-fledged war may throw some curveballs its way, such as explosions from bombs hurled at the structure. But experts say that both sides have little to gain by destroying the reactor.

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. As Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine enters its second day, the people of Ukraine are starting to come to terms with the reality that the unthinkable has actually happened. Today, my colleague Anton Troianovski explains the significance of this moment. And Sabrina Tavernise, Lynsea Garrison, and Michael Schwirtz speak to Ukrainians about the agonizing decisions that they now must make.

[music]

It’s Friday, February 25. Anton, we are talking to you on Thursday night in Moscow. We are coming to the end of day one of this invasion. Help us wrap our heads around what’s happening and the significance of what we’re all witnessing. Because even if we’ve been hearing warnings about this for weeks, it’s hard to believe that we’re now experiencing a full scale attack on Ukraine by Russia.

anton troianovski

Yeah. It is really hard to believe. It’s the biggest attack of one nation on another nation in Europe since World War II. It is really kind of the worst case scenario of all those scenarios of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine that have been discussed. It’s something that I’ve spent just about every day writing about this crisis for the last two months or so. And honestly, even until yesterday I didn’t think that this could actually happen. It’s Europe’s most powerful military, bearing, basically, its entire firepower, much of its firepower against the neighboring country. So since about 5:00 AM, we have seen cruise missile, ballistic missile strikes against infrastructure targets, military targets in Ukraine. Then during the day, today, we started seeing footage coming in of helicopter assaults, of paratroopers landing, of tanks rolling across the border. And this is happening from 3 sides, from the North, Belarus, from the East, Russia, from the South, from the Black Sea in Crimea. It started, what, like 18 hours ago or so, and it’s still very hard to just wrap our heads around the magnitude of what’s happening.

michael barbaro

And what do we understand to be the end goal here at this point?

anton troianovski

Well, Putin laid it out quite clearly in his early morning speech. He said, our goal is to demilitarize and de-Nazify, in his words, Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And just explain that because—

anton troianovski

Yeah.

michael barbaro

De-nazification is not a familiar phrase in 2022.

anton troianovski

Exactly. And I mean, I will say, until recently, it hasn’t been a familiar phrase in Russia either. But the Kremlin in their propaganda they consider the democratically elected government of Ukraine a Nazi regime. They claim falsely that it has perpetrated a genocide on Russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine. And so Putin is trying to claim the moral high ground here. He is saying he’s going in to remove this evil regime. And what that means is this is a full scale military assault to topple the government, most likely, of another country. This is just a massive undertaking that we’re only seeing the beginnings of.

michael barbaro

So we’re talking about a sovereign nation in Europe being attacked by another European nation. And its democratically elected leadership being, by what you just described, deposed. And these are developments that are unheard of in modern Europe. So how should we think about that?

anton troianovski

Yeah. I think it’s really the end of a certain post-Cold War order in Europe. It’s the end of 30 years of Russia trying to find a place in that kind of Western led order. It’s the end of 20 years of Putin trying to use diplomacy as well as his kind of hybrid warfare tactics to try to further his interests in Europe. That’s all gone now. We’re in a new reality now, where Russia is showing it is prepared to fight a large land war in Europe to achieve what it describes to be its aims. It’s just a totally different world that we’re in now.

michael barbaro

Well, so let’s talk about the consequences of that for all involved.

anton troianovski

Yeah. I mean, I would break it up into a few different parts, the consequences for Ukraine, for Russia, for Europe, and the U.S., and the rest of the world. So starting with Ukraine. This is just the beginning, I fear. If this continues, if this continues the way we think it’s going to, to Putin pursuing regime change, it could get much more bloody. So we don’t know yet what happens to the cities. There is a fight for territory going on in Eastern Ukraine, where those separatist regions are. But the big question is, will they go into Kyiv?

michael barbaro

Right.

anton troianovski

Very scarily, it looks like they may well.

michael barbaro

OK. So what about Russia, where you are based? What are the consequences you are seeing and expecting there?

anton troianovski

Well, so people are expecting a new crackdown on civil liberties, on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, even on business. The reason being that whenever we’ve had crackdowns here in Russia, the justification has always been that the Kremlin is hunting down internal enemies, who are serving some kind of foreign agenda to destabilize the country. So that’s certainly one thing to watch over the coming days and weeks is how much of an additional crackdown is there.

protesters [CHANTING]

anton troianovski

Tonight, we had pretty significant anti-war protests—

protesters [CHANTING]

anton troianovski

—in Moscow, and St. Petersburg, and in a number of cities in Siberia all told several thousand people were in the streets and there were more than 1,500 arrests. So—

michael barbaro

Wow.

anton troianovski

—one thing that’s very important to point out is, there has been next to no outpouring of support for this. And there is a lot of anger, disbelief, fear to see your country inflicting so much suffering on a neighboring country is awful, and this narrative for why it was necessary to do it. It really does fall apart quite quickly upon inspection. Why— How does Ukraine actually threaten Russia? Can it really be true that the Ukrainians were planning an invasion of these pro-Russian separatist areas in the East just as 150,000 plus troops were surrounding Ukraine on three sides? There’s just so much in the Kremlin propaganda narrative that doesn’t hold up, that I think a lot of people aren’t buying that story.

michael barbaro

OK. Finally, let’s talk about the consequences for the United States and for the rest of the world.

anton troianovski

So President Biden and the E.U. announced major sanctions today against Russia. And Russia has promised to respond potentially asymmetrically. So we might not see sanctions by Russia against the U.S., but we might see Russia take other actions that could cause harm and pain in the U.S. And they’re— We can really only speculate what that would be. Some folks are talking about the potential for cyber attacks here in Moscow. There’s been a lot of talk that Russia could base missiles or other military assets in Latin America, to more directly threaten the United States. Russia, obviously, is one of the world’s biggest energy suppliers, especially to Europe. If it were to turn that spigot, that could cause incredible problems for Europeans. So there is so much uncertainty here still, not just in Ukraine, not just in Russia, but really about how this crisis plays out and what it means for the rest of the world.

michael barbaro

And Anton, as you’re preparing to sign-off for the night, I want to return to Ukraine and where this situation leaves its people at this moment.

anton troianovski

I mean, it’s a horrible situation. These are people who— I think there was so little expectation that Russia could actually go ahead with this kind of invasion. And now they are making choices they would never thought they would have to make. Do they stay in Kyiv? Do they try to flee West? Do they try to get out of the country? Do you sleep in the basement? It’s really an unimaginable situation for millions and millions of people right now.

Hi, Lynsey. Not good.

lynsea garrison

Not good.

denis surkov

It’s not the same.

michael barbaro

Lynsea Garrison got on the phone with Denis Surkov, who lives in a city called Dnipro in Eastern Ukraine.

denis surkov

I am doctor, Chief of Dnipro Regional Children’s Hospital.

lynsea garrison

You’re a doctor at Dnipro Regional Children’s Hospital.

denis surkov

Yep.

lynsea garrison

OK.

denis surkov

And I am Chief of NICU and I.C.U.

lynsea garrison

Chief of NICU?

denis surkov

Exactly.

lynsea garrison

Got it. Can you just tell me a little bit about what the past 24 hours have been like for you?

denis surkov

So in the morning, we wake up and we have heard, first, rocket explosions near Dnipro Airport. So I was in my hospital. We were nervous. We were confused. Everybody was near their laptops or iPhones.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

And checked the news. And the news were and are dramatic.

lynsea garrison

Dramatic. How were you understanding this? Did you think that this would happen?

denis surkov

Honestly, no. We were expected for the beginning of the attack, but we didn’t know that it could be so, so fast, so right now. And now, the borders between Ukrainian regions are closed. We had some possibilities and some efforts to go last week.

lynsea garrison

OK.

denis surkov

I can’t explain, but something stopped us. We hoped that finally everything will resolve. But now, honestly, I don’t know exactly what to do.

lynsea garrison

What do you think stopped you?

denis surkov

My family didn’t want to leave Ukraine because we love Ukraine, and we wanted to live here happy and in peace, and so on. So I said, OK, maybe everything will be not so bad. Let’s wait. So my main question for myself is, if I made a very, very big mistake not to move from Ukraine when I had an opportunity to do this.

lynsea garrison

That’s a heavy question.

denis surkov

Yes. If there was a big mistake or not so big, and I have no answer. I can ask you, do you want to wake up in the morning and understand you should go forever, not for one day, not for two days, forever? Can you make such a decision in— I don’t know, in 10 minutes? My question to you.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

To bring just a bit of water, just a bit of food, single cloth, documents, money, and go outside your home forever, can you make such a decision? Just imagine.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

So this was my family feeling last week. Even though yesterday in the evening, I told to my wife that this is the last calm day we can evacuate. In the morning, we realized that war came to Ukraine, not conflict, not disturbs, war, conventional war.

lynsea garrison

What are your children asking you? Like, how are you talking about this with them?

denis surkov

I say to my children, everything will be OK, your father will care about you.

lynsea garrison

How old are they?

denis surkov

My elder daughter is 30 and she lives abroad. And my younger daughter, she is 14. She’s with me.

lynsea garrison

How is she doing?

denis surkov

She believed me.

lynsea garrison

That you’ll protect her? And how does that make you feel that she believes you?

denis surkov

I will do all I can to protect her. I don’t know exactly what, but I will do everything, everything can.

lynsea garrison

Are you worried it won’t be enough?

denis surkov

I am worried. Everything could be changed, I don’t know, next few hours or even next few maybe minutes.

sabrina tavernise OK. Back to the hotel. Everything is closed now. It’s almost as if it was nighttime. A few cars are still going by, but almost no pedestrians. It’s very central. The street is just completely deserted.

[music]

It does feel ominous.

michael schwirtz Day one of the war it’s been a very long day. The town I’m in, Slovyansk, kind of continued on as normal. There were bits of panic that could be evident. There were lines at the A.T.M.s. And people were stocking up on medications. But overall, the mood was pretty calm and collected, probably because these people have been through this before, the town came under heavy attack in 2014 when Ukrainian forces clashed with Russian backed rebels who had come in from the East. And so when I’m walking around town, people are telling me that this is just part of their lives. Very few people I met around town today said that they had any intention of leaving even though rocket attacks hit an airport nearby and Russian forces were fighting with the Ukrainian military just a few dozen kilometers away. lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz I met a woman named Lera Alekseevna, who was in the courtyard near my hotel. Oh, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And she had stuffed her pet hairless cat in her jacket and it was shivering. lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And she was telling me how she was planning on going to work at a company that sells cash registers and bringing her animals with her, so that they wouldn’t have to be alone. So if she had to make a quick dash for it, she could be with her animals. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz But she said she had no intention of leaving, mostly out of fear that she would be forced to leave behind her pets. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Outside a blood bank in Slovyansk, I met a young man named Bogdan Kravchenko,

[non-english singing]

who was just sitting in his car listening to the Ukrainian national anthem cranked up on high volume.

bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He had just gone and donated blood. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And he said he wasn’t panicked, but he said that he was acting according to the situation and that things had only just begun. bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I walked up to a base of the National Guard Unit here in Slovyansk. And out front there were a few couples, men dressed in drab green uniforms, and women— all of them were being sent off. The men, they were all being sent off somewhere. Some of them said they couldn’t tell me where they were being sent. Some of them admitted that they didn’t even know. I met one couple, Yelena and Eugenia. Yelena had brought Eugenia, her husband, some clothes that he was going to take with him on his deployment wherever he was headed. Another couple just held each other for what seemed like 15, 20, 30 minutes, just held each other on the street in the sun ahead of whatever deployment this young man was being sent on. speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 12 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz You both [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And then, I met Lyubov Vasilyevna, a 75-year-old pensioner, she was carrying a bag filled with newly purchased loaves of bread. And she said she had spent her last bit of cash on. And was waiting in line at an A.T.M., it would appear that there was no cash left. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz All she wanted, she said, was to live in peace in her native Donbass, which is what this Eastern region is called. lyubov vasilavna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And then, she paused and recited a poem that she said she wrote 2 years ago. It was supposed to be evocative, the piece that she was looking for. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And I’ll read that poem that I translated from the Russian into English. I’m so looking forward to peace, but it is coming to us so slowly. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz We still have a little patience. Peace is close at hand, and we’re waiting for it to arrive without gunfire, without blood. Enough has been spilled in Donbass. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Let the sun smile, and the sky brighten, and the children smile. Let it go in a black moment. There will be peace for all. And people will say, god hurt us. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Let all stormy skies leave us. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Donbass [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And hail Donbass and the city of Slovyansk. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

[music]

The airstrikes are beginning again. You can hear the siren. We’re trying to decide whether to leave. Our colleagues, a few of them drove out this morning because it’s really unclear what’s going to happen. Will there be a big fight with the Ukrainian military? Or will the Russians just come in? What will happen if they take the city? And it seems like that is imminent. So we’re trying to make arrangements. Our hotel doesn’t have a generator, which means we would be out of power if the power gets cut off in the city, which is a pretty good chance. Yeah. We’re trying to figure it out. I guess, like a lot of people here, we’re trying to make that decision. Should we leave or should we stay?

As of Friday afternoon in Kyiv, Ukrainian officials were bracing for an attack on the capital city as Russia’s military offenses pressed closer to the heart of the government.

In a televised address, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said that at least 137 Ukrainians, military and civilians, had already been killed. And he called on Ukrainians to defend themselves against Russian forces, saying that nobody else would come to their rescue.

By Asher McShane

More than 130 people have been killed and hundreds more injured on the first day of Russia's military action in Ukraine - with fresh missile strikes reported on Friday morning as the war approaches the capital.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday night that 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - had died and hundreds more had been hurt. It was feared the death toll may be higher.

Russian forces also captured the site of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and there are reports staff there have been taken hostage.

That is just north of Kyiv, the capital, which it is feared the Russians are attempting to encircle, possibly with a view to overthrowing the democratically elected government. The Associated Press said the Kremlin's forces were just 20 miles away.

In the early hours of the morning, President Putin launched a major unprovoked assault on Ukraine, firing missiles on cities and military targets. The invasion came despite weeks of Russian claims that they had no intention of invading. #StandWithUkraine pic.twitter.com/KltWqYMvdD — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) February 24, 2022

On Friday, the Russian bombardment continued, with Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba saying ""horrific rocket attacks"" hit Kiev just before 4am.

""Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany,"" he said.

""Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia. Sever all ties. Kick Russia out of [everywhere].""

Ukraine has banned all men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation - meaning all Ukrainians are being urged to defend their homeland and conscripts and reservists are being called up.

Vladimir Putin said in a televised address early on Thursday morning that Russia was launching what he called a ""special military invasion"", but what is widely recognised by western leaders as an invasion.

Explosions were heard across the country on Thursday as Russia launched strikes against a number of targets - some of which are close to the capital of Kyiv.

Western leaders have announced a number of economic sanctions in response to the invasion.

In Russia itself, anti-war demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest against the actions of their leader.

More than 1,700 arrests have been made across the country, mainly in Moscow.

On Friday morning, President Zelensky said he was Russia's ""target number one"" and his family ""target number two"".

""According to our information, the enemy has listed me as target number one, and my family – as target number two. They want to destroy the country politically, terminating the head of state,"" he said in a video address.

""Today, we all heard from Moscow that they want to talk in the end. They want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status. I am telling all our country's partners: right now, the fate of our state is being decided. I am asking them: Are you with us? They answer that they are. But they are not ready to take us into the alliance.

""We are not afraid to talk about security guarantees for our country. Not afraid to talk about neutral status. But what will be our security guarantees? And what countries will provide them?

""We must talk about the end of this invasion. We must talk about ceasefire. But right now, our country's fate depends fully on our military.""

He also denounced claims he had left the capital.

""I know there is much fake news including those as if I had left Kyiv,"" he said.

""I remain in the capital with my people.""

Boris Johnson called Putin a ""blood-stained aggressor"" in the House of Commons on Thursday, and said it was evident he was always planning on invading Ukraine despite the UK and it's allies trying to to come to a diplomatic agreement.

""At this stage, Ukrainians are offering a fierce defence of their families and their country,"" he told MPs.

""Earlier today, President Putin gave another televised address and offered the absurd pretext that he sought the de-militarisation and de-Nazification of Ukraine.

""In fact, he is hurling the might of his military machine against a free and peaceful neighbour in breach of his own implicit pledge and every principal of civilised behaviour between states.

""He will never be able to cleanse the blood of Ukraine from his hands.

""I'm driven to conclude that Putin was always determined to attack his neighbour, no matter what he did.

""Now we see him for what he is, a blood-stained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest.""

The seizing of the nuclear power plant Chernobyl sparked concern on Thursday.

An adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office confirmed the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history had been seized by the Russians on Thursday evening.

""It is impossible to say the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe after a totally pointless attack by the Russians,"" said Mykhailo Podolyak.

""This is one of the most serious threats in Europe today.""

Ukraine's prime minister also said the Chernobyl area near Kyiv was now under the control of Russian troops.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters there are reports staff at the site are being held hostage by Russian soldiers.

""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said.

""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning.

""We condemn it and we request their release.""

Heavy fighting broke out earlier after invading Russian troops tried to seize the nuclear plant. An alert was also issued over a possible nuclear cloud covering the region if sensitive sites containing radioactive material were destroyed in the fighting.

Senior Ukrainian officials warned that fighting near Chernobyl could cause nuclear waste contamination to spread across the region and further across Europe.

An adviser for the Interior Minister of Ukraine, Anton Gerashchenko said today: ""The invaders from the territory of Belarus have moved into the Chernobyl AES Zone.

""The National Guardsmen, who guard the collectors of unsafe nuclear radioactive waste, are fighting hard.

""If the invaders artillery hits and ruins/damages the collectors of nuclear waste , radioactive nuclear dust can can be spread over the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and the country of the EU!""

The plant lies 130 kilometres (80 miles) north of the capital Kyiv.

The exploded reactor has been covered by a protective shelter to prevent radiation leak and the entire plant has been decommissioned.

Ukraine's ambassador to Estonia wrote online: ""Bloody battle near Chornobyl nuclear facilities. Our people die to prevent ecological catastrophe in Europe.""

One journalist based in Minsk wrote: ""Russian troops from Belarus entered the Chernobyl zone. Heavy fights between them and Ukrainian soldiers guarding the storage of radioactive waste. We don't know about the fallout yet. But this is an absolute madness.""

A radioactive disaster struck the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history.

The development came hours after Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Hundreds of civilians were reported dead after Russian and Belorussian tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border and missiles rained down on cities after Putin launched a ""special military operation"" and saying he wants to ""demilitarize"", not occupy, the country.

Boris Johnson said early on Thursday: ""I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskyy to discuss next steps.

""President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine.

""The UK and our allies will respond decisively.""

Defence secretary Ben Wallace said: ""This is naked aggression against a democratic country which had dared to express a different aspiration than being a supine neighbour to Russia.

""No one should forget this day. Putin thinks this land grab is about securing his legacy -it will be, but not the one that he wishes.""

In a statement the Ukrainian foreign ministry said: ""This is an act of war, an attack on sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, a gross violation of the UN Statute and the fundamental norms and principles of international law.""",https://www.lbc.co.uk/world-news/russian-and-ukrainian-fighting-near-chernobyl-risks-nuclear-waste-breach/
