0,23cd8638-45f0-4c30-aa9e-14ec48abd76c,"['Jennifer Deaton', 'Lauren Said-Moorhouse']",2022-04-05,"(CNN) Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of indiscriminately killing civilians ""just for their pleasure"" in an emotionally-charged address to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, before questioning the very mandate of the Security Council itself.

Zelensky's speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha , where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend.

On Tuesday, he related the aftermath of Russia's retreat from the town in horrifying detail , describing entire families killed, people with their throats slashed, and women raped and killed in front of their children. Zelensky said Russia's actions were no different from those of a terror group, except that Russia is a permanent member of the UNSC.

The Ukrainian leader then criticized the body, asking representatives point blank: ""Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It is not there, though there is a Security Council.""

Zelensky added: ""It is obvious that the key institution of the world designed to combat aggression and ensure peace cannot work effectively.

""Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you of Article 1, Chapter 1 of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? Its purpose is to maintain and make sure that peace is adhered to. And now the UN charter is violated literally starting with Article 1. And so what is the point of all other Articles?"" he asked.

At least 1,480 civilians have been killed and at least 2,195 have been injured in Ukraine between the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 and April 4, a UN official said at the meeting, citing updated numbers from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The latest figures on the number of Ukrainian civilians in the conflict had ""more than doubled"" since the last briefing to the UNSC on March 17.

In Bucha, bodies strewn across the streets and in basements were found by human rights groups and documented by independent journalists. Satellite images suggest some bodies had been there since at least March 18.

In his damning speech, Zelensky said there was ""not a single crime"" that the Russians ""would not commit,"" alleging that Russian troops had ""searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country.""

""They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone ... They killed entire families, adults and children and they tried to burn the bodies,"" Zelensky said.

""I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased every single day and in the memory of the civilians who died, who were shot and killed in the back of their head after being tortured,"" he told the UNSC.

""Some of them were shot on the streets. Others were thrown into wells, so they died there suffering. They were killed in their apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road, just for their pleasure,"" he continued. ""Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them.""

The Security Council session was called to consider Ukrainian allegations of mass murder of civilians in the town of Bucha by Russian soldiers.

Zelensky also warned that the horrors found in Bucha would be replicated in other cities across Ukraine. Demanding accountability, he called for any Russians who have given ""criminal orders"" and ""carried out them by killing our people"" to be brought before a tribunal, similar to the Nuremberg trials that occurred after World War II when Nazis were put on trial.

UN: Civilians were targeted

Separately, the United Nations on Tuesday said that the shocking images from Bucha showed ""all the signs"" that civilians were ""directly targeted and directly killed.""

In a virtual press briefing, OHCHR spokesperson Liz Throssell said the reports emerging from Bucha and other areas were ""very disturbing developments.""

She specifically referenced the ""disturbing"" images of people with their hands tied behind their back and of partially naked women whose bodies have been burnt as further evidence suggesting the direct targeting of individuals.

""We have been talking about war crimes in the context of shelling, bombardment, and artillery attacks. Now they need to be investigated. But you could argue there was a military context, for example, to a building being hit. It's hard to see what was the military context of an individual lying in the street with a bullet to the head or having their bodies burned,"" Throssell continued.

As the OHCHR is trying to currently gain access to Bucha, she didn't have ""exact information"" to share regarding the situation on the ground.

Throssell also paid tribute to the ""crucial role"" that journalists are playing in documenting these scenes, mentioning the ""multiple teams"" involved in ""reporting, analyzing, and sending video footage.""

Russia's response

Russia has repeatedly denied the alleged atrocities, despite increasing evidence suggesting otherwise. Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations responded to Zelensky's remarks, calling the accusations against the Russian military ""ungrounded.""

""We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military, which are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses,"" Nebenzia said in translated remarks.

The ambassador recalled Zelensky's election to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019, stating that hopes that Zelensky would end the fighting in the Donbas region of Ukraine ""failed to materialize.""

Nebenzia also repeated past claims that ""a huge amount of lies about Russian soldiers and military"" continue to proliferate.

Addressing Zelensky directly, Nebenzia concluded his remarks by claiming Russia ""came to ... Ukraine"" to bring peace, not to ""conquer lands.""

Nebenzia's words echoed those of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier Tuesday, who called the allegations not only ""groundless, but ... a well-staged tragic show"" and ""a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/world/zelensky-ukraine-united-nations-speech-intl/index.html
1,23cd8638-45f0-4c30-aa9e-14ec48abd76c,[],,"Dear Mrs. President!

Dear Mr. Secretary General!

Dear members of the Security Council and other participants of the meeting!

Thank you for the opportunity.

I am sure that all the representatives of the UN member states will hear me today.

Yesterday I returned from our city of Bucha, recently liberated from the troops of the Russian Federation.

It is difficult to find a war crime that the occupiers have not committed there.

The Russian military searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our state.

They executed women outside the houses when approaching and simply calling someone alive.

They killed whole families - adults and children. And they tried to burn their bodies.

I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased everyday. Everyday, in the morning.

The memory of the killed civilians.

Who were shot in the back of the head or in the eye after being tortured. Who were shot just on the streets.

Who were thrown into the well, so that they die there in suffering.

Who were killed in apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Who were crushed by tanks in civilian cars in the middle of the road. For fun.

Whose limbs were cut off, whose throat was cut. Who were raped and killed in front of their own children.

Their tongues were torn out only because they did not hear from them what they wanted to hear.

How is this different from what the ISIS terrorists were doing in the occupied territory?

Except that it is done by a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

It destroys the internal unity of states.

Destroys state borders.

Denies the right of more than a dozen peoples on two continents to self-determination and independent state life. Pursues a consistent policy of destroying ethnic and religious diversity.

Inflames wars and deliberately wages them in such a way as to kill as many ordinary civilians as possible. To destroy as many ordinary peaceful cities as possible. To leave in the country where it sends its troops only ruins and mass graves. You've seen it all.

Promotes hatred at the state level and seeks to export it to other countries through its system of propaganda and political corruption.

Provokes a global food crisis that could lead to famine in Africa and Asia, and will certainly end in large-scale political chaos in countries where food price stability is a key factor of domestic security.

So where is the security that the Security Council must guarantee? There is no security. Although there is a Security Council, as if nothing happened.

So where is the peace that the United Nations was created to guarantee?

It is obvious that the key institution of the world, which must ensure the coercion of any aggressors to peace, simply cannot work effectively.

Now the world has seen what the Russian military did in Bucha while keeping our city under occupation. But the world has yet to see what they have done in other occupied cities, in other occupied areas of our country.

Geography may be different, but cruelty is the same. Crimes are the same.

And responsibility must be inevitable.

Ladies and Gentlemen!

I would like to remind you of the first article of the first chapter of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? To maintain peace. And to force to peace. Now the UN Charter is being violated literally from the first article. And if so, what is the point of all other articles?

Today, it is as a result of Russia's actions on the territory of my state, on the territory of Ukraine, that the most heinous war crimes of all time since the end of World War II are being committed.

Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes.

They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation in them. They are deliberately shooting at columns of civilians on the roads who are trying to escape from the territory of hostilities.

They are even deliberately blowing up shelters where civilians are hiding from air strikes. They are deliberately creating conditions in the temporarily occupied territories so that as many civilians as possible are killed there.

The massacre in our city of Bucha is just one, unfortunately, of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for 41 days.

And there are many other such places that the world has yet to find out the full truth of: Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Okhtyrka, Borodyanka and dozens of other Ukrainian communities, each of which is like Bucha.

I know, and you know very well, what the representatives of Russia will say in response to the accusations of these crimes. They have said this many times. The most illustrative was after the downing of a Malaysian Boeing over Donbas by Russian forces with Russian weapons. Or during the war in Syria.

They will blame everyone, just to justify themselves. They will say that there are different versions, and which of them is true is allegedly impossible to establish yet. They will even say that the bodies of those killed were allegedly “planted”, and all the videos are staged.

But. Now is the year 2022. There is conclusive evidence. There are satellite images. It is possible to conduct a full, transparent investigation.

That is what we are interested in.

Maximum access of journalists. Maximum cooperation with international institutions. Involvement of the International Criminal Court. Full truth, full responsibility.

I am sure that every state in the UN system should be interested in this. For what? In order to punish once and for all those who consider themselves privileged, consider themselves unpunished. Hence, to show all other potential war criminals in the world that they will inevitably be punished as well. If the biggest is punished, everyone will be punished.

Why did Russia come to Ukraine, tell me?

I will answer. Russia's leadership feels like colonizers - as in ancient times. They need our wealth and our people. Russia has already deported tens of thousands of our citizens to its territory. Then there will be hundreds. It abducted more than two thousand children. Simply abducted thousands of children. And continues to do so. Russia wants to turn Ukrainians into silent slaves.

The Russian militaries are openly looting the cities and villages they have captured. This is looting of the highest scale. They steal everything from food to gold earrings they just rip out with blood.

We are dealing with a state that turns the right of veto in the UN Security Council into a right to kill.

Which undermines the whole architecture of global security.

Which allows evil to go unpunished and spread the world. Destroying everything that can work for peace and security.

If this continues, the finale will be that each state will rely only on the power of arms to ensure its security, not on international law, not on international institutions.

Then, the UN can simply be dissolved.

Ladies and Gentlemen!

Are you ready for the dissolving of the UN? Do you think that the time of international law has passed?

If your answer is no, you need to act now, act immediately.

The power of the UN Charter must be restored immediately.

The UN system must be reformed immediately so that the right of veto is not a right to kill. So that there is a fair representation of all regions of the world in the Security Council.

The aggressor must be forced to peace immediately. Determination is needed. The chain of mass killings from Syria to Somalia, from Afghanistan to Yemen and Libya should have been stopped a long time ago to be honest.

If tyranny had ever received such a response to the war it had unleashed that it would have ceased to exist and a fair peace would have been guaranteed after it, the world would have changed for sure.

And then, perhaps, we would not have a war, a war in my country. Against our nation, the Ukrainian nation. Against people.

But the world watched and did not want to see the occupation of Crimea, or even before - the war against Georgia, or even earlier - the alienation from Moldova of the entire Transnistrian region. It also didn’t want to see how Russia was preparing the ground for other conflicts and wars near its borders.

How to stop it?

Immediately bring the Russian military and those who gave them orders to justice for war crimes in Ukraine.

Everyone who gave criminal orders and fulfilled them by killing people will face a tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials.

I want to remind Russian diplomats that a man like von Ribbentrop has not avoided punishment after World War II.

And I also want to remind the architects of Russia's criminal policy that punishment has reached Adolf Eichmann as well.

None of the culprits will escape. No one.

But the main thing is that today is the time to transform the system, the core of which is the United Nations. To do this, we propose to convene a global conference. And we ask to do it already in peaceful Kyiv - in order to decide.

How we will reform the world security system.

How we will really guarantee the inviolability of universally recognized borders and the integrity of states.

How we will ensure the rule of international law.

It is now clear that the goals set in San Francisco in 1945 during the creation of a global international security organization have not been achieved. And it is impossible to achieve them without reforms.

Therefore, we must do everything in our power to pass on to the next generations an effective UN with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and thus guarantee peace.

Prevent aggression and force aggressors to peace. Have the determination and ability to punish if the principles of peace are violated.

There can be no more exceptions, privileges. Everyone must be equal. All participants in international relations. Regardless of economic strength, geographical area and individual ambitions.

The power of peace must become dominant. The power of justice and the power of security. As humanity has always dreamed of.

Ukraine is ready to provide a platform for one of the main offices of the updated security system.

Just as the Geneva office specializes in human rights, just as the Nairobi office specializes in the field of environmental protection, the Kyiv U-24 Office can specialize in preventive measures to maintain peace.

I want to remind you of our peaceful mission in Afghanistan. When, at our own expense, we Ukrainians evacuated more than a thousand people from this country. And it was the hottest phase. But people needed help - and Ukraine came. Just like other states.

We evacuated people of different nationalities, different faiths. Afghans, citizens of European countries, USA, Canada. We did not distinguish who needs help, whether these are our people or not. We saved everyone.

If every time there was a need everyone in the world was confident that help would come, the world would be definitely safer.

Therefore, Ukraine has the necessary moral right to propose a reform of the world security system.

We have proven that we help others not only in good times, but also in dark times.

And now we need decisions from the Security Council. For peace in Ukraine. If you do not know how to adopt this decision, you can do two things.

Remove Russia as an aggressor and a source of war from blocking decisions about its own aggression, its own war. And then do everything that can establish peace.

Or show how you can reformat and really work for peace.

Or if your current format is unalterable and there is simply no way out, then the only option would be to dissolve yourself altogether.

I am convinced that you can do without the third option.

Ukraine needs peace. We need peace. Europe needs peace. The world needs peace.

And finally, I’m asking you to watch the video. A short one.

A video of what has come to replace your power because someone alone can abuse his rights.

This is what impunity leads to.

If possible - watch this video. Because there is no opportunity for everyone to come to us and see it. So watch it.

Thank you.",https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/vistup-prezidenta-ukrayini-na-zasidanni-radi-bezpeki-oon-74121

Editor's note: This story contains descriptions of violence that some may find disturbing.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an impassioned speech to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, urging representatives not to let permanent member Russia continue to go unpunished for what he described as ""the most terrible war crimes"" since World War II.

His remarks come a day after he visited the city of Bucha, where bodies were found in the streets and in basements after the withdrawal of Russian forces. Zelenskyy described the alleged atrocities there and said the world is likely to see similar horrors in other cities still occupied by Russia — in addition to large-scale consequences like food insecurity and political chaos far beyond Ukraine's borders.

Zelenskyy called on the Security Council to implement internal reforms to hold Russia — and, as he put it, other would-be war criminals — accountable, and he urged it to remove Russia as a member ""so it cannot block decisions about ... its own war."" If not, he said, it should ""dissolve"" itself.

Zelenskyy urged the council to act immediately to stop the Russian invasion, and called for a war crimes tribunal — like the Nuremberg trials after World War II — to hold Russia accountable.

He also described the role that Ukraine could play in this process, saying that it has a ""moral right"" to propose reforms of the world security system since it has helped people from other conflict-ridden countries, such as Afghanistan, in their times of need.

Zelenskyy suggested convening a global conference to discuss how to enforce U.N. goals such as guaranteeing recognition of borders. And he also proposed opening a ""preventative"" U.N. office in Kyiv that would focus on promoting peace.

""We must do everything in our power to pass onto the next generation an effective U.N. with the ability to respond preventively to security challenges and thus guarantee peace, prevent aggression and force aggressors to peace,"" he said at one point.

Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's ambassador to the U.N., later repeated Russia's claims without evidence that Ukraine had staged the scenes in Bucha and said that civilians were allowed to move around freely, use their cell phones and leave the town while it was under Russian control. He accused Western countries of ""fueling anti-Russian hysteria"" by painting Russian soldiers as murderers and rapists, which he called ""an incredibly low blow.""

Zelenskyy doubts the council's ability to hold Russia accountable

It's difficult for the Security Council — the U.N.'s most powerful body — to hold Russia accountable for its war in Ukraine because it is a permanent council member with veto power. Russia has downplayed its objective in the country and dismissed allegations of war crimes as untrue and has voted against multiple resolutions that would have it withdraw its troops.

Zelenskyy warned that if Russia goes unpunished, countries will be reliant on their own arms for security, rather than international law and institutions.

He reminded his audience that the opening chapter of the U.N. charter aims to maintain peace and then said it has been violated ""literally starting with Article 1.""

""Where is the security that the Security Council was supposed to guarantee?"" Zelenskyy asked, highlighting a common criticism of the U.N.'s ability to make its members fulfill the promises of Article 1 of the U.N Charter to maintain peace. Zelenskyy also highlighted the unlikelihood of the U.N. to take action in light of Russia's permanent seat on the Security Council and its veto power.

""Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to close the U.N.? Do you think the time for international order is gone?"" he asked.

If the answer is no, he said, then action must be taken immediately to restore the U.N. charter and punish Russia.

He pointed to Syria, Somalia, Afghanistan and Yemen and said that if such atrocities had been punished earlier and not allowed to drag on, perhaps there would not be a war in Ukraine now.

So how can the world respond now? Zelenskyy said that anyone in the Russian military who gave or carried out criminal orders should be brought before a tribunal and held accountable.

He also urged the council to remove Russia ""as an aggressor and a source of war"" so that it cannot block responses to its own acts of violence.

""If there is no alternative and no option, then the next option would be: dissolve yourself altogether,"" Zelenskyy added.

Zelenskyy says Bucha is 'only one example'

Zelenskyy also said that there is not a single crime that Russian forces ""will not commit."" He compared their actions to those of terrorist groups such as ISIS, with the only difference being that Russia sits on the Security Council.

Describing the scene in Bucha, near Kyiv, he accused Russian troops of killing entire families and trying to burn their bodies, torturing people, shooting them on the streets, throwing people into wells, killing them in their homes and using tanks to crush cars with civilians inside ""just for their pleasure.""

In even more graphic detail, he described them cutting off limbs, slashing throats, raping and killing women in front of their children and pulling out peoples' tongues ""only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them.""

Zelenskyy said that Russia needs Ukraine's wealth and its people, saying it has deported hundreds of thousands of citizens to Russia, abducted children and is aiming to turn Ukraine ""into silent slaves."" He also alleged that the Russian military is openly looting the cities and villages it has occupied, stealing everything from food supplies to ""gold earrings that are pulled out and covered with blood.""

Zelenskyy said the scenes in Bucha are ""unfortunately only one example of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past 41 days."" NPR has not independently confirmed the reports.

Russia has denied these reports and accused Ukraine of staging the killings in Bucha. Zelenskyy said such denials are part of a classic tactic to say that there are different narratives and that it's impossible to establish which one is the truth.

""But it is 2022 now,"" he said. ""We have conclusive evidence, satellite images, we can conduct full and transparent investigations.""

He called for such an investigation, as well as maximum access to journalists, cooperation of international organizations and the involvement of the International Criminal Court, of which neither Russia nor Ukraine is a member.

""Geography may be different or various, but cruelty is the same, crimes are the same, and accountability must be inevitable,"" he said.

9:30 pm: Russian forces' blockade still restricting evacuation of Mariupol, Ukraine says

People in the besieged city of Mariupol are still only able to flee on foot or by private car as efforts to organise mass evacuations by bus to safer parts of Ukraine have failed, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in an online post.

A total of 3,846 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Tuesday, slightly more than the 3,376 who escaped on Monday, the deputy prime minister said.

Vereshchuk said seven buses trying to get to Mariupol had not managed to make their way through a Russian blockade to reach the first part of the evacuation route out of the city.

Efforts to evacuate civilians in Mariupol – some with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) – have repeatedly broken down, with both sides in the war blaming each other.

6:14 pm: Zelensky invokes Nazi bombing of Guernica in address to Spanish parliament

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday compared Russia's devastating assault on his country to the Nazis' 1937 bombing of the town of Guernica in an address to Spain's parliament.

""It's April 2022 but it seems like April 1937 when the whole world heard about one of your cities, Guernica,"" he told lawmakers of the atrocity when aircraft from Hitler's ""Condor Legion"" carpet-bombed Guernica during Spain's 1936-1939 civil war in support of General Francisco Franco's nationalist forces.

Hundreds of people were killed, many of whom were at a weekly market in the town centre, in an atrocity that shocked the world and was immortalised in Picasso's haunting anti-war painting.

Historians give an estimated death toll of between 150 and 300 people, while local authorities give a much higher figure of 1,654.

4:58 pm: Zelensky says Ukraine has suffered 'most terrible war crimes' since World War II

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said “the most terrible war crimes in the world” since World War II are being committed in while speaking to the UN Security Council via video.

Zelensky described scenes of rape, torture and killing of civilians in Ukraine. He said “hundreds of thousands” of Ukrainians had been deported to Russia.

He said the civilian deaths recently documented in Bucha were “only one example” of what Russian forces have been doing throughout Ukraine since the war began and said more evidence of war crimes will emerge.

He said, for Russia, “accountability must be inevitable”.

Zelensky called for the UN to “act immediately” and expel Russia from the UN Security Council. He also called for reform of the international body. “We must do everything in our power to pass on to the next generation an effective UN with the power to take preventative action to ensure peace,” he said.

4:43 pm: Claims Russia used cluster bombs in Ukraine are 'credible', UN says

A top UN official told the 15-member Security Council including Moscow's envoy on Tuesday of ""credible"" claims Russia has used indiscriminate cluster munitions at least two dozen times in populated parts of Ukraine.

UN human rights body ""OHCHR has received credible allegations that Russian forces have used cluster munitions in populated areas at least 24 times,"" UN undersecretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, told the meeting on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

She said the global body was ""gravely concerned by the persistent use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area"",saying such weapons are causing the most civilian casualties in the war.

""Against the backdrop of global food shortages, this year we will have to be prudent with supplies abroad and carefully monitor such exports to countries that are clearly hostile towards us,"" Putin said at a meeting.

3:23 pm: NATO chief fears 'more atrocities' will be discovered in Ukraine

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday he feared there were ""more atrocities"" to be discovered in areas of Ukraine that were occupied by Russian troops.

""When and if they withdraw the troops and Ukrainian troops take over, I'm afraid they will see more mass graves, more atrocities and more examples of war crimes,"" he told a media conference.

3:04 pm: EU proposes fifth set of sanctions on Russia including coal ban

The European Union’s executive branch has proposed a ban on coal imports from Russia in what would be the first sanctions targeting the country’s lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday that the EU needed to increase the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin after what she described as the “heinous crimes” carried out around Kyiv.

Von der Leyen said the ban on coal imports is worth €4 billion per year. She added that the EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

Von der Leyen didn’t mention natural gas. A consensus among the 27 EU member countries on targeting gas that’s used to generate electricity, heat homes and power industry would be more difficult to secure.

The site faces up to 4 million Roubles ($48,000) in fines.

10:02 am: Denmark expels 15 Russian diplomats over Bucha killings

The Danish government has decided to expel 15 Russian diplomats following reports of mass graves being found and of civilian killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, according to Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod. The 15 expelled diplomats are accused of spying, he explained.

Russia responded by saying it would retaliate the move.

09:44 am: Kyiv mayor estimates ‘almost 20,000’ Russian troops have died in Ukraine

Kyiv’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko on Tuesday estimated Russian troop losses at “almost 20,000” since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24, without citing evidence of his claim.

Russia, meanwhile, has only confirmed 498 casualties so far – a number that was made public in the beginning of March but which has not been updated since then.

Death tolls in the conflict have been extremely difficult for independent observers to verify due to the lack of trustworthy information and the challenges of accessing the most violence-fraught areas.

Last week, however, NATO estimated that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the conflict.

“After negotiations, they were released during the night and sent to Zaporizhzhia,” she said referring to a nearby city.

The team had been aiming to reach the besieged city of Mariupol on Monday and evacuate some of the remaining residents who are lacking basic supplies. It was their fourth such attempt since Friday.

""The new sanctions will probably be adopted tomorrow,"" Beaune told RFI radio on Tuesday, adding the EU should also quickly act on gas and coal imports from Russia.

Russia denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha. Its envoy to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, said Russia will present ""empirical evidence"" to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday showing its forces were not involved in atrocities.

07:57 am: ‘Extraordinary defeat of Russian forces’ in Bucha

Despite the massive destruction and dead civilians they allegedly left behind them, Russian forces do not seem to have retreated from the town of Bucha, near Kyiv, voluntarily, but rather because they faced an “extraordinary defeat” by Ukrainian troops. “It was clearly not an orderly withdrawal from these areas. There are destroyed Russian military vehicles absolutely everywhere,” FRANCE 24’s Ukraine correspondent Gulliver Cragg reports.

6:30 am: Ukraine’s Zelensky to address UN Security Council

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will address the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday after saying it is in Kyiv’s interest to have the most open investigation into the killing of civilians in Ukraine.

He said that in Bucha, where mass graves and bodies were found after Ukraine took the town back from Russian forces, at least 300 civilians have been killed, and he expects that in Borodyanka and other towns the number of casualties may be even higher.

The speech will be Zelensky's first to the UN body since Russia's invasion. It comes after he made an emotional trip to Bucha outside the capital, where dozens of bodies were discovered after the withdrawal of Russian troops.

Horrific images of corpses lying in the streets, some with their hands bound behind them, have drawn international condemnation.

4:04 am: Moscow warns of ‘symmetrical’ response to Western countries’ expulsion of Russian diplomats

Russia will respond proportionately to the expulsion of its diplomats from a number of Western countries, Russian ex-president and deputy head of security council Dmitry Medvedev said late on Monday.

“Everyone knows the answer: it will be symmetrical and destructive for bilateral relations,” Medvedev said in a posting on his Telegram channel.

“Who have they punished? First of all, themselves.”

On Monday, France said it would expel 35 Russian diplomats over Moscow’s actions in Ukraine and Germany declared “significant number” of Russian diplomats as undesirable.

“If this continues, it will be fitting, as I wrote back on 26th February – to slam shut the door on Western embassies,” Medvedev said. “It will be cheaper for everyone. And then we will end up just looking at each other in no other way than through gunsights.”

5,23cd8638-45f0-4c30-aa9e-14ec48abd76c,['Richard Pérez-Peña'],2022-04-05,"With evidence mounting of atrocities in the Kyiv suburbs, and Russian forces preparing for a new offensive farther east, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine delivered a scathing speech to the United Nations on Tuesday, accusing Russia of a litany of horrors and questioning whether a world body that takes no action to stop a war serves any purpose.

Speaking via video link to the U.N. Security Council, he compared Russian forces to the Islamic State, called for a Nuremberg-like war crimes tribunal and vented his bitter frustration, knowing that the council — where Russia is one of five permanent members with veto power — would do nothing but talk.

“Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?” Mr. Zelensky said, raising the question of whether Russia deserved to keep its seat on the council. “Are you ready to close the U.N.? Do you think that the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately.”

The chamber fell silent as a short video provided by Mr. Zelensky’s government played, showing some of the hundreds of corpses found strewn around the city of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, after Russian forces retreated last week — bloated, charred bodies of civilians, including children. Some victims, their hands bound, had been shot in the head.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/zelensky-un-security-council.html

People tortured and summarily executed, their hands sometimes tied behind their backs. Throats slashed and limbs cut off. Women raped and killed in front of their children.

These were just some of the nightmarish scenes that unfolded under Russian occupation in the Ukrainian city of Bucha, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the United Nations Security Council in a virtual address on Tuesday.

""There is not a single crime they would not commit there,"" Zelensky said, comparing Russian fighters to ISIS militants and Nazi war criminals.

Zelensky's speech came a day after he visited Bucha, a small suburban city northwest of Kyiv that Ukraine retook from Russians in the past week, to see the devastation for himself. He described what he saw as among the worst war crimes since World War II.



""Now the world can see what the Russian military did in Bucha,"" Zelensky told the Security Council. ""The world has yet to see what they have done in other occupied cities and regions of our country.""",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/ukraine-bucha-zelensky-united-nations

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of indiscriminately killing civilians “just for their pleasure” in an emotionally-charged address to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, before questioning the very mandate of the Security Council itself.

Zelensky’s speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend.

On Tuesday, he related the aftermath of Russia’s retreat from the town in horrifying detail, describing entire families killed, people with their throats slashed, and women raped and killed in front of their children. Zelensky said Russia’s actions were no different from those of a terror group, except that Russia is a permanent member of the UNSC.

The Ukrainian leader then criticized the body, asking representatives point blank: “Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee? It is not there, though there is a Security Council.”

Zelensky added: “It is obvious that the key institution of the world designed to combat aggression and ensure peace cannot work effectively.

“Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you of Article 1, Chapter 1 of the UN Charter. What is the purpose of our organization? Its purpose is to maintain and make sure that peace is adhered to. And now the UN charter is violated literally starting with Article 1. And so what is the point of all other Articles?” he asked.

At least 1,480 civilians have been killed and at least 2,195 have been injured in Ukraine between the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 and April 4, a UN official said at the meeting, citing updated numbers from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). The latest figures on the number of Ukrainian civilians in the conflict had “more than doubled” since the last briefing to the UNSC on March 17.

In Bucha, bodies strewn across the streets and in basements were found by human rights groups and documented by independent journalists. Satellite images suggest some bodies had been there since at least March 18.

In his damning speech, Zelensky said there was “not a single crime” that the Russians “would not commit,” alleging that Russian troops had “searched for and purposefully killed anyone who served our country.”

“They shot and killed women outside their houses when they just tried to call someone … They killed entire families, adults and children and they tried to burn the bodies,” Zelensky said.

“I am addressing you on behalf of the people who honor the memory of the deceased every single day and in the memory of the civilians who died, who were shot and killed in the back of their head after being tortured,” he told the UNSC.

“Some of them were shot on the streets. Others were thrown into wells, so they died there suffering. They were killed in their apartments, houses, blown up by grenades. Civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road, just for their pleasure,” he continued. “Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them.”

Zelensky also warned that the horrors found in Bucha would be replicated in other cities across Ukraine. Demanding accountability, he called for any Russians who have given “criminal orders” and “carried out them by killing our people” to be brought before a tribunal, similar to the Nuremberg trials that occurred after World War II when Nazis were put on trial.

UN: Civilians were targeted

Separately, the United Nations on Tuesday said that the shocking images from Bucha showed “all the signs” that civilians were “directly targeted and directly killed.”

In a virtual press briefing, OHCHR spokesperson Liz Throssell said the reports emerging from Bucha and other areas were “very disturbing developments.”

She specifically referenced the “disturbing” images of people with their hands tied behind their back and of partially naked women whose bodies have been burnt as further evidence suggesting the direct targeting of individuals.

“We have been talking about war crimes in the context of shelling, bombardment, and artillery attacks. Now they need to be investigated. But you could argue there was a military context, for example, to a building being hit. It’s hard to see what was the military context of an individual lying in the street with a bullet to the head or having their bodies burned,” Throssell continued.

As the OHCHR is trying to currently gain access to Bucha, she didn’t have “exact information” to share regarding the situation on the ground.

Throssell also paid tribute to the “crucial role” that journalists are playing in documenting these scenes, mentioning the “multiple teams” involved in “reporting, analyzing, and sending video footage.”

Russia’s response

Russia has repeatedly denied the alleged atrocities, despite increasing evidence suggesting otherwise. Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations responded to Zelensky’s remarks, calling the accusations against the Russian military “ungrounded.”

“We place on your conscience the ungrounded accusations against the Russian military, which are not confirmed by any eyewitnesses,” Nebenzia said in translated remarks.

The ambassador recalled Zelensky’s election to the Ukrainian presidency in 2019, stating that hopes that Zelensky would end the fighting in the Donbas region of Ukraine “failed to materialize.”

Nebenzia also repeated past claims that “a huge amount of lies about Russian soldiers and military” continue to proliferate.

Addressing Zelensky directly, Nebenzia concluded his remarks by claiming Russia “came to … Ukraine” to bring peace, not to “conquer lands.”

Nebenzia’s words echoed those of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov earlier Tuesday, who called the allegations not only “groundless, but … a well-staged tragic show” and “a forgery in order to try to denigrate the Russian army.”
