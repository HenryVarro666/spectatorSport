0,864d35e1-7efe-40b9-9407-ffd1e23ce02b,[],,"President Biden will announce Friday that the U.S., European Union and G7 countries will move to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status over its invasion of Ukraine, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.

Mr. Biden's move comes as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called on him to revoke what is formally known as ""permanent normal trade relations"" with Russia. It would allow the U.S. and allies to impose tariffs on Russian imports.

Meanwhile, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted Thursday night that the Biden administration is receiving reports that ""Russia may be considering seizing the assets of U.S. and international companies that have announced plans to suspend operations in Russia or to withdraw from the Russian market.""

She said the possible Russian retaliation would ""ultimately result in even more economic pain for Russia"" and ""compound the clear message to the global business community that Russia is not a safe place to invest and do business.""

Within the past few days, companies such as Starbucks, McDonald's, Hilton Worldwide Hotels, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo., have announced changes to their operations in Russia. Psaki reiterated Thursday night that each company had made its decision independent of the U.S. government.

""We stand with American companies who are making tough decisions regarding the future of their Russian operations,"" Psaki wrote.

On Capitol Hill, the Senate approved a $1.5 trillion omnibus spending bill that includes a $13.6 billion emergency package of military and humanitarian aid for besieged Ukraine and its European allies. The vote was 68-31.

""We promised the Ukrainian people they would not go at it alone in their fight against Putin,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said just before the vote. ""And once we pass this funding in a short while, we will keep that promise.""

The bill now heads to Mr. Biden's desk, and he is all but certain to sign it.

On the ground in Ukraine, a convoy of Russian forces outside of Kyiv appeared to dissolve, according to satellite images obtained by the AP. Ukrainian forces, as well as reported food and fuel shortages, slowed the convoy's advance.

However, Russian forces continue to launch airstrikes on swaths of the country, including coastal towns.

Leaders from across the world are expected to convene on Friday morning after Russia hastily called a U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss in open debate what it called ""the military biological activities of the US on the territory of Ukraine"" — leading the Biden administration to immediately denounce it as a ""false flag effort.""

US President Joe Biden announces a ban on US imports of Russian oil and gas, March 8, 2022, from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, DC. The announcement tightens unprecedented economic sanctions punishing Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. The ban is partly a response to strong bipartisan pressure from Congress, despite the impact the announcement is likely to have on already soaring domestic gas prices.

CNN —

President Joe Biden on Friday called for suspending normal trade relations with Russia and said the US would ban imports of seafood, vodka and diamonds from the nation as part of an effort to ramp up economic pressure on Russia for invading Ukraine.

Biden said the US, along with the G7 and European Union, will call for revoking “most favored nation” status for Russia, referred to as permanent normal trade relations in the US. The status means two nations have agreed to trade under the best possible terms, which can include lower tariffs, fewer barriers to trade and high imports, Biden said.

The move requires approval from Congress and legislation is expected to be introduced following Biden’s announcement.

“Revoking PNTR for Russia is going to make it harder for Russia to do business with the United States and doing it in unison with other nations that make up half of the global economy will be another crushing blow to the Russian economy that’s already suffering very badly from our sanctions,” Biden said.

The President said, “Many issues divide us in Washington, but standing for democracy in Ukraine, pushing Russia’s aggression should not be one of those issues. The free world is coming together to confront Putin.”

The President also thanked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for being a “strong advocate” on this issue and for holding off on the legislation in the House of Representatives “until I could line up all of our key allies to keep us in complete unison.”

Biden announced the US would ban goods from several signature sectors of Russia’s economy, including seafood, vodka and non-industrial diamonds. The White House says this will deny Russia more than $1 billion in export revenues.

The President will also sign an executive order ending the exportation of luxury items – including spirits, tobacco, clothing, jewelry, cars and antiques – to Russia.

Biden spent 49 minutes on the phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday as he laid out in detail the new measures he was about to announce regarding US trade with Russia, two officials familiar with the call told CNN.

While most of the calls between the two leaders since Russia’s invasion have hovered in the 30- to 40-minute range, this was one was a bit longer as Biden highlighted how the US was moving to suspend normal trade relations in another effort to punish the Kremlin.

Zelensky tweeted that he had given Biden an “assessment of the situation on the battlefield, informed about the crimes of Russia against the civilian population” and they had agreed on “further steps to support the defense of Ukraine and increase sanctions against Russia.”

A White House official told CNN the administration’s goal is to continue hurting Russian oligarchs and the country’s wealthiest people by depriving them of their creature comforts, as the US continues to try to put pressure around those close to Putin. It is also aimed at removing ways for these oligarchs to shelter their money, as they are already increasingly closed off from traditional financial avenues, the official said.

The US imported 48,867 metric tons of seafood from Russia in 2021, worth about $1.2 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Crab accounted for the largest portion of those imports, with the US buying more than $900 million worth of frozen snow and red king crab last year. The US does not sell any seafood directly to Russia, as the country banned US exports of seafood and fish in 2014.

Imports of Russian vodka to the United States accounted for only 1.3% of total vodka imports in in 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. The total amounts to $18.5 million dollars in 2021, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said.

The President also announced G7 leaders would seek to deny Russia the ability from borrowing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

“We’re going to continue to squeeze Putin,” Biden said, adding that “Putin must pay the price,” for launching an unprovoked attack on Ukraine.

“The G7 is also stepping up pressure on corrupt Russian billionaires — we’re adding new names to the list of oligarchs and their families that we’re targeting and we’re increasing coordination among the G7 countries to target and capture their ill begotten gains. They support Putin. They steal from the Russian people and they seek to hide their money in our countries,” Biden said.

CNN reported Thursday that bipartisan talks in the Senate had been taking shape to take more aggressive action on Russia’s trade status – after the White House effectively watered down the House-passed bill banning importing Russian oil, natural gas and coal into the US.

The earlier version of the legislation had included a provision that would suspend permanent normal trade relations for Russia and Belarus. But the White House expressed concerns over that part of the bill, and ultimately it was excised. The bill banning Russian energy imports that passed the House Wednesday night instead simply called for a review of Russia’s status in the World Trade Organization.

Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, a Democrat of Oregon, told CNN that he was engaging in talks with the top tax writers in Congress and the Biden administration about the matter, as pressure grew to include tougher language in the House bill when the Senate takes it up – as soon as next week.

“I believe the Russians – the inhumane behavior of Russia does not justify it to get the fruits of the international community,” Wyden told CNN.

Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican and the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, said he probably wouldn’t support the House bill without stronger language on its trade status – and made clear there would be an effort to amend it.

“The question is PNTR, which is absent. And then they had some other stuff on the WTO in there, which is kind of hollow if we don’t do PNTR,” Crapo said earlier in the day. “So, I probably would not support it because it doesn’t have the key things that you need for a proper trade response.”

Top Democrats and Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee announced a deal earlier this week that would have moved to suspend normal trade relations between the U.S. and Moscow.

But the provision was left out of a bill to sanction Russia and ban its energy imports that passed in the House on Wednesday.

Biden's expected Friday announcement would put Moscow's trade relationship with the U.S. in the same category as North Korea and Cuba.

Washington: President Joe Biden will announce Friday that, along with the European Union and the Group of Seven countries, the US will move to revoke ""most favored nation"" trade status for Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

That's according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the announcement. The person said each country would have to follow its own national processes. Stripping most favored nation status from Russia would allow the US and allies to impose tariffs on Russian imports, increasing the isolation of the Russian economy in retaliation for the invasion.

Biden's move comes as bipartisan pressure has been building in Washington to revoke what is formally known as ""permanent normal trade relations"" with Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed the US and allies to take the action against Russia in remarks to Congress over the weekend. It follows days after the Biden moved to ban imports of Russian oil and gas products.

Biden, after initially slow-walking congressional efforts to take the trade action against Russia, was set to embrace lawmaker efforts to do just that on Friday.

The White House said Biden would speak Friday morning to announce ""actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.""

On Monday, Democrats on the powerful House Ways & Means Committee posted, then removed, an announcement on a bipartisan bill to ban Russian oil imports and slap further trade sanctions on the country, according to an aide, because of pushback from the White House against acting before Biden had coordinated with allies and reached a decision on both matters. The House voted Wednesday on a narrower bill to ban Russian energy imports after Biden instituted the ban by executive order.

Canada was the first major US ally to remove most favored nation status for Russia last week.

Biden's action was first reported by Bloomberg News.

The revoked status, if passed by Congress, would clear the way for increased tariffs on Russian imports in the U.S. and around the world.

The 'most favored nation' trade status applies to members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and allows countries with the status to trade freely and fairly with each other.

Each country is expected to implement its own measures on trading with Russia after its status gets revoked, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Friday's announcements would serve as yet another economic blow to Russia and President Vladimir Putin as it allows more tariffs to be imposed on Russian imports

Earlier this week, Congress imposed its latest economic blow against Russia by banning Russian energy imports, just shy of revoking the 'most favored nation' status.

The trade leaders in the House and Senate announced the deal in a statement as the White House sought to balance a desire to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine while seeking to avoid sending U.S. energy prices still higher.

'Taking these actions will send a clear message to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin that his war is unacceptable and the United States stands firmly with our NATO allies,' the lawmakers said.

The statement was issued by House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal and Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden, both Democrats, and their Republican counterparts, Representative Kevin Brady and Senator Mike Crapo.

In a rare show of bipartisanship, lawmakers on both sides approved the measure 414-17, with just 15 Republicans voting against it, as well as Squad members Cori Bush and Ilhan Omar.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced ahead of a vote to ban Russian oil on Wednesday that she's 'so pleased the president' had moved to do so

What does 'energy independence' mean? Both Democrats and Republican lawmakers are calling for a path to American energy independence, though they have different ideas about how to get it done. To be 'energy independent' means to export more oil, gas and coal than is imported each year. In theory it could also describe a nation that exclusively exists on its own fuel sources -- though with a vast number of global transit lines and how natural resources are distributed around the country, the latter definition is near impossible to achieve in the US. Americans consumed roughly 20 million barrels of liquid fuel per day in 2021, according to the Energy Information Administration. The United States exported an average 8,632 barrels of crude oil and petroleum per day last year. And as of February 25, the EIA stated there were 580 million barrels in the strategic reserve. However even if the US were to produce more oil than it buys -- as was the case in 2020 -- it would still be far costlier and more cumbersome for energy companies to sell that oil in parts of the country. For example, the Wall Street Journal points out that oil companies shipped about 3 million barrels per day out of the US Gulf Coast. Pipelines from the Gulf Coast lead to the southwestern Permian Basin and the crude oil storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma that's home to 14% of total US oil storage. Thanks to the 1920 Jones Act, US companies are limited in the size of ships they can use to transport goods between domestic ports. That effectively makes it costlier for oil to be shipped from there to the East and West Coasts, for example, which have more direct access to overseas markets. Advertisement

The bill is now headed to the Senate and goes further than just banning oil.

It encourages a review of Russia's status in the World Trade Organization and calls for strengthening the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which authorizes the U.S. government to sanction those it sees as violating human rights, freeze their assets and ban them from entering the country.

It comes after many in Congress had pushed for weeks for a ban on Russian oil - with some seeing it as a way to punish Russian officials for alleged human rights violations.

But the Biden administration had been reluctant to act out of fear of increasing already record-high gas prices throughout the country.

On Tuesday, the president changed course - announcing from the White House that the U.S. would indeed ban Russian oil.

Biden said the ban would 'deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine' after a vast number of sanctions targeting Russia's financial institutions and top officials were already levied in coordination with other western governments.

Oil imported from Russia amounts to less than 10 percent of the United States' oil imports, whereas many European countries rely on Russia's supply.

As of Wednesday, the average price of regular gasoline in the U.S. was $4.25 a gallon, setting an all-time record for the second day in a row, according to AAA.

That is an increase of 16 percent from just one week prior, and 22.5 percent higher from last month as Russia continues to bomb cities and towns in Ukraine - where residents are seeking shelter in underground tunnels.

The president admitted that the ban would impact American drivers as well, saying: 'The decision today is not without cost here at home. Putin's war is already hurting American families at the gas pump.

'Since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian borders, just since then, the price of the gas at the pump in America went up 75 cents.'

'And with this action it's going to go up further. I'm going to do everything I can to minimize Putin's price hike here at home,' he said, explaining that he made the decision in consultation with European allies - though they may not join the US in the oil ban.

'We're moving forward this ban understanding that many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us,' Biden said. 'The United States produces far more oil domestically than all of the European countries combined. In fact, we're a net exporter of energy. So we can take this step when others cannot.'

In fact, data from the Energy Information Administration show the US shifted to being a net importer of petroleum in 2021, and projected the same for 2022 last month. US oil production peaked under the Trump administration in 2019, before falling 8 percent the next year.

The US is now the world's top oil producer, with much of its imported oil coming from Canada.

The European Union is also aiming to cut its reliance on Russian gas by nearly 80 percent by the end of this year and the United Kingdom is expected to ban Russian oil.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10601265/US-allies-revoke-favored-nation-status-Russia.html
7,864d35e1-7efe-40b9-9407-ffd1e23ce02b,[],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"Washington (AFP) – US President Joe Biden intends to strip Russia of its preferential trade status, a move that would enable Washington to inflict steep tariff hikes on Moscow in retaliation for the invasion of Ukraine.

The move is set to be announced Friday, in coordination with the G7 and the European Union, according to a source familiar with the matter, who noted that Congress would have to make the final decision.

That is expected to be a formality, however, as US lawmakers have declared their support for a move to revoke normal trade relations with Russia.

The White House said Biden will ""announce actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.""

He is scheduled to speak at 10:15 am (1515 GMT).

The preferential trade status, known in the United States as permanent normal trade relations (PNTR), is a key principle of the World Trade Organization that requires member countries to guarantee equal tariff and regulatory treatment to other members.

Accorded by the United States to most countries in the world, with notable exceptions like Cuba and North Korea, the status also known as most favored nation grants imported goods from a country equal footing with other trading partners.

Stripping Moscow of the designation, granted in December 2012, would allow Biden to impose steep tariffs on Russian goods or restrict imports of some products.

The new trade sanction would cap several rounds of measures intended to sever Russia's economic and financial ties with the rest of the world over its invasion of ex-Soviet Ukraine.

They have included banning Russian oil imports, seizing the assets of billionaires tied to President Vladimir Putin, and freezing the nation's stockpile of cash.

Together, the moves have already pushed Moscow to the brink of a debt default.

Limited impact?

But those steps have also caused prices for key commodities, like gasoline and wheat, to soar, harming US consumers already facing the highest inflation in four decades.

And trade experts are dubious about whether new tariffs would be effective.

""US direct trade with Russia is relatively small, so higher tariffs would not do much damage to them but could raise costs for our manufacturers who rely on them for key raw materials,"" said William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

In addition, ""The additional damage this does to the trading system, while not immediate, could be significant,"" he said in an analysis.

The United States imported just under $30 billion in goods from Russia last year, including $17.5 billion in crude oil.

The IMF said Thursday that war and the sanctions will lead to a ""sharp contraction"" of the Russian economy, and lead to slower global growth.

The IMF this week approved a $1.4 billion in fast-disbursing aid for Ukraine, and the World Bank this week released nearly $500 million of what is expected to be a $3 billion financing package to aid the war-torn country.

US lawmakers meanwhile passed a huge spending bill on Thursday, including almost $14 billion in humanitarian and military aid to war-torn Ukraine, as the invasion by Russia entered its third week.

More than doubling from an initial $6.4 billion last week, the $13.6 billion relief includes aid for refugees, military aid and support for NATO allies in eastern Europe.
