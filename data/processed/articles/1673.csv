Russian forces launched coordinated missile and artillery attacks on Ukrainian cities on Saturday including the capital, Kyiv, where a curfew went into effect at 5pm local time. After Ukrainian forces said they had repulsed an attack on the capital overnight, President Volodymyr Zelensky shot a selfie-style video in the city centre vowing to stay and fight on.

Since Russia started its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Wednesday night, Russian troops have invaded more areas across the country. Follow the most important developments here. The latest updates appear highest on the page.

According to a statement by the Ukrainian armed forces on Saturday, Russian fighter jets have carried out attacks in Sumy in the northeast, Mariupol in the south and Poltava in the east.

In the capital Kyiv, buildings, including flats, have been hit by missiles, as shown in a video shared by the foreign affairs ministry. Civilians are resisting the attacks on the capital, resulting in intense street fighting and bursts of gunfire being heard.

Pro-Russian separatist fighters have reportedly advanced a total of 25 km into Ukrainian-controlled territory.

In its latest intelligence update, the British ministry of defence wrote that Russian forces are not making the progress they had planned, as they are suffering from logistical challenges and strong Ukrainian resistance. They are reportedly also sustaining casualties and a number of Russian troops have been taken prisoner.

Russian banks removed from SWIFT [23:30]

The European Union and its partners announced further economic measures in response to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

In a statement, the leaders of the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States also condemned Putin‚Äôs war of choice and attacks on the sovereign nation and people of Ukraine.

‚ÄúWe are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies,‚Äù European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated.

These measures include the removal of several Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the world‚Äôs largest global interbank payment system acting as an intermediary and executor of financial transactions between banks.

‚ÄúThis will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally. Cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports,‚Äù von der Leyen said.

Russia‚Äôs central bank‚Äôs assets will be paralysed, in essence meaning Putin will lose access to his so-called war chest, according to the statement. Von der Leyen added that the EU and its partners are working to prohibit Russian oligarchs from using their financial assets on their markets.

Specifically, the EU commits to taking measures to limit the sale of citizenship‚Äîso-called golden passports‚Äîthat let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of EU member states.

Protests in Brussels and other cities [16:35]

Protests against the attack on Ukraine took place in several cities across the world, including in Brussels, where thousands of people took to the streets in the centre of the capital and chanted ‚ÄúPutin, go home‚Äù and ‚ÄúStop Putin, stop the war.‚Äù

Some 4,500 protesters were believed to have gathered on the Boulevard du R√©gent, Ilse Van de keere, a spokesperson for the Brussels-Capital/Ixelles police, confirmed to The Brussels Times.

Ukrainian flags were omnipresent, as well as protest signs with slogans such as ‚ÄúClose the airspace, save our families‚Äù, ‚ÄúPutin, hands off Ukraine‚Äù and ‚ÄúUkraine is Europe.‚Äù

Van de keere said that the demonstration remained peaceful and that people have started to slowly disperse.

Protesters took to the streets of Russia‚Äôs St. Petersberg on Friday night, even after the police reportedly arrested thousands of anti-war demonstrators during demonstrations the previous night.

The Ukrainian army has called on the population to stop the Russian advance by any means possible. ‚ÄúCut down trees, build barricades, burn tyres. Use whatever you have at your disposal,‚Äù a statement published by the Ukrainian news agency Unian read.

The army also invites citizens to make Molotov cocktails. ‚ÄúThe invaders must understand that they are not welcome here and that at every corner they will find resistance. Together towards victory.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the Kremlin has accused Ukraine of scuppering a truce by refusing negotiations.

‚ÄúYesterday (Friday), expecting negotiations, the Russian president ordered a halt to the advance of Moscow‚Äôs main forces,‚Äù Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ‚ÄúSince the Ukrainian side refused negotiations, the advance of Russian forces resumed today,‚Äù he added.

Curfew in Kyiv [13:50]

The mayor of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, announced that a tougher curfew would be put in place because of the Russian invasion, warning that anyone on the street between 17:00 on Saturday and 8:00 Sunday morning would be treated as an enemy.

‚ÄúFor a more effective defence of the capital and the safety of its inhabitants, today, 26 February 2022, the curfew will be in force from 17:00 to 08:00. This curfew will be in force until the early evening of 28 February,‚Äù he said on Twitter.

Ukraine ‚Äòintercepted Russia‚Äôs plan‚Äô [12:20]

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday around noon that the country had ‚Äúbroken Russia‚Äôs plan‚Äù on the third day of the invasion of Ukraine, and called on Russians to tell Vladimir Putin to stop the war.

‚ÄúKyiv and key cities around the capital are controlled by our army. The occupants wanted to block the centre of our state like in Donetsk. We broke their idea,‚Äù he said in a video he published on Facebook.

Meanwhile, the former Russian president and current deputy chair of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said that the invasion in Ukraine will continue despite Western sanctions, said on the VKontakte social network.

‚ÄúThe military operation to protect the Donbass will be carried out relentlessly until all our goals are achieved. No more and no less,‚Äù he said, calling Western sanctions ‚Äúpolitical impotence resulting from the inability to change Russia‚Äôs course‚Äù.

He added that the Kremlin, in retaliation of sanctions imposed by Western countries, will seize money that foreigners and foreign companies have deposited in bank accounts in Russia.

198 Ukranian deaths in war so far [10:45]

In total, almost 200 people have lost their life in Ukraine. At least 35 people, including two children, were wounded in fighting in Kyiv on Friday night, according to a report by the mayor of the Ukrainian capital Klitschko said early on Saturday morning.

Local authorities warned of fighting in the streets on Saturday morning and called on residents to remain calm and cautious.

‚ÄúIf you are at home, don‚Äôt go to the window, don‚Äôt go to the balcony,‚Äù Ukrainian authorities said. Many residents spent the night in bunkers, basements and other underground shelters.

A 20-storey building was hit by a missile. Videos posted on social networks show a tall building with a gutted facade and debris lying in the street below.

Several tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens ‚Äî mainly women and children, as well as men who are not old enough to fight in the Ukrainian army ‚Äî have fled to Poland since the launch of the Russian offensive in Ukraine.

‚ÄúIn the past 24 hours, 35,000 people have crossed the Polish border,‚Äù Polish Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker said on state TVP on Friday evening.

The latest tally stated that the Ukrainian army had inflicted ‚Äúheavy losses‚Äù on the Russian army. Some 3,500 Russian soldiers have been said to be killed and 200 captured since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukrainian territory, however, these figures could not be independently verified.

An analysis of its own damage in a statement from state special communications service highlighted that sub-units of State Special Communications Service were one the first to take the hit from Russia.

It added that Russian occupiers struck the Joint Command Post of the Joint Forces Operation ‚ÄúChasiv Yar‚Äù in the province of Donetsk Oblast, during which a government communications centre was destroyed and various officers were injured or killed.

Meanwhile, Russia said it has ‚Äúdecommissioned‚Äù some 800 Ukrainian military objects since the war began, however, this too has not yet been verified.

‚ÄòWill not drop our weapons,‚Äô Ukraine president says

In a video shared on his social media channels, President of Ukraine Zelenskyy urged his citizens not to believe any false news about him asking the Ukrainian army to surrender. He pledged to fight as Russia‚Äôs invading forces are nearing his office.

‚ÄúI am here. We will not lay down any weapons. We will defend our state because our weapons are our truth,‚Äù he stated in a video on Saturday morning.

In an earlier video on Friday night, he had told the nation that ‚Äúwe must withstand tonight‚Äù as he warned of an impending Russian assault in Kyiv and other cities across the country.

Belgium to support Ukraine where possible

On Wednesday, the National Security Council decided that Belgium will send military protection material to Ukraine. However, weapons are not included, as Belgium needs them to be able to fulfil its commitments within the NATO framework.

By Friday, Belgian Foreign Affairs Sophie Wilm√®s said she wanted Defence to draw up a list of the weapons that Belgium could send to Ukraine. During a call with the country‚Äôs Foreign Affairs minister Dmytro Kuleba, Wilm√®s emphasised Belgium‚Äôs ‚Äúreadiness to evaluate our capacity to meet his country‚Äôs needs.‚Äù

During the Foreign Affairs Council in response to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine on the same day, the Council formally adopted the second sanctions package against Russia and partly Belarus, targetting financial institutions, certain exports in the energy sector, transport and dual-use goods.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said this conflict highlighted it is time to close the ‚Äúlong-standing discussion once and for all and decide on Ukraine‚Äôs membership in the European Union.‚Äù

He led the London Symphony Orchestra in New York in 2015.

Valery Gergiev, the star Russian maestro and prominent supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was removed Tuesday from his post as chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic after he refused to denounce Mr. Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.

And Anna Netrebko, the Russian diva who is one of opera‚Äôs biggest international stars and also has ties to Mr. Putin, saw her upcoming engagements with the Bavarian State Opera canceled, and the Zurich Opera House announced that she had withdrawn from her next performances there.

Mr. Gergiev‚Äôs abrupt dismissal, three years before his contract was set to expire, was the biggest setback yet for the conductor, who has been the target of widespread anger and condemnation in recent days for his long record of support for Mr. Putin, whom he has known for three decades.

Dieter Reiter, the mayor of Munich, said that Mr. Gergiev, who had held the post of chief conductor there since 2015, had failed to respond to a demand issued on Friday by Mr. Reiter that he condemn Mr. Putin‚Äôs ‚Äúbrutal war of aggression‚Äù by Monday or be fired.

‚ÄúI would have expected him to reconsider and revise his very positive assessment of Russia‚Äôs leader,‚Äù Mr. Reiter said in a statement. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Mr. Gergiev was also dismissed on Tuesday from his position as honorary conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra. The orchestra‚Äôs managers, who had also recently asked Mr. Gergiev to denounce Mr. Putin, said in a statement that they had spoken with Mr. Gergiev but could not resolve an ‚Äúunbridgeable‚Äù divide. The orchestra said it was eliminating its ‚ÄúGergiev Festival.‚Äù

Mr. Gergiev did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

Ms. Netrebko also came under fire for her ties to Mr. Putin, who has awarded her prizes and praised her artistry. Ms. Netrebko endorsed his re-election bid, and has at times appeared to lend support to his policies, including in 2014, when she was pictured holding a flag used by some Russian-backed separatist groups in Ukraine.

While she had in recent days sought some distance from the invasion, issuing a statement over the weekend saying she opposed the war, she has remained silent on Mr. Putin.

The director of the Zurich Opera House, Andreas Homoki, called Ms. Netrebko‚Äôs statement condemning the war a ‚Äúpositive development‚Äù and said the company did not ‚Äúconsider it appropriate to judge the decisions and actions of citizens of repressive regimes based on the perspective of those living in a Western European democracy.‚Äù

But Mr. Homoki went on to note that the opera house‚Äôs ‚Äúdecisive condemnation‚Äù of Mr. Putin and his actions was ‚Äúnot compatible with Anna Netrebko‚Äôs public position.‚Äù

He said that Ms. Netrebko had decided not to sing in the upcoming performances, and relayed a statement from her that said: ‚ÄúThis is not a time for me to make music and perform. I have therefore decided to take a step back from performing for the time being. It is an extremely difficult decision for me, but I know that my audience will understand and respect this decision.‚Äù

After the cancellations were announced on Tuesday, Ms. Netrebko posted a picture on Instagram of herself with Mr. Gergiev smiling after a concert. Then, in a separate post, she wrote: ‚ÄúAs I have said, I am opposed to this senseless war of aggression and I am calling on Russia to end this war right now, to save all of us. We need peace right now.‚Äù Both posts were then deleted.

The Metropolitan Opera did not make any announcement regarding Ms. Netrebko‚Äôs scheduled appearances this spring, but Peter Gelb, its general manager, said in an interview on Tuesday that ‚ÄúThe Met stands by its position that artists who support Putin are not going to be allowed to perform at the Met.‚Äù

Asked about Ms. Netrebko‚Äôs statement opposing the war, Mr. Gelb said, ‚ÄúIn the case of somebody who is so closely associated with Putin, denouncing the war is not enough.‚Äù

Before the Met performed Verdi‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon Carlos‚Äù on Monday evening, the company performed the Ukrainian national anthem.

The fast-moving events showed how quickly arts organizations around the world had moved to sever ties with some of Russia‚Äôs most prominent cultural ambassadors since the start of Mr. Putin‚Äôs invasion on Thursday.

Mr. Gergiev had lost a number of engagements in the days that followed, but the loss of his leadership position at the helm of a major European orchestra suggested much more serious ramifications for his international career.

It is a stunning turnaround for Mr. Gergiev, whose packed schedule and regular engagements with many of the world‚Äôs leading concert halls and opera houses has led the website Bachtrack, which collect statistics on classical music performances, to proclaim him the world‚Äôs busiest conductor in several recent seasons.

Mr. Gergiev endorsed Mr. Putin‚Äôs re-election and appeared at concerts in Russia and abroad to promote his policies. The two have known each other since the early 1990s, when Mr. Putin was an official in St. Petersburg and Mr. Gergiev was beginning his tenure as the leader of the Mariinsky, then called the Kirov.

Mr. Putin has played an important role in Mr. Gergiev‚Äôs success, providing funding to the Mariinsky Theater, where Mr. Gergiev serves as general and artistic director.

Mr. Gergiev‚Äôs international engagements began drying up last week, when Carnegie Hall and the Vienna Philharmonic dropped him from a series of performances. On Sunday, Mr. Gergiev‚Äôs manager announced he was ending his relationship with his client.

The manager, Marcus Felsner, said in a statement that it had become impossible to defend Mr. Gergiev, whom he described as ‚Äúone of the greatest conductors of all time, a visionary artist loved and admired by many of us, who will not, or cannot, publicly end his long-expressed support for a regime that has come to commit such crimes.‚Äù

On Monday, the fallout continued, with the Verbier Festival in Switzerland saying it had asked for and accepted the resignation of Mr. Gergiev as music director of the festival‚Äôs orchestra. (The festival also said it would ban other artists who had shown support for Mr. Putin‚Äôs actions, and that it would return donations from individuals under sanctions from Western governments.)

The Edinburgh International Festival in Scotland, where Mr. Gergiev served as honorary president, also said Monday that he had resigned his position after being asked to do so. Philharmonie de Paris, a performing arts complex in France, announced it was canceling two concerts in April with Mr. Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra. And the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland said it was canceling two performances in August with Mr. Gergiev and the Mariinsky.

‚ÄúIn view of Russia‚Äôs acts of war in violation of international law, we are sending a clear signal of solidarity to the people of Ukraine,‚Äù Michael Haefliger, the festival‚Äôs executive and artistic director, said in a statement.

Shortly after the mayor of Munich announced his decision on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, Germany ‚Äî another major concert hall ‚Äî said it, too, had canceled Mr. Gergiev‚Äôs future engagements. Several other institutions are considering similar moves, including Teatro alla Scala, in Milan.

In an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a gruelling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv.

""We can't do that, because all ways are blocked,"" he finally said. ""Right now we are encircled."" The AP was not able to immediately verify the mayor's report that Kyiv was encircled by Russian forces or how wide an area that would encompass due to a strict curfew Sunday on movement in the city.

Klitschko himself later backed away from that assessment, saying on his Telegram channel: ""In the evening, Russian internet publications spread information with reference to me that Kyiv is allegedly surrounded and evacuation of people is impossible. ... Do not believe lies! Trust information only from official sources.""

When Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city's famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters.

The mayor confirmed to AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child. Ukraine's Interior Ministry said Sunday that 352 civilians have been killed, including 14 children.

A Klitschko-ordered curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8 a.m. Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorized person outside could be considered a saboteur.

""We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,"" Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian ""saboteurs"" were killed Saturday night.

Russian troops' advance on the city has been slower than many military experts had expected.

""√è just talked to the president [Volodymyr Zelensky]. Everybody is not feeling so well,"" Klitschko said, adding the Ukrainian city government employees were in shock but not depressed. ""We show our character, our knowledge, our values.""

In the last few days, long queues of people ‚Äî both men and women ‚Äî were spotted waiting to pick up weapons throughout the capital, after authorities decided to distribute weapons freely to anybody ready to defend the city. There are concerns, however, about arming nervous civilians with little military experience amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists.

""To be honest, we don't have 100 per cent control,"" said Klitschko. ""We built this territorial defence in a short amount of time ‚Äî but these are patriotic people.

""Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,"" he added.

Responding to a question about the city's capacity to replenish dwindling stocks of food and medicine, Klitscho's view darkened, however.

""We are at the border of a humanitarian catastrophe,"" he said. ""Right now, we have electricity, right now we have water and heating in our houses. But the infrastructure is destroyed to deliver the food and medication.""

Then, in the same breath, he rallied like the world heavyweight boxing champion he once was.

""That's why the message for everyone is: 'Support Ukraine together ... We are strong,'"" he said. ""Every Ukrainian is proud to be independent, proud to be Ukrainian, and we are proud to have our own country.""

Fighting in Ukraine's 2nd largest city

Ukrainian authorities say Russian troops have entered Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv and fighting is underway in the streets. The city of 1.5 million is 40 kilometres from the Russian border.

Oleh Sinehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional administration, said Sunday that Ukrainian forces were fighting Russian troops in the city and asked civilians not to leave their homes.

Russian troops approached Kharkiv shortly after Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine on Thursday. But until Sunday, they remained on its outskirts without trying to enter the city while other forces rolled past, pressing their offensive deeper into Ukraine.

Videos on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv and a light vehicle burning on the street.

Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian president's office said Russian forces blew up a gas pipeline in Kharkiv.

The State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection warned the explosion, which it said looked like a mushroom cloud, could cause an ""environmental catastrophe"" and advised residents to cover their windows with damp cloth or gauze and to drink plenty of fluids.

Russia acknowledges casualties for 1st time

The Russian military said Sunday some of its troops were killed and some were wounded in Ukraine ‚Äî admitting for the first time it had suffered casualties since the Russian invasion.

Maj.-Gen. Igor Konashenkov, a Russian Defence Ministry spokesperson, said Sunday ""there are dead and wounded among our comrades,"" without offering any numbers, but adding that Russia's losses were ""many times"" fewer than those of Ukraine's forces.

It was the first time Russian military officials mentioned casualties on their side.

Ukraine has claimed that its forces killed 3,500 Russian troops. Konashenkov also said that since the start of the attack Thursday, the Russian military have hit 1,067 Ukrainian military facilities, including 27 command posts and communication centres, 38 air defence missile system and 56 radar stations.

Konashenkov's claims and Ukraine's allegations that its forces killed thousands of Russian troops can't be independently verified.

Canada closes airspace

Canada is joining many European countries in closing its airspace to all Russian aircraft as the West ramps up pressure on Russia for invading Ukraine.

Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said Sunday that Canada will hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked attacks.

Most European countries have either announced they are closing their airspace or said intend to do so.

Also on Sunday, Canada said it will send an additional $25 million worth of defensive military equipment to Ukraine.

Foreign Affairs Minister M√©lanie Joly said the equipment includes helmets, body armour, gas masks and night-vision gear. She says it will be routed through Poland to get there as quickly as possible.

Defence Minister Anita Anand said Canada will offer up cybersecurity experts who can help Ukraine ""defend its networks against cyber attacks that are increasingly forming part of modern-day warfare.""

'We need to prepare for millions'

The European Union's top migration official says hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing war have entered the 27-nation bloc in recent days and is warning that Europe must be ready for millions to arrive.

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson urged the bloc's interior ministers meeting on Sunday to trigger a special protection mechanism set up 20 years ago to help deal with influxes of refugees.

""We have to prepare for even bigger numbers, and we have to prepare for the support that we need to give to the Ukrainians fleeing,"" she told reporters at the EU meeting in Brussels. ""I think we need to prepare for millions.""

The protection system was set up in the wake of the wars in former Yugoslavia and Kosovo, when thousands of people were forced to flee their homes. It has never been used. It provides residence permits for a fixed time, the possibility of jobs, accommodation, social welfare, medical treatment and education for children.

The United Nations said it has confirmed at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed, in the fighting in Ukraine that erupted since Russia's invasion on Thursday ‚Äî though it believed the ""real figures are considerably higher"" because many reports of casualties remain to be confirmed.

The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs relayed the count late Saturday from the UN human rights office, which has strict methodologies and verification procedures about the toll from conflict.

Ukraine files genocide case

Ukraine launched a case against Russia at the UN's highest court, accusing Moscow of planning genocide and asking the court to intervene to halt the invasion and order Russia to pay reparations, the International Court of Justice said Sunday.

The case, filed Saturday, asks the International Court of Justice, based in The Hague, to indicate ""provisional measures"" ordering Moscow to ""immediately suspend the military operations"" that were launched Feb. 24.

The case said Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine based on false claims of acts of genocide in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions of eastern Ukraine and now is planning genocidal acts in Ukraine.

Ukraine ""emphatically denies that genocide happened in the eastern regions"" and says it filed the case ""to establish that Russia has no lawful basis to take action in and against Ukraine for the purpose of preventing and punishing any purported genocide,"" the court said in a statement.

Also at the UN, the Security Council on Sunday voted for the 193-member General Assembly to hold an emergency session on Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Monday.

The vote on Sunday to authorize an emergency meeting was 11 in favour, Russia opposed, and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. That was the exact same vote on a resolution Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. But in that case, Russia used its veto and the resolution was defeated.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-russia-attack-feb27-2022-1.6366236
