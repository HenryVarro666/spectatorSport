“There is nothing to replace the negotiation process,” Lavrov told reporters, continuing to condemn the West and the EU for their support for Ukraine.

Lavrov insisted that Russia did not attack Ukraine when asked about whether Russia plans to intervene in other countries in the region.

“We are not planning to attack other countries. We did not attack Ukraine in the first place,” Lavrov said, warning that those who send weapons to Ukraine, or encourage mercenaries, will be held responsible for their actions.

The meeting was held on Thursday in Turkey on the margins of Antalya Diplomacy Forum and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu played the role of mediator.

“We continue our efforts to stop bloodshed and tears in Ukraine. We defend resolving disputes by diplomatic means. We are aware that there is no victor in such wars,” Cavusoglu said, thanking both ministers for their attendance.

Cavusoglu said miracles at the first-high level meeting should not be expected, underlying the importance of a ceasefire and humanitarian corridors.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister was not hopeful after the meeting. “No progress has been made on a ceasefire as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was not authorized to discuss the matter,” Kuleba said, defining the meeting as “easy and difficult” at the same time.

“Russia is not in a position at this point to establish a ceasefire. They seek a surrender from Ukraine. This is not what they are going to get. Ukraine is strong, Ukraine is fighting,” Kuleba told reporters.

Turkey’s diplomatic chief Cavusoglu said a meeting was necessary between the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia, and Turkey would be happy to host that meeting as well.

“Volodymyr Zelenski accepted this kind of meeting and Vladimir Putin informed our President that he is not against the idea in principle,” Cavusoglu added.

Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine on February 24. However, the success of the Russian military is being questioned and the Ukrainian army and people have resisted more than was expected.

Russia is also hit by record-heavy Western sanctions, which aim to cripple its economy and businesses.

On Thursday, Russia announced it would no longer participate in the Council of Europe, CoE, after the European organisation suspended Russia’s rights of vote due to its military campaign in Ukraine.

According to the UN, more than 2 million Ukrainians have fled the country seeking shelter in neighbouring countries as Russia pounds major Ukrainian cities including the capital, Kyiv, the second-largest city, Kharkiv and the port of Mariupol.

On March 2, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned Russia’s Invasion with the votes of 141 countries, including Turkey, out of 193 UN member states.

However, Turkey has not joined Western sanctions and has not closed its airspace to Russia, unlike all other NATO and EU member countries.

Yet, Turkey also has close ties with Ukraine, and Ankara has helped to equip the Ukrainian army, most prominently with armed drones, which have resulted in heavy Russian casualties recently.",https://balkaninsight.com/2022/03/10/turkey-hosted-ukraine-russia-talks-stall-but-may-resume/

He described the meeting as ""difficult,"" accusing his Russian counterpart of bringing ""traditional narratives"" about Ukraine to the table.

He also repeated his vow that the country will not give in, saying ""I want to repeat that Ukraine has not surrendered, does not surrender, and will not surrender.""

Kuleba said ""no progress"" had been achieved on even a 24-hour ceasefire, expressing frustration that ""it seems that there are other decision-makers for this matter in Russia.""

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba met on the sidelines of a diplomatic forum in the Turkish resort city of Antalya for three-way talks joined by Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.

Russia and Ukraine on Thursday failed to find a breakthrough on a ceasefire and other humanitarian issues at the first high-level talks between the two sides since Moscow's invasion.

Ukrainian and Russian delegations have also been meeting in Belarus, but the team sent by Russia to those talks is relatively low-ranking, without a minister.

Lavrov appeared to put a greater emphasis on those talks saying: ""Today's meeting has confirmed that the Russian-Ukrainian format in Belarus has no alternative.""

""We are in favor of any contacts... to solve the Ukrainian crisis... but the thing we realised is they must have added value and must not undermine the main track in Belarus.""

Images of the meeting showed the Russian, Turkish and Ukrainian delegations sitting on each side of a 'U' shaped table, with each minister accompanied by just two other officials.

There was no indication that they had shaken hands ahead of the discussions.

Hospital attack

The meeting took place against the background of international outrage after an attack on a children's hospital in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol which, according to Kyiv, killed at least three people, including a young girl.

Kuleba said he wanted to emerge from the meeting with an agreement on a humanitarian corridor from the besieged city of Mariupol but ""unfortunately Minister Lavrov was not in a position to commit to it.""

Kuleba said Lavrov ""will correspond with respective authorities on this issue.""

Lavrov claimed the hospital was serving as ""as a military base for nationalists"" from the radical Azov Battalion.

He also accused the European Union and other countries of ""dangerously"" backing the supply of arms to Ukraine.

Asked by a Turkish reporter if Russia was planning to attack other nations, Lavrov replied ""we don't plan to attack other countries"" and claimed ""we did not attack Ukraine.""

He insisted that President Vladimir Putin launched the operation on Feb. 24 as the situation in Ukraine ""posed a direct threat to the Russian Federation.""

Multiple initiatives

Host Cavusoglu acknowledged that the meeting was ""not easy"" but said that the exchanges had been ""very civilized"" with voices never raised in anger.

He said Kuleba had reaffirmed that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was ready for a meeting with Putin and Lavrov had replied that Putin was not against it in principle.

""The meeting was an important start. No one should expect miracles at one meeting,"" Cavusoglu said.

The Turkey talks are one of a number of diplomatic initiatives underway.

Israel is seeking to broker a solution through direct talks with Putin, and French President Emmanuel Macron is also frequently phoning the Kremlin chief.

""There is today a very slim hope and we need to seize it... without being naive,"" France's Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France Inter radio ahead of the meeting.

Turkey is a traditional ally of Ukraine and has supplied the country with Bayraktar drones — made by a firm whose technology director is Erdogan's own son-in-law which Kyiv has deployed in the conflict.

But it is seeking to maintain good relations with Russia, on which Turkey depends heavily for gas imports and tourism revenues.

""We are working to stop this crisis transforming into a tragedy,"" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday, adding he hoped for a permanent ceasefire.",https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/03/10/russia-ukraine-fail-to-make-progress-at-difficult-turkey-talks-2-a76856

Ukraine’s foreign minister said he discussed a 24-hour ceasefire with his Russian counterpart but no progress was made as Moscow’s representative defended its invasion and said it was going as planned.

The foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine met for face-to-face talks in Turkey on Thursday in the first high-level contact between the two sides since Moscow invaded its ex-Soviet neighbour last month.

Ukraine’s Dmytro Kuleba said he secured no promise from Russia’s Sergey Lavrov to halt firing so aid could reach civilians, including the main humanitarian priority – evacuating hundreds of thousands of people trapped in the besieged port city of Mariupol.

“We also talked on the ceasefire but no progress was accomplished on that,” Kuleba told reporters after meeting Lavrov.

“It seems that there are other decision-makers for this matter in Russia,” Kuleba added in apparent reference to the Kremlin.

He described the meeting as “difficult” and accused Lavrov of bringing “traditional narratives” to the table.

“I want to repeat that Ukraine has not surrendered, does not surrender, and will not surrender,” said Kuleba.

Tried ‘diplomatic means’

Lavrov, meanwhile, said Russia wants to continue negotiations with Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin would not refuse a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss “specific” issues.

Lavrov said Russia would not have started the conflict in Ukraine if the West had not rejected “our proposal on security guarantees“.

“Until the end, we wanted to resolve the situation in Ukraine through diplomatic means,” he said.

Western nations were behaving dangerously over Ukraine, and Russia’s “special military operation” there was going according to plan, he added.

The Russian foreign minister said he did not believe the standoff with the West over Ukraine would lead to nuclear war.

“I don’t want to believe, and I do not believe, that a nuclear war could start,” he told a news conference.

Russia had never used its oil and gas as weapons and it will always have markets for its energy exports, added Lavrov.

“We will come out of this crisis with refreshed views of the world – with no illusions about the West. We will try to never again be dependent on the West,” he said.

Officials from Kyiv and Moscow have held several rounds of discussions, but the meeting in the southern city of Antalya marked the first time Russia sent a minister for discussions on the crisis.

The meeting between Lavrov and Kuleba took place on the sidelines of a diplomacy forum near Antalya on Thursday. Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also participated.

Cavusoglu has said the aim of the meeting was to pave the way for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, which would be facilitated by Turkey’s president.

Kuleba said earlier his team will be “pressing for the maximum”.

“I will demand a ceasefire to liberate our territories, and of course to resolve the humanitarian issues, or rather catastrophes created by the Russian military,” he said.

Moscow has said Ukraine must meet all of its demands – including that Kyiv takes a neutral position and drops aspirations of joining the NATO alliance – before an end of its assault.

It was the first trip abroad for Lavrov since Russia was isolated by the Western world with biting sanctions that have also targeted Putin’s long-serving top diplomat.

Bringing Lavrov and Kuleba together marks “a step forward” and could escalate diplomacy at higher levels in Moscow, said Mustafa Aydin, professor at Kadir Has University in Istanbul.

“Russia is not yet close to entertaining peace, though it is slowly changing its stance,” Aydin said. “Its initially uncompromising posture is slowly giving way to a negotiation stance though not yet enough for a concrete outcome.”

Soner Cagaptay, from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, echoed the comments.

“I think this is really not a moment for Putin to accept humility and step down,” he said.

“But I think this is still a significant achievement for Turkish diplomats, the fact that they can get the foreign ministers of these two parties in brutal conflict to sit together around a table in a neutral location, it’s a very significant achievement.”

Delegations from the two countries have held three rounds of talks previously, two in Belarus and one in Ukraine. Despite some positive signs on humanitarian arrangements, those negotiations have had little effect.

The latest sit-down comes as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pushed for Ankara to play a mediation role.

“We are working to stop this crisis from transforming into a tragedy,” Erdogan said on Wednesday. “I hope the meeting between the ministers will open the way to a permanent ceasefire.”

NATO member Turkey is keen to maintain strong relations with both sides despite the conflict.

Turkey shares a maritime border with Russia and Ukraine in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. Ankara has called Russia’s invasion unacceptable and appealed for an urgent ceasefire, but has opposed sanctions on Moscow.

While forging close ties with Russia on energy, defence and trade, and relying heavily on Russian tourists, Turkey has also sold drones to Ukraine, angering Moscow. It also opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya, as well as its 2014 annexation of Crimea.

Moscow calls its incursion a “special military operation” to disarm Ukraine and dislodge leaders it calls “neo-Nazis”. Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss that as a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war against a democratic country of 44 million people.

Following two weeks of war, the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine on Thursday held their first face-to-face talks, which Ukraine's Dmytro Kuleba said made ""no progress"" on achieving a cease-fire to the fighting that has caused 2.2 million refugees to flee across Ukraine's borders. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow wanted to continue negotiations with Kyiv.

Turkey stressed that humanitarian corridors in Ukraine should be kept open without any obstacles, Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu also said underlining the need for a sustainable cease-fire.

The meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers was civil despite all the difficulties and the most important outcome of the talks was establishing contact, he added.

""Turkey is one of the countries that Ukraine is looking to among guarantors for a possible sustainable peace agreement,"" the minister underlined.

Speaking after the talks in southern Turkey, Kuleba told a news conference that the most difficult situation was in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, and that Lavrov did not commit to a humanitarian corridor there.

Kuleba called on Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol through a ""humanitarian corridor.""

Kuleba said he wanted to emerge from the meeting with an agreement on a humanitarian corridor from the besieged city but ""unfortunately Minister Lavrov was not in a position to commit to it.""

Kuleba said Lavrov ""will correspond with respective authorities on this issue.""

""We also talked on the cease-fire but no progress was accomplished on that,"" Kuleba told reporters after his meeting with Lavrov in Antalya, describing the meeting as ""difficult"" and accusing his counterpart of bringing ""traditional narratives"" to the table.

""It seems that there are other decision-makers for this matter in Russia,"" Kuleba said, in an apparent reference to the Kremlin.

Kuleba said that it appears Russia will continue its offensive as it pushes Kyiv to surrender, which will not happen.

He repeated his vow that the country ""will not surrender"" and said: ""I want to repeat that Ukraine has not surrendered, does not surrender, and will not surrender.""

He said Ukraine was ready for diplomacy but also able to defend itself.

His impression from the meeting was that Russia is not in a position at this point to establish a cease-fire after invading Ukraine, accusing Lavrov of having a different undering of what foreign ministers do in a crisis.

He added that he would be ready to meet with Lavrov again ""if there are prospects or a substantial discussion and for seeking solutions.""

But he emphasized: ""We are ready for diplomacy, we seek diplomatic decisions but as long as there are none, we go with dedication, sacrificing ourselves, to defend our lands, our people, in the face of Russian aggression.""

""Turkish Foreign Minister Çavuşoğlu showed high professionalism in a bid to find a solution to the crisis that arose between two sides,"" he also added.

Russia has presented its proposals to Ukraine and wants a reply, Lavrov said during another media briefing after talks with Kuleba in Turkey.

Lavrov said that the West was behaving dangerously in reaction to the events in Ukraine and that Russia's military operation there was going according to plan.

He said that the West was creating a danger in the region that would persist for many years and that those who supply weapons and mercenaries to Ukraine should understand the gravity of what they are doing.

He accused the European Union and other countries of ""dangerously"" backing the supply of arms to Ukraine, as it resists an incursion by thousands of Russian troops.

""We see how dangerously our Western colleagues, including in the European Union, are acting now, which, in violation of all its so-called principles and values, encourages the supply of deadly weapons to Ukraine,"" Lavrov said.

Russia is ready to continue talks with Ukraine within the framework of the existing format in Belarus, Lavrov also said after negotiations with his Ukrainian counterpart.

""Today's meeting has confirmed that the Russian-Ukrainian format in Belarus has no alternative,"" Lavrov stated.

Russian President Vladimir Putin would not refuse a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss ""specific"" issues, Lavrov added.

On the possibility of a nuclear war, Lavrov said: ""I don’t want to believe that ... only Western representatives have planted this idea of nuclear war in the public discourse.""

Foreign Minister Çavuşoğlu held bilateral meetings with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov ahead of the meeting.

""At a time of great need for peace, met with my Russian and Ukrainian counterparts Lavrov and Kuleba in a tripartite format on the margins of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum,"" he said on Twitter.

""We sincerely hope that peace prevails in our region. We will continue our efforts for diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine,"" he added.

The high-level tripartite meeting was arranged by Turkey as part of its continued efforts to mediate between the warring countries.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will also meet President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Çavuşoğlu on Friday.

Stoltenberg will visit Antalya on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, NATO announced in a press statement.

He will hold talks with Erdoğan and Çavuşoğlu, and participate in the Antalya Diplomacy Forum, the statement added.

The Antalya Diplomacy Forum is a high-level event of political leaders, diplomats, foreign policy experts, and academics. It will be held on March 11-13 this year.

Earlier lower-level talks in Belarus had produced several attempts to get civilians out of cities, many of which have failed after so-called humanitarian corridors came under attack.

Meanwhile, Russian forces neared Kyiv on Thursday, with tanks just a few kilometers from the limits of the Ukrainian capital in some places, raising fears it could soon be encircled.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 35,000 civilians had managed to flee cities under Russian attack on Wednesday.

But there was little relief in the southern port city of Mariupol, where the mayor said over 1,200 civilians had died in nine days of continuous shelling that have left residents without water, heat or communications.

Maintaining its neutral and balanced stance, Turkey continues its diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the Ukraine conflict, urging all sides to exercise restraint. While Ankara has opposed international sanctions designed to isolate Moscow, it also closed its straits to prevent some Russian vessels from crossing the Turkish Straits.

Since the beginning of the conflict, Ankara has offered to mediate between the two sides and host peace talks, underlining its support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.

ANTALYA

The first high-level negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian ministers were mediated by Turkey in the southern resort of Antalya on March 10, with no progress for establishing a ceasefire, but parties confirmed their desire to continue negotiations.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he aimed a 24-hour ceasefire and establishing a humanitarian corridor for civilian evacuations, but “no progress was accomplished on that.”

Kuleba and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held face-to-face talks in southern Turkey on March 10 in the first high-level contact between Kiev and Moscow since Russia invaded its neighbor two weeks ago. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu also participated at the trilateral meeting which took place on the sidelines of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Kuleba said Lavrov “was not in a position to give a promise on that.”

“It seems that there are other decision-makers for this matter in Russia,” Kuleba said, in an apparent reference to the Kremlin. Kuleba also repeated his vow that the country will not give in, saying, “I want to repeat that Ukraine has not surrendered, does not surrender, and will not surrender.”



He described the meeting as “difficult,” accusing his counterpart of bringing “traditional narratives” about Ukraine to the table.

Kuleba said Lavrov “will correspond with respective authorities on this issue.” He added that he would be ready to meet with Lavrov “again in this format if there are prospects or a substantial discussion and for seeking solutions.”

He emphasized that Ukraine was ready for diplomacy and that they seek diplomatic decisions, however, stating, “but as long as there are none, we go with dedication, sacrificing ourselves, to defend our lands, our people, in the face of Russian aggression.”

In a separate press conference, Lavrov said he did not aim to negotiate a ceasefire in the Antalya meeting, and Moscow wanted to continue negotiations with Ukraine within the framework of the existing format in Belarus. “Today’s meeting has confirmed that the Russian-Ukrainian format in Belarus has no alternative,” he said.

Asked for the prospects for negotiations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, Lavrov said: “Everyone is well aware that President Putin never refuses contacts. We only want these contacts to be organized not for their own sake but in order to fix some specific agreements.”

Çavuşoğlu held bilateral meetings with Kuleba and Lavrov ahead of the meeting. The Turkish minister stated that Turkey had played the role of “facilitator” during the tripartite meeting in Antalya.

Speaking to reporters, Çavuşoğlu said Turkey urged for a humanitarian corridor into the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

“In this meeting, we played a facilitating role while keeping the national position of Turkey reserved” and emphasized the humanitarian dimension of the issue, he said. Russian and Ukrainian ministers said they will discuss the issue with their authorities, he added.

“Nobody should expect miracles from this meeting. But this meeting of political level is important,” he stated.

Speaking at a news conference after the meeting in Antalya, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba criticized what he called Russia's lack of sincerity.

Kuleba said, “We cannot stop the war if the country that started the aggression has no desire to do so. We are ready for diplomacy but ready to defend ourselves.”

At his news conference, his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, accused Ukraine of not being serious in seeking a diplomatic solution.

In a possible gesture to Kyiv, however, Lavrov said Russian President Vladimir Putin could be ready to hold a summit with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Since the start of Russian-Ukrainian tensions, Zelenskyy has called for direct talks with Putin.

Lavrov also warned the West it was playing a dangerous game by arming Ukraine with sophisticated weapons, including surface-to-air missiles.

He said, “Therefore the threat is set to last for years. There will be risks for civil aviation, and not only in the Ukrainian sky. They [the risks] can spread across Europe.""

The Ukrainian foreign minister said he received no response to proposals to help mitigate the humanitarian crisis, including a 24-hour cease-fire and the opening of a corridor to allow hundreds of thousands of civilians to escape the besieged city of Mariupol.

In addition, Lavrov rejected Kviv’s accusations that Russian forces attacked a maternity hospital in Mariupol, claiming Ukrainian forces had taken it over and that there were no patients using the building.

Lavrov said, ""About the maternity hospital, this is not the first time we have seen pathetic cries about the so-called atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces.""

Moscow is facing international condemnation over the hospital attack.

Given the apparent lack of progress, it remained unclear whether the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers agreed to meet again. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, who hosted Thursday's talks, would not comment on future gatherings, other than to say Thursday's meeting was held in a civil fashion.

Ankara, which has good ties with Kyiv and Moscow, has sought a mediating role since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month. Columnist Sezin Oney of the Turkish news portal PolitikYol said Ankara saw the conflict as an opportunity.

“Ukraine is an important ground for Turkey now; Turkey is using its own strategic junctures to expand its power,"" Oney said. ""So, this is Turkey's new power play as it aspires to become a bigger player on the world stage.”

Kuleba also said that it seemed Lavrov had a different idea than him about what foreign ministers do in such a crisis.

What did Lavrov say?

For his part, Lavrov reiterated the Kremlin's allegations that the West has caused the conflict by forcing Ukraine to choose between close ties with Moscow and integration into Western Europe.

He said the West was creating a long-lasting danger in the region and that those who supplied weapons to Ukraine should be aware of how dangerous this was.

He also said President Vladimir Putin would not refuse a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss ""specific"" issues.

When asked about the bombing of a children's hospital in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Lavrov said Western media had not given ""both sides"" on this topic.

He said there had long been no women or children at the hospital, only ""armed radicals.""

Earlier, other Russian officials had claimed the reports were fake.

And when questioned on the possibility that the current conflict could lead to a nuclear war, Lavrov said, ""I don't want to believe, and I do not believe, that a nuclear war could start,""

Kuleba: Expectations 'limited'

Kuleba tempered expectations ahead of the meeting, saying the prospects for a cease-fire agreement were ""limited"" as Russia continues its bombardment, as well as siege, of major cities.

He said the success of the meeting would depend on ""what instructions and directives Lavrov is under"" from the Kremlin.

""I am not pinning any great hopes on them, but we will try and get the most out of"" the talks, he added.

Moscow has said it is ready for talks but that all of its demands, including that Kyiv takes a neutral position and drops aspirations of joining the NATO alliance, must be met to end its assault.

Turkey as mediator

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pushed for his country to play a mediation role between the two sides.

DW Russian affairs analyst Konstantin Eggert said ahead of the talks that Turkey's mediation was an important factor, as ""Turkey, and specifically Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ... belong to the very few entities in the world that Putin respects.""

He said that any prospect of an agreement being reached ""essentially lies with Putin.""

Eggert added that chances for the talks depended on Lavrov presenting a modified set of demands differing from those made by Moscow at the start of the invasion, as Ukraine would not be prepared to accept those given its current successes in the conflict.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba met on Thursday morning in Turkey, the highest-level contact between the two countries since the war began on February 24. But the meeting failed to yield a breakthrough on a cease-fire and other humanitarian issues.

The divide was apparent in statements given by both men in simultaneous news conferences that made clear the foreign ministers had made no progress.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine entered its third week on Thursday with none of Moscow’s objectives met. Meanwhile, thousands of people have been killed, and more than 2 million have sought refuge in neighboring countries.

During his meeting with reporters, Lavrov stuck to his previous position and didn’t make any concessions, repeating Moscow’s demands that Kyiv be disarmed and accept neutral status. He said Ukraine seems interested in participating in meetings for the sake of meetings and blamed the West for its part in escalating the conflict by arming its neighbor.

“We see how dangerously our Western colleagues, including in the European Union, are acting now, which in violation of all its so-called principles and values encourages the supply of deadly weapons to Ukraine,” he said.

Lavrov added that Russia is ready to continue talks with Ukraine within the framework of the existing format in Belarus.

“Today’s meeting has confirmed that the Russian-Ukrainian format in Belarus has no alternative,” he said.

Lavrov and Kuleba met on the sidelines of a diplomatic forum in the Turkish resort city of Antalya for three-way talks joined by Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.

“We are in favor of any contacts … to solve the Ukrainian crisis … but the thing we realized is they must have added value and must not undermine the main track in Belarus,” said Lavrov.

For his part, an exasperated Kuleba said “no progress” had been reached on even a 24-hour cease-fire, saying that “it seems that there are other decision-makers for this matter in Russia.”

“We also talked on the cease-fire, a 24-hour cease-fire, but no progress was accomplished on that,” he said.

But Kuleba said Lavrov “will correspond with respective authorities on this issue.”

He insisted that Ukraine will not give in, saying: “I want to repeat that Ukraine has not surrendered, does not surrender, and will not surrender.”

Kuleba described the meeting as “difficult,” accusing his Russian counterpart of bringing “traditional narratives” about Ukraine to the table; however, he didn’t rule out another meeting with Lavrov “again in this format if there are prospects for a substantial discussion and for seeking solutions.”

“We are ready for diplomacy, we seek diplomatic decisions but, as long as there are none, we go with dedication, sacrificing ourselves, to defend our lands, our people, in the face of Russian aggression,” Kuleba said.

The mayor of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, said on Thursday that half of the city’s population has fled since the Russian invasion began, as Moscow’s forces continue their push toward the capital.

“From our information, one in two Kyiv residents has left the city,” Vitali Klitschko told Ukraine television. “A little less than 2 million people have currently left. However, Kyiv has been transformed into a fortress. Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified.”",https://themedialine.org/top-stories/no-progress-in-russian-ukrainian-foreign-ministers-meeting-in-turkey/
