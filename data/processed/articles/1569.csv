0,4de981f4-079a-44ee-bb81-d7aa12e72089,[],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"YouTube announced on Friday that it had begun blocking access globally to channels associated with Russian state-funded media, citing a policy barring content that denies, minimizes or trivializes well-documented violent events.

The video platform had previously blocked the channels, specifically those of Russia Today and Sputnik, across Europe.

YouTube announced the move in a Twitter post and said that while the change was effective immediately, “we expect our systems to take time to ramp up”.

The platform, which is owned by Google, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine now fell under its violent events policy and violating material would be removed.

A YouTube spokesman, Farshad Shadloo, said the blocking of the Russian outlets was in line with that policy.

YouTube also said it was now removing content about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that violates its policy on material that “minimizes or trivializes well-documented violent events”. The Kremlin refers to the invasion as a “special military operation” and not a war.

YouTube previously paused YouTube ads in Russia. Now, it is extending that to all the ways it makes money on the platform in Russia.

Russian state media have called restrictions placed on them by distributors, which include app stores and other social media services, unjustified censorship.

“The blocking by YouTube is nothing but a new turn of an atrocious attack on one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society – that is freedom of the press,” Sputnik said in a statement on Friday.

YouTube declined to specify which and how many channels had been blocked globally, or whether they ever would be restored.

Workers across Google had been urging YouTube to take additional punitive measures against Russian channels, accusing them of spreading false narratives about the Ukrainian leadership and civilian deaths during the war, according to three employees at the company.

The move comes as Russia has taken up an increasingly aggressive stance against US tech companies that have taken measures to curb Russian disinformation on their platforms.

Russia on Friday moved to block Instagram after its parent company, Meta, said it would allow calls for violence against Vladimir Putin and Russian soldiers involved in the invasion of Ukraine to appear on the social media platform in Ukraine. The Russian government blocked access to Facebook last week. The blocks further limit most Russians’ access to outside information on the war.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/11/youtube-blocks-russian-state-funded-media

Google-owned YouTube has already blocked state media and restricted monetization in Russia on its platform, which prevents Russian creators from earning on YouTube. Many platforms have done the same, halting ad sales and restricting Russian media outlets and channels on their networks as the escalation in Ukraine continues this month.

YouTube will also block access to channels associated with Russian state-funded media globally, expanding from the previous block across Europe. The change is immediate, and the company said it has already removed more than 1,000 channels and more than 15,000 videos for violating policies around hate speech, misinformation and graphic content.

“Our Community Guidelines prohibit content denying, minimizing or trivializing well-documented violent events. We are now removing content about Russia’s invasion in Ukraine that violates this policy,” YouTube said on Twitter.

Social platforms from Facebook to TikTok have continued cracking down on Russian media, but the country has responded by blocking Facebook and Instagram this month. Russia’s internet censor agency Roskomnadzor said on Friday it plans to block access to Instagram after the company made exceptions a day earlier to allow content about violence against Russians.",https://www.thewrap.com/youtube-remove-videos-denying-minimizing-trivializing-ukraine-invasion/

President Biden strongly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine during his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday. Here are some excerpts from his prepared remarks, as released by the White House.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

He met the Ukrainian people.

From President Zelensky to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

In this struggle as President Zelensky said in his speech to the European Parliament, “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian ambassador to the United States is here tonight.

Let each of us here tonight in this chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.

Please rise if you are able and show that, yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.

Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.

They keep moving.

And the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.

That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War II.

The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.

It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.

Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.

He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.

He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did.

We prepared extensively and carefully.

We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.

I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.

We countered Russia’s lies with truth.

And now that he has acted, the free world is holding him accountable.

Along with 27 members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.

We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.

Together with our allies — we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.

We are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian ruble, making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.

We are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.

Tonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime, “No more.”

The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.

We are joining with our European allies to find and seize their yachts their luxury apartments their private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.

And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. He has no idea what’s coming.

The Ruble has lost 30 percent of its value.

The Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value, and trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is to blame.

Together with our allies, we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance.

We are giving more than $1 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine, and will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.

But let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.

Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies — in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.

For that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

As I have made crystal clear: The United States and our allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power. Every single inch.

And we remain cleareyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks and months will be hard on them.

Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.

And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backward.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I always promised I would be. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.

And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.

But I want you to know that we are going to be OK.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

While it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake, now everyone sees it clearly.

We see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.

In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.

This is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.

To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you.

Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.

He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/01/world/ukraine-russia-war

There are about 200 tons of nuclear fuel still in the reactor which was destroyed in 1986 and more than 20,000 used fuel assemblies from other decommissioned reactors stored on the site.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said that if the plant would lose power, it would not be an immediate safety issue because the assemblies are old and do not generate much heat. The staff there would also be able to continue to monitor the situation. “But they would carry out this work under worsening radiation safety conditions due to a lack of ventilation at the facility,” the Times reported.

Russian companies will no longer receive privileged treatment in our economies,” EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. Th EU “will also work to suspend Russia’s membership rights in leading multilateral financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

Russia targets Instagram, Meta

Update 9:30 a.m. EST March 11: Russia is targeting Instagram and is trying to shut down one of the last Western social media networks still operating in the country, The New York Times reported.

“Meta’s aggressive and criminal policy leading to incitement of hatred and hostility towards Russians is outrageous,” Russia’s ministry of foreign affairs wrote, according to The Wall Street Journal. “Media corporations have become soldiers of the propaganda machine of the Western establishment.”

Reuters reported Thursday that Meta has allegedly lifted the ban on Facebook and Instagram on calls for violence against Russian troops in some countries. Citing internal memos to content moderators, Reuters reported the company also lifted the ban calling for the death of Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko as long they don’t have other targets, a specific location or specific method.

Meta, however, drew the line at calling for violence against Russian civilians, Reuters reported.

“In light of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, we made a temporary exception for those affected by war, to express violent sentiments toward invading armed forces such as ‘death to the Russian invaders’. These are temporary measures designed to preserve voice and expression for people who are facing invasion. As always, we are prohibiting calls for violence against Russians outside of the narrow context of the current invasion,” Meta told CNN in a statement

Russia requested the meeting.

The U.S. said Russia is using the Security Council “as a venue of disinformation.”

“Importantly, US citizens who travel to Ukraine – especially with the purpose of participating in the fighting in Ukraine – they face significant risks, including the very real risk of capture or death.”

China’s ambassador to the UN, Zhang Jun, was the only member of the Council to have given “any credence whatsoever” to Russia’s claims, Hanna said.

Chernobyl plant still without external power supply, Ukrainian inspectorate says

Ukraine’s State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate says the electricity supply to the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant has not yet been restored, despite Russia’s energy ministry claiming on Thursday that Belarusian specialists had fixed the issue.

Ukraine warned on Wednesday that there was an increased risk of a radiation leak at the plant, which suffered the world’s worst nuclear accident in 1986, after a high-voltage cable was severed during fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces and its external electricity supply was cut off.

When the external electricity supply is severed, an emergency diesel generator kicks in.

“These include missiles, heavy artillery shells and rockets, as well as air strikes.”

Russia could surround Odesa on three sides, mayor warns

Gennadiy Trukhanov suggested Moscow’s forces would seek to advance from territories they have occupied in Ukraine’s Mykolaiv region towards Moldova’s separatist-controlled Transdniestria region, where Russian troops are based.

Such a move could cut Odesa, which sits on the Black Sea, off from the rest of Ukraine.

Who are the volunteer fighters referred to by Russia?

Putin has said Russia should allow volunteer fighters from Syria and other countries to join Moscow-backed separatists fighting Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine.

Damascus is a staunch ally of Moscow, which intervened in the Syrian civil war in 2015 to support President Bashar al-Assad, turning the tide of the conflict in his favour.

Where are the Russian forces near Kyiv now?

A huge Russian military convoy that had been stationed outside Kyiv since last week appears to have dispersed, according to a United States-based satellite-imaging company, as the city braces for a possible ground assault.

Maxar Technologies said satellite images taken on Thursday showed that the 64km (40 miles) long line of vehicles, tanks and artillery has broken up and been redeployed.

The assessment came as a senior US defence official said on Thursday that Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from the northwest had edged 5km (3 miles) closer to the city in the previous 24 hours, placing them just 15km (9 miles) from its centre.

Meanwhile, a separate tranche of soldiers advancing on the capital from the northeast was about 40km (25 miles) from the city, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added at a Pentagon news briefing.

The official said the “multiple lines of advance towards Kyiv” indicate Moscow aims to encircle the city.

Russia to lose ‘most favoured nation status’ over Ukraine: Sources

The US, together with the Group of Seven nations and the EU, will move to revoke Russia’s “most favoured nation” status, multiple people familiar with the situation told Reuters.

Stripping Russia of its favoured nation status paves the way for the US and its allies to impose tariffs on a wide range of Russian goods, which would ratchet up pressure on an economy already heading into a recession.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

Russia sought on Friday to declare Facebook an extremist organization and YouTube blocked Russian state media channels worldwide, an escalation of the tit-for-tat battle between Silicon Valley companies and Russia as the Ukraine war enters its third week. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight YouTube blocked the channels of Russian state media outlets globally after initially doing so last week in Europe only. Friday’s decision is a major blow to Russia’s efforts to sow propaganda about the war to international audiences.

Meanwhile, the Russian government said Friday it was blocking popular social media app Instagram, taking further action against Meta — the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — because of reports the previous day that Facebook temporarily suspended its hate-speech rules to allow posts that called for the death of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The country had previously blocked Facebook, which has a much smaller audience in Russia than WhatsApp or Instagram.

The incremental escalations over the past two weeks between Russia and the tech giants has forced the companies to rethink the ways they police speech online, rewriting their rules as they go in response to the fast-moving conflict. Social platforms are critical tools for the public to communicate and share information during wartime, but Russian propaganda outlets have also used them to spread disinformation about the war. And the companies are weighing pressure from world leaders to increase Russia’s isolation against potential retaliation by the country itself.

In the wake of Russian interference in the 2016 election and a global pandemic, companies including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have moved away from a historically hands-off approach to policing the content on their platforms, creating new rules to attempt to halt the spread of misinformation that they said could cause real-world harm.

But the Ukrainian conflict has prompted a flurry of new rule-changing and policymaking as the companies have banned state media outlets and allowed some speech previously considered to be hateful.

“This is clearly a crisis information environment and tech companies are making many decisions on the fly,” said Graham Brookie, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.

The companies say there is some precedent for the last-minute decisions and that it is necessary to stay nimble during fast-paced world events.

“I want to be crystal clear: Our policies are focused on protecting people’s rights to speech as an expression of self-defense in reaction to a military invasion of their country,” said Nick Clegg, Meta’s president for public affairs. “The fact is, if we applied our standard content policies without any adjustments we would now be removing content from ordinary Ukrainians expressing their resistance and fury at the invading military forces, which would be rightly viewed as unacceptable.”

Instagram head Adam Mosseri tweeted Friday that Instagram had 80 million users in Russia who will be cut “off from one another and from the rest of the world, as [about] 80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong.”

Advertisement

Facebook also temporarily suspended its hate-speech policies last year, allowing Iranians to call for death to the country’s leader, Ali Khamenei, for two weeks during a period of government repression.

YouTube enacted a policy against “denying, minimizing or trivializing well-documented violent events” in 2019, and cited the Holocaust and the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut as examples. On Friday, the company said it would take down Russian state media worldwide “in line with that policy.”

Companies have long resisted cracking down on Russian state-backed channels — despite their known propensity for spreading propaganda — because they feared being shut out of the country. The companies also worried about being perceived as inconsistent, because news outlets like PBS and the BBC in the United States and Europe also receive funds from government or other public sources. Instead, the companies chose in 2018 to label media outlets that receive the bulk of their funding from governments.

As a result, state-owned channels have hugely capitalized on social media. With more than 16 million followers for its English, Spanish and Arabic channels combined, outlet RT has claimed to be the most-watched news network on YouTube and boasted more than 10 billion views over time. RT’s YouTube English channel gained 130,000 more followers in the weeks leading up to the Ukraine war.

The companies argue that in places where the government controls the news media, Western social media services are often one of the few places where people can organize and express opinions more freely. Services like Instagram and YouTube are hugely popular with the Russian public, and have been a place where some criticism of the invasion has been able to find a platform, despite harsh penalties for dissent inside Russia.

But the calculus for social media companies is quickly changing amid international condemnation of Russia’s invasion and Russia’s retaliation against Silicon Valley services, in what some are calling a new digital iron curtain. Increasingly, the companies are willing to pick a side.

State media outlets have inaccurately described Russia as liberating Ukrainian people who support Russia and protecting them from Ukrainian Nazis. The Russian government doesn’t refer to the war as a “war,” instead calling it a “special operation” to “demilitarize and de-Nazify” Ukraine.

(Ukraine’s government and its Jewish president were democratically elected, and a recent poll run by a Kyiv-based agency showed nearly 80 percent of Ukrainians oppose making concessions to Russia and 67 percent said they were willing to put up armed resistance against Russia.)

In shutting down outlets like RT and Sputnik globally, YouTube is knowingly risking a retaliatory shutdown in Russia. Facebook was also willing to risk a total shutdown of Instagram and WhatsApp when it hastily instated the temporary policy allowing people to call for death to Putin and to Russian invaders earlier this week.

Former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said that despite tech companies’ hesitancy to do so, in geopolitical events in which thousands of people are dying, “It’s okay to pick a side. In fact it’s the only reasonable thing you can do. Because if you don’t pick a side, you’re actually picking the side of the powerful over their victims.”

Tech companies have long championed protecting free speech and have been hesitant to take down political content as long as it wasn’t overtly violent. That hands-off stance has shifted in recent years, but researchers have repeatedly shown that tech companies struggle to consistently police content and often fail to enforce their rules. Some say the companies have been too permissive with state media.

The coronavirus pandemic is a major example, said the Atlantic Council’s Brookie. Tech companies for years said they would not block misinformation on their platforms because they did not want to be arbiters of truth, but then they began removing content regarding the coronavirus that experts said went against public health guidelines.

That extended to RT, whose initials once stood for Russia Today, which media watchers have pointed out was pushing different narratives about the coronavirus pandemic depending on who its audience was. Domestically, it was supporting mask-wearing and vaccines, while on its English, French, Spanish and German channels, it was pushing stories about how mask mandates were an attack on peoples’ freedoms. (Last year YouTube cracked down on two German RT channels as a result of pushing covid misinformation, prompting the Russian government to vow to take “retaliatory measures.”)

Facebook has been criticized by its own independent Oversight Board for having inconsistent rules. The company created an exception to its hate-speech rules for world leaders but was never clear which leaders got the exception or why. After it suspended the account of President Donald Trump in the wake of violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the Oversight Board said the decision was correct but that Facebook did so without a clear rationale or plan.

And for years, Russia has used both state media and covert operatives to promote a distorted view of coronavirus as well as the long-running civil war in Syria, which Russia has been directly involved in since 2015. In 2018, Facebook even took down a covert disinformation campaign about Syria that it said was tied to Russian intelligence.

RT’s YouTube channel frequently posted reports on people protesting Covid-19 mandates in Western countries like the U.S. and Australia. The site also recently posted videos alleging Polish officials were mistreating migrants crossing over into the country from Poland, without mentioning the Belarusian government’s efforts to push migrants over the border in retaliation for European Union sanctions.

The tit-for-tat between the companies and Russia started in the early days of the invasion, when Facebook began to fact-check misleading articles on Russian outlets. Facebook also quickly changed its hate-speech policies to allow praise of a previously banned neo-Nazi group in Ukraine that was fighting against Russia.

The Russian government asked Facebook to remove those fact checks, but Facebook refused, Clegg said in tweets last week. The company argued that its services are critical for activists and everyday Russians to communicate with their families. Russia’s Internet regulator then said it would begin limiting access to Facebook services.

Facebook, YouTube and others responded by blocking the ability of Russian state media services to buy advertising. Then the European Commission announced that it was banning state media services RT and Sputnik, and they asked the tech companies to comply with the regional ban.

The tech companies complied, and also said they would be further limiting the reach of Russian government-backed outlets around the world.

A week ago Friday, Russia announced it was fully blocking Facebook. But the Russian Internet regulator did not extend the block to the more popular Instagram or WhatsApp.

On Thursday, a Facebook content moderator leaked new guidelines that showed that Facebook had decided to break its own rules to allow for some calls to violence against Russian invaders. The company confirmed the leak.

Russia’s top prosecutor said Friday that the government was opening a criminal case against Meta and is seeking the classification of the company as an “extremist organization and the prohibition of its activities” on Russian territory, alleging the platform was used to incite “mass riots accompanied by violence.”

The invasion and the flurry of demands about taking down certain content has sparked an emergency for the tech companies, so the relatively rapid changes in policy make sense, said Daphne Keller, who was associate general counsel for Google until 2015 and now directs the Program on Platform Regulation at Stanford University’s Cyber Policy Center.

“When it’s a crisis situation, doing something exceptional that isn’t already covered by law or isn’t already covered by the platform’s discretionary policies makes sense,” she said.

☝️We demand that 🇺🇸 authorities stop the extremist activities of @Meta, take measures to bring the perpetrators to justice. Users of #Facebook & #Instagram did not give the owners of these platforms the right to determine the criteria of truth and pit nations against each other. https://t.co/1RkrjRmEtA pic.twitter.com/sTacSm4nDt — Russian Embassy in USA 🇷🇺 (@RusEmbUSA) March 11, 2022

But the resulting Russian retaliation has negative downstream effects, Brookie said.

“Creating a digital iron curtain that shuts off the Russian people from a global information environment will make it harder to hold the Russian government accountable for its actions,” he said.

7,4de981f4-079a-44ee-bb81-d7aa12e72089,[],,"Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Tuesday pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept an offer from Russian President Vladimir Putin, which would require Kyiv to make significant concessions in order to end Moscow’s invasion, the Walla and Haaretz news sites report.

The Prime Minister’s Office denied the claim.

Walla does not specify the details of Putin’s offer as reportedly conveyed by Bennett, but previous reports from the news site said that Putin is demanding an independent Donbas region, while stopping short of seeking regime change in Ukraine. Other reports have suggested that the plan Bennett brought to Zelensky includes recognizing Russia’s annexation of Crimea, recognizing Donetsk and Luhansk as separate entities, and changing the Ukrainian constitution to excise a commitment to joining NATO.

“If I were you, I would think about the lives of my people and take the offer,” Bennett told Zelensky during a phone call on Tuesday, according to a senior Ukrainian official who spoke to Walla and Haaretz on condition of anonymity.

Zelensky did not take well to the proposal, responding with a brief “I hear you.”

“Bennett has proposed that we surrender,” the senior Ukrainian official tells the Hebrew news sites. “We have no intention of doing so. We know that Putin’s proposal is just the beginning.”

The report says that Israel has also asked that Ukraine cease its requests for Israeli military or defense assistance, as this could hinder Jerusalem’s efforts to mediate and maintain neutrality.

Thus far, Zelensky has been unimpressed with Bennett’s mediation efforts, saying the Israeli premier has sufficed with being a “mailbox” that passes along messages between Russia to Ukraine without coming up with any proposals of his own, the senior official says.

“We do not need a mailbox. We have enough of these,” the senior Ukrainian official says. “President Zelensky’s office does not believe this is the way to mediate. If Bennett wants to be neutral and mediate, we would like to see him appoint someone who will deal with the matter day and night to try and reach a compromise.”

Zelensky is under the impression that Bennett has taken up the role of mediator as part of his effort to avoid picking sides in a war because of the risk of damaging Israel’s ties with Russia, the official claims. (Bennett was asked by Zelensky on February 25 to try to mediate a solution to the crisis, and flew to Moscow on Saturday night for a Kremlin meeting with Putin. Zelensky has also criticized Bennett, however, saying on March 3 that he did not feel the prime minister is “wrapped in our flag.”)

The official reportedly pointed out that other countries such as Germany and France have also played roles in passing along messages between Russia and Ukraine while still maintaining a clear public stance against Moscow’s invasion, unlike the Israeli prime minister, who has not condemned Russia.

Zelensky’s office has identified a wide gulf between Bennett’s position and that of the Israeli public, which has been far more supportive of Ukraine, the official reportedly says. This has led to significant frustration and even personal offense on the part of Zelensky with the Israeli government, according to the senior official.

The official reportedly said Zelensky feels he has all but exhausted his efforts to influence the Israeli government.

He is hoping to deliver a speech to the Knesset plenum, as he has done in other parliaments around the world. But Israel has instead proposed that he hold a less formal Zoom session with all MKs invited, Walla reports.

Zelensky has rejected the idea and is weighing the possibility of a speech at Yad Vashem, though it is not clear whether the Holocaust museum would be interested in the idea.

Israeli officials have given a number of reasons to Zelensky’s office for why he cannot give a speech at the Knesset plenum — including that parliament is in recess and that the building is undergoing renovation.

But Walla reports that those are mere excuses, as Bennett and Foreign Minister Lapid do not want to anger Russia by granting Zelensky such a high-profile appearance.

Responding to the report, a source in the Prime Minister’s Office says, “It is doubtful whether this is a senior official who is in Ukraine and on [Bennett’s] call [with Zelensky], since it took place on a private line.

The PMO source denies that Bennett told Zelensky to take Putin’s offer, “as Israel does not have such an offer.”

“In any case, the prime minister does not intend to give Zelensky recommendations or advice on how to act at any stage,” the source tells Walla. “The conversation between the two was long and positive and included the possibility of a meeting [between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators] in Jerusalem.”

The source declines to say whether Bennett will be prepared to make proposals of his own. “The prime minister’s efforts are aimed at one thing: to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine and the unnecessary suffering.”",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-11-2022/
