Ukrainian armed forces on Friday identified a large Russian landing ship that they said they destroyed at the port of Berdyansk in southern Ukraine the day before.

The port, which had recently been occupied by Russian forces with several Russian warships in dock, was rocked by a series of heavy explosions soon after dawn on Thursday.

Social media videos showed fires raging at the dockside, with a series of secondary explosions reverberating across the city.

The Ukrainian armed forces on Friday named the ship as the “Saratov.” In earlier reporting, the ship was named as the “Orsk.”

In a statement, the armed forces said: “In the Azov operational zone, according to updated information, a large landing ship “Saratov” was destroyed during the attack on the occupied Berdiansk port. Large landing ships “Caesar Kunikov” and “Novocherkassk” were [also] damaged. Other losses of the enemy are being clarified.”

Several Russian ships had been unloading military equipment at Berdyansk in recent days, according to reports from the port by Russian media outlets.

The United States said that Ukraine likely did conduct a successful attack against Russian ships in Berdiansk, according to a defense official, though it is unclear what type of weapon or weapons were used in the attack. It echoes a similar statement from the British Ministry of Defence, which said that Ukrainian forces have attacked “high value targets” in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, including a landing ship and ammunition depots at Berdyansk.

Analysis of videos uploaded on Thursday showed that one Russian naval vessel left the port soon after the explosions.

The Russian Ministry of Defense has made no official comment about the explosion.

Berdyansk sits on the Azov Sea and is roughly 45 miles (70 kilometers) southwest of Mariupol. The city has a small naval base and a population of about 100,000.

Russian military troops first occupied Berdyansk government buildings on February 27, three days after Russia’s invasion began.

Mariupol still eludes Russian control despite being surrounded and mercilessly pummeled, block by block, by Russian firepower.

Its defenders rejected an ultimatum to surrender by Monday morning, thwarting a Russian effort to finalize a land bridge linking Crimea with the separatist republics of the eastern Donbas region.

Russia has fired on Mariupol from the Sea of Azov, according to a senior US defense official, using a group of approximately seven ships to launch attacks on the critical coastal city.

Further west, Ukrainians have been fighting to take back the city of Kherson, as well as pushing Russian forces from the northeast of Mykolaiv, forcing them to reposition south of the city, a senior US defense official said Tuesday.

The official cautioned that the US cannot say whether these moves are part of a “larger operational plan” by the Ukrainians, but called the Ukrainian defense “nimble” and “agile.”

The Russian missile cruiser that was damaged in a fire on Thursday was hit and ultimately sunk by Ukrainian missile strikes, a senior U.S. defense official confirmed on Friday. Russia and Ukraine had offered differing accounts of what happened to the vessel.

The defense source confirmed that the ship was hit by two Neptune missiles and told NPR that there are likely casualties.

Experts say the loss of the Moskva — the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet — is significant both symbolically and militarily, even if it doesn't deal a decisive blow to Russia's overall operations.

Russia's Defense Ministry has said that a fire broke out on board, causing munitions to explode and prompting the evacuation of the ship's crew, which is believed to number about 500. Ukraine claims responsibility, saying it hit the vessel with two Neptune anti-ship missiles about 60 miles off the coast of Odesa.

Russian defense officials said later that the vessel sank while being towed to shore in stormy weather, though weather reports indicate that conditions on the Black Sea were mild.

While losing one vessel isn't going to immobilize Russia's navy, it reinforces the narrative that Ukrainian troops can still deliver powerful blows by being more agile and creative, as NPR's Greg Myre reports. This is the second major vessel that Russia has lost off the coast of Ukraine in recent weeks.

The U.S. Defense Department previously noted that other Russian warships in the northern Black Sea moved farther away from the coast following Thursday's episode, a move that raised questions about Russia's claim that it was an accident.

Retired Adm. James Foggo, who commanded U.S. naval forces in Europe and Africa, said earlier on Thursday that though the forensics of what happened were ongoing at that time, the significance of the loss was clear, especially since the flagship of any navy is ""the biggest and the best and the brightest.""

""This is a terribly humiliating blow to the Russian navy, and it's rather astonishing that they could allow this to happen to themselves,"" Foggo told Morning Edition.

Here's what we know about the history and significance of the sunken ship.

The Cold War-era ship played roles in conflicts in Georgia and Syria

The star of Russia's Black Sea Fleet has a legacy dating back to the Cold War.

The ship was built in then-Soviet Ukraine — in the southern city of Mykolaiv, which has been heavily bombarded by Russian forces in recent days — and was launched in 1979. It originally bore the name Slava (which means ""glory"") but was renamed for Russia's capital after the Soviet Union's fall, according to Reuters.

The vessel, which carried nuclear weapons during the Cold War, has also served as the site of meetings between heads of state, with Russian President Vladimir Putin inviting world leaders on board for talks. It also helped conduct peacetime scientific research with the U.S., according to The Associated Press.

The Moskva was involved in operations in the Black Sea during Russia's war in Georgia in 2008, and Al Jazeera reports that Georgian authorities say the ship took part in an attack on the country.

It later briefly participated in a blockade of the Ukrainian navy as part of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the following year it provided air defense for Russian forces operating in Syria.

Ukrainian officials say it's the same ship that gained renewed notoriety at the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine when its crew called on Ukrainian border troops defending strategic Snake Island to surrender — only to be memorably refused with profanity. (The troops were originally believed to have been killed but were actually taken captive and released in a prisoner swap in early March.)

The defiance at Snake Island has become a defining moment of the war and a rallying cry for Ukraine, which recently unveiled a commemorative postage stamp in the soldiers' honor.

The loss of the vessel is a win for Ukraine but won't devastate the Russian operation

The loss of the Moskva constitutes a major propaganda victory for Ukraine, especially given the vessel's perceived involvement in the Snake Island incident, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a U.S.-based think tank.

ISW says the ship's sinking provides a boon to Ukrainian morale as a symbol of Ukraine's capabilities to strike back at the Russian navy. And, on the other side, ISW says the Kremlin will struggle to explain what happened.

""Both explanations for the sinking of the Moskva indicate possible Russian deficiencies—either poor air defenses or incredibly lax safety procedures and damage control on the Black Sea Fleet's flagship,"" it said in an assessment on Thursday.

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan made similar comments on Thursday, saying Russia's potential narratives are either that it came under attack or that it was incompetent, and neither offers a particularly good outcome.

But while the loss of the Moskva may be embarrassing for Russia, it's unlikely to significantly hurt its overall military operations.

The ship had the capacity to carry 16 long-range cruise missiles (as well as air defense missiles and other guns), so its absence will somewhat shrink Russia's firepower in the Black Sea. It had recently undergone an extensive refit to improve its capability and had returned to operational status only in 2021, the U.K. Ministry of Defence tweeted.

ISW says the loss of the Moskva is unlikely to ""deal a decisive blow to Russian operations on the whole.""

Still, that doesn't mean Russia won't change its strategy in light of the incident.

""Ukraine's possibly demonstrated ability to target Russian warships in the Black Sea may change Russian operating patterns, forcing them to either deploy additional air and point-defense assets to the Black Sea battlegroup or withdraw vessels from positions near the Ukrainian coast,"" ISW added.

Foggo, the retired admiral, said that the Moskva incident serves as a wake-up call that the war isn't taking place only on land. He added that if Ukrainians do actually have missiles like the Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles they claimed they used on Thursday, Russian forces are likely worried that any of their ships could be in jeopardy when they get close to the shoreline.

The Moskva joins a list of other Russian warships lost during conflict

News outlets had previously noted how significant Ukraine's claims would be, if verified.

Reuters had said that if Ukraine's claims of missile strikes were true, the attack on the Moskva could take its place as one of the highest-profile naval attacks of the century.

Citing military analysts, it reported that this would be the biggest Russian warship damaged by enemy fire since German dive bombers hit a Soviet battleship in Kronshtadt harbor in St. Petersburg in 1941.

And this wouldn't have been the first time that an onboard explosion took a flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet out of action — Reuters says the Imperatritsa Maria dreadnought battleship sank in 1916 after an explosion involving ammunition.

The AP reported that if Ukraine did in fact hit the cruiser with missiles, it likely represents the largest warship to be sunk in combat since a similarly sized cruiser was torpedoed by a British submarine in the 1982 Falklands War.",https://www.npr.org/2022/04/15/1093026912/russian-moskva-warship-sunk-ukraine

U.S. to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing war, sources say.

Ukraine's navy reported on Thursday that it had destroyed a Russian warship in the Sea of Azov, docked at the occupied Ukrainian port city of Berdyansk.

The Navy of the Armed Forces of Ukraine released photos and video on Facebook of fire and thick smoke coming from the port area. Russia did not immediately comment on the claim.

Russia has been in possession of the port in southern Ukraine since Feb. 27 — a few days after Russia's invasion of the country began — and the ship had disembarked armoured vehicles there on Monday for use in Moscow's offensive, the Zvezda TV channel of the Russian Defence Ministry said earlier this week.

According to the report, the ship was the first Russian ship to enter Berdyansk, which is about 80 kilometres west along the coast from the besieged city of Mariupol. The vessel was initially identified in the report as the Orsk. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine later named the destroyed ship as the Saratov.

Ukraine also claimed two more ships were damaged and a 2,721-tonne fuel tank was destroyed when the Saratov was sunk, causing a fire that spread to nearby ammunition supplies.

When Russia unleashed its invasion Feb. 24 in Europe's biggest offensive since the Second World War, a swift toppling of Ukraine's government seemed likely. But a month into the fighting, Moscow is bogged down in a grinding military campaign of attrition after meeting fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Zelensky calls for global protest

In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky called on people worldwide to gather in public on Thursday to show support for his embattled country as he prepared to address U.S. President Joe Biden and other NATO leaders gathered in Brussels on the one-month anniversary of the Russian invasion.

""Come to your squares, your streets. Make yourselves visible and heard,"" Zelensky said in English during an emotional video address late Wednesday that was recorded in the dark near the presidential offices in Kyiv. ""Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters.""

In response, thousands of people took to the streets of Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, on Thursday.

Some of the 60,000 refugees from Ukraine joined the demonstration, which was organized on social media following Zelensky's call. Waving Ukrainian and European flags, protesters chanted ""Stop the war,"" ""Stop Putin"" and ""Freedom for democratic Ukraine.""

The organizers of the event said that it was time for Bulgaria to come out in large numbers in support of a sovereign Ukraine.

To keep up the pressure on Russia, Zelensky spoke to NATO members in a video address on Thursday, asking the alliance to provide ""effective and unrestricted"" support to Ukraine, including weapons, tanks, planes, rockets and air defence systems.

Citing a long list of weaponry he said is vital for his country's survival, the Ukrainian leader asked NATO leaders for ""military assistance without limitations,"" telling them that Ukrainian forces are ""in a grey area, between the West and Russia, defending our common values.""

""This is the scariest thing during a war — not to have clear answers to requests for help,"" Zelensky said.

NATO continuing to impose 'costs' on Russia

Around the capital, Kyiv, and other areas, Ukrainian defenders have fought Moscow's ground troops to a near-stalemate, raising fears that a frustrated Russian President Vladimir Putin will resort to chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.

Opening the NATO summit in Brussels, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance is ""determined to continue to impose unprecedented costs on Russia, and we will reinforce allied deterrence and defence.""

""This could include detection equipment, protection and medical support, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management,"" he told reporters.

Canada imposes more sanctions

Canada was among the countries gathered that also announced new sanctions. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would continue to increase its defence spending as he announced the new sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

""Canada will be increasing pressure by sanctioning 160 members of the Russian Federation Council who facilitated and enabled this unjustified invasion,"" Trudeau told reporters after a NATO summit in Brussels.

The Biden administration announced more sanctions targeting 48 state-owned defence companies, 328 members of the Duma, Russia's lower parliament, and dozens of Russian elites. The Duma as an entity was also named in the new sanctions.

Biden, who was attending all three summits, said more aid was on its way. But Western leaders also suggested they were treading carefully so as not to further escalate the conflict beyond the borders of Ukraine.

""NATO has made a choice to support Ukraine in this war without going to war with Russia,"" said French President Emmanuel Macron. ""Therefore we have decided to intensify our ongoing work to prevent any escalation and to get organized in case there is an escalation.""

Biden said his top priority at Thursday's meetings was to make certain that the West stayed on the same page in its response to Russian aggression against Ukraine.

""The single most important thing is for us to stay unified,"" Biden said.

Separately, the White House announced the U.S. would welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and provide an additional $1 billion US in food, medicine, water and other supplies.

Satellite images provided to USNI News by Maxar Technologies prove the Alligator-class landing ship tank (LST) that was seen on video on Thursday was underwater at the side of the pier, with the superstructure and forecastle sticking up above the water.

The imagery shows that the fire spread to a merchant ship moored in front of it. It appears that the merchant ship, likely a grain carrier, had been docked there since before the invasion. The fire also spread to tanks on the pier. Both of these fires were still burning today when the satellite passed.

Video footage of the burning ship, taken soon after the attack, shows that two Ropucha-class landing ships were also damaged. They had been berthed alongside and in front of the Alligator-class amphibious ship. They sailed away fighting their own blazes as the fire on the Alligator raged.

A senior U.S. defense official confirmed to reporters on Friday that Ukrainian forces had struck and destroyed the Alligator-class LST while it was pierside.

“It appears from the imagery we’ve seen that they destroyed that ship. We don’t know how many casualties. I don’t know how many people were on the ship when it got hit,” the official said.

It is unclear whether the attack involved a ballistic missile or a drone. The U.S. defense official would not say what Ukraine used to attack the ship, citing operational security for Ukrainian forces.

The Alligator-class ship was performing a resupply mission, the official said, as fighting continues in the port city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov.

“It’s clear that at least one thing they were trying to do was use the port there at Berdyansk as a resupply depot for their fight up near Mariupol,” the official said.

The official told reporters that there had been “no real changes in Mariupol,” as of Friday.

“Obviously vicious, vicious fighting continues there and still long-range strikes. So lots of heavy fighting there,” the official said.

The Pentagon’s assessment is that Russia is focusing on the eastern part of Ukraine in a ground offensive, as Russian forces try to cut off the Donbas region, the official said.

“They’re trying to break out – to take Mariupol – and then be able to break off north from there to do that from the south. Now that’s why they’re frustrated and frankly, we think that’s of a piece of why they had LSTs dropping off supplies in Berdyansk – to try to reinforce their efforts to take Mariupol,” the official said.

The official said there has been no change in naval activity in the Sea of Azov since the attack on the Russian amphibious ship.

Russia has been amassing landing ships for the war in Ukraine. During the build-up phase, six ships from the Northern and Baltic Fleets sailed into the Black Sea. More are on their way from the Pacific Fleet, although it is unclear whether Turkey will allow them to enter the Black Sea.

Docking at Berdyansk would have been a calculated risk for the Russian Navy. The city, which was recently captured by Russian forces, provides a logistics hub close to the siege at Mariupol. Reinforcements, armored vehicles and supplies can be unloaded. The struck landing ship appeared to have been carrying substantial quantities of ammunition which likley

Although the landing ships can theoretically perform cross-beach landings, this would have complicated unloading. The captured port of Berdyansk provides a hard quay for unloading vehicles and supplies using cranes. Additionally, the Sea of Azov is very shallow and the port is one of the few places where larger ships can get close to land.

It is unclear how the loss of the ship will affect the Russian Navy. The destruction of the LST as has only blocked one berth. There are several other berths that can still be used.



The two Ropucha-class ships have likely returned to Sevastopol in Crimea, meaning they’ve left the Sea of Azov. Two Ropuchas were observed approaching the port from the direction of Berdyansk today.

As for Odesa, the senior U.S. defense official said it appears the port city is not at risk of an immediate Russian amphibious or ground assault.

“No signs that Odesa is under an imminent threat of an amphibious assault, or frankly a ground assault. They can’t break out of Mykolaiv and we haven’t seen anything noteworthy in terms of naval activity in the Black Sea,”the official said.

Russia currently has 22 warships in the Black Sea – 15 surface combatants, while most of the remaining ships are amphibs, according to the Pentagon.

“We’ve seen them move into the Sea of Azov to conduct an amphibious assault, to try to resupply their efforts on Mariupol. We have not seen them move on Odesa. It’s unclear the degree to which they would or could use naval power to assist in what they’re trying to do in the eastern – in the Donbas,” the official said when asked how Russia moving its ships out of the Sea of Azov could affect its effort to cut off the Donbas region.

“But clearly they could reach parts of the Donbas from the Sea of Azov if they wanted to. They could absolutely use some of their surface power – particularly missiles – if they wanted to. But we just haven’t seen that happen.”",https://news.usni.org/2022/03/25/satellite-images-confirm-russian-navy-landing-ship-was-sunk-at-berdyansk

A Russian Navy amphib exploded and burned at the captured port of Berdyansk, Ukraine on Thursday, just days after Russian state media released video footage of military cargo operations at the pier. The Ukrainian Armed Forces confirmed in a social media message that the Russian vessel had been ""destroyed"" and promised that ""there will be more,"" but did not describe the root cause of the casualty.

Video and imagery from Berdyansk shows that an Alligator-class tank landing ship - identified as either the Orsk or the Saratov - exploded at the port on Thursday morning. Secondary explosions followed for an extended period of time, consistent with combustion of a cargo of munitions.

Two other Ropucha-class tank landing ships - which had been berthed nearby - were seen exiting the port shortly after the blast. One appeared to have sustained limited damage to its superstructure.

Russian forces have been using tank landing ships to deliver military cargo to Berdyansk since last week, using the port to resupply the ongoing offensive along Ukraine's Sea of Azov coastline.

A webcam video from the southeast of the port appears to show that the first visible signs of trouble began with a small plume of white smoke, not a large initial blast from an incoming missile or bomb. The fire appears to have evolved into a much larger conflagration over the span of 10 minutes, with the smoke increasing and tall columns of flame occasionally visible.

Videos on social media purportedly showed the port of Berdyansk in flames on Thursday morning. The Ukrainian navy says the Orsk Russian tank-landing ship was destroyed at the port, and media reports indicate that two other ships are ""smoking heavily and trying to escape."" A warehouse with ammunition and fuel was reportedly destroyed at the port as well.

""In Berdyansk, a large landing ship of the Russian army 'Orsk' was destroyed,"" the Ukrainian navy said Thursday.

The Ukrainian armed forces shared a video of an explosion at the port and a massive inferno with the caption, ""Berdyansk !!! The [Russian] occupiers are burning well!""

In addition to the destruction of the Orsk, a Ukrainian military officer claims the ""large landing ship"" the Saratov was damaged by fire and the Kunikov and Novocherkassk were able to escape. The officer claims three people were killed in the assault and 11 were wounded.

The port of Berdyansk, located on the Sea of Azov coastline, is approximately 50 miles west of the besieged city of Mariupol, which has suffered from heavy shelling by land, air, and sea.

On Wednesday, the Kremlin-funded media outlet RT shared a video on social media showing Russian combat operations at the port.

The RT report showed the Orsk docked at Berdyansk, bringing heavy equipment and other supplies to front lines.

The Orsk is classified as an alligator-class landing ship by NATO. It can carry up to 20 tanks, 40 armored personnel vehicles, and hundreds of troops, according to the RT report.

A Russian military official interviewed by RT heralded the capture of the now-burning port.

""Our arrival here is a milestone event. It opens up completely new opportunities for the Black Sea Fleet to use existing Ukrainian infrastructure for our logistics operations,"" the unnamed military official said.

RT's report claimed humanitarian aid was also being transported in via the port, a claim that cannot be independently verified.

Russia has faced logistical challenges across Ukraine in its monthlong invasion, and its forces have largely stalled in their efforts to advance on major cities. They have been most successful in the south, where an early push out of Crimea and amphibious assaults launched by naval infantry allowed them to gain control over parts of the coastlines of the Black Sea and Sea of Azov.

The port of Berdyansk, which Russia captured in late February, has offered Moscow a way to bring reinforcements and supplies closer to critical areas of fighting in Mariupol and across Ukraine’s eastern front.

Videos and photos reviewed by The New York Times confirmed that a Russian ship was on fire at the port. At least two Alligator-class landing ships are listed in active service in Russia’s Black Sea Fleet: the Orsk and the Saratov.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/world/europe/russian-landing-ship-berdyansk-ukraine.html
