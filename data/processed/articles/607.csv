IL MESSAGGIO DELLE DONNE UCRAINE DAL FRONTE

WASHINGTON, 8 marzo. / TASS /. Gli Stati Uniti stanno vietando le importazioni di risorse energetiche russe, ha affermato martedì il presidente degli Stati Uniti Joe Biden nel suo discorso sull’Ucraina dalla Casa Bianca. “Oggi annuncio che gli Stati Uniti stanno prendendo di mira l’arteria principale dell’economia russa”, ha affermato il presidente. “Stiamo vietando tutte le importazioni di petrolio e gas energetici russi. Ciò significa che il petrolio russo non sarà più accettato nei porti statunitensi e il popolo americano infliggerà un altro potente colpo alla macchina da guerra di Putin”. Secondo Biden, gli Stati Uniti faranno la mossa unilateralmente poiché i loro alleati europei non possono aderire al divieto sulle importazioni di energia russe.

Mariupol – secondo il ministero della Difesa dell’Ucraina, le forze russe “hanno aperto il fuoco nella direzione del corridoio umanitario” da Zaporizhzhia a Mariupol. “Otto camion e 30 autobus pronti a consegnare aiuti umanitari a Mariupol e a evacuare civili a Zaporizhzhia.

ANSA – E’ scattata alle 9, ora locale (le 8 italiane), il cessate il fuoco in Ucraina per permettere l’evacuazione di civili da Kiev, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Chernihiv e Sumy secondo l’accordo siglato ieri a conclusione del terzo incontro negoziale tra la delegazione ucraina e quella Russa dopo il flop dei corridoi umanitari che non hanno avuto alcun esito.

Colpito un impianto di medicina nucleare a Kharkiv

L’Ucraina ha riferito all’Agenzia internazionale per l’energia atomica (Aiea) che un impianto di ricerca nucleare che produce radioisotopi per scopi medici e industriali è stato danneggiato dai bombardamenti della Russia nella città di Kharkiv. Lo ha detto il direttore generale dell’Aiea, Rafael Mariano Grossi, sottolineando che i bombardamenti non hanno causato alcun aumento dei livelli di radiazioni nel sito. «Dobbiamo agire adesso per evitare un incidente nucleare in Ucraina che potrebbe avere gravi conseguenze per la salute e l’ambiente. Non possiamo permetterci di aspettare», ha tuttavia sottolineato Grossi.

ODESSA – “Abbiamo appena sentito tre o quattro forti esplosioni provenire da ovest.
