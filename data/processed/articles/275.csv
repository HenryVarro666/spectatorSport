About this during a live broadcast in Facebook Olga Gaysumova, head of the Melitopol Conscious Society NGO, said, Ukrinform reports.

“He was driving in a car with his family, he was pulled out of the car and taken away in an unknown direction. His name is Kirichuk Sergey Sergeevich. Nothing is known about him yet. We keep the issue under control, but the occupiers are responsible for his life,” Gaysumova said.

Today, thousands of Melitopol residents again went to a peaceful rally against the occupation. People with national flags are chanting “Melitopol – Ukraine”, singing the anthem of Ukraine. According to the activist, Kirichuk was stolen on March 9. He supports pro-Ukrainian rallies and the song “Bayraktar” sounded from the speakers of his car.

As reported, pro-Ukrainian actions have been taking place in the occupied Melitopol since March 1. People meet at 12:00 and walk along the city street to the central square.

The mayor of the city, Ivan Fedorov, urged the townspeople not to approach the military equipment, not to provoke the soldiers, and thanked the people for their active position.",https://mailbd.net/news/in-melitopol-russian-soldiers-kidnapped-a-participant-in-a-rally-against-the-occupation-25217/

Melitopol, Kherson, Berdyansk, Starobilsk, Novopskov are among the cities and regions that are currently under the control of Russian forces. But the residents continue to resist the “occupiers”.

In the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol, the internet connection has all but disappeared, making it nearly impossible to reach people by WhatsApp or Telegram call, or stay connected for more than a few minutes.

Melitopol mayor Ivan Federov said that ordinary phones are no longer an option for them.

“We cannot use (phone lines), too easy for the Russians to listen in,” Federov was quoted as saying by BBC.

The Melitopol mayor claimed that the Russian forces occupying the city have taken control of the city’s communication network and warned that they need to be wary of what they hear on TV and radio.

Ivan Federov and his team have been exiled to another location following the Russian occupation of the city a week ago.

""We are not co-operating with the Russians in any way,"" Federov said emphatically. ""They have not tried to help us, they cannot help us, and we do not want their help.""

Non-stop protests in Russian-occupied Ukrainian cities

When Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine, he claimed that Moscow does not plan to occupy Ukraine. He claimed that the “military action” announced by him will seek to ""demilitarize"" Ukraine and came in response to threats from Ukraine.

""We decided to launch a special military action aimed at demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine,"" Putin had said in a televised address.

But in Melitopol and a string of other mainly Russian-speaking Ukrainian cities, Putin’s forces have found themselves treated as occupiers.

""There are protests in Melitopol every day,"" said 33-year-old Yuliya Kovaliova, who before the invasion helped run her family business of electronics stores.

""At some point, the Russian army started shooting at us and one man got shot, but we have not stopped protesting,"" Kovaliova said. ""We are not afraid to protest because we are together. We are afraid to walk alone at night, but we are not afraid to protest.""

Videos have surfaced showing protests in Kherson, Berdyansk, Starobilsk, Novopskov.

""I don't know how to count the number of people protesting, I thought it was 2,000 at least,"" said Yunona, a 29-year-old IT worker in the southern city of Kherson.

""One of our friends was beaten and taken by the Russian soldiers and people got so angry they chased the occupiers down the street and took him back,"" Yunona added.

Residents also claimed that the Russian forces looked young, uncertain, and afraid.

Olha, a 63-year-old English teacher, said, ""We go to the protests every day and they are close to us but they look afraid.""

""We are all just waiting for the Ukrainian army to kick them out,"" she added.

The mayors of the occupied cities are facing a dilemma- whether to encourage their citizens to take to streets, or warm them against going near Russian forces.

""Our people need to protest but they also need to save their lives,"" said Federov, the Melitopol mayor. ""I have asked them - please do not go near the Russian soldiers, go around them.""

Speaking to BBC, Vadym Gaev, the mayor of Novopskov, said that there had been daily protests but they had stopped three days ago when Russian soldiers shot three protestors - non-fatally - and beat another. Gaev said the Russian troops told an intermediary they had authorisation to shoot protesters, so there should be no more protests.

In Starobilsk, mayor Yana Litvinova was also working remotely.

""A new 'administration' has been appointed. The only thing we know is that it is going around government buildings and asking people to co-operate, and they are refusing,"" Litvinova said.

The mayors, who have left the city to keep the administration running are also facing increased criticism from the residents. Some accused them of betrayal while others said they were grateful hat the administration was still able to work.

Two residents of Kherson claimed that they thought the mayor there had betrayed the city by co-operating with Russian forces - an accusation circulating in Telegram chat groups.

""If I had betrayed the city would I still be here? I am in the office every day, working with my team to keep things running,"" Kherson mayor Igor Kolykhayev said.

The priority was to restart food production and get people back to work,

Kolykhayev emphasised that the priority in the current situation was to restart production and get people back to work.

""We are running out of food and there is no aid coming in, it's just not happening,"" he said. ""So we are telling everyone in the city: make any food you can make, manufacture anything you can manufacture.""

Residents in the Russian occupied cities have flagged the food scarcity, with shops fast running out.

""Shops are almost empty. You can buy the things that are left but very few things are left,"" said Yuliya Kovaliova, the electronics shop owner from Melitopol. ""Pharmacies are empty and my mother can't buy her heart medicine.""

Distrust of Russian ‘humanitarian convoy’

City residents in Melitopol, Kherson, and other places have described Russian “humanitarian convoys” that are attempting to hand out food, but filming the act for alleged propaganda.

Kovaliova said that two Russian trucks with humanitarian markings came into Melitopol last week and attempted to hand out food, but they also brought a film crew.

Nearly everyone refused, she said.

""Later we saw on it on TV. Russia has taken over the TV towers here so we only have one Russian channel being shown now and it was showing people taking the food and saying how thankful they are to the Russian humanitarian convoy,"" Kovaliova said.

Maxim, a 22-year-old piano teacher in the city, also described the supposed humanitarian convoy.

""They were filming and people said actors arrived to take the food,"" he said.

Yunona, the IT worker in Kherson, said she saw the same thing there, and Ukrainian media reported on the phenomenon in Berdyansk.

Melitopol mayor Ivan Federov said he had heard about these 'humanitarian convoys' too. But there were ""no real Russian trucks and no real Russian food,"" he said.

""They could open humanitarian corridors at any time to allow food and medicine in, but they do not want to. We know, we have tried,"" Federov lamented.

According to the information spread on social media russian troops allegedly “without resistance” and “without a fight” entered the Ukrainian city of Melitopol in the Zaporizhia region. Some posts refer to russia’s ministry of defense.

This is russian misinformation. On the morning of Feb. 25, russian troops entered the city, then their attack was repelled by the Ukrainian servicemen. Melitopol was surrounded, fighting around the city lasted several days.

Feb. 25

On the morning of Feb. 25, russian troops fired on the SBU building, and a military convoy arrived from the north of the city. The first illogical thing in the fake: if russian troops expected to enter the city without resistance, why did they start with shelling office buildings?

The information that on Feb. 25 the battle was taking place in Melitopol, was reported by the General Staff and the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The chairman of the Melitopol district council Igor Sudakov on Facebook urged citizens not to publish information about the movement of the Armed Forces or Territorial Defense in Melitopol. Another confirmation was that the Ukrainian servicemen were in the city at the time and resisted.

The outskirts of Melitopol were occupied by russian soldiers who came from Crimea. But the other part was held by the Ukrainian servicemen that held the line to prevent the russian advance on Mariupol. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the President’s Office, spoke about this at a briefing on Feb. 25.

During the day in Melitopol, urban combats for strategic objects continued. As of 10 p.m., Melitopol was surrounded, there were battles near the city, said the head of the Zaporizhia Military Administration Oleksandr Starukh.

Feb. 26

Battle for the city between the russian occupiers and Ukrainian servicemen continued. “The most difficult situation is in Melitopol. Heavy machinery in the city. The combat continues. The column of heavy machinery passed towards Primorsk. From 8 p.m last day until 8 a.m, we have 14 wounded of our servicemen,” Oleksandr Starukh said on the morning of Feb. 26. Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to the head of the Office of the President, confirmed that heavy fighting was continuing in Melitopol.

Propaganda resources began writing at midnight on Feb. 25 that “russian units, without meeting resistance, entered Melitopol.” Then, in fact, the combatting for the city continued.

At noon on March 26, Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov said local officials had lost control of the buildings.

March 1

On March 1, head of the Zaporizhia Military Administration Oleksandr Starukh said Ukrainian governance was in Melitopol, but “the situation is difficult.” “Some institutions are not under the control of the Ukrainian authorities. They have also located units of the national guard of the russian federation that perform tasks of seizing power and making management decisions within Melitopol,” the statement reads.

March 2-4

Civilians also opposed the russian occupiers. On March 2 and 3, citizens with Ukrainian flags and slogans “Orcs, go away” went to peaceful rallies. The occupiers opened fire and wounded civilians. This did not stop the citizens, and on March 4 they again went to rallies with the slogans “Melitopol is Ukraine!”, “Melitopol – get up!”.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

President Biden strongly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine during his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday. Here are some excerpts from his prepared remarks, as released by the White House.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

He met the Ukrainian people.

From President Zelensky to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

In this struggle as President Zelensky said in his speech to the European Parliament, “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian ambassador to the United States is here tonight.

Let each of us here tonight in this chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.

Please rise if you are able and show that, yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.

Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.

They keep moving.

And the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.

That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War II.

The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.

It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.

Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.

He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.

He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did.

We prepared extensively and carefully.

We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.

I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.

We countered Russia’s lies with truth.

And now that he has acted, the free world is holding him accountable.

Along with 27 members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.

We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.

Together with our allies — we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.

We are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian ruble, making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.

We are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.

Tonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime, “No more.”

The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.

We are joining with our European allies to find and seize their yachts their luxury apartments their private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.

And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. He has no idea what’s coming.

The Ruble has lost 30 percent of its value.

The Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value, and trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is to blame.

Together with our allies, we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance.

We are giving more than $1 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine, and will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.

But let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.

Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies — in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.

For that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

As I have made crystal clear: The United States and our allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power. Every single inch.

And we remain cleareyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks and months will be hard on them.

Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.

And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backward.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I always promised I would be. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.

And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.

But I want you to know that we are going to be OK.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

While it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake, now everyone sees it clearly.

We see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.

In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.

This is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.

To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you.

Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.

He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/01/world/ukraine-russia-war
