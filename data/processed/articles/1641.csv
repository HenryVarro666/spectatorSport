LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - A ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine would not be enough to trigger the lifting of British sanctions, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a meeting of his senior ministers on Tuesday.

""The prime minister said a ceasefire alone would not be cause for UK sanctions to be removed on Russia,"" Johnson's spokesman told reporters, giving his account of the cabinet meeting.

""He said the pressure on (Russian President Vladimir) Putin must be increased both through further economic measures and providing military aid to ensure Russia changes course completely.""

London (AFP) – UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday said Western powers should tighten the economic noose around Russia until it withdraws all its soldiers from Ukraine.

At a hearing in parliament, Johnson told lawmakers that to lift G7 sanctions simply in return for a Russian ceasefire in Ukraine would go ""straight into (Vladimir) Putin's playbook"".

""My view is we should intensify sanctions with a rolling programme until every single one of his troops is out of Ukraine,"" he said.

Johnson said also that the government in London was looking at ""going up a gear"" in its military aid to Ukraine.

He said that could include the provision of armoured personnel carriers to help Ukrainian forces break out of the besieged city of Mariupol.

Following peace talks this week in Turkey between Ukraine and Russia, reports suggested the UK, France and the United States could sign up to guarantee Ukraine's security in return for a Russian pullout.

Johnson ruled out giving Ukraine the equivalent of NATO's Article Five, which says an attack on one member is an attack on all.

But Ukraine could benefit from a different security concept ""based on the idea of deterrence by denial"", he said.

Ukraine would be armed so much with Western aid, and ""the quills of the porcupine have become so stiffened, that it is ever-after indigestible to Putin"".

""That is the path we are on,"" he told the lawmakers, while also defending the pace of the UK visa programme to bring over Ukrainians fleeing the fighting.

The prime minister meanwhile said he understood US President Joe Biden's frustration when he said last week that Putin could not stay in power.

But Johnson stressed that regime change in Moscow is ""not the objective of the UK government"".

""We are simply setting out to help protect the people of Ukraine and protect them from absolutely barbaric and unreasonable violence.""

'Luxury toys'

The government said separately that sanctioned Russian oligarchs and their businesses would now be banned from using Britain's aviation and maritime industries and engineers.

It immediately used the new powers laid in parliament against the billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler and Oleg Tinkov, the founder of Tinkoff bank.

The UK's National Crime Agency this week impounded a superyacht said to be owned by an unnamed Russian businessman JUSTIN TALLIS AFP

Both were slapped with asset freezes and travel bans last week.

The latest announcement comes after the UK authorities on Tuesday detained a Russian-owned $50-million superyacht, the Phi, docked at London's Canary Wharf.

The 58.5-metre (192-foot) vessel, which was in London for a refit, is registered to a company based in the Caribbean nation of St Kitts and Nevis and sails under a Maltese flag.

At least two oligarch-linked private jets have previously been impounded in the UK.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Today's legislation adds new routes at our disposal to deprive oligarchs' access to their luxury toys.

""Our economic and transport sanctions are working to suffocate those most complicit in Putin's regime ensuring that no one on UK soil can support Putin's inhuman assault in Ukraine.""

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the new legislation has also extended finance, trade and shipping sanctions imposed on Crimea to Russian-seized Ukrainian territory in Donetsk and Luhansk.

As reported earlier, On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine and launched a large-scale invasion. Russian troops have been destroying Ukrainian infrastructure, massively shelling residential areas, using artillery, rockets, and ballistic missiles, as well as employing warplanes to bombard Ukraine.

On March 29, the Ukrainian and Russian delegations are holding another round of live talks in Istanbul (Turkey), where the key issue is signing an agreement on international security guarantees for Ukraine and achieving a ceasefire.

LONDON — The G7 should intensify sanctions against Russia until all Russian troops have left Ukraine, the British prime minister said.

Boris Johnson told a parliamentary committee Wednesday that the public should not expect the G7 group of the world’s seven most industrialized democracies to lift sanctions “simply because there has been a cease-fire in Ukraine,” adding that doing so “goes straight into [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s playbook.”

The British government’s view is that the U.K. and its allies should “continue to intensify sanctions with a rolling program until every single one of his troops is out of Ukraine,” Johnson said.

The prime minister was taking questions on a variety of topics during a hearing of the House of Commons liaison committee.

Johnson’s position appears to be more hard-line than that of other allies. U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said Tuesday sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine are designed to drive a behavioral change in Moscow, and could be “reversed” when allies conclude Russia’s “behavior has changed.”

Asked for his opinion on the multiple attempts by French President Emmanuel Macron to engage with Putin in order to try to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis, Johnson replied that the question of the value of these attempts “is an open one.”

“My own view is Putin is plainly not to be trusted,” he added.

Johnson also said NATO members will need to rethink the support offered to countries like Ukraine in the longer term.

“There’s going to come a point where I think we should recognize that this has happened and that we, I hope, will be in a position with willing partners to offer not an Article 5 security guarantee to Ukraine [which would require NATO members to retaliate if Ukraine was attacked again], but a different kind of future, a different kind of commitment,"" he said. ""So that Ukraine is so fortified and so protected — the quills of the porcupine have become so stiff — that it is ever after indigestible to Putin.”",https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnson-sanctions-should-intensify-until-all-russian-troops-leave-ukraine/
