Five weeks into the war, Russia is pulling back some of its troops back from areas around the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and appears to be ramping up military operations in the eastern part of Ukraine.

Roughly 20 percent of the Russian troops outside Kyiv have begun withdrawing in the past day or so, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. These include frontline troops that were as close as 10 miles from the city center.

The troops are heading north towards Belarus, and some have already crossed the border, according to the Pentagon. But U.S. officials are calling it a ""repositioning"" rather than a permanent withdrawal.

""Our assessment would be that they're going to refit these troops, resupply them and then probably employ them elsewhere else in Ukraine,"" Kirby said on Wednesday.

In the first two weeks of the war, Russian troops advanced to the outskirts of Kyiv, a city with a pre-war population of around 3 million.

The U.S. and the Ukrainians said it was clear that the Russians wanted to oust President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government. But the Russians have been stalled for three weeks, and are now pulling back from their initial plan.

Still, most Russian forces near Kyiv remain in place, and Russia continues to target the city with long-range artillery on the ground and airstrikes from above.

So while Russian forces may not be able to take Kyiv at this point, they are primed to keep up this long-range bombardment indefinitely.

In addition, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in remarks Thursday that there is reason to take Russia's announcements with a grain of salt.

""We have heard the recent statements that Russia will scale down military operations around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine,"" he said. ""But Russia has repeatedly lied about its intentions. So we can only judge Russia on its actions, not on its words.""

If Russia redeploys the troops, eastern Ukraine is seen as a likely destination. Russia has said this week it will focus on that region and both Ukrainian and U.S. intelligence say they're seeing operations intensify there.

Stoltenberg also cited intelligence on Thursday that suggests Russia is trying to ""regroup, resupply and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas region"" in the east.

Russian troops are still fighting on the edges of the hard-hit coastal city of Mariupol, and taking it would give Russia control of a substantial swathe of Ukrainian territory — from the Donbas in the east, down the southeastern coast, through the Crimean peninsula in the south. That would allow Russia to potentially cut off Ukrainian forces to prevent them from defending other parts of the country.

The big question remains: What will Russian President Vladimir Putin do next, and what are his ultimate goals in Ukraine?

The White House said Wednesday it believes Putin is getting limited or even bad information from advisers who don't want to give him negative news on the state of the war or Russia's economy.

After the White House's statement, the Pentagon said it concurred and then a top British intelligence official agreed in a rare public speech. That coordinated announcement is reminiscent of the kinds of intelligence leaks that came from the U.S. and its allies before Russia first invaded last month — and that intelligence did turn out to be accurate.

Russian forces appear to be withdrawing in the area around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, as they turn their attention and firepower further to the south and east.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

The Red Cross is trying to help Ukrainians evacuate a besieged city on the country's southeastern coast. The aid organization turned back yesterday from Mariupol due to intense fighting. They say they'll make another attempt today. That's amid a round of peace talks and what appears to be a Russian withdrawal from the outskirts of Kyiv. NPR's Elissa Nadworny is in Kyiv and joins us. Elissa, thanks for being with us.

ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.

SIMON: What's happening on the ground?

NADWORNY: So around Kyiv and in northern Ukraine, Russian forces are withdrawing. You know, this idea that early in the days of the war, Russia could capture the capital city - that's long gone now. But, you know, we don't know yet where these Russian troops are going to be redirected to. The Pentagon says they aren't going home. But, you know, now, as areas previously held by Russian forces are opening up around Kyiv - like the suburb of Irpin - video footage and firsthand reports of what happened there are pretty devastating - documented reports of rape, dead bodies lying on the street, homes destroyed. The mayor of Irpin is saying to residents, just because Ukrainian forces have taken it back, it is not yet safe to come home.

SIMON: And what are the conditions elsewhere in Ukraine?

NADWORNY: Well, across the country, fighting continues, you know, especially in the east in the Donbas region. And overnight, Russian missiles hit a number of cities, including two in central Ukraine, damaging infrastructure and residential buildings, according to officials. In the south, Russia is mobilizing troops in a small sliver of unrecognized land between Ukraine and Moldova called Transnistria, according to the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces. And the worry there is those forces could threaten Odesa, which is on the Black Sea.

SIMON: Elissa, of course, there is an attack on a fuel depot in the Russian city of Belgorod, which is near the Ukrainian border. What do we know about that?

NADWORNY: So Russia has said that the attacks came from low-flying Ukrainian helicopters, but Ukraine's top security officials deny it. You know, the place is heavily militarized. So the significance of the hit is that it could really hamper Russia's ability to move supplies to areas in Ukraine, specifically in the Kharkiv area. And Russia has said that this attack could also impact peace talks, which are ongoing.

SIMON: The U.N. estimates that more than 10 million people have had to flee their homes in Ukraine. That number is simply staggering. What is being done to help those who still can't get out?

NADWORNY: Yeah, so Ukrainian officials say they're working every day to set up evacuation corridors to get people out of the places in the east and the south that are trapped. Just yesterday, the deputy prime minister said 6,000 residents around Mariupol and in the east from Luhansk made it out. But larger-scale efforts have met major challenges. On Friday, the Red Cross attempted to set up a big humanitarian aid convoy to Mariupol, that seaside city that's just been devastated by Russian forces. And they had to turn back. They deemed it too unsafe. The Red Cross says they're going to plan to try again today.

SIMON: And what's Kyiv like at the moment?

NADWORNY: Well, you know, it's quiet here. You know, I've been talking with people who are in the territorial defense about what their sense is of kind of where we are in this war. And people are skeptical of Russia's withdrawal. You know, they're buckling down, preparing for months more of war. I talked with a woman named Iryna Cherhava (ph). She's a medic with a battalion here.

IRYNA CHERHAVA: (Non-English language spoken).

NADWORNY: You know, she told me she's been sleeping in her full uniform because with missiles, you never know where the front line is. She says she does have moments of hope. A few days ago, she started taking off her jacket before she's going to bed. And she laughs, but she thinks, you know, maybe that's a small sign that things are getting better.

SIMON: NPR's Elissa Nadworny in Kyiv. Thanks so much.

NADWORNY: You bet, Scott.

The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist.

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Wednesday on Day 36:

Russians being hunted as they withdraw from Kyiv area

The U.S. continues to see roughly 20% of the Russian forces that were arrayed against Kyiv repositioning away from the capital, the official said. And Ukrainian forces are attacking these troops as they withdraw from the area.

""As these forces begin to reposition, the Ukrainians are moving against them,"" the official said.

Most of the Russian forces that are repositioning were located to the north and northwest of Kyiv. Most notably, they seem to have abandoned Hostomel airport, which has been a site of intense fighting at various points since the beginning of the invasion.

""We believe that they have very likely abandoned Hostomel airfield,"" the official said.

Although some troops are repositioning, long-range strikes on Kyiv continue.

""Despite the rhetoric of de-escalation, we're still observing artillery fire and airstrikes in and around Kyiv,"" the official said.

Shifting focus to Donbas

""This repositioning that they're doing around Kyiv and other places in the north, and this reprioritization on the Donbas, clearly indicates that they know they have failed to take the capital city, that they know they have been under increased pressure elsewhere around the country,"" the official said.

While Russia might be dedicating more forces to taking control of the Donbas region, the Ukrainians are primed to make it a tough fight.

""The Ukrainians know the territory very, very well. They have a lot of forces still there, and they're absolutely fighting very hard for that area, as they have over the last eight years,"" the official said. ""So just because they're going to prioritize it and put more force there or more energy there doesn't mean it's going to be easy for them.""

Russian ships can hit Donbas

While there are still no signs of any imminent amphibious landings, Russia has several ships in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov that could be used to threaten the Donbas region with cruise missiles, the official said.

Putin not getting full picture from advisers

""Our assessment is that the planning for this war was done with a very small circle of people, and that Mr. Putin's advisers do not count many. And, you know, our assessment is that they have not been completely honest with him about how it's going,"" the official said.

The official said Russian President Vladimir Putin has kept to a ""very, very close circle,"" a leadership style that inherently limits access to information.

""I can't account for the fact that the people advising him have chosen to obstruct certain information or omit certain information. All we can say is we don't believe that he has been getting the full picture,"" the official said.

Odesa under blockade

""We know that the Russians have continued to blockade Odesa,"" the official said. ""So obviously it's having it's having an economic impact there.""

Kherson contested

""We assess that they're still fighting over Kherson. We know that the Russians are in the city, but we aren't prepared to call it for one side or the other at this point. I mean, it had been in Russian control, but the Ukrainians are attempting to retake Kherson, so it's still being fought over,"" the official said.

Bombardment of Mariupol continues

""I don't have an update on the degree to which a cease-fire is being applied in Mariupol. What I try to give you is what we've seen, you know, in the last 24 hours since we last talked, and we have continued to see Mariupol will come under airstrikes,"" the official said.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/ukrainians-hunting-russians-leave-kyiv-area-pentagon-update/story?id=83799022

(CNN/Pool)

A “small number” of Russian troops are “beginning to reposition,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said during a news briefing on Thursday.

“It’s not exactly clear” where the troops are going, but the US does not “see any indication that they’re going to be sent home,” Kirby said.

“The best assessment that” the US has is that the troops “are going to reposition probably into Belarus to be refit, resupplied and used elsewhere in Ukraine,” he said.

The US has seen some Russian troops departing from the Chernobyl plant facility in Ukraine, Kirby added. Those troops are “leaving to the north to go back again towards Belarus,” he said.

Earlier Thursday, Energoatom, the state enterprise overseeing Ukraine's nuclear power plants, said Russian forces have withdrawn from Chernobyl.

""It was confirmed that the occupiers, who seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and other facilities in the Exclusion Zone, marched in two columns towards the Ukrainian border with the Republic of Belarus,"" said Energoatom in a statement published on Telegram.

In late February, during the first week of the war, the plant and its surrounding territory fell into the hands of Russian troops.

Russian troops announced on Thursday their intention to leave and hand over control to Ukrainian personnel, said Energoatom.

Ukraine: Russian shelling hits evacuation convoy, one dead

One person was killed and four wounded when Russian forces shelled an evacuation convoy out of the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner Lyudmyla Denisova said.

Denisova said that there were ""civilian volunteers"" on the buses.

Denisova said Russian forces were ""denying any chance of evacuating peaceful citizens from besieged Chernihiv, essentially holding tens of thousands of people hostage without food, water or heat.""

Russia had previously announced it would draw down military activities around Chernihiv.

Pentagon: Ukraine stopped Russian convoy near Kyiv 'pretty quickly'

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby it was not clear if Russia's convoy of military vehicles to Kyiv, ""even exists"" anymore after failing to accomplish its mission.

The stalled convoy, which had once stretched some 40 miles (64 kilometers), became a symbol of Russia's battlefield difficulties and had been reportedly attacked several times by Ukrainian forces during the first weeks of the more than monthlong war.

""I don't even know if it still exists at this point... They never really accomplished their mission,"" Kirby told reporters, responding to a question about whether the Pentagon had any updates about the convoy.

""They never really accomplished their mission. They never really provided any supply of any value to Russian forces assembling around Kyiv,"" he added.

""The Ukrainians put a stop to that convoy pretty quickly.""

UN nuclear watchdog says Russian forces have left Chernobyl

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it has been informed by Ukraine that Russian forces have ""in writing, transferred control"" of the Chernobyl nuclear plant to Ukrainian authorities.

Energoatom, Ukraine's nuclear operator company, earlier reported that most of the Russian forces that were occupying the Chernobyl nuclear power station had left.

Energoatom said only a ""small number"" of Russian troops remained, but the majority were heading toward Belarus.

""The information is confirmed that the occupiers, who seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and other facilities in the exclusion zone, have set off in two columns toward the Ukrainian border with the Republic of Belarus,"" it said in a statement.

Russian troops were exposed to ""significant doses"" of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site around the now-closed Chernobyl plant, Energoatom said.

The troops ""panicked at the first sign of illness,"" which ""showed up very quickly,"" and began preparing to leave, the operator added.

The IAEA said it could not confirm that Russian forces had received high doses of radiation.

Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the US continues ""to see indications"" that Russian troops were departing from Chernobyl.

""But we don't see any indication that they're going be sent home,"" he told reporters.

Kirby said the troops' departure was ""not necessarily because of a health hazard or emergency at Chernobyl,"" but rather for repositioning to be ""resupplied and used elsewhere in Ukraine.""

Germany says sent over €80 million worth of weapons to Ukraine

German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Germany has delivered more than €80 million ($88.62 million) worth of weapons to Ukraine so far, ""and more are to follow.""

Berlin has come under fire over what critics say is not enough military aid to Kyiv, as compared to, for instance, Washington.

Earlier this month, the White House said US President Joe Biden was sending an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine.

According to the White House, the figure brings the total US security assistance to Kyiv to $1 billion in one week — and a total of $2 billion since Biden took office in early 2021.

Ukraine says Russian forces killed 148 children

Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Russian forces have killed 148 children during shelling and airstrikes.

According to the ministry, Russia has fired 1,370 missiles and destroyed 15 Ukrainian airports since the start of the invasion on February 24.

Over 10 million Ukrainians have been displaced by the war, the ministry said.

The figures could not be independently verified.

Biden says Putin 'seems to be self-isolated'

US President Joe Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be self-isolating and may have sacked some of his advisers.

""He seems to be self-isolated and there's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,"" Biden said. ""But I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time.""

Earlier, US and UK intelligence reports said Putin was being ""misled"" by his advisers about the developments of the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin denied the claim.

UN delivers aid to northern Ukraine, says south inaccessible

Osnat Lubrani, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, says supplies have been delivered for thousands of people in the country's northeast — but some encircled cities in the south of Ukraine remain difficult to reach.

Lubrani said food rations from the UN's partners will benefit nearly 6,000 people in Sumy and areas including Trostianets and Okhtyrka.

According to Lubrani, basic household items, including blankets and kettles from the UN refugee agency, will support 1,500 people. Sanitation kits will also help 6,000 people with hygiene and drinking water, she said.

The UN-facilitated humanitarian notification system with Ukraine and Russia enabled safe passage for the convoy to Sumy on Thursday, ""but this is clearly not enough,"" Lubrani said.

However, efforts to reach Mariupol, Kherson and other southern Ukrainian cities have been unsuccessful over the past month due to safety concerns.

Britain, allies to send more 'lethal aid' to Ukraine

British Defense Minister Ben Wallace said Britain and its allies have agreed to send more military aid to Ukraine.

""There'll be more lethal aid going into Ukraine as a result of today. A number of countries have come forward either with new ideas or indeed more pledges of money,"" Wallace told reporters.

He said the aid for Ukraine would include the provision of air and coastal defense systems, longer-range artillery and counter-battery capabilities, armored vehicles and wider training and logistical support.

The minister's statement came after he hosted over 35 international partners at the second International Defense Donor Conference for Ukraine (IDDCU).

""Today's donor conference demonstrates the international community's determination to support Ukraine in the face of President Putin's illegal and unprovoked invasion by Russian forces,"" Wallace said in a later statement.

Oil prices fall as Biden releases oil reserves

US President Joe Biden has announced the largest-ever release of US emergency oil reserve in a bid to bring down gasoline prices.

Prices have soared in recent weeks over fears of a major supply shortfall in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Following the news about Biden's move, oil prices tumbled. London's Brent crude and New York's WTI managed to pull back slightly in mid-afternoon trading but were both still more than 4% lower at prices well above $100 (€90) a barrel.

Biden said the US will release 1 million barrels of oil a day for the next six months.

""The scale of this release is unprecedented: the world has never had a release of oil reserves at this one million per day rate for this length of time,"" the White House said in a statement. ""This record release will provide a historic amount of supply to serve as bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up.""

US sanctions Russian tech firms

The US Treasury Department announced sanctions against a series of Russian tech firms, including Russia's largest chip maker.

The US Treasury said the sanctions are ""part of its crackdown on the Kremlin's sanctions evasion networks and technology companies, which are instrumental to the Russian Federation's war machine.""

IAEA chief arrives in Russia for talks

The International Atomic Energy Agency said its director, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has arrived in Russia's Baltic Sea exclave of Kaliningrad for talks with senior Russian officials.

The UN nuclear watchdog did not specify whom Grossi would meet on Friday.

Grossi arrived in Russia after visiting a nuclear power plant in Ukraine and held talks with top officials on efforts to ensure the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power plants.

There are 15 active nuclear reactors at four plants in Ukraine. Russia's military controls one of them, Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest nuclear power plant.

Red Cross team prepares for Mariupol evacuation

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its team has assembled in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with medicines, food, water, hygiene items and other essentials.

The team is preparing to take civilians out of the besieged port city of Mariupol.

""We're here because really, we hope to be able to facilitate safe passage for civilians desperately wanting to flee Mariupol,"" said Lucile Marbeau, a staff member with the ICRC team hoping to enter the city.

Russia has said it committed to a cease-fire along the route from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, and Ukrainian authorities said they were sending 45 buses to collect civilians from the city and provide aid to those who remain.

Julien Lerisson, deputy director of operations for the ICRC, said the organization has high-level agreement for the mission but is focused on making sure ""the order trickles down the chain of command,"" allowing the team to enter and leave Mariupol safely.

Russia says foreign leased aircraft to remain in country

Yuri Borisov, Russia's deputy prime minister, said all foreign leased aircraft that are still in Russia after the termination of Western leasing contracts will remain in Russia.

According to the Reuters news agency, Borisov said those planes have been entered into the Russian aircraft register.

Western sanctions on Russia forced leasing companies to terminate contracts with Russian airlines for more than 500 aircraft. Over 400 of them remain in Russia, Reuters reported.

Russia bans entry of top EU officials, lawmakers

Moscow has imposed entry bans on representatives of the European Union in response to Western sanctions.

""The restrictions apply to the highest leadership of the European Union... as well as to the majority of members of the European Parliament,"" Russia's Foreign Ministry announced.

The ministry added that the ""blacklist"" also includes representatives of governments and parliaments of individual EU states.

It did not list specific names.

German economy minister calls for more Russia sanctions

Robert Habeck, the German economy minister, said the EU should impose additional sanctions on Russia to prevent a ""barbaric"" war in Ukraine.

He said he discussed what further measures could be taken with his French counterpart during a bilateral meeting in Berlin on Thursday.

""The last package [of sanctions] doesn't need to be the final one, it should not be the final one,"" he told reporters,

Habeck added that he and French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire had ""identified additional points that could be included in a [sanctions] package.""

The German minister declined to elaborate on what those points might be.

Zelenskyy calls on Belgium to send arms to Ukraine

Speaking to Belgian lawmakers, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Belgium to deliver arms to help his people fight Russian troops, especially in Mariupol.

The Ukrainian leader called on Belgium to consider peace more important than trade with Russia.

""I think that peace is much more valuable than diamonds, than agreements with Russia, than Russian ships in the ports, more also than Russian oil and gas, so help us!

Zelenskyy went on to say that the besieged city of Mariupol, in southern Ukraine, remained with thousands of civilians without access to ""anything necessary to survive.""

""Today [Mariupol] is hell on earth... but no one has the determination to stop the disaster,"" Zelenskyy said via video call.

UNHCR reports 4,059,105 people fled Ukraine

The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said 4,059,105 Ukrainians had fled across the country's borders since the Russian invasion started on February 24.

""We are confronted with the realities of a massive humanitarian crisis that is growing by the second,"" UNHCR said, also noting the millions displaced within Ukraine.

Some 13 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave, according to UNHCR.

Macron calls for extended cease-fire in Mariupol

French President Emmanuel Macron's office said Russia's hourslong cease-fire on Thursday was not enough time to allow trapped residents to get out of — or aid into — the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

The city has been surrounded by Russian troops since the beginning of March, and its residents have been in dire humanitarian conditions.

On Thursday, the Ukrainian government sent 45 buses to Mariupol to get people out. It's still unclear if the mission was successful.

The deployment is contingent on approval by the Danish Parliament, but the Defense Ministry expects the battalion to be ready for deployment in Latvia in May.

Putin says gas payments to be made via Russian accounts

Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that foreign countries open accounts with Gazprombank in order to continue receiving Russian gas.

Putin signed a decree stipulating that foreign buyers must transfer foreign currency to a special Gazprombank account. The bank would then act as intermediary, buying rubles on behalf of the gas buyer to transfer the payment in Russian currency to another special account.

If ""unfriendly"" countries fail to comply with Putin's order, Russian gas supplied would be cut off, he said.

Watch video 00:55 Putin: 'Purchasers have to open ruble accounts in Russian banks'

It came day after Germany said Putin had assured Chancellor Olaf Sholz in a phone call that gas payments could still be made in euros.

""De facto, for those who receive Russian gas, who pay for the deliveries, there is in fact no change. They just acquire rubles for the amount in currency which is stipulated in the gas contract,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday.

""Russia remains committed to all its obligations under existing contracts, both in quantity and in price,"" he said, adding that Putin and Scholz had discussed the system in detail a day earlier.

Kremlin dismisses claims that Putin is 'misled' by advisers

Kremlin spokesman Dimity Peskov has denied US and British claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin's advisers are not reporting to him the truth about Moscow's military operation in Ukraine.

""This shows that neither the Department of State nor the Pentagon have real information about what is happening in the Kremlin,"" Peskov told journalists.

""They don't understand President Putin, they don't understand the mechanism for taking decisions and they don't understand the style of our work,"" he added.

The White House had said earlier that declassified intelligence found that Putin ""felt misled by the Russian military.""

Britain's GCHQ spy agency chief, Jeremy Fleming, later said that ""Putin's advisers are afraid to tell him the truth"" about the degree of Ukrainian resistance.

""Rescuers pulled 19 bodies from under the rubble, and one person died in intensive care,"" it said in a post on Facebook.

The initial death toll was 12.

The regional governor accused Russia of waiting until civilians arrived for work before hitting the building on Tuesday.

UK: Russia targeting countries opposing war in cyberspace

Jeremy Fleming, the head of the British spy service GCHQ, said Russia has attempted to disrupt Ukraine's government and military, as well as countries opposing the invasion, in cyberspace.

""We've seen sustained intent from Russia to disrupt Ukrainian government and military systems. We've seen what looks like some spillover of activity affecting surrounding countries,"" Fleming said in a speech in Canberra.

""And we've certainly seen indications which suggests Russia's cyber actors are looking for targets in the countries that oppose their actions,"" he added.

NATO chief: Russian forces not withdrawing but regrouping

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia's forces are not withdrawing from Ukraine but rather regrouping after Russia announced it would be scaling back military operations around Kyiv.

Citing NATO intelligence, Stoltenberg said, ""Russia is trying to regroup, resupply and reinforce its offensive in the Donbas region.""

""At the same time, Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities. So, we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering,"" he added.

Putin signs decree ordering 134,500 new conscripts

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree ordering 134,500 new conscripts into his country's army as part of the annual spring draft while denying the decree had anything to do with what the Kremlin terms its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said those drafted would not be sent to any ""hot spots."" Prior to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia also denied any such plans.

Conscription is a sensitive issue in Russia. Putin has denied on various occasions that Russia is ordering conscripts into Ukraine though on March 9, the Ministry of Defense acknowledged some conscripts had indeed been sent to invade Ukraine.

At the time, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin had ordered military investigators to punish those responsible for ordering conscripts into Ukraine, something he insisted had not been ordered despite the defense ministry's contradictory statement.

Russian stocks badly hit while ruble stabilizes

Russia's stock market experienced its worst quarterly decline in over 13 years.

The RTS index, a dollar-denominated, free-float capitalization weighted index of 50 Moscow Stock Exchange traded stocks, dropped nearly 38% this quarter. The ruble-denominated index also plunged more than 30% the last quarter.

Both indexes experienced their worst quarterly performance since the financial crisis hit global markets in December 2008.

Stock trading picked up Thursday as some restrictions on short selling were lifted.

The ruble also tightened to near prewar levels at 83 against the US dollar. While the ruble lost almost half its value following the war, tight capital controls as well as intervention from the central bank have brought the currency's decline to 11.5% for the year.

EBRD: Ukraine, Russian economies to see massive contraction

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said that Russia's economy will contract by 10% this year and Ukraine's gross domestic product (GDP) will decline by as much as 20% due to Russia's invasion.

The EBRD said the war Russia launched against Ukraine last month has caused ""the greatest supply shock"" in 50 years.

""Russia and Ukraine supply a disproportionately high share of commodities, including wheat, corn, fertiliser, titanium and nickel,"" the EBRD said.

Watch video 03:23 Sanctions cripple Russian economy: DW's Roman Goncharenko

Prior to the war, the EBRD had forecast the Ukrainian economy to grow by 3.5% and Russia's economy to likewise expand by 3%. Instead, now the EBRD's revised forecasts shows both economies tanking in what is the first updated growth forecast for both nations from an international financial institution since the war began.

The EBRD's current model is to ""assume that a ceasefire is brokered within a couple of months, followed soon after by the start of a major reconstruction effort,"" none of which is certain at this stage.

The EBRD was created in the ashes of the Cold War to aid countries formerly under Soviet tutelage transition from highly inefficient Moscow-controlled command economies to free-market economies. Since the early 1990s, the EBRD has expanded its reach to include Middle Eastern and African nations.

IMF: Russia sanctions could erode US dollar's dominance

The result of the war on the global financial system is also likely to be one of ""fragmentation,"" Gopinath said.

Summary of events in the Russian war in Ukraine on Wednesday

South Ossetian leader Anatoly Bibilov said that the breakaway republic wants to hold a vote on integration into the Russian Federation.

The head of the United Kingdom's eavesdropping agency, GCHQ, said Russia's President Vladimir Putin ""has massively misjudged the situation"" in Ukraine.

Russia promised a temporary cease-fire to let residents of the besieged port of Mariupol flee on Thursday.

Russia's Defense Ministry reiterated its plan to focus forces on securing the separatist republics in the Donbas despite its forces continuing to bombard Kyiv and Chernihiv on Wednesday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that European companies could continue paying for gas in euros. Putin said the money would be paid into Gazprom Bank, which is not a subject of sanctions, and then transferred in rubles to Russia.

President Joe Biden told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy the US would provide $500 million (€448 million) in direct budgetary aid to Ukraine.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Western nations should tighten sanctions against Moscow until Russian President Vladimir Putin withdraws all his soldiers from Ukraine. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that a peace deal would not ""automatically lead to easing of [sanctions against Russia].""

Russian forces in Ukraine are regrouping and preparing for renewed offensive operations, Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said.

Russian air strikes and heavy shelling have killed civilians in acts that may amount to war crimes, the top United Nations human rights official said on Wednesday.

2 Apr 2022 22.08 Associated Press reports on the annual Russian conscription campaign which began this week. A few hours ago Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy urged Russian families to keep their sons at home, warning it was “guaranteed death for many young guys”. As Moscow’s forces bog down in Ukraine, many young Russians of draft age are increasingly jittery about the prospect of being sent into combat. Making those fears particularly acute is an annual spring conscription that began Friday and aims to round up 134,500 men for a one-year tour of military duty. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu pledged at a meeting of the military brass this week that the new recruits won’t be sent to front lines or “hot spots.” But the statement was met with skepticism by many in Russia who remember the separatist wars in the southern republic of Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s, when thousands of poorly trained young men were killed. “I don’t trust them when they say they won’t send conscripts into combat. They lie all the time,” said Vladislav, a 22-year-old who is completing his studies and fears he could face the draft immediately after graduation. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing reprisals. All Russian men ages 18 to 27 must serve one year in the military, but a large share avoid the draft for health reasons or get deferments granted to university students. The share of men who avoid the draft is particularly big in Moscow and other major cities. Even as President Vladimir Putin and his officials say that conscripts aren’t involved in what Russian authorities call “the special military operation in Ukraine,” many appeared to have been taken prisoner during its initial days. Videos emerged from Ukraine of captured Russians, some being shown calling their parents, and were put on social media. The mother of one of the prisoners said she recognised her 20-year-old draftee son in a video even though he was shown blindfolded. “I recognised him by his lips, by his chin. You know, I would have recognised him by his fingers,” said the woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Lyubov, for security reasons. “I breastfed him. I raised him.” The Defense Ministry was forced to walk back its statements and acknowledge that some conscripts were sent to Ukraine “by mistake” and were taken prisoner while serving with a supply unit away from the front. There have been allegations that before the invasion, some conscripts were forced to sign military contracts that allowed them to be sent into combat — duty that is normally reserved only for volunteers in the army. Some of the captured soldiers said they were told by their commanding officers that they were going to a military exercise but suddenly found themselves fighting in Ukraine.



2 Apr 2022 21.54 Olexiy Danylov, Ukraine’s secretary of the national security and defence council appeared on TV earlier, according to Victor Kovalenko, a former Ukrainian journalist and soldier. Danylov said it was too early to celebrate Russia’s apparent retreat, according to Kovalenko’s translation. “I would like everybody to realise that Putin doesn’t abandon an idea to destroy Ukraine. Now he is rebuilding his forces to continue strikes. Do not enjoy that someone voluntarily leaves our cities - this is the work of our army. Behind the liberation of every city are the lost lives of our your men and women. That is why saying that “they run”... I would not say that. There is a high price for us for their retreat. They want to reformat very much. They need a victory. They have the sacred date - 9 May. To this date they have a goal to end everything with a victory parade. We have many battles ahead of us, so I don’t recommend anyone relax. The situation is not that joyful, as we all would want.” The secretary of #Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council Olexiy Danylov said on #Ukrainian TV that it is too early to celebrate the #Russian Army retreat.

2 Apr 2022 20.04 Russian withdrawal from north 'slow but noticeable' - Zelenskiy Hello, this is Helen Davidson to take you through the next few hours of updates on the Ukraine conflict. In the last hour Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has released a video statement. Speaking from what looks like a conference room, with a screen bearing the Ukrainian flag behind him, he has levelled further accusations of war crimes at Russia, claiming it was trying to conscript people from Crimea into the armed forces to fight. In the video, Zelenskiy said Russian forces were withdrawing from the north of Ukraine, in a “slow but noticeable” way, sometimes expelled by Ukrainian forces but other times leaving of their own accord. “After them a complete disaster and many dangers are left, it’s true,” he said, adding that bombs may continue and the Russians were leaving mines in the area as they left, including in houses, equipment, and the bodies of people left behind. “Anyone who returns to this area must be very careful,” he said. It is still impossible to return to normal life as it was... Wait for our land to be cleared, wait until you can be assured that new shelling is impossible.” Zelenskiy said Russian forces were massing in Donbas, towards Kharkiv and were “preparing for even more powerful blows”. He noted the beginning of Russia’s conscription season, saying this year it was “guaranteed death for many young guys”. He sent the men and their families a warning: “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so they do not become villains. Don’t send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. Keep them at home.” He accused Russia of trying to take people into the army from Crimea, which he said was a violation of humanitarian law, and called for further sanctions in response. He urged people in Crimea to refuse but if they couldn’t, to surrender to Ukrainian military “at the first opportunity”.

“We will understand everything. You will live,” he said. Separately, he said Russia had installed “temporary leaders” in some southern Ukraine areas, who were threatening employees of businesses and authorities into cooperating. Zelenskiy warned of problems” for anyone who became one of these leaders, who he termed “collaborators.

1 Apr 2022 22.26 Russian troops have reportedly taken an unspecified number of captive Ukrainian servicemen hostage after leaving Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear power plant, according to officials. State nuclear agency Energoatom released a statement on Telegram, citing plant workers: As they ran away from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the Russian occupiers took members of the National Guard, whom they had held hostage since Feb 24, with them.” The Guardian is unable to verify these claims and it remains unclear how many, if any, Ukrainian servicemen were taken away.



1 Apr 2022 22.02 The Biden administration has approved the drawdown and sale of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) citing a severe energy supply interruption. In a recently published memorandum, Biden said Russia’s invasion on Ukraine “has had a profound impact on global oil markets” prompting the International Energy Agency Governing Board to agree to a collective release of petroleum reserves. He said the United States committed to a drawdown and sale of 30 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. “The Secretary is authorised and directed to draw down and sell petroleum from the SPR at public sale to the highest qualified bidder at a rate the Secretary may determine, in accordance with section 161 of EPCA and the SPR competitive sales procedures in 10 CFR Part 625,” the statement read.



1 Apr 2022 21.40 Russia will respond to European Union sanctions and says the 27-nation bloc might realise that a confrontation with Moscow is not in its interests, Russian state media agency RIA Novosti cited a senior foreign ministry official as saying on Friday.

Are they ready from their own pocket to pay for further killings of civilians in Ukraine, the transformation of Europe from a region of cooperation and stability into a zone of conflict? I don’t think so.”

UK defence secretary Ben Wallace has seemingly concurred with this assessment, saying Putin is “not the force he used to be” as he becomes increasingly more isolated. Speaking with Sky News, Wallace said: President Putin is not the force he used to be. He is now a man in a cage he built himself. He’s isolated. His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed. He has not only got to live with the consequences of what he is doing to Ukraine, but he has also got to live with the consequences of what he has done to his own army.” Wallace added that he believed Russian forces appear to be regrouping and shifting their focus towards the south and east of Ukraine. “We have seen it before. It always gets worse. It goes for more civilian attacks, more civilian areas.” ""President Putin is not the force he used to be"".

1 Apr 2022 21.00 Russian troops leave Chernobyl after radiation exposure - Ukraine reports Russian troops began leaving the Chernobyl nuclear plant after soldiers contracted “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site, Ukraine’s state power company has alleged. Ukraine’s state agency in charge of the Chernobyl exclusion zone, Energoatom, published an update late on Thursday confirming Russian troops had left the site. According to the staff of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, there are currently no outsiders at the NPP site. It will be recalled that today the Russian occupation forces left the territory of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the satellite city of Slavutych.” Energoatom said Russian troops had dug in the forest inside the exclusion zone around the now-closed plant. “It should be noted that the information about fortifications and trenches that the [Russians] built right in the Red Forest, the most polluted in the entire Exclusion Zone, was also confirmed,” Energoatom said in a Telegram post. So it is not surprising that the occupiers received significant doses of radiation and panicked at the first sign of illness. And it manifested itself very quickly.” The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had not been able to confirm reports of Russian troops receiving high doses and was seeking more information in a statement on Thursday. The IAEA has not been able to confirm reports of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation while being in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and is seeking further information in order to provide an independent assessment of the situation.” Energoatom said Russian troops had dug in the forest inside the exclusion zone around the now-closed plant. Photograph: EyePress News/REX/Shutterstock Edwin Lyman, a nuclear expert with the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, told the Associated Press it “seems unlikely” a large number of troops would develop severe radiation illness, but it was impossible to know for sure without more details.

He said contaminated material was probably buried or covered with new topsoil during the cleanup of Chernobyl, and some soldiers may have been exposed to a “hot spot” of radiation while digging. Others may have assumed they were at risk too, he said. Russian troops on Tuesday left Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear power plant after weeks of occupation, officials said on Thursday. Energoatom said Russian troops began leaving the station and other exclusion zones, which they had occupied since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February. The IAEA also released a statement, saying: “Ukraine informed IAEA today that Russian forces that had been in control of Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant since 24 February have, in writing, transferred control of the nuclear power plant to Ukrainian personnel and moved convoys of troops.” #Ukraine informed IAEA today that Russian forces that had been in control of #Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant since 24 Feb have, in writing, transferred control of the NPP to Ukrainian personnel and moved convoys of troops. https://t.co/DkBXEJpDu8 pic.twitter.com/guITblxwXP — IAEA - International Atomic Energy Agency (@iaeaorg) March 31, 2022

EU officials close to the preparations of the summit said any help given to Russia would damage China’s international reputation and jeopardise relations with its biggest trade partners - Europe and the United States. The presidents of the European Commission and European Council, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, will hold virtual talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and later President Xi Jinping. An EU official said China’s stance towards Russia would be the “million-dollar question” on Friday, as reported by Reuters. Another pointed out that over a quarter of China’s global trade was with the bloc and the United States last year, against just 2.4% with Russia. “Do we prolong this war or do we work together to end this war? That is the essential question for the summit,” the official said. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated China’s call for peace talks this week, adding the legitimate concerns of all sides should be accommodated.

31 Mar 2022 19.12 In another busy day of diplomacy Zelenskiy confirmed he addressed the parliaments of Australia, the Netherlands and Belgium. “I felt total support. I am waiting for concrete steps. I called for tougher sanctions against Russia. We have to put pressure on the aggressor until the aggression is over,” he said.

In a discussion with President of the European Council, Charles Michel, Zelenskiy said the pair discussed additional sanctions on Russia, economic support for Ukraine and financing of priority projects. “The dynamics of our movement towards full membership in the EU,” he added. Zelenskiy said he was grateful for the new package of sanctions against Russia imposed by the United States. “We are grateful. It will not allow the current sanctions to be circumvented - we have already noticed such attempts. It will also limit the work of sensitive sectors of the Russian economy - its defence sector.” Finally, Zelenskiy said he also held talks with President of Turkey Erdoğan. “We spoke very specifically. In particular, about the prospects of negotiations in Turkey with the Russian Federation. And also about the creation of an effective system of guarantees for our state. About the security we have always needed and to the real provision of which we have come closer. “I am grateful for Turkey’s readiness to become a guarantor of security for Ukraine.”



31 Mar 2022 19.03 Zelenskiy also provided an update on Ukraine’s military defence, confirming Russian troops continue to leave the country’s north but describing the move as a tactical withdrawal. To the north of Kyiv, in the Chernihiv direction, in the Sumy region, the expulsion of the occupiers continues. They themselves are aware that they can no longer withstand the intensity of hostilities they could have maintained in the first half of March ... But we must also realise that for the Russian military, this is part of their tactics. All this is not occasional. We know their plans. We know what they are planning and what they are doing. We know that they are moving away from the areas where we are beating them to focus on others that are very important. On those where it can be difficult for us. Describing the “extremely difficult” situation in Ukraine’s south and in Donbas, Zelenskiy claimed Russian forces are accumulating in the temporarily occupied areas of region of Kherson. They are trying to organise some of their incomprehensible structures there, they are trying to figure out how to consolidate their presence there,” he said. Also in Donbas, in Mariupol, in the Kharkiv direction, Russian troops are accumulating the potential for strikes. Powerful strikes.”



31 Mar 2022 18.57 Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as we continue to deliver all the latest from Ukraine. As expected, Zelenskiy has delivered another late-night address. They [Russia] said - three or five days. They thought that this would be enough for them to seize our entire state. And it’s already 36. And we are standing. And we will continue to fight. Until the end.”

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

What is Russia planning next for Ukraine? Russia says it's repositioning troops that once were trying to capture Kyiv. The U.S. says it has detected some movement of troops, but it's hard to know what's in the mind of Russian commanders or of their president, Vladimir Putin. To better understand where this might be going, we've called NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre. Greg, good morning.

GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.

INSKEEP: OK, what troops are moving where?

MYRE: Well, the Pentagon says an estimated 20% or so of the Russian troops who've been outside Kyiv have begun to withdraw over the past day or so. Now, these include some frontline troops that were only about 10 miles or so from the city center. These forces are headed north toward neighboring Belarus. Some have already crossed the border. However, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby is calling this a repositioning of Russian troops, not a permanent withdrawal.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN KIRBY: Our assessment would be, as we said yesterday, that they're going to refit these troops, resupply them and then probably employ them elsewhere in Ukraine.

INSKEEP: Does that suggest a different focus, a new strategy, then?

MYRE: Well, quite possibly, yes. You know, we're five weeks into the war at this point. And in the first two weeks, the Russians advanced and got close to Kyiv in the north and northwest of the capital. This was clearly a major objective to oust President Zelenskyy and take over the capital. But the Russians have been stalled for the past three weeks. They're clearly pulling back from an initial plan that just didn't work. Now, that said, most of the Russian forces near Kyiv are still there, and they're bombarding the city with artillery on the ground and supported by air strikes. So the Russians may not be able to take Kyiv at this point, but they can keep up this long-range bombardment indefinitely.

INSKEEP: Continuing to do physical damage, economic damage to the capital of Ukraine. But what is the new Russian area of interest, a place these troops who are backing up might go instead?

MYRE: Well, it's really eastern Ukraine. The Russians said this week openly that they'll focus on the east. And the Ukrainians and the U.S. say they are seeing more intense Russian operations in this regions - region. The coastal city of Mariupol has been one of the hardest hit cities in Ukraine throughout the war. And if the Russians can take it, and they do have troops who have reached parts of the city, Russia would then control a substantial swath of Ukraine from the Donbas region in the east, down along the southeast coast, to the Crimean peninsula in the south. And this would also allow Russia to pin down or cut off these Ukrainian forces so they can't help defend other parts of the country. So we certainly expect this to be the main battleground in the days ahead.

INSKEEP: Let's try to get inside the head of Vladimir Putin, if we can, or at least find out how U.S. officials are trying to do that. The White House, the Pentagon, other officials said yesterday they think Putin has been getting bad information from his advisers and that he himself is finding out how misinformed he was. What is being said and why?

MYRE: Right. So the White House rolled this out on Wednesday afternoon, and then the Pentagon said it concurred. And a top British intelligence official said the same thing. So this is clearly a coordinated announcement, the kind of intelligence - declassified intelligence assessments we've been seeing from the U.S. that began before the war, and they've largely proved accurate. So it's clear that Putin miscalculated. Some of his top advisers are not being seen. So there are some strange things going on. The big question is, what will Putin do next and what is his ultimate goal in Ukraine?

INSKEEP: Greg, thanks so much.

MYRE: My pleasure.

INSKEEP: That's NPR's Greg Myre. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",https://www.gpb.org/news/2022/03/31/russian-troops-leaving-kyiv-area-moscow-focuses-more-on-eastern-ukraine

Zelenskyy strips 2 generals of rank for violating 'oath of allegiance' LVIV, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he has stripped two generals of their military rank. Zelenskyy said “something prevented them from determining where their homeland was” and they “violated their military oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people.” According to Zelenskyy, one of the generals had headed internal security at the SBU, the main intelligence agency. He said the other general had been the SBU head in the Kherson region, the first major city to fall to the Russians. Zelenskyy didn’t say anything about the fates of the two generals other than them being stripped of their rank. Share this -







UK: Russia redeploying troops from Georgia to reinforce Ukraine The British defense ministry says that Russia is redeploying elements of its forces from Georgia in order to reinforce its attack and invasion of Ukraine. In an intelligence update Thursday, the U.K. put the number between 1,200 and 2,000. ""It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner, and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion,"" the British defense ministry said in the update. Georgia, once a Soviet republic, is an independent nation but two regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, are breakaway territories that are not recognized as independent states by most of the world. The British defense ministry did not specify a region in Georgia in its update about redeployment. Share this -







IAEA seeking more information about claims of Russian radiation exposure The International Atomic Energy Agency said it is seeking more information about claims that Russian forces were exposed to radiation while occupying the Chernobyl nuclear site. Ukraine's national operator of nuclear power plants said Thursday that Russian forces were withdrawing from Chernobyl and the satellite city of Slavutych, which they captured early in the invasion. Ukraine Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian troops who dug trenches in the forest were exposed to radiation, The Associated Press reported. ""The IAEA has not been able to confirm reports of Russian forces receiving high doses of radiation while being in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone,"" the international agency said. ""The IAEA is seeking further information in order to provide an independent assessment of the situation."" Chernobyl, north of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and near the border with Belarus, is the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster. The damaged reactor is surrounded by a large exclusion zone.

Red Cross moving to facilitate evacuation from besieged Mariupol The International Committee of the Red Cross was traveling to help facilitate the evacuation of residents out of the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the aid organization said Thursday. Russia's defense ministry said Thursday that it would open a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia for the evacuation of residents and foreigners. The situation in Mariupol has been described as dire, with around 150,000 residents remaining in shelters from bombardment with little food or water. Russian forces have blockaded the city for weeks. An evacuation convoy of 17 buses was able to leave Mariupol on Thursday, the City Council said. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of shelling and attacking humanitarian corridors to Mariupol in the past. Control of the city is contested, with Ukrainian forces fighting inside the city, a senior U.S. defense official said Thursday. The Red Cross said it is also bringing badly needed supplies, including medicine. ""It's desperately important that this operation takes place. The lives of tens of thousands of people in Mariupol depend on it,"" it said. Russian forces stole 14 tons of food and medicine intended for Ukrainian civilians Thursday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. Share this -







U.S. official: Russia has fired more than 1,400 missiles at Ukraine More than 1,400 missiles have been fired against Ukraine since Russia attacked last month, and the number of Russian airstrikes has increased despite talk of de-escalation, a U.S. defense official said Thursday. ""Despite the rhetoric of de-escalations, we're still observing artillery fire and airstrikes in and around Kyiv,"" the senior Defense Department official said at a briefing. Some Russian forces have been seen moving from Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, but there has not been a ""wholesale movement, at least not at this point,"" the U.S. official said. The official estimated that the number 20 percent of the Russian forces arrayed just against Kyiv. Russia's deputy defense minister said this week that a decision was made to reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas. U.S. officials have expressed skepticism about the claim. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby has said those troops have not been sent home and that the assessment is they will be resupplied and used elsewhere in Ukraine. Share this -







Russia seizes 14 tons of food and medicine, Ukrainian deputy prime minister says Russian forces continue to stymie humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. In a message posted Thursday on Telegram, Vereshchuk said Russian troops took 14 tons of food and medicine intended for Ukrainian civilians. The Russian military also blocked 45 buses Ukrainian officials sent into Berdyansk. About 600 people must wait until Friday morning to leave for Zaporizhzhia, Vereshchuk said. More than 30 buses remain at the entrance to Berdyansk until then. Nearly 1,460 people were able to reach Zaporizhzhia on Thursday using three humanitarian corridors, she added. The majority are from Mariupol and cities in the Zaporizhzhia region. Share this -







Ukrainians seeking refuge at U.S.-Mexico border stuck in legal limbo Armed with a backpack and a smartphone, Ihor Solomko paced outside the San Ysidro Port of Entry at the U.S.-Mexico border Tuesday, anxiously waiting for news from his eldest daughter, whom officials stopped as she tried to cross into the U.S. that morning after having fled war-torn Ukraine. The family has been separated since 2016, when Solomko and his wife secured green cards and moved permanently to Wisconsin with their youngest daughter. Their older daughter stayed in Ukraine with her husband and hadn’t seen her parents in two years. “I’m so stressed. I can’t think straight,” Solomko said. “I just want to hug my daughter.” Solomko is one of hundreds of Ukrainians living in the U.S. who rushed to pick up loved ones at the U.S.-Mexico border, which became a flashpoint in recent weeks for Eastern Europeans expecting to be immediately welcomed into the U.S. But confusion and frustration are overshadowing humanitarian efforts as conflicting information from the Biden administration leaves thousands of people stuck in legal limbo, without a direct way to seek asylum and making it difficult for loved ones in the U.S. to contact relatives who are being detained or processed by immigration officials.

Zelenskyy says country gradually being freed from 'occupiers' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday the country is gradually being freed from Russian “occupiers.” Zelenskyy said on his official Telegram account that Russian forces, who he said never expected to be fighting after more than a month, are weakening. “We endured tenfold what the enemy thought we would. They said — three or five days. They thought that this would be enough for them to capture our whole country. And it is already 36 days. And we are standing. And we will continue to fight,” he said. “Our Armed Forces, the National Guard, the National Police, intelligence community, they are doing a great job. Absolute gratitude towards them. North of Kyiv, in Chernihiv direction, in Sumy oblast, the expulsion of the occupiers is continuing. They realize it themselves that they are not able to cope with the intensity of the combat operations that they were able to secure in the first half of March. … They are leaving those directions where we are defeating them, so they could focus on other ones.” While most of Zelenskyy’s tone was optimistic, he said Russia is wreaking havoc in southern Ukraine and the Donbas, where the situation remained “very difficult.” Share this -







Pentagon: Weapons shipments arrive in Ukraine WASHINGTON — The Pentagon says an initial half-dozen shipments of weapons and other security assistance have reached Ukraine as part of the $800 million package of aid that President Joe Biden approved on March 16. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Thursday that the shipments included Javelin anti-tank weapons, Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems, body armor, medical supplies and other material.

Kirby said the $800 million in assistance is likely to be fully delivered within about two weeks. It also includes Mi-17 helicopters, small arms, ammunition, vehicles, secure communications systems, and satellite imagery and analysis capability. Separately, Kirby said U.S. troops are not training Ukrainian troops in Poland but are acting as liaisons with Ukrainian personnel who cross the border into Poland to take possession of U.S. security assistance. He noted that the standard U.S. military training mission that had existed in Ukraine for years was suspended shortly before Russia invaded. Share this -

Biden says he is skeptical Putin is pulling back forces Biden told reporters Thursday there is ""no clear evidence"" that Putin is pulling back all of his forces. Of the idea that Putin is pulling all of the troops out from around Kyiv and moving south, ""there's no evidence he's done that,"" Biden said. However, he said there is evidence Putin is ""beefing up"" his troops in the Donbas region. ""Depending on your view of Putin, I'm a little skeptical,"" Biden said.

U.N. struggling to aid cities in south Ukraine The U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine says the United Nations and its partners have delivered supplies for thousands of people in the country's northeast but have been unable to reach some encircled cities in the south. Osnat Lubrani said Thursday that food rations from the humanitarian organization People in Need and the U.N. World Food Program will benefit nearly 6,000 people in Sumy and areas including Trostianets and Okhtyrka. In addition, she said, basic household items including blankets and kettles from the U.N. refugee agency will support 1,500 people and sanitation kits will help 6,000 people with hygiene and drinking water. Lubrani said medical supplies and trauma kits from the U.N. World Health Organization will treat 150 patients needing intensive care for serious injuries while other medical supplies will support 10,000 people for three months. Shei said the U.N.-facilitated humanitarian notification system with Ukraine and Russia enabled safe passage for the convoy to Sumy on Thursday “but this is clearly not enough.” Efforts over the past month to reach Mauripol, Kherson and other encircled cities in the south have been unsuccessful because of safety concerns.

Nuclear operator says Russian forces withdrawing from Chernobyl Russian forces are withdrawing from Chernobyl and the satellite city of Slavutych, according to Energoatom, the national operator of Ukraine's nuclear power plants. Russia captured Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, over a month ago. Since then, a limited number of Ukrainian personnel have remained at the plant to ensure it continues to function. Energoatom said Thursday that the Russian decision to reallocate forces was influenced in part by soldiers' contact with radiation from the site and the resulting symptoms, which sparked concerns. The organization said soldiers from both the plant and the city are headed toward Ukraine's shared border with Belarus. Share this -

Kremlin decree allows foreign currency for gas ROME — A Kremlin decree says “unfriendly countries” can continue to pay for natural gas in foreign currency through a Russian bank that will convert the money into rubles. The decree published Thursday by state media came a day after the leaders of Italy and Germany said they received assurances from President Vladimir Putin. Putin talked tougher, saying Russia will start accepting ruble payments starting Friday for Western countries that imposed sanctions over its conflict with Ukraine. He said contracts will be stopped if buyers don’t sign up to the new conditions, including opening ruble accounts in Russian banks. European leaders had rejected paying for deliveries in rubles, saying it would undermine sanctions imposed because of the war in Ukraine. The decree Putin signed and published by state news agency RIA Novosti says a designated bank will open two accounts for each buyer, one in foreign currency and one in rubles. The buyers will pay in foreign currency and authorize the bank to sell that currency for rubles, which are placed in the second account, where the gas is formally purchased. Share this -

Biden administration weighs releasing 1M barrels of oil a day from reserves President Joe Biden is weighing the release of about 1 million barrels of oil a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for about six months, a source familiar with the matter said. The president could announce the plan, which could free up as much as 180 million barrels of oil, when he delivers remarks from the White House at 1:30 p.m. Thursday. Biden plans to outline his administration's actions to lessen the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on domestic energy and gas prices. The news comes several weeks after he announced the U.S. was banning the import of Russian energy products, including oil, liquified natural gas and coal, as part of an effort to increase pressure on Russia's economy through a range of sanctions. The president and other administration officials made clear that they anticipated the move would lead to a rise in already-high gas prices. Read the full story here. Share this -







She fled the Donbas region years ago. Now, she is helping the latest wave of refugees Anna Chernikova, 26, is spending every day helping refugees get situated in Vinnytsia, a city of approximately 400,000 in west-central Ukraine. Just a few years ago, she was a refugee herself. She left the Donbas region back in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea. Her father moved her, her mother and two brothers to Vinnytsia. “I waved my grandma goodbye and told her I would see her in two weeks. It was the last time I would see her,” she said, standing in a storefront that has been transformed into a humanitarian hub for Ukrainian refugees at a high-end mall. Chernikova stood in the empty storefront full of boxes with clothing donations from all over the world, including the United States. A steady stream of refugees walked past her as they looked for clothes that would fit them.

Russian attacks on Ukraine cast shadow over NATO allies that were Soviet countries TALLINN, Estonia — Each new bomb and missile that strikes Ukraine casts a long shadow across this country and the other Baltic states that share a border with Russia. Unlike Ukraine, however, these states — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — are members of NATO and are close allies of the United States. For years, they have raised the alarm that Russia is their most existential threat. Yet, they feel they received little response prior to the invasion of Ukraine. Now, unless they get further support from their allies, they fear they could be the next target of the Kremlin and the very bombs and missiles that it has used to level Ukrainian cities.

Ukraine's economy could shrink by a fifth this year, European bank says The Ukrainian economy is expected to shrink by one-fifth this year, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said Thursday. The bank said it expected Ukraine’s gross domestic product to fall by 20 percent this year and Russia’s by 10 percent, in its biannual Regional Economic Update published Thursday. The bank said the war was taking place in territories that produce about 60 percent of Ukraine's GDP. It said that the National Bank of Ukraine estimates that 30 percent of businesses have stopped production, while electricity consumption was estimated at about 60 percent of the prewar level. ""Projections are subject to an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty, including major downside risks should hostilities escalate or should exports of gas or other commodities from Russia become restricted,"" it noted. Still, the bank further said that the war would have a ""severe effect"" on economies beyond the immediate area of the conflict. ""The war on Ukraine has been having a profound impact on the economies in the EBRD regions, as well as globally,"" Beata Javorcik, chief economist of the bank, said. ""Inflationary pressures were already exceptionally high and it seems certain they will now be worse, which will have a disproportionate affect on many of the lower income countries where we work.” Share this -
