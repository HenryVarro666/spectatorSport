2,e9708d98-3ea7-44f3-bfc8-503a2181d68b,[],,"Ukrainian TikTokers, at home and abroad, have been livestreaming, recording, and sharing everything from the banal to the brutal since Russia invaded Ukraine.

The Ukranian content creator who has me hooked lives in Kyiv with her 2-year-old daughter. Her most-watched TikTok is not so different from the billions of other videos that populate the Chinese app: She can’t sleep, so she’s recording a video from bed to share her fears and anxieties — teenagers across the world do this routinely. What makes Kristina stand out is the fact that she can’t sleep because she feels explosions shake her house. “This might be the beginning of something serious,” she says. Her shaky voice is backdropped with gentle piano music that she’s added for a haunting effect. A large part of TikTok’s ethos is that videos are built around music.

Seeing war survivors in photographs and videos is not novel. Yet TikTok allows viewers to watch survivors record themselves — and then step behind their cameras to show us what they see. Garmoniya, a TikToker reportedly from Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, posted glamorous videos of herself until a month ago. Now she is in a war zone. In an earlier TikTok, she showed us that an explosion had shattered her bedroom window — there were shards of glass everywhere. In the video, a translator informs us that the window has been replaced, but it doesn’t fit exactly right, there’s a slight draft. You can hear Garmoniya laughing as she talks about the window. Is she laughing at the absurdity of war, happiness for her new window? A lot of TikTok is like this: In exchange for direct access to people’s emotions and viewpoints, for removing the journalist in the middle, viewers sacrifice other details.

Despite this, I continue to scroll — and pause on faces that have now become familiar to me — because the app allows me to interact with those under siege. On Sunday, a Donbas man living in a bunker with a dog and two cats conducted a livestream. He left his dimly-lit bunker to have a smoke outside in the dark. Thousands of viewers stayed, patiently waiting while he finished his cigarette. “What are you feeling?” I typed when he returned to the bunker. “I’m scared because even when this war is over, the trauma, the mines, and the tanks will be here,” came the response. His reply was unedited, unfiltered.

There is no doubt that TikTok is also being used to spread misinformation and disinformation. The app’s structure makes it easy to overlay old audio onto current videos, causing misleading videos to be unintentionally amplified by users. Some users attempt to pass footage from video games, training manuals, or old war films as live. Sifting truth from lies is not easy, but helpful users disseminate tricks and leave messages to help catch fake videos.

There is no dearth of absurd content related to the ongoing war. Videos describing how to turn your American home into a nuclear bunker. Soliloquies describing the history of Russia and Ukraine, in which Vladimir Putin is described as a husband willing to go to any lengths to take back his former wife (Ukraine). The adulatory reactions to TikToks of Ukrainians making Molotov Cocktails are hypocritical — no non-white group of people making bombs for self-preservation has ever received widespread encouragement from the West.

TikTok is undoubtedly playing multiple roles in this war. One of which is that the war and its accompanying acts of brutality are being documented and disseminated across the world. In her 2002 New Yorker article “Looking At War,” Susan Sontag wrote, “[M]any critics have suggested that the agonies of war . . . have devolved into a nightly banality. Flooded with images . . . we are losing our capacity to react.” Will taking in all this content just make us numb? Perhaps what is different about TikTok is that, while documenting, many of the creators are making requests. As television watchers, all we could offer was compassion until the next conflict distracted us, but these creators are asking for sanctions of Russia, for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, and for our protracted attention.

I have absorbed so much content from Ukraine in the last week. When I sleep, I dream about the Ghost of Kyiv — an unconfirmed myth about a Ukrainian fighter pilot who shot down six Russian planes. I wake up and check Kristina’s feed to see if there is new content. But that doesn’t mean that I understand any of what they are feeling. Sontag wrote, “We don’t get it. We truly can’t imagine what it was like. We can’t imagine how dreadful, how terrifying war is — and how normal it becomes. Can’t understand, can’t imagine.” I can converse with these men and women, hear their thoughts in real time, see the shattered glass in their bedrooms, but the distance between our realities isn’t dissolved. We can recognize their wretched fear mixed with hopeful patriotism, but that doesn’t mean we get it.

3,e9708d98-3ea7-44f3-bfc8-503a2181d68b,['Jimin Kang'],2022-03-01,"At first, the idea terrified me. But my apprehension convinced me that this would be a good test both of who I was and what I could do. Giving up English would deconstruct not only an integral part of my identity, but also the way in which I daily build it up. And isn’t this deconstruction at the heart of Lent, at the end of which Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus and the opportunity to begin again?

And so the 40 days began. In lieu of podcasts like The Daily, I would wake up and listen to 10-minute newsreels from Brazil, where I’d spent a gap year after high school. As the frigid New Jersey winter slowly turned to spring, I would listen to stories about Carnaval and vaccination rates in São Paulo. In the evenings, I would make my way through Spanish-language Netflix shows or scour news websites in Korean.

One morning, I wrote in my journal about a dream I’d had about a close friend who I had fallen out with. I forced myself to describe our dream-dialogue in a language he didn’t speak. “This language was never ours,” I wrote, in Portuguese, “but I will try to express what I saw and felt anyway.” Although writing in a language foreign to our relationship impersonalized the hurt, it also doubled the frustration I felt: first at having lost the friendship, and again at being unable to write about it in the cathartically expressive way I needed.

Through processes like these, I was reminded of how English — or rather, the ease with which I could inhabit it and feel as if I didn’t need anything else — was intricately linked to my relationships with my family and my faith. Throughout my childhood, I followed my parents to a Korean Catholic church in Hong Kong, where my inability to fully understand the priest’s Korean-language sermons made it difficult for my faith to grow. To this day, all the prayers I have memorized are in Korean, but reciting them brings less spiritual comfort than it does a familiar ease, in the way a lullaby might.

Outside of church, I faced a similar roadblock when I wanted to have deeper, more honest conversations with my parents. Plagued by the belief that there was a language barrier between us, I would refrain from sharing certain things: like the literature I was reading, what these books taught me about myself, or reflections I had about my changing relationship to religion. How could I explain, in a language I associated with their parenting and my childhood, that my nascent adult identity demanded a different kind of prayer — one that, instead of asking for simple forgiveness, broached topics of misplaced intimacies, difficult decisions and a desire to grow apart from my parents so I could become a person of my own?",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/opinion/lent-sacrifice-english.html

Keplinger, Kody. 2018. That’s Not What Happened. Scholastic Inc. (Scholastic Press). 336pp. $18.99 (Hardcover). ISBN 978-1-338-18652-9.

Powerful and profound, are two words to describe the experiences of the six survivors in the years following a traumatic event , a school shooting. In her first year at Virgil County High School, Lee, and her best friend Sarah, were in the bathroom when an active shooter entered their school and shot seven students (including Sarah) and two teachers The media quickly shared the events of the day throughout the town, county and country. A major newsworthy story from the shooting was Sarah talking back to the shooter and dying while proclaiming her faith. Lee knew this was not what happened. The other survivor who had been in the bathroom, Kellie, spoke up right away and said it was her necklace, not Sarah’s. Nobody believed Kellie, the quiet emo girl, would have owned a cross necklace, much less proclaimed her faith in what were possibly her final moments. The town shunned her and drove her family out of town. Lee was unable to speak the truth for three years about the events of the shooting. When she did tell people the truth, she faced hostility and was called a liar. In order to get the truth out, she came up with the idea to have all of the survivors write letters about their experience. While collecting these letters from Denny, Eden, Miles and Ashley, Lee believes she has to find a way to contact Kellie and get her to write a letter as well so she could have everyone’s story. After hearing Kellie say she does not want to write a letter, Lee realizes trying to force her to tell her story is the opposite of giving a voice to the survivors. They should all have the choice to share their experience, or not. Lee decides to give Kellie the letters and let her make the decision to publish them or not.

Told from the first person point of view, readers see Lee’s current narrative, flashbacks to her past, letters from the other survivors and small obituaries for the victims. These different settings enable the reader to see different points of view and piece together the events of the shooting. The setting painted by the use of flashbacks to the day of the shooting creates a dreadful, deafening mood transporting the reader to the position of the survivors recounting their actions. The exposition of the story shows readers how Lee is coping three years after the shooting. Underlying the exposition is the big anticipated reveal of the truth about what happened with Sarah in the bathroom. Lee’s desire to reveal the truth begins the rising action, along her reading of her friend Denny’s scholarship letter, which prompts her to collect letters from each of the survivors in order to tell their stories. The main conflict occurs while Lee is trying to tell her community the truth about Sarah. Sarah’s parents, her pastor, and members of the community, all reject her statements and believe that Lee is lying. This creates the person versus society conflict between Lee and the community, which underlies the rest of the story. The climax occurs when Lee is finally able to meet with Kellie, who refuses to write a letter. Following this conversation, Lee realizes that trying to make the survivors share their stories is not making their voices heard, unless they freely choose to do so. The falling action occurs when she goes to a party Miles and Denny are at, but gets cornered by other students harassing her for lying about Sarah. Miles saves her from the panic attack she is having and gives her his letter. Thus, his story is revealed to the reader and Lee realizes she loves him. The resolution is Lee deciding to give the letters to Kellie so she can choose to publish them or not. One of the aspects of a compelling story is having relatable characters. Readers see firsthand into the eyes of each and every survivor as they write their letters. The reader also sees Lee’s transformation from an anxious girl who is struggling to tell the truth about the shooting, into a more enlightened version of herself. She realizes telling the truth may do more harm than good, and survivors should have the option to share their experiences.There are themes of trauma, PTSD, gun violence, perseverance, friendship and the power of rumors addressed throughout the story. Each survivor deals with PTSD in their own way, but readers clearly see the effects on Lee as well as Eden.The theme of friendship is shown through Lee and her friends, and fellow survivors, Eden, Denny and Miles who supported her unconditionally throughout her endeavors of trying to come out with the truth. She needed each of the other survivors after the shooting and formed bonds with them others could not understand. (SAB)

Stein, David Ezra. 2019. Hush, Little Bunny. HarperCollins (Balzer + Bray). 40pp. $17.99 (Hardcover). ISBN 978-0-06-284522-1.

A heartwarming tale about a father’s love for his son is revealed through a new version of a traditional children’s rhyme. Told from the 3rd person point of view, the exposition depicts the season changing to spring and papa bunny deciding to show his son the new world. They encounter a host of conflicts throughout their day; cloudy skies, dying clovers, hawks, rain, unfair bunnies, a firefly flying away, and the sun setting. The baby bunny encounters a few different types of conflicts, one of which is person vs person. This happens when the other bunnies are not playing fair with baby bunny as well as when the hawk flies overhead. The other type of conflict is person vs nature. Multiple times throughout the day, the bunnies run into different aspects of nature. These include the cloudy skies, dying clovers, rain and the sun going down. In this regard, the setting can acts as the antagonist when these acts of nature occur and challenge the bunnies. Throughout all of these obstacles, papa bunny protects his son and helps him to overcome his fears. The resolution occurs when papa bunny tells his son he will always love him, no matter the season.

Throughout the course of the narrative, the lines created by different aspects of the illustrations create direction and lead the readers eyes across the page. For example, the hill in the beginning with the bunny at the bottom curves, leading the eye across the pages. In addition, often the bunnies are either looking the direction the reader should go or running across the page leading the eyes. When it rains, both the rain falling and the bunnies jumping create diagonal lines. Diagonal lines imply a loss of balance or chaos, which is very accurate of a rainy day. The predominant colors include green, brown, yellow and blue. These are very typical colors of an outdoor setting. The warm yellows and greens give the reader a bright and happy feeling as the bunny is content and safe with his father. When the rain comes, the colors shift to more cool shades of blue and grey. This contrasts the warm colors used when things are going well for the bunnies. In addition, the sky illustrates the passing of time. In the introduction, the sun is just coming up and gives off a light yellow hue. As the day progresses, the yellow gets brighter until the sun sets at the end of the day giving off an orange and pink glow. As the book is set in nature, the curved shapes are used and vary between pages, as real plants would. The only geometric shape is a house off in the distance, which has straight lines and right angles denoting a synthetic structure. This house also appears on the page about papa bunny bringing his son back into the light after hiding from a hawk. Therefore, the house projects safety and stability through its solid shapes. The uneven shapes used for the plants and surrounding environment make the reader visualize real plants. This leads to the brush strokes looking fairly large in order to portray that nature isn’t perfectly contained to precise shapes. Texture is seen through these brush strokes as well as the use of watercolor paper to make the illustrations. Watercolor paper gives the illusion of the different dimensions of color that are true to nature. The overall themes of love and overcoming obstacles are present in the text. Papa bunny clearly loves his son, and does everything in his power to protect him. He also shows his son how to look on the bright side of situations and overcome challenges he may face in his life. Baby bunny begins as a sheltered child who did not know very much about the world, but through his father's guidance, blossoms into a more knowledgeable bunny. (SAB)

Yolen, Jane. 2018. How Do Dinosaurs Learn to Read? Scholastic Inc (The Blue Sky Press). 40pp. $16.99 (Hardcover). ISBN 978-1-338-23301-8. Illustrated by Mark Teague.

The question of how a dinosaur learns to read is explored throughout the book, followed by different actions showing what a dinosaur might do with a book. In the resolution the reader learns a dinosaur would be kind to books and read each page carefully. By reading this text young readers can learn appropriate ways to treat books. Cool colors of blue, brown, and green are used on dinosaurs, however , they do not depict anything sad or calm. Warm yellows and reds are used on a few dinosaurs demonstrating what not to do to a book. The texture is a unique feature of these illustrations. The brush strokes used on the dinosaurs make the reader feel like they are leaping off the page. The ridges in their throats are clear as well as the differences in their skin and the bumps on one of the dinosaurs. The shapes of the dinosaurs vary from one to another, a few have patterns of abstract shapes and some have stripes or circles. This variation in the illustration excites young readers .The dinosaurs have clearly curved lines making up their bodies, where as the rest of the scene has very straight lines which imply objects being artificial. This difference clearly illustrates how different and unique the dinosaurs are to their environment, which makes them stand out. Readers are compelled to guess what might happen next, through the constant restating of the question and title of the book. They can develop their cognitive skills through observing the actions of the dinosaurs who are behaving badly and then analyze what makes their behavior inappropriate. In addition, readers can compare dinosaurs in terms of actions they take as well as the ways in which they look different or similar. Along with developing cognitive skills, children can also expand their imaginations by thinking about dinosaurs to read books. The overall theme of the story is showing children how to properly care for books and to be respectful when it comes to reading them. (SAB)

Krause, J. R. 2019. Dragon Night. Penguin Random House LLC (G.P Putnam’s Sons). 32pp. $16.99 (Hardcover). ISBN 978-0-52-551424-4.

Georgie and his dragon friend embark on a journey and face their fears in this heartwarming tale about friendship. In the exposition, Georgie is lying in bed, trying to sleep but he is unable to as he is afraid of the night. The only colors present in the entire scene are black, white and blue. The cool blue color dominates depicting the sad and scared mood of Georgie. When a book falls open and a dragon pops out, they become fast friends over their seemingly common fear. The dragon is afraid of the knight, but Georgie is afraid of the night. This difference introduces and reinforces the concept of homophones. When the dragon pops out of the book, yellows and oranges are used to reflect the changing mood. After they fly across the city, they sit down and talk about the night. The dragon tells Georgie the dark is not always scary, because without the dark you would be unable to see the stars and would not be able to experience the quietness and peace night brings. This is when the characterization of Georgie becomes apparent. He matures and realizes the night is not as terrible as he thought. The theme of facing one's fears is revealed through the characterization of Georgie. Looking on the bright side and positives about one's fears is one way to face them. Learning how to face fears helps to further the personal development of readers, as all children experience fears. In the morning, they realize the dragon cannot stay, but he does not want to go back with the knight. The resolution occurs when Georgie decides to draw a new story for the dragon in which the knight wants to be his friend.

One day in his office, rising action starts to take hold as he meets Maria Reynolds. She claims her husband has been mistreating her and she needs his help to get out of the marriage. Eliza also comes up with the idea to open the first orphanage in New York City. In order to fund this, she must receive donations from all of the wealthy families around the city. Thus, she goes on a carriage trip for a week to visit the different families. While on this trip she falls ill for three weeks with pneumonia. During the expedition of his wife, Alex goes to visit Maria and he cheats on his wife with her.

Stevens, Janet and Susan Stevens Crummel. 2019. The Donkey Egg. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH Books for Young Readers). 48pp. $17.99. ISBN 978-0-54-732767-9. Illustrated by Janet Stevens.

This is a heartwarming story of a bear who is tricked by a fox into believing that a watermelon is a donkey egg. The story may help readers learn valuable lessons about life. Fox sees Bear sitting in his chair outside his run-down farmhouse and tricks him into paying him for a “donkey egg.” Bear believes Fox and takes care of the egg by keeping it warm, safe, and happy. Hare sees Bear with the egg and tries to tell him donkeys are not born from eggs, but Bear believes Fox was telling him the truth. When Fox returns to talk to Bear, readers can see the disheveled look of bear and his house. The illustrations show trash, scattered tools and a shaggy looking Bear. The textures of his fur coat, depicted by lines going every direction, help to add to the idea of Bear being extremely worn out and grumpy. When Bear eventually falls asleep, the egg rolls away down a hill. After Bear and Hare chase the egg, it hits a tree and cracks. While they are chasing the egg, the shapes of the characters from lines leading the readers eyes across the pages, portraying the idea of a fast paced chase happening. When the egg hits the tree, Bear finds out the egg is not actually an egg, but a watermelon. As the bright warm red which makes up the inside of the watermelon spills out, it at first seems sad. However while Bear is sad about not getting a donkey, he realizes he can plant the seeds to grow more watermelons. This optimism and hope for the future is what the color red is portraying. Hare helps Bear plant his fields and when the watermelons are sold, they buy a baby donkey. In seeing this, the reader finds out Fox was for certain, not to be trusted. In a way, person vs person conflict is present between Bear and Fox, however this conflict is not apparent to Bear until the end of the story. This interaction displays the theme of not trusting everyone right away and not taking things at face value. In order to determine if someone is telling the truth, one would have to know more about the situation as well as the person. Thus children learn not to trust everyone they meet, but to look further into situations they may face. In being able to buy the donkey he wanted in the first place, Bear learns the value of hard work. In addition, by taking care of the egg for so long, he learns about perseverance. While the egg may not have turned into a donkey like he had hoped it would, it still played an instrumental role in getting his farm up and working again. Bear transforms from a grumpy, disheveled bear into a bear that knows how to work hard, persevere through challenges and not trust everything people say. Hard work and perseverance are greatly valued in cultures all around the world, and are valuable concepts for children to learn at a young age.

The story also has a unique aspect to the style. It contains “Did you know?” boxes at the bottom of the pages where Bear is talking about the length of time he has been taking care of the egg. These boxes not only give equivalent measures of time to the time Bear talks about, but also provide real-life examples of things which take the same amount of time to occur. This allows children to put an amount of time into perspective and compare it to things they already have a concept of. The story uses the traditional characters of Fox, Hare and Bear to portray the lessons to be learned. Foxes are generally sly, clever characters who often trick others for their own gain. Hare is a fast paced friendly character while Bear is old, lazy and cranky. The way these animals are portrayed in this story stay true to the common ways these animals are depicted in folk literature. The story even points these personality traits out on a page before the book begins. (SAB)

Phelan, Matt. 2018. Knights vs. Dinosaurs. HarperCollins Publishers. (Greenwillow Books). 160pp. $16.99 (Hardcover). ISBN 978-0-06-268623-7.

Two common fascinations of children; knights and dinosaurs, collide in this exciting tale of unlikely heroism and action. In the exposition, Sir Eric, one of the knights of King Arthur’s round table, is attending a banquet in Camelot. When he decides to exaggerate his feats by saying he defeated forty dragons, Merlin challenges him to defeat fearsome lizard in a cave. Eric and three other knights agree to come along on this quest. As they venture into the cave, they read a book and are placed to a new world in which dinosaurs roam the Earth. The new setting of the world in which dinosaurs exist is the antagonist, as the knights are continually challenged this unfamiliar world. This new setting in time presents aspects of a time warp, even though the central part of the plot based on a mythical quest. The main conflict arises as they face a dinosaur for the first time in battle and their encounter does not go as planned. Person versus person conflict arises in the form of knights vs dinosaurs, and continues until the resolution. Another central conflict is the knights against one another. Each knight believes they will be best if they go off on their own. After they encounter more hardships on their own, they reconvene and realize in order to survive, they must work together. The aforementioned theme of teamwork is central to the plot. Once they are back together Mel, whom is the squire of one of the knights, is taken by a flying dinosaur. The knights know they must work together to save her. After saving her, the climax occurs as they go back to the cave they arrived in to find a way to escape. However, they find the path blocked by multiple giant dinosaurs. As the knights fight, Mel has the brilliant idea to use fire to encircle the dinosaurs so they can escape. This illustrates the theme of unlikely characters being heroes. Mel is only a squire, and female as well, but without her the knights would not have escaped. Readers can further their social development skills in learning about teamwork and cooperation along with the knights. The illustrations on a number of pages supplement the sequence of events occurring in the tale. There is a battle with the dinosaurs, which is conveyed through illustrations in a graphic novel type of format. In addition, while the knights are in a lake swimming, a dinosaur comes up from the depths through an illustration, not a written description. This not only makes things easier for young readers to grasp, but it also helps suspend disbelief. The illustrations show events actually happening, which helps readers place the writing into a visual representation of the enchanted world. In addition, disbelief is suspended by having flawed, realistic and relatable characters. None of the characters are perfect, or make all the right decisions. They struggle with cooperation and teamwork. This encourages children to relate to the characters by reflecting on their own behaviors and actions. Disbelief is suspended by using an already established setting: Camelot, with King Arthur and Merlin from the Knights of the Round Table. Readers are introduced to characters they may have been exposed to prior to reading. Also, children learn from a young age dinosaurs were real at one point in time, which furthers the credibility of the plot, conflicts, themes, characters, and setting. (SAB)

Engledow, Dave. 2018. The Little Girl Who Wanted To Be Big. HarperCollins. 40pp. $17.99. ISBN 978-0-06-242539-3. Illustrated by Dave, Engledow.



The protagonist desires to be a “big kid”. The exposition features a young girl who wants to be bigger and the plot is moved by conflicts that arise because she is not big enough. These conflicts are solved by the protagonist waking up big. The conflicts are simple and the resolutions do not make sense without the reader being able to see the images accompanying the text. The main feature of the images is the size of the child compared to her surroundings. She is smaller than everything else for the first half of the book and larger than her surroundings for the second half.



This text supports the idea that children will magically be given exactly what they want without any work. It projects an idea that children are incapable, and the upper middle class, white, hetero-normative family image that a majority of children simply do not have. (ALB)

Elizabeth Jennings was an African American woman who lived in New York City in the mid 1800’s. She was a catalyst for African American rights activists.

When Aisulu’s brother, Serik breaks his femur on a trip in the Mongolian countryside, her life is changed. Serik’s injury causes their parents to take him to the hospital over 100 miles away in Ulaanbaatar where his leg is amputated, leaving Aisulu behind with her uncle and aunt. Conflict occurs when Aisulu’s father informs her they will have to sell their ger (yurt) and herds, so they can live near the hospital and buy Serik a prosthetic leg. Aisulu, who has just rescued a weak and starving eaglet, is determined to save and train it, in order to win the prize money at the eagle festival in Ulaanbaatar. In Kazakh culture, girls are not burkitshi, which translates to eagle hunters. Readers follow Aisulu as she learns to rise above society’s limitations placed on her gender with support from her aunt, who accepts her for who she is. The unique style uses Kazakh and Arabic words and phrases, as they relate to the life of Kazakh nomads in Mongolia. The theme of family is evident as Aisulu seeks to save her family’s nomadic lifestyle and as she leans on her aunt and uncle for support while she trains her eagle. (AMC)

Virginia Laydon lives in colonial James Town and has a unique gift; she has premonitions. Her gift is dangerous, as her grandmother, who also had this gift, was executed after being found guilty of witchcraft. When Virginia’s mother discovers Virginia’s gift, she tries to kill her daughter. Virginia survives the attempt on her life, but her mother informs her she must get rid of her gift or she will be killed. Virginia attempts to get rid of her gift and it begins to disappear. However, one day Virginia has a feeling the colony is going to be poisoned and must decide whether to tell or not. Virginia overcomes her fear of retribution for using her gift to risk her life to save the colony. Trust is a recurring theme as Virginia learns to trust herself as well as her mother when trying to alert the colony to the possibility of being poisoned. There are some historical inaccuracies, as the Colonists are portrayed as being kind and eager to get along, while the Algonquian people are portrayed as wanting conflict. Additionally, the colonists’ negative views on slavery reflect those of the modern day rather than those of people in 1622. (AMC)
