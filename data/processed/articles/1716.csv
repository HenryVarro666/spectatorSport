According to Energy Minister Herman Halyshchenko, Ukraine regained full control over the plant after a fierce battle. “The plant’s staff left shelters and returned back to work,” he informed, according to Kyiv Independent. Heavy infighting broke out in the capital overnight, and footage circulated by Ukraine showed that the Russian forces bombarded the residential apartment building not far from the Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany) with missile attacks. No deaths were reported.

Capital’s energy-generating company attacked

The Ukrainian side also reported that the capital’s energy-generating company was attacked at around 6:24 am and was caught ablaze. The plant was taken over by the Ukraine forces the next hour. The Russian paratroopers, according to Vasylkiv Mayor Nataliia Balasynovych, landed with parachutes in the fields, forests, and villages of Vasylkiv and unleashed the attacks across several areas including the Decembrists Street, which Kyiv claims, was set on fire. Russian troops attempted to capture an airfield to deploy their troops, but Ukraine’s 40th Brigade “repulsed the attack, ” Balasynovych told the newspaper. The air raid alerts went off in Kharkiv and Odesa regions and Russian fighter jets flew over the city of Konotop.

At least two loud explosions were heard in the Konotop area. Ukraine’s 101st brigade meanwhile opened fire on the Russian forces as intense fighting ensued on both sides. A Russian drone also reportedly targeted the Ukrainian border guard ship near Chornomorsk, Odesa Oblast and attacks were launched in Mykolaiv, a city near the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada reported on Saturday.

Ukraine Army also downed Russian Il-76 transporter aircraft as more than 50 explosions were heard from the heavy machine gun fires across the Ukrainian civilian cities, the Ukraine Army stated. Russian troops also launched an offensive on the thermal power station in Troieshchyna, Kyiv’s northern left bank.

Ukrainian officials were not immediately available for comment on the fate of Melitopol, a city of about 150,000 people. If confirmed, it would be the first significant population center the Russians have seized since their invasion began on Thursday.

Earlier, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces fired cruise missiles from the Black Sea at Mariupol, as well as Sumy in the northeast and Poltava in the east.

For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.

Kyiv authorities said a missile hit a residential building and a Reuters witness said another hit an area near the airport. There was no immediate word on casualties.

Earlier, gunfire erupted near city-center government buildings, a Reuters witness said. The cause was not clear.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking in a video message from outside his Kyiv office, was defiant. “We will not put down weapons, we will defend our state,” he said.

Ukrainian authorities have urged citizens to help defend Kyiv from the advancing Russian forces but even as the fighting grew more intense, the Russian and Ukrainian governments signaled an openness to negotiations, offering the first glimmer of hope for diplomacy since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion.

The air force command earlier reported heavy fighting near an air base at Vasylkiv southwest of the capital, which it said was under attack from Russian paratroopers.

It said one of its fighters had shot down a Russian transport plane. Reuters could not independently verify the claims.

Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the president’s office, said the situation in Kyiv and its outskirts was under control.

“There are cases of sabotage and reconnaissance groups working in the city, police and self-defense forces are working efficiently against them,” Podolyak said.

Kyiv residents were told by the defense ministry to make petrol bombs to repel the invaders.

Some families cowered in shelters and hundreds of thousands have left their homes to find safety, according to a UN aid official.

Ukraine said more than 1,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. Russia did not release casualty figures. Zelenskyy said late on Thursday that 137 soldiers and civilians been killed with hundreds wounded.

Putin’s appeal

After weeks of warnings from Western leaders, Putin unleashed a three-pronged invasion of Ukraine from the north, east and south on Thursday, in an attack that threatened to upend Europe’s post-Cold War order.

“I once again appeal to the military personnel of the armed forces of Ukraine: do not allow neo-Nazis and (Ukrainian radical nationalists) to use your children, wives and elders as human shields,” Putin said at a televised meeting with Russia’s Security Council.

“Take power into your own hands.”

Putin has cited the need to “denazify” Ukraine’s leadership as one of his main reasons for invasion, accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss the accusations as baseless propaganda.

Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and Kyiv hopes to join NATO and the EU - aspirations that infuriate Moscow.

Putin says Ukraine, a democratic nation of 44 million people, is an illegitimate state carved out of Russia, a view Ukrainians see as aimed at erasing their more than thousand-year history.

Communication channels

Western countries have announced a barrage of sanctions on Russia, including blacklisting its banks and banning technology exports. But they have stopped short of forcing it out of the SWIFT system for international bank payments.

The United States imposed sanctions on Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov. The European Union and Britain earlier froze any assets Putin and Lavrov held in their territory. Canada took similar steps.

The invasion triggered a flurry of credit rating moves on Friday, with S&P lowering Russia’s rating to “junk” status, Moody’s putting it on review for a downgrade to junk, and S&P and Fitch swiftly cutting Ukraine on default worries.

But amid the chaos of war came a ray of hope.

A spokesman for Zelenskyy said Ukraine and Russia would consult in coming hours on a time and place for talks.

The Kremlin said earlier it offered to meet in the Belarusian capital Minsk after Ukraine expressed a willingness to discuss declaring itself a neutral country while Ukraine had proposed Warsaw as the venue. That, according to Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov, resulted in a “pause” in contacts.

“Ukraine was and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace,” Zelenskyy’s spokesman, Sergii Nykyforov, said in a Facebook post. “We agreed to the proposal of the President of the Russian Federation.”

But US State Department spokesman Ned Price said Russia’s offer was an attempt to conduct diplomacy “at the barrel of a gun” and Putin’s military must stop bombing Ukraine if it was serious about negotiations.

At the United Nations, Russia vetoed a draft Security Council resolution that would have deplored its invasion, while China abstained, which Western countries took as proof of Russia’s isolation. India also abstained while most members voted in favor.

The White House asked Congress for $6.4 billion in security and humanitarian aid for the crisis, officials said, and Biden instructed the US State Department to release $350 million in military aid.

An earlier Reuters report incorrectly stated that Russian troops had taken over the Kyiv hydroelectric power plant, according to Interfax.

5,59b52e21-f693-43ed-b90e-e025e4876e69,[],2022-02-26 20:18:05,"Ukraine’s energy system is continuing to function as Russia invades the country, but a stray rocket that damages energy infrastructure or a nuclear power plant could prove a major blow, a Ukrainian energy company warned on Saturday (26 February).

The country’s energy system is under as much control as it can be given the circumstances, with some local disturbances, but no major impacts yet, representatives from the Ukrainian energy company DTEK told journalists in a press conference.

However, they warned that things change by the hour and that, although Russian forces are not targeting critical energy infrastructure at this stage, it is not guaranteed that a stray rocket would not damage something like a transformer or nuclear power plant.

According to Ukrainian’s Ministry of Infrastructure, there have already been risks. The Ukrainian air defence shot down a rocket heading towards the dam of the Kyiv Reservoir, the destruction of which could have caused an accident at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, the government said.

“If some big element of the energy system is damaged or destroyed … if it’s out of the grid unexpectedly, the system operator staff may not be able to timely do the necessary changes of the connections scheme, and that may lead the automatic cut off of the system to prevent the bigger disaster,” said Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK.

“Taking into account the [in]accuracy of Russian rockets that they are sending from their territory, that may happen because they just can unexpectedly or unintentionally hit this big piece of infrastructure,” he added.

Concerns about nuclear energy

Ukraine is highly reliant on nuclear power, with 15 reactors, providing about half of its electricity.

But there is a danger that, intentionally or unintentionally, Russian forces could damage these or hit vital infrastructure, causing a major disruption to the electricity supply, said Timchenko.

Currently, all Ukrainian nuclear power plants – barring the now out of commission Chernobyl – are in Ukrainian hands and defended by the military.

However, there are concerns about a thermal power plant and a nuclear power plant – the biggest of their kinds in the country – located around the town of Enerhodar in the south of Ukraine, which Russian troops are currently 25 km away from.

“Our military forces strengthen their positions around nuclear power plants but nobody can say with certainty [whether] they can keep them under control,” said Timchenko.

And with threats of stray Russian rockets comes the unthinkable: damage to a nuclear power plant that could create safety concerns, raising the spectre of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986.

“I don’t want to read in the news that somebody said about a high risk of nuclear explosion, but [my] first statement is that based on our experience for the last days, Russia is not targeting critical infrastructure, including nuclear power stations,” said Timchenko.

“Of course, the level of their madness [is] at the highest level, but I hope that it’s not at the level to start shelling nuclear power units. So it can be potentially unintentionally hit, like we experience in other infrastructural objects or facilities,” he added.

Indeed, there are already safety concerns around Chernobyl, which is currently held by the Russians. The Ukrainian government has warned that levels of radiation have exceeded due to military equipment moving the topsoil.

The Ukrainian government stresses that the responsibility for this situation lies with “the invaders”.

“This is one of the most serious threats to Europe today, as any provocations by the invaders in Chernobyl during the hybrid war could potentially turn into another planetary environmental catastrophe,” it adds.

Localised damage

Since Russia invaded on Thursday, the Ukrainian energy system has seen localised damage. One thermal power station is out of operation and disconnected from the grid. It was taken over by Russian forces on Saturday, according to DTEK.

Alongside this, 40% of DTEK’s 1 gigawatt of renewable energy is offline due to a broken connector that cannot be accessed to repair.

However, neither of these are major blows to the energy system.

“We experienced damages of transmission lines and substations in 50% of regional companies, but we do not have any major disruption of electricity supplied to our consumers in all the regions,” said Timchenko.

Some local regions are also suffering losses of gas. The Luhansk region has been disconnected from its gas supply due to damage to the network, according to Ukraine’s transmission system operator (TSO).

But, as of 7:30 on Saturday morning, the TSO was still transporting natural gas to consumers and keeping the system balanced, it reported. While some staff are now working remotely for their safety, the company’s facilities in all of Ukraine, including areas of military operation, continue to operate.

Because of the constant changes, Ukrainian energy companies are also meeting every two hours with the energy ministry. On Saturday, there was an agreement for energy prices to be set by a regulator due to the market uncertainty and vulnerability.

It has also been decided to switch the country’s thermal plants from using coal to gas because coal supply routes by sea are already blocked and routes over land are also at risk.

Ukraine has about 15-20 days’ worth of coal in reserves, so it switched to gas since most of its gas wells are still functioning and it can use Russian gas transiting through the country.

“As long as we have transit of Russian gas through our system, I believe we will have enough gas for our power generation,” said Timchenko.

Isolated electricity

Ukraine is currently disconnected from the Russian, Belarusian and EU electricity grids and Timchenko voiced doubt that the country will be reconnected to the Belarusian and Russian grids.

While there is baseload power from nuclear energy, Ukraine’s isolation limits the ability of the grid to adapt to demand.

“We have enough capacity. If we have a stable operation of our nuclear company, we will have enough generation capacity to stay in isolated mode. But where we have problems is the flexibility of the system and stability of the system,” he explained.

Ukraine now wants full integration of its electricity into Europe’s grid and the network of transmission system operators (ENTSO-E). This could be done in months, if not weeks, said Timchenko.

Kramer']",2022-02-25 00:00:00,"KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian defense forces, outmanned and outgunned, waged a ferocious resistance to the Russian invasion on Saturday, battling to keep control of the capital, Kyiv, and other cities around the country.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine posted a video on Twitter, telling the public not to believe false reports.

He was alive. Kyiv had not fallen. Any reports of Ukraine laying down its arms was a lie, Mr. Zelensky said.

“I’m here,” he said. “We are not putting down any arms. We will protect our country, because our weapons are our truth. The truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will protect them all.”

“That is it. That’s what I wanted to tell you. Glory to Ukraine.”

His comments, released before 9 a.m., came as fighting intensified in Kyiv. What until three days ago had been a thriving European metropolis has been transformed into a battle zone. Russian troops pressed in from all directions.

There was intense street fighting, and bursts of gunfire and explosions could be heard across the city, including its heart, Maidan square, where in 2014 Ukrainian protests led to the toppling of a pro-Moscow government.

The Russian military has a decisive edge in cyberwarfare, tanks, heavy weaponry, missiles, fighter planes and warships. In sheer numbers, its military dwarfs that of Ukraine.

Russia has established attack lines into three cities — Kyiv in the north, Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south — and Ukrainian troops are fighting to hold all three. The Pentagon reported late Friday that the Russians did not appear to be in control of a single major population center. Significantly, a senior U.S. defense official said, Ukrainian command and control remains intact.

The Ukrainian government reported that hundreds of Russian soldiers had been killed in the war, along with scores of their own soldiers, while the Russian defense ministry issued a statement on Saturday morning that made no mention of any casualties or anything about the fight for Kyiv.

The Russian invasion started with targeted airstrikes before dawn on Thursday, but on the third day of the war, bloody battles were often being waged in close quarters. Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news site, citing witnesses, reported combat 400 yards from Maidan Square in central Kyiv.

All Ukrainian men of fighting are being drafted into service, and tens of thousands are signing up. Ukrainians were asked to make Molotov cocktails. And there were tearful scenes at airports in western Ukraine as wives kissed their husbands goodbye before they headed to front.

The nation has rallied around its president, Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian.

To him and other officials, the objective of the Russian invasion of a neighboring country that possessed no military threat is to topple the government.

Mr. Zelensky has said that he is “target no. 1.”

As battles were waged around the city on Saturday morning, there were reports of clashes near the city’s train station and along a central thoroughfare, Bohdan Khmelnitsky Street, leading from Victory Square toward the city center, according to the witness accounts. Along that street, closer to the city center, bursts of gunfire could be heard through the night.

“We are stopping the horde, so far as we can,” the secretary of the Ukrainian Security and Defense Council, Oleksy Danilov, said around 7 a.m. “The situation is under control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and citizens of Kyiv.”

In dozens of interviews in the tense hours before the invasion and in the days after, Ukrainians struggled to understand how a country at peace so suddenly found itself at war. For many Ukrainians, the answer was found in Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.

This is Mr. Putin’s war. But what frightened people perhaps as much as the threat of missiles and bombs was that they did not know what he wanted.

The fear was evident in the drive from Kyiv to a small village outside the city. Military convoys had replaced families going on vacation or visiting friends. Where once Kyiv was known as a city where the music played a touch too loud in its cafes, the incessant wail of air raid sirens drowned out all joy.

The fear was evident in the faces of the people seeking safety in Western Ukraine, after they emerged from 20-hour train rides in packed carriages that were kept pitch-black to avoid being targeting by Russian rockets.

From Lviv in the west to Odessa in the south and Kharkiv and nearly all points in between, people huddled in air raid shelters and lined up and bank machines and stocked up on essentials.

Two separate Russian missile attacks on oil and gas facilities in northern Ukraine late Saturday caused massive explosions and fires that could easily become environmental catastrophes, according to Ukrainian officials in the cities impacted by the blasts.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, Russian troops fired a missile that hit a major gas pipeline late Saturday night, local officials said. The resulting blast was so massive that it prompted the government to specifically caution residents that what they had seen was not a nuclear bomb.

""This is NOT a nuclear strike, although the explosion is visually similar to it,"" the Kharkiv government Telegram channel warned, according to an NBC translation of the message.

The channel advised residents to close their windows, purify the air if possible and prepare to wear wet masks if they smelled smoke.

Around 250 miles west of Kharkiv, the same advisory was issued to residents in and near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv after Russian troops blew up a fuel tank in Vasylkiv.

According to the regional governor of the state where Kyiv is located, the missile attack cut off Vasylkiv's gas supply and caused a fire so large that it could be seen 15 miles away in the capital. Fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces prevented first responders from extinguishing the fire, the governor said in a Telegram post.

""This night, the occupiers are causing man-made disasters,"" said the local government of Kharkiv.

The attacks on the fuel lines came as invading Russian troops encountered resistance Saturday and early Sunday from the Ukrainian military, which managed to hold all three of the cities Moscow had targeted: Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson.

U.S. officials said Saturday they believe Russian President Vladimir Putin was unprepared for the tenacity of Ukraine's military response.

They said Putin was mistakenly convinced that Ukraine's military would collapse within hours of a Russian invasion, and its president Volodomyr Zelenskyy would flee. Neither of these happened.
