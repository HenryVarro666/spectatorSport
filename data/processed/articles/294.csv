According to him, there is an official decision of Poland to transfer the aircrafts to the appropriate American base. The agreement between the American side and Poland has been reached. ""But at the same time, we hear that Poland's proposal seems to be unreasonable. And that's what they say in Washington. So when the decision will be taken?"" Zelensky said.

1,3dd931b0-9add-4d71-a3b9-e49052856ea2,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],2022-03-09 00:00:00,"Washington (CNN) The Pentagon said Wednesday that it is bluntly opposed to a Polish plan to provide fighter jets to Ukraine.

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told the Polish minister of defense that the US does not support the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets to the Ukrainian air force ""at this time,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said, either by Poland transferring them to Ukraine with the US backfilling Poland's fleet or by Poland transferring the MiG-29s to the US to then give to Ukraine.

Austin ""stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time, and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody either,"" Kirby said.

His comments come a day after the US rejected a proposal from Poland to send Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine by way of a US-NATO air base in Germany.

The US and NATO want to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian troops invading the country, but also avoid being drawn into an outright conflict with Russia.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been asking the West for MiG-29 fighter jets, which were used during the Cold War and that Ukrainian pilots were trained to use, to maintain control of the skies in his country as it remains under attack by Russia.

Zelensky's other request for help establishing a no-fly zone over Ukraine has been rejected by the US and the alliance, who view it as a move that would pit them directly against Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also warned that he would consider countries imposing a no-fly zone ""as participants in a military conflict.""

With a no-fly zone off the table, the US has weighed the option of providing support to the Ukrainian military by helping facilitate the delivery of Polish fighter jets to Ukraine. But it has proven to be a thorny political issue and logistically complicated objective.

Over the weekend, the US said it was in discussions with Poland about a potential deal in which Poland would supply Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets that Ukraine has requested, and the US would then provide Poland with American F-16s.

Poland, however, on Tuesday took the US by surprise and offered to deploy all its MiG-29 fighter jets to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia -- but by first sending the jets to US Ramstein Air Base in Germany, also a NATO nation.

The US Defense Department rejected the proposal as not ""tenable"" and deemed it too risky.

""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby had said in a statement Tuesday.

US officials described the issue to CNN as twofold: a logistics problem of getting the jets to Ukraine, and a political problem of avoiding escalation with Russia. US officials described the Polish plan as failing to adequately address both.

NATO members have expressed concerns that providing fighter jets to Ukraine -- even if done bilaterally -- could be perceived by Russia as the alliance becoming directly involved in the war, NATO diplomats told CNN.

Poland, a NATO member and neighbor of Ukraine, has also been worried about the risks of sharing the fighter jets with Ukraine, as they don't want to become a party to the conflict and escalate the situation along their border, Polish officials told CNN.

Polish Ambassador to the US Marek Magierowski said Wednesday evening that Poland was ""acutely aware"" of the consequences involved with its proposal.

""We were under immense pressure on the part of our allies, and public opinion also here in the United States. And we were acutely aware of all technical, legal and diplomatic consequences of such a move, which was risky, of course,"" Magierowski told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""

""That is why we came up with a logical, conscionable solution. Our American partners rejected this proposal, because they have come to the conclusion that it was too escalatory. Well, we understand this, and I believe that we can continue coordinating our joint efforts with our American partners and with other NATO members in order to help the Ukrainians defend themselves as effectively as possible.""

If a Russian attack extends into one of the bordering NATO countries, it could trigger Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty, which is the principle that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all members.

If Article 5 is invoked, the US and other NATO members would then be obligated to provide resources to protect a fellow NATO member and could find themselves directly involved in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

Discussions continuing

Prior to Kirby stating the Pentagon is strongly opposed to Poland's proposal on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials told CNN the US is continuing to consult with Poland and other NATO allies about the possibility of providing fighter jets to Ukraine.

American and Polish officials have held a ""number of conversations"" since the White House was caught off guard by Warsaw's statement, a US administration official told CNN, adding that the relationship between the two countries remains strong despite the disagreement.

US Vice President Kamala Harris is also traveling to Poland this week and is expected to discuss the issue.

US officials also told CNN that they do not believe the episode precludes reaching some type of agreement that would allow the jets to get to Ukraine.

As of now, though, there are no immediate apparent solutions for the US to facilitate the delivery of jets to Ukraine since rejecting Poland's offer.

""I think what we're seeing is that Poland's proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security systems. We have to make sure that we're doing it the right way,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Wednesday at the State Department headquarters.

Logistical challenges

The US has made clear that sending jets to Ukraine is a ""sovereign decision"" for Poland to make, but has been willing to help sort through the challenges.

Besides the political quagmire, there are logistical challenges with sending fighter jets to Ukraine for the US and NATO allies to still work out.

""Secretary Austin, Chairman Milley and members of our Defense Department are in touch with Ukrainian counterparts, NATO counterparts, discussing what are clearly logistical challenges here,"" White House press secretary Psaki said on Wednesday.

Psaki cited some of the logistical and operational challenges: getting planes into Ukraine in a way that is not escalatory, potentially having to take the planes apart and putting them back together, and ensuring the planes' safe movement amid a war.

She later called it a ""serious logistical bottleneck,"" saying that discussions on the matter are ongoing.

Open-ended questions include how the aircraft would actually be moved from Poland to Ukraine and the number of Ukrainian pilots available, US Ambassador to NATO Julianne Smith told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday.

One idea floated initially was that Ukrainians would travel to Poland to retrieve the fighter jets and fly them back into Ukraine's dangerous air space, which US officials say remains contested.

Ukraine late last month made a request for MiG-29s to Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria, and Zelensky on Saturday in a call with US lawmakers pleaded for US help in getting the fighter aircraft to his country.

Some of the countries appeared to have a willingness to consider this move before Poland offered to send their MiG-19s. As of Wednesday, US officials are not ruling out talks with those three other European nations as they seek a way to get the fighter jets to Ukraine.

Sanger', 'Eric Schmitt']",2022-03-09 00:00:00,"President Biden’s commitment to keeping the United States from engaging in direct combat with Russian forces faced an unexpected test this week, when Poland surprised American officials by offering to turn over its collection of aging, Russian-made MIG fighters, for ultimate transfer to Ukraine.

But the offer came with a hitch: Poland refused to give the MIGs directly to Ukraine. The deal would only go forward if the United States, and NATO, did the transferring, and then replaced Poland’s fleet with American-made fighter jets. The United States, blindsided by the demand, began to pick apart what was going on. Polish leaders, fearful of incurring Russia’s wrath, and perhaps an attack on the air base where the MIGs launched from, was handing the problem of becoming a “co-combatant” in the war off to Washington and its other NATO allies.

The Pentagon all but rejected the idea on Tuesday night and said the United States had not been consulted. By late Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III had put a stake through the whole idea, telling his Polish counterpart in a phone call that the proposed MIG transfer was a dead letter, Pentagon officials said.

On Wednesday, the Biden administration rejected a proposal from Poland that would have made its old Russian-made MiG fighters available to a U.S. base in Germany for potential handover to Ukraine, because it would be a “high risk” step that could ratchet up tensions with Russia, the Defense Department said.

The difficulties are legal, logistical and political. Top leaders of NATO — the alliance of 30 countries that includes the U.S. and Germany — want to help Ukraine but have resisted actions that could drag it directly into Moscow’s war against its neighbor.

Officials so far have deemed Ukraine's appeals for additional fighter jets, as well as requests to impose a no-fly zone, as moves that would risk direct conflict with Russia.

Why did Ukraine want warplanes from Poland in the first place?

U.S. or Western European planes are out of the question, because Ukrainian pilots don’t know how to fly them.

“Their military is basically built off the Soviet-Russian military, so they operate Soviet-Russian equipment,” said Max Bergmann, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress who oversaw international security assistance in his former role as a State Department official. “It’s a bit like if you give someone an iPhone who has always had an Android. And you don’t want to be reading a flight manual while you’re at war.”

That’s why countries in the former East bloc that are now part of NATO, like Poland and Latvia, have offered to send their MiG jets to Ukraine in exchange for a promise from Washington to replace them with newer U.S.-made planes in the future.

Why the U.S. balked

The Pentagon has said that in practice, the trade proposal isn’t “tenable.” Washington has also promised its next batch of sales of F-16 fighters to Taiwan to counter China.

Countries sell or give away new and used military defense equipment to foreign countries all the time — the State Department oversees $55 billion a year in sales — and it’s typically the responsibility of the buyer to go pick it up.

But Western officials worry that if Ukrainian pilots go to a NATO country to pick up fighter jets and then fly them back into contested Ukrainian airspace, where they might have to engage with Russian fighters, Moscow will view the country they left from as a combatant and therefore fair game.

And NATO’s core tenet, spelled out in Article 5 of its charter, is that an attack on any member country is an attack on all, meaning all 30 member states would be obligated to join the fight.

“The intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in Russian reaction that could increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday.

Some have discussed shipping the fighter jets overland or even dismantling them and reassembling them inside Ukraine. But Kirby said U.S. military and intelligence officials determined that more jets are ""not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force relative to Russian capabilities.""

Experts outside the government have noted that Ukraine hasn’t deployed many of the MiGs it already owns, which makes them wonder whether the country has the complex infrastructure needed to support the aircraft, from trained pilots and mechanics to extra parts, munitions and jet fuel.

The losses suffered by Ukraine’s air force in the Russian invasion have been compounded by “years of neglect and underfunding,” according to the Congressional Research Service. “Most of Ukraine’s planes and air defense systems are over 30 years old.”

The country’s major air power success seems to have come largely from Turkish-made drones, not manned fighter jets.

Russia’s air force has suffered from its own apparent logistical limits; however, it still has more modern aircraft than MiG-29s, which first took to the air in the late 1970s.

“The broader thing is that this is probably all just a waste of time,” Bergmann said. “Would we just be putting Ukrainians up in 30-, 40-year-old fighter jets that are just basically flying coffins?”",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-reject-polands-plan-give-ukraine-soviet-era-fighter-jets-rcna19396

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the Polish minister of defense on Wednesday that the U.S. is not interested in participating in its plan to transfer its fight jets to the U.S., who would them give them to Ukraine.

The Polish government announced Tuesday that it was prepared to immediately transfer its MiG-29s to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The Pentagon responded that the proposal did not appear tenable, and after Austin’s call, DoD announced it would not play a role in such a transfer.

“Secretary Austin thanked the minister for Poland’s willingness to continue to look for ways to assist Ukraine, but he stressed that we do not support the transfer of additional fighter aircraft to the Ukrainian air force at this time, and therefore have no desire to see them in our custody, either,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters.

The U.S. intelligence community’s opinion figured into the decision, Kirby said.

While the U.S. and others have sent military aid to Ukraine, fighter jets “may be mistaken as escalatory,” Kirby said. “That could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO.”

From the Pentagon’s point of view, anti-air and anti-armor missiles are doing a good job of slowing Russia’s assault on Ukraine.

“We believe the best way to support Ukrainian defense is by providing them the weapons and the systems that they need most to defeat Russian aggression, in particular, anti-armor ... and we know that they are being used with great effect.”

Further, Kirby added, it’s the Pentagon’s assessment that given Russia’s widespread anti-aircraft capabilities, adding fighter jets to Ukraine’s inventory will have little payoff for the high risk involved.

With his country under increasing aerial bombardment, including an airstrike on a maternity hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued yet another plea to politicians around the world, including House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat.

“The partners are fully informed about what is happening in our Mariupol. And about the situation in all other regions of Ukraine, where hostilities continue,” he said in a message contained in the daily “War Bulletin” produced by the Ukrainian embassy in Washington D.C. this evening and shared with Military Times. “We are working to make Russia feel the consequences of its actions. We are doing everything to finally secure our sky.”

But, Zelenskyy said, despite what the Pentagon said, his country needs the jets.

“Together we must return courage to some Western leaders,” he said. “So that they finally do what they had to do on the first day of the invasion. Either close the Ukrainian sky from Russian missiles and bombs, or give us fighter jets so that we can do everything ourselves. A pause without a decision has become simply deadly.”

Whether Poland wants to provide aid directly to Ukraine is a separate issue, Kirby added, as they’re free to provide security assistance on their terms.

“What I’m talking about today is this particular proposal about the MiG-29s ... we believed it was important to lay flat our concerns about that and that’s what we’ve done here,” Kirby said.

The United States has rejected Poland’s offer to send its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via a US airbase in Germany, saying the proposal raised “serious concerns” for the entire NATO alliance.

Warsaw made the surprise offer on Tuesday amid repeated appeals from Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for more warplanes to replenish his country’s air force as it defends against invading Russian forces.

The Polish scheme proposed that the Russian made MiG-29 fighter jets be delivered to a US base in Ramstein, Germany, and then be deployed to Ukraine.

But Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the prospect of the jets flying from a US-NATO base “into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance”.

“We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” Kirby said in a statement.

“It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,” he added.

While a significant part of Ukraine’s air force remains intact since the war began on February 24, both Ukraine and Russia have sustained significant losses and neither controls the airspace over the country.

Ukraine’s air force fleet consists of ageing Soviet-era MiG-29 and Sukhoi-27 jets, and heavier Sukhoi-25 jets – and these are the only planes Ukrainian pilots could fly immediately without additional training.

And while Ukraine has stepped up calls for Western allies to supply it with military jets, providing Kyiv with warplanes poses serious risks.

Russia has warned that supporting Ukraine’s air force would be seen in Moscow as participating in the conflict and open up suppliers to possible retaliation.

NATO has said it does not want direct conflict with Moscow, a fellow nuclear-armed power, and US President Joe Biden has ruled out sending American troops into Ukraine to fight, something the Pentagon has said would apply to troops on the ground or in the air, flying missions.

After Poland announced its offer, US Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told US legislators that Washington had been caught off guard.

“To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,” Nuland told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. “So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,” she said.

While several legislators pressed for the jets to be rushed to Ukraine, Nuland refused to commit Washington to support or facilitate the exchange.

“I will continue to convey the very strong bipartisan view of this committee that these planes need to get to Ukraine,” she told the panel. “There are a number of factors to consider here and there are some mixed views among Allies and even within the administration.”

Earlier on Tuesday, British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said his country would stand by Poland if it handed over the jets, noting that it could face the “direct consequence” of its decision.

“And so we would protect Poland, we’ll help them with anything that they need,” Wallace said on Sky News.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said any decision about delivering offensive weapons must be made unanimously by NATO members.

“This is why we are able to give all of our fleet of jet fighters to Ramstein, but we are not ready to make any moves on our own because … we are not a party to this war,” he said.

Poland's foreign ministry announced on Tuesday that it was ready to deploy its MiG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States. It urged other members of the alliance that had other such aircraft to do the same.

The U.S. State Department's No. 3 diplomat said the Polish proposal caught the United States by surprise.

""So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,"" she said.

The impasse raises questions about the viability of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy plea for European countries to provide Russian-made planes, an issue he underscored during a video call Saturday with U.S. lawmakers.

U.S. lawmakers are eager to speed military aid to Ukraine and are pushing the Biden administration to facilitate the aircraft transfer.

But Poland's announcement could also reflect its own sensitivities.

Poland is supporting Ukraine with defensive weapons, but has said it would not send jets as it is not a direct party to the conflict between Ukraine - which is not a NATO ally - and Russia.

Russia's defense ministry warned this week that countries offering air fields to Ukraine for attacks on Russia may be considered as having entered the conflict.

Nuland said the main issue was to assess what Poland's immediate needs would be given it is adjacent to the conflict.

""Poland - they benefit from full air security from the NATO alliance. ... The main issue is to evaluate what Poland's immediate needs are in the context of being a neighbor of this conflict,"" she said.

That announcement from the Polish government followed a week of back-and-forth negotiation between Warsaw and Washington, though Tuesday’s announcement came as a surprise to U.S. officials.

But the U.S. Department of Defense opposed the transfer of Polish planes to Ukraine, a senior administration official told POLITICO, and Kirby cited both logistical and military complications of such a hand-off.

Kirby noted that the most effective weapons at this stage in the war for Ukraine are anti-armor and ground-based air defense, and that adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory was “not likely to significantly change” the Ukrainian air force’s ability to counter Russian attacks.

Any action by the U.S. or its NATO allies to provide jets to Ukraine, Kirby noted, could be seen by President Vladimir Putin of Russia as an act of aggression and lead to an escalation of his country’s attack.

Kirby’s comments differed from those of Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier in the day, who expressed opposition to Poland’s proposition but implied that providing fighter jets “in the right way” might still be on the table.

“Poland’s proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security assistance,” Blinken said in a news conference at the State Department. “We have to make sure that we’re doing it in the right way.”

In particular, Blinken expressed concern about the prospect of U.S. pilots departing from a NATO-controlled base in Germany into Russian-contested airspace over Ukraine. Such an arrangement might drag the U.S. and NATO into open conflict with Russia.

“It’s not simply clear to us that there’s a substantive rationale for doing it in the way that was put forward yesterday,” Blinken said. “So what we’re doing right now is continuing to consult very closely with Poland with other NATO allies on this and the logistical challenges that it presents.”

Blinken on Wednesday also dismissed calls for a NATO-enforced partial no-fly zone over Ukraine, an idea that has gained steam among foreign policy elites in the U.S. Blinken stated that such enforcement — which would include introducing American pilots into Ukrainian airspace — “would almost certainly lead to direct conflict” between U.S. forces and Russia.

“That would expand the conflict. It would prolong it. It would make it much more deadly than it already is,” Blinken said. “And that would be neither in the interest of our countries, nor in the interest of Ukraine.”

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has repeatedly asked NATO member countries to implement a no-fly zone and to provide fighter jets, including in a Zoom call with U.S. lawmakers on Saturday.

On Wednesday, Zelenskyy called for a resolution to be reached “immediately” between Poland and the U.S., noting that Ukrainians “do not have time” for indecision.

“This is not ping pong! This is about human lives!” Zelenskyy said in a speech. “We ask once again: solve it faster. Do not shift the responsibility, send us planes.”

Vice President Kamala Harris departed on Wednesday morning for a previously planned trip to Warsaw, where she will meet with Polish leaders and discuss the ongoing situation in Ukraine.

“If I were in President Zelenskyy’s position,” Blinken said, “I’m sure I would be asking for everything possible, in his mind, to help the Ukrainian people.”",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/09/blinken-ukraine-poland-fighter-jets-00015747

Ukrainian cities are under siege, and Ukraine is pleading with the West to send it fighter jets. But as a recent tiff between the U.S. and Poland over providing jets to Ukraine underscores, there are limits to what the United States and NATO are willing to do to help, as world leaders scramble to ensure that the war does not spill beyond Ukraine’s borders or escalate into a direct confrontation between powers armed with nuclear weapons.

Here’s what happened between the United States and Poland, and what it says about the war in Ukraine.

Why does Ukraine want fighter jets?

Ukraine has pilots ready to fly and fight Russians, but it can’t compete with Russia’s air power. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told U.S. lawmakers that fighter jets are his country’s top priority, even over antiaircraft missiles that Ukraine has been getting from its allies.

“If you can’t do [a no-fly zone], at least get me planes,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told members of Congress in a call this weekend, Republican senators said.

No one has given Ukraine fighter jets since Russia’s invasion, said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.

What did Poland offer?

In an unusual move, Poland on Tuesday offered to send a number of Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via an American air base in Germany, blindsiding U.S. officials, who said they had not been consulted, The Washington Post reported. In exchange, Poland requested that the United States send it replacement planes, presumably newer, U.S.-manufactured F-16s, which would constitute a major upgrade.

The United States and Poland had been in preliminary talks about some kind of plane swap to help Ukraine get more fighter jets. But Poland proposed Tuesday that the United States step in to move the planes to Ukraine, which was not part of Washington’s plan.

Poland is “ready to deploy — immediately and free of charge — all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,” which would in turn “provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities,” read a statement posted to the website of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The offer would be a win-win for Poland: It would help Ukraine in its fight with Russia, which Poland also sees as a threat, and bolster the Polish air force.

And it wouldn’t have to take direct responsibility for getting the planes to Ukraine.

Poland is worried both about the war next door in Ukraine and about Putin finding a pretext to invade other parts of Eastern Europe. The United States is also worried about the war spreading to Ukraine’s neighbors, some of whom are also NATO members. The United States announced Tuesday that it would send to Poland two Patriot missile batteries, a defensive measure that can detect and fire rockets at incoming missiles. Poland has been requesting new F-16s from Washington for a while. But production for the warplanes is backlogged and the United States has promised Taiwan, under increasing threat from China and spooked by Russia’s attempt to annex Ukraine, that it would receive the next batch. Poland presumably asked for “used” planes to bypass this issue.

Why MiG-29 jets?

Because that’s what Ukrainians are trained to fly.

The MiG-29 was the Soviet Union’s prized fighter jet. The warplane was designed in the late 1970s in part to counter the fast and versatile U.S.-manufactured F-16s. When U.S. intelligence first learned the Soviets were making fighter jets, they were worried to see the Soviet Union catching up with U.S. aircraft technologies, Smithsonian magazine reported.

Countries across the then-former Soviet Union flew the warplanes, as have others such as Iraq, Cuba, Iran and North Korea.

Over time, Washington also learned more about the jets and developed its own technologies to better counter them. The planes have by now largely fallen out of use, but they remain predominant in former Soviet states.

Why the U.S. basically rejected this plan

It would shift the responsibility for delivering the fighter jets — and the risk of confrontation with Russia — on to Washington in a very public way.

“We do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” John Kirby, press secretary for the Pentagon, said in a statement.

Poland’s offer would require the United States and NATO to play a lead role in getting the planes to Ukraine. Even in the context of broad Western effort to arm Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin could easily construe jets taking off from a NATO base in Germany to eventually fight Russians as NATO fighting Russians. That, Kirby said, “raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance.”

Left unsaid is that if Washington does find a way to get fighter jets into Ukraine, it wants to do it as quietly as possible. “They are trying to find a low-visibility way to send planes to Ukraine,” Cancian said, “as opposed to holding a news conference to announce they’re trying to do it.”

The United States and Europe were totally caught off guard by Poland’s offer, given Poland had just rejected a U.S. offer to send planes from Poland. “Sideswiped” is how one European official described the reaction,, The Post reported.

On a visit to Poland days after this, Vice President Harris tried to smooth over the diplomatic relationship between the two countries: “I want to be very clear,” Harris told reporters. “The United States and Poland are united in what we have done, and are prepared to do, to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop.”

What does NATO fear?

Western officials and their allies are very worried about how this war could quickly escalate — into NATO countries, into Western Europe and even into a nuclear war.

Putin is feeding those fears. He’s talked about his country’s nuclear weapons and warned that he would view any nation that declared a no-fly zone — a threat to shoot down Russian planes over Ukraine — “as participants of the military conflict.”

Plus, the line between proxy war between the United States and Russia and real war is getting fuzzier. The United States has been supplying Ukraine weapons for years — billions of dollars worth, my colleagues report — and they’ve ramped that up as the Russian invasion loomed. They’ve sent them missiles, antitank weapons, ammunition and systems that let Ukrainians shoot down Russian aircraft.

But some U.S. officials have fretted that the United States’ definition of direct combat with Russia is not Putin’s, the New York Times reports. “Some U.S. national security officials say they have a foreboding that [direct] conflict is increasingly likely,” the Times writes.

Could the U.S. still send planes to Ukraine?

Possibly. In fact, Cancian thinks it’s likely that Washington could find a way to transfer these Soviet-era planes to Ukraine when no one’s looking. “They’ll find a secret airfield somewhere,” he said

Republican members of Congress are putting pressure on the Biden administration to get these jets. Republican senators held a news conference Thursday saying they think Putin already knows American weapons are killing Russians, and demanding that the Biden administration get Ukraine jets. “I have talked to numerous colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and they too agree with the need to get these jets to Ukrainians,” asserted Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) on Thursday.

For now, though, the United States and NATO publicly launching planes into Ukraine could be a step too far for officials.

The United States, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday, is trying to “end this war in Ukraine, not start a larger one.”

Though they haven’t ruled out getting the jets to Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the military is studying options that would avoid raising Russia’s ire to a tipping point: “How do you get planes into Ukraine in a way that is not escalatory, and what are the logistics and operational details of that?” she asked. “Carting them down the street is not as easy as you may think it is.”

Cancian says it’s a matter of time before planes make it to Ukraine, with the help of the United States.
