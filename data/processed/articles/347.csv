President Joe Biden on Friday vowed that Russia would ""pay a severe price"" if it used chemical weapons in its war against Ukraine, a warning that came as other Western leaders expressed fear that such an attack could soon happen.

""I'm not going to speak about the intelligence, but Russia would pay a severe price if it used chemical weapons,"" Biden said in response to a reporter's question after remarks at the White House.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and top White House officials have called out Russia for seeking to concoct a narrative that the US and Ukraine are scheming to use chemical weapons. Western officials pointed out that Russia previously provided cover for or defended its chemical attacks with similar rationales.

""They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans,"" Johnson told Sky News on Thursday. ""And so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have as a sort of a maskirovka, a fake story ready to go.""

The Kremlin has denied any suggestion that it's preparing a chemical-weapons attack. The Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry continued Friday to accused Ukraine and the US of gearing up for such an attack.

""Radical Ukrainian groups under the control of the representatives of American special services have prepared several potential scenarios of the use of toxic chemicals in order to carry out various types of provocations,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Russia was supposed to have destroyed its chemical-weapons stockpile. During the Cold War, the US and Russia amassed the world's largest stockpiles of some of the most brutal weapons. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the two former adversaries worked together to eliminate their arsenals.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons certified in 2017 that Russia had destroyed its declared stockpile that once reached a staggering 40,000 metric tons of chemical agents like mustard gas, VX, and sarin. The latter two nerve agents disrupt the human body's nervous system, which can lead to permanent damage or death. The US and experts believe that Russia still maintains a small secretive stockpile.

""The United States assesses that Russia maintains an offensive BW (bioweapons) program and is in violation of its obligations under Articles I and II of the BWC (Biological Weapons Convention),"" the State Department wrote in its 2021 edition of its annual report on arms control and compliance. The US has said that Russia's failure to comply with the convention that it signed in 1975 ""has been of concern for many years.""

The 2018 poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in London offered evidence that Russia maintained a chemical-weapons program. The United Kingdom said it assessed the Kremlin ordered the attack and used Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent, as the poison of choice.

Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said Russia's continuing program made it ""possible"" for the Kremlin to stage an attack just as the West feared it might. He said the war in Ukraine was already brutal but the deployment of chemical weapons would make for a ghastly scene.

""These are weapons of potentially mass and clearly indiscriminate destruction,"" Kimball said in an interview. ""Any death is horrendous, but nerve agents, choking agents, blistering agents — they produce acute suffering in the victim. A bullet can kill very quickly, but chemical weapons produce partially difficult deaths and injuries.""

Biden's warning came as he announced that the West would expand its crippling sanctions on the Russian economy by banding together to deprive Moscow of its favored trade status, a way nations ensure smooth trade relationships with minimal or no barriers like tariffs or import controls. The president also said the US was banning the exportation of luxury goods to Russia and the importation of key Russian goods like seafood, diamonds, and vodka.",https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-vows-russia-will-pay-a-severe-price-if-it-uses-chemical-weapons-2022-3

Putin endorses plan to bring 16,000 “volunteers” from the Middle East to fight in Ukraine

During a March 11 meeting of Russia’s Security Council, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that more than 16,000 “volunteers” from the Middle East had expressed interest in joining Russia’s “liberation movement” for the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. He emphasized that they are not financially motivated and are participating on a voluntary basis. Shoigu said many of the volunteers fought alongside Russia in the fight against ISIS.

In response to Shoigu’s announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that if people from the Middle East want to help the people in the Donbas voluntarily and are not interested in money, then Russia should facilitate their deployment to the combat zone. He also slammed Western countries for permitting “mercenaries” to join the conflict on the Ukrainian side and accused them of violating international law.

The Pentagon previously reported that Russia is trying to recruit people from Syria to fight in Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal noted that Syrian soldiers are already fighting in Ukraine alongside Russians but did not specify how many fighters have been deployed. Syrian outlet DeirEzzor24 wrote that Russia is seeking fighters for six-month contracts and offering a salary of $200 to $300 per month.

Russia spreads conspiracies about US and Ukraine biological weapons program

On March 10, Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian Armed Forces’ nuclear, chemical, and biological defense, once again accused Ukraine and the United States of working together to develop biological weapons. The latest version of this narrative began on March 6, when Russia’s Ministry of Defense claimed it had obtained documentary proof that the US and Ukraine collaborating to develop biological weapons.

Igor Kirillov said that the obtained documents revealed that more than 140 containers of ectoparasites of bats were transferred overseas from a biological laboratory in Kharkiv. He said that all high-risk research occurring in Ukraine’s biological laboratories is conducted under the guidance of US specialists, and that the US is interested in studying bats as biological weapons. Referring to the obtained documents, Kirillov said that the US spent $1.6 million in Ukrainian labs to study the transmission of infections by migratory birds. Kirillov added that in addition to Ukraine, the project is implemented in “Georgian biological laboratories controlled by the Pentagon,” claiming that the research is being conducted “in the immediate vicinity of the borders of Russia.” Kirillov also blamed Ukraine and the US for the COVID-19 outbreak.

That same day, Russian Foreign Minister of Sergei Lavrov demanded explanations for “US biological activities in Ukraine.” Lavrov claimed that “the Pentagon has created several dozen military biological laboratories on Ukrainian territory, as part of its program to create such military-biological laboratories around the world, in violation of the relevant convention on the prohibition of biological, toxin weapons.” Russia’s top diplomat also said that experiments in Ukrainian laboratories were not peaceful but aimed at creating “ethnically oriented” biological weapons.

Avril Haines, the US Director of National Intelligence, responded by explaining that there is a difference between a biological weapons lab and labs created for public safety and biodefense, noting that the latter are intended to ensure an adequate and efficient public health response during health emergencies like COVID-19. Haines said Ukraine operates a dozen biological research labs for public health purposes, and the US has provided bio-safety assistance. “We do not assess that Ukraine is pursuing either biological weapons or nuclear weapons, which have been some of the propaganda that Russia is putting out,” she said.

China has echoed Russia’s false claims about the US-run biological weapons labs in Ukraine. The US Department of Defense has denied the allegations, stating that Russia and China are “falsely accusing use of biological weapons against Russians.”

“There are five biological research laboratories in Kyiv,” Pentagon officials added. “Their work focuses on diagnostics, therapeutics, treatments, prevention, and vaccines, not on military use as the Russians and Chinese accuse.”

Memes and sarcasm on Russian social media after Lavrov claims Russia “didn’t attack Ukraine“

At a March 10 press conference, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declared, “We are not planning to attack other countries. We didn’t attack Ukraine, either.” This denial comes after Lavrov participated in unsuccessful ceasefire negotiations with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Turkey.

Lavrov’s claim that Russia did not attack Ukraine was covered by pro–Kremlin and Belarusian media, in addition to Ukrainian and foreign media. The statement also inspired several memes on Facebook, which was recently banned in Russia.

On the popular Russian social media platform VKontakte (VK), some users expressed support for Lavrov while others used sarcasm to describe the absurdity of the statement. Pro-Kremlin pages posted identical messages in support of Lavrov. In the comments, users wished Lavrov and other Kremlin leadership God’s blessing and good health, and expressed pride about being represented by Lavrov and other Kremlin officials. Few comments directly addressed Russia’s statement denying the war in Ukraine.

Pro-Kremlin outlets reporting Lavrov’s remarks on VKontakte received sarcastic user comments. For example, one commenter wrote, “Black is white. War is peace. 2×2=5,” while another said, “War is peace, ignorance is strength, freedom is slavery.” Some comments on these posts suggested Lavrov was using drugs.

Pro-Kremlin Ukrainian Telegram channels paint Ukraine’s Western allies as untrustworthy

Ukrainian Telegram channels linked to the Kremlin continue to publish reports that seek to undermine trust in Western countries allied with Ukraine. For example, the Kremlin-tied channel Rezident wrote that the West has distanced itself from Ukraine, and condemned the European Union for not transferring frozen funds from the Russian Central Bank to Ukraine. Another Kremlin-associated channel, ZeRada, claimed that Western countries would prefer to appropriate the frozen funds for themselves rather than give them to Ukraine.

Another post in the Rezident channel also claimed that Western countries would not accept Ukraine into the EU because it would force EU countries to pay for Ukraine’s recovery. The post noted that NATO won’t provide fighter jets and refuses to enact a no-fly zone over Ukraine. “The bottom line, Ukraine received a destroyed country and empty promises of help,” they added. The channel does not mention that the EU and NATO have imposed severe sanctions on Russia and sent weapons and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

In another message, Rezident wrote that the EU “does not want to impose new sanctions and provide real help,” arguing that Ukraine should base its foreign policy decisions on the “axiom” that “no one wants to accept us to the European Union.”

Russia blocks access to Instagram, citing misleading Reuters headline

The Russian state censor has announced a ban on Instagram, effective March 14. The ban follows an announcement that the Russian Prosecutor’s Office had requested that Meta, the parent company of Instagram, be declared an “extremist organization.” Instagram has long been a popular service in Russia; this move represents a significant curtailment of Russian digital life and a far more consequential move than the Russian ban on Facebook instituted last week. Meta’s remaining platform, WhatsApp, will remain operational in Russia for now. Some observers speculate that, because WhatsApp constitutes an estimated 60 percent of messenger activity in the country, Russia is not yet in a position to implement or enforce such a ban.

The immediate impetus for the Instagram ban was a story, first published by Reuters, which found that Meta has temporarily relaxed its prohibition against calls to violence in Ukraine and the Baltic States. Users of Facebook and other Meta platforms may issue unspecific calls for violence (i.e. no evidence of specific planning) against Russian soldiers and against Vladimir Putin and Alyaksandr Lukashenka. They may also issue calls for violence against “Russians” when the context is understood to be Russian soldiers. They may not issue calls for violence against Russian civilians, nor circulate content that dehumanizes Russians as a nationality or ethnicity.

UPDATE – Reuters changed the headline after initial publishing from ""against Russians"" to ""invading Russians."" pic.twitter.com/ENUqhmwo4E — Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) March 10, 2022

Reuters initially ran this story with the headline, “Facebook and Instagram to temporarily allow calls for violence against Russians, calls for Putin’s death.” This headline provoked widespread outrage among human rights activists and Russian immigrants and expatriates, who assumed that this was a generalized policy of xenophobia. Reuters later amended the headline to read, “Facebook temporarily allows posts on Ukraine war calling for violence against invading Russians or Putin’s death”—a distinction lost on the tens of thousands of people who had already reacted to the article.

While Russia appears to have been preparing to institute an Instagram block for some time, it leapt on the opportunity provided by the Reuters headline. The subsequent Reuters correction, as well as the specifics of Meta’s policy, have gone unmentioned by Russian state media.

As international sanctions restrict the global internet, civil society urges for clarity, transparency, and caution

The invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the norms surrounding content moderation and content removal, with several technology platforms around the world continuing to take voluntary actions to de-rank, label, and de-monetize conflict-related content. Further, some internet infrastructure companies have terminated all business and sales in Russia citing US sanctions, while others are severing ties to sanctioned entities and users.

Increasingly, government sanctions are playing a role in both content moderation decisions, and corporate operations servicing Russian users; in absence of clear implementation rules, civil society coalitions and experts are calling for greater clarity, transparency, and a proactive effort to prevent the splintering of the global internet. On March 10, civil society organizations published an open letter calling on the Biden Administration and other governments to carefully weigh measures that could restrict the Russian public’s access to the internet, noting the need for clear carve outs to sustain online civic spaces, support for digital security and independent media, and human rights-based assessments of the impact of domestic tech regulation on international users.

Georgian leader of anti-Russian protests sentenced to four days in prison

Shota Dighmelashvili, a leader of the Shame Movement, a group of activists organizing anti-Russian and pro-Ukrainian protests in Georgia, has been sentenced to four days in prison. Open Caucasus Media reported that police detained Dighmelashvili on March 8, after he threw an egg at a government administration building in Tbilisi. The previous day, Georgian residents took to the streets to demand the cancelation of the visa-free regime for Russians, a ban on Russian state-affiliated media, and the closing Georgian airspace to Russian planes.

Kremlin attempts to justify attack on maternity hospital in Mariupol

As widely reported this week, Russian forces bombed the Mariupol Territorial Medical Association of Child and Women’s Health hospital on March 9. While Russia did not deny the attack, it claimed militants had taken over the hospital. According to Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, “This maternity hospital was long captured by Azov Battalion and other radicals. All pregnant women, nurses, and other personnel were kicked out. It was an ultraradical Azov battalion base. We got this data three days ago.”

Multiple pro–Kremlin and Kremlin–owned media outlets published alleged debunks of the bombing to justify the atrocity. Kremlin-controlled media reported on March 5 that Ukrainian soldiers from the Azov Battalion had established their base in maternity house number one. The bombed building is a separate building formerly known as children’s hospital number three.

Kremlin-controlled media also accused Marianna Vyshemirskaya, a beauty blogger from Mariupol, of playing a victim in an allegedly staged rescue operation. In an article published by Mariupol regional media outlet 0629.com.ua, Vyshemirskaya’s friends explained how she had arrived at the hospital for an ultrasound prior to the bombing. “Marianna found a good doctor in a maternity hospital on the left coast of Mariupol, she had to give birth there,” one of them explained. “But on the day when she was supposed to go there for the last ultrasound scan, shelling began, and there were explosions.”



Additionally, pro-Kremlin KP.ru and REN TV falsely claimed that Vyshemirskaya had changed outfits and put on make-up to play two different victims. REN TV went so far as to make a side-by-side comparison of photos of two pregnant women, claiming both were Vyshemirskaya.

In two photos taken after the blast, Vyshemirskaya is clearly seen with consistent facial bruises and carrying the same blanket.

Georgia’s pro-Kremlin political parties call on UN Security Council to support neutral status of Georgia and Ukraine

Irma Inashvili, the leader of the pro-Kremlin Georgian political party Alliance of Patriots, published an open letter on March 10 addressing the UN Security Council. The letter, signed by fifty-five pro-Kremlin organizations, called on the UN Security Council to support Georgia and Ukraine becoming neutral.

“The tragic conflict in Ukraine clearly shows that neutrality is the best solution for the countries like Georgia and Ukraine, especially taking into account the fact that the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin repeatedly stated that the neutrality is the best solution for Ukraine,” said the letter.

On February 21, three days before Russia invaded Ukraine, the same group of pro-Kremlin organizations addressed Vladimir Putin and called on the Georgian government to announce its neutrality.

Ukrainian forces have seized gas marks from Russian troops following warnings from the West that Vladimir Putin could use chemical weapons in his barbaric invasion.

The Ministry of Defence shared images of the captured equipment, which also included World War II era helmets and an ushanka hat, showing the dilapidated state of Putin's run-down military.

The ministry said on Twitter: 'The second army of the world is a sham. Equipment of ""liberators"". They want us to live like that? stoprussia.'

Western and Ukrainian leaders have issued dire warnings that Putin is preparing to use chemical weapons, and the masks issued to Russian troops suggest an attack is likely.

Volodymyr Zelensky said yesterday the threat of Russian forces deploying chemical weapons is 'very real' as the invasion enters its third week.

In last night's televised address to the nation, the president sarcastically addressed Russian troops and asked where they planned to deploy the weapons.

'Where will you strike with chemical weapons?' he asked. 'At the maternity hospital in Mariupol? At the church in Kharkiv? Okhmadit children's hospital?

'Or at our laboratories, which have been around since Soviet times and work on regular technology, not military technology?'

Boris Johnson and former head of MI6's Russian operations Christopher Steele echoed Zelensky's concerns that Russia could soon deploy chemical weapons amid slow progress on the ground.

Western and Ukrainian leaders have issued dire warnings that Putin is preparing to launch a chemical attack on civilians

The Prime Minister said Putin is in charge of a 'cynical, barbaric government', and believes Russia is preparing a 'fake story' which it could use to deny using the weapons and to blame the West.

The Prime Minister told Sky News’ Beth Rigby Interviews show: ‘The stuff that you are hearing about chemical weapons, this is straight out of their playbook.

‘They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans and so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a sort of maskirovka, a fake story, ready to go. And you have seen it in Syria. You saw it even in the UK.’

Asked if it was his expectation that Russia will use chemical weapons, the premier said: 'I just note that that is what they are already doing [preparing a fake story]. It is a cynical, barbaric government I am afraid.’

Yesterday, Russia accused Ukraine of preparing a chemical weapons strike without any evidence, which officials fear could be used as a pretext for their own attack.

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed that Ukraine was running chemical and biological weapons labs with US support, allegations which have been dismissed by the West.

Moscow is officially committed to destroying its chemical weapons stockpiles under various international treaties, and has not used the weapons in combat for decades.

The Soviets were last accused of using them during the invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s.

But Russia used the deadly Novichok poison in 2018 an attempt to assassinate spy Sergei Skripal living in Salisbury, England.

And it is suspected of using a similar poison against opposition leader Navalny in 2020.

Moscow has also offered diplomatic cover to Syrian use of chemical agents, for example accusing the West of being behind the 2017 attack on Khan Shaykhun with Sarin or similar nerve agent.

Steele said that although Putin had 'grossly miscalculated' the invasion and that his regime would not survive over the long term as oligarchs and regular citizens alike begin to feel the pinch of sanctions, the Russian leader would likely step up the violence in the short term.

'As the Russian army becomes bogged down, more desperate, and clearly not realising its objectives militarily, you're likely to see more indiscriminate killing and bombardment and possibly the use of a [chemical] weapon,' Steele said.

Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki refused to be drawn on whether such indiscriminate chemical attacks would trigger an intervention by the US.

'I'm not going to get into hypotheticals,' she said.

'What we're saying right now is they have the capacity and the capabilities. I'm also not going to get into intelligence. But the president intention of sending US military to fight in Ukraine against Russia has not changed.'

Asked again, she refused to issue threats to Moscow, saying that the aim was to prevent the conflict escalating into a world war.

'I'm not going to get into red lines from here,' she said.

Other Western officials expressed concern that Putin could next resort to the use of 'non-conventional weapons' such as chemical weapons, in the conflict.

One official speaking on condition of anonymity said: 'I think we've got good reason to be concerned about possible use of non-conventional weapons, partly because of what we've seen has happened in other theatres.

'As I've mentioned before, for example, what we've seen in Syria, partly because we've seen a bit of setting the scene for that in the false flag claims that are coming out, and other indications as well.'

U.S. intelligence chiefs denounced what they said was a classic Russian disinformation campaign accusing Washington of backing biological weapons laboratories.

CIA Director Bill Burns and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines both said there was no evidence that Ukraine was developing weapons of mass destruction.

Boris Johnson said he fears Vladimir Putin will use chemical weapons in Ukraine because it would be 'straight out of Russia's playbook'

Instead, they joined the chorus of warnings that Moscow could be preparing a fake narrative before it unleashed its own chemical arsenal.

'I think it underscores the concern that all of us need to focus on those kinds of issues, whether it's the potential for a use of chemical weapons either as a false flag operation or against Ukrainians,' Burns told the Senate intelligence committee.

'This is something as all of you know very well is very much a part of Russia's playbook.

'They've used those weapons against their own citizens. They've at least encouraged the use in Syria and elsewhere.

'So it's something we take very seriously.'

It comes as a 40-mile Russian 'death convoy' that had been stalled to the north of Kyiv has begun moving towards the capital, satellite images reveal, with rocket artillery taking up firing positions as what is sure to be a long and bloody battle for control of the city enters its early stages.

Russian supply trucks and other vehicles are seen parked in the tree line of a forest (to the right of the image) in an apparent effort to make them harder for Ukrainian forces to destroy

Russian tanks and armoured vehicles have also dispersed into civilian areas in an effort to make them harder to hit. Pictured are some of the 'death convoy' vehicles in the town of Ozera, north east of Kyiv

Initially, the 40-mile line of vehicles, tanks and artillery had stalled outside Kyiv but as of Thursday, parts of the convoy have now 'repositioned' into the woods and dispersed along roads

Those vehicles which are left along the main highway into Kyiv (pictured, part of the road north of Ivankiv) are now spaced out to make them less of a target for Ukrainian artillery

Ukrainian commanders say Russian attacks are underway to the north, west and east of Kyiv and that the city will soon be surrounded as what is sure to be a long and bloody battle for control of it gets underway

Vladimir Putin's forces are now attacking to the north, west and east of Kyiv, Ukrainian commanders say, as the convoy - which had been stuck for two weeks due to fuel and logistical issues - gets moving again - dispersing to take up firing positions or else concealing itself in civilian areas and forests to prevent attacks.

Ukraine believes the capital - which is currently home to around 2million people - could soon be surrounded, after which it faces the same punishing fate meted out to the cities of Mariupol, which has been without water or power for 11 days, Kharkiv, and Sumy, where thousands of civilians have been killed.

Territorial defence units, charged with protecting the city, were pictured digging trenches there and setting up barricades, as mayor Vitali Kitschko said the capital has been turned into a 'fortress'.

Oleksiy Reznikov, Ukraine's defence minister, said Russia's attacks have now killed more civilians than soldiers after generals switched tactics from American-style 'shock and awe' precision strikes - which largely failed due to poor battlefield tactics - to 'medieval'-style siege warfare of the kind Moscow's men waged in Syria.

Airstrikes early Friday struck the cities of Dnipro, in central Ukraine, Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, in the west, which have largely been spared attacks.

The strike on Dnipro hit civilian areas including a shoe factory, killing at least one person.

The bombings in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk are thought to have targeted military airports - mirroring attacks in the early days of the war. Two soldiers were killed.

Strikes on Kharkiv, a surrounded city in the north east of Ukraine, hit the Physics Institute which houses a nuclear reactor - drawing accusations from Ukraine that Russia is committing 'nuclear terrorism'.

Her appointment as White House press secretary under Biden ruffled feathers on the Right after a photo emerged of her wearing a pink Russian hat next to John Kerry and Putin’s lapdog Sergei Lavrov. The photo was taken in January 2014 when Psaki represented the State Department. Sources close to Psaki told USA Today that the hat was a gift from the Russian government, and that she did not keep it. Advertisement

White House press secretary Jen Psaki suggested on Thursday that Vladimir Putin using chemical weapons was not a 'red line' for the United States to prompt a military response.

She doubled down on President Joe Biden's stance that America won't have boots on the ground in the Ukraine. And she refused to say what - if anything - would change that.

'I'm not going to get into red lines from here,' Psaki said from her podium in the White House briefing room.

'I'm not going to get into hypotheticals,' she noted. 'But the president's intention of sending U.S. military to fight in Ukraine against Russia has not changed.'

American officials have expressed concern that Russia could use chemical weapons after the Russian Defense Ministry said Ukraine could make such a move, in what U.S. officials say could be a false flag operation to justify any moves by Moscow.

The Russian president has shown no sign in letting up of his invasion of the Ukraine. Officials for the two sides - meeting in Turkey - left the negotiation table with no ceasefire in place nor an agreement for safe passage for Ukrainian civilians caught in the war zone.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko also said on Thursday that Ukraine's capital city has been 'turned into a fortress' ahead of the Russian assault, with about two million people - half the residents of the metro area of the capital - having fled as Putin's troops draw ever closer.

But Psaki indicated there would be some kind of response to such a Russian move, saying the administration was trying 'to prevent a World War Three.'

'We have not let anything go unanswered that President Putin has done to date,' Psaki noted, adding 'what that would look like I can't give you an assessment of that from here at this point.'

The U.S. has responded to the Russian invasion with heavy economic sanctions on Putin himself, his inner circle, the oligarchs made billionaires by his policies, and Russian banks and companies. The Kremlin called those moves an 'economic war.'

Psaki noted that American concerns Moscow would use chemical weapons is based on past incidents. U.S. officials have raised the possibility Russia could escalate the fighting as Ukrainian resistance remains strong.

'They have a history of using chemical and biological weapons, and that in this moment, we should have our eyes open for that possibility use of chemical or biological weapons,' Psaki said.

Russia has wielded chemical weapons in the past.

Moscow used the deadly Novichok poison in 2018 an attempt to assassinate a defector living in Salisbury, England. And it is suspected of using a similar poison against opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020.

Russia also offered diplomatic cover to Syrian use of chemical agents. It accused the West of being behind the 2017 attack on Khan Shaykhun with Sarin or similar nerve agent.

Biden's administration is continuing its diplomatic efforts, pushing for a cease fire before fighting continues to escalate. Biden spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday after peace talks being held there failed to produce any progress.

The two men 'reaffirmed their strong support for the government and people of Ukraine, underscored the need for an immediate cessation of Russian aggression, and welcomed the coordinated international response to the crisis,' the White House said in a readout of its call.

'President Biden expressed appreciation for Turkey’s efforts to support a diplomatic resolution to the conflict, as well as Turkey’s recent engagements with regional leaders that help promote peace and stability,' the White House said.

CIA director Burns says chemical weapon use is 'part of Russia's playbook' and Director of National Intelligence slams Russian nuclear lab propaganda U.S. intelligence chiefs on Thursday denounced what they said was a classic Russian disinformation campaign accusing Washington of backing biological weapons laboratories in Ukraine, which they said could set the scene for Russia to launch its own chemical attacks. C.I.A. Director Bill Burns and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines both said there was no evidence that Ukraine was developing weapons of mass destruction. Instead, they joined a chorus of warnings that Moscow could be preparing a fake narrative before it unleashed its own chemical arsenal. 'I think it underscores the concern that all of us need to focus on those kinds of issues, whether it's the potential for a use of chemical weapons either as a false flag operation or against Ukrainians,' Burns told the Senate intelligence committee. 'This is something as all of you know very well is very much a part of Russia's playbook. 'They've used those weapons against their own citizens. They've at least encouraged the use in Syria and elsewhere. 'So it's something we take very seriously.' Concerns flared a day earlier, when Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed, without evidence, that Ukraine was running chemical and biological weapons labs with U.S. support. The claims are not new, but have circulated as debunked conspiracy theories that have been spread by the likes of QAnon-linked websites. On Thursday, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that it had uncovered U.S. and Ukrainian plans to spread flu with birds. 'At least two species of migratory birds were identified, the routes of which pass mainly through Russia, and information on migration routes through the countries of Eastern Europe was also summarized,' it said in a release. It comes as military analysts have warned that the war could take a brutal turn as Putin switches tactics after his forces failed to make the rapid breakthrough he expected. Advertisement

And Vice President Kamala Harris is in Poland where she vowed to defend 'every inch' of NATO territory Thursday as US troops fired Stinger missiles during military drills in Estonia and Russian troops moved within a few miles of Kyiv.

The exercises were a sign of both defensive might and coordination capabilities, amid concerns about Vladimir Putin's plans as his forces continued their brutal invasion of Ukraine.

The forces carried out air defense drills in cold weather exercises in coastal areas of Estonia, a NATO ally, with U.S., British, Estonian, as well as forces from Finland – NATO partner but not a member of the alliance.

'They take place in the winter to demonstrate the ability to operate in harsh conditions,' Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in late February when announcing the Operation Saber Strike exercises.

During the exercises, allied troops used Stryker armored vehicles Thursday to fire Stinger missiles – the same weapons the U.S. and allies are rushing into the hands of Ukrainian forces resisting the Russian invasion. According to the Pentagon, Ukrainian forces have been using weaponry provided by allied nations to well – and video images have revealed a succession of destroyed Russian armor during the two-week old war.

The exercises are also meant to practice and demonstrate the complex coordinated maneuvers NATO forces have trained for – amid signs of severe Russian problems with supply lines and coordinated air and ground forces during their two-week old invasion of Ukraine.

But the White House said the move was not meant to be aggressive against Russia. The Biden administration has repeatedly said it doesn't want to start a war, using that as its reason to oppose Poland's plan to supply the Ukraine with Polish-owned MiG planes.

'I think, for people to understand how we look at this, which is that there's an escalation ladder, right,' Psaki explained. 'And there's difference between an anti tank weapon, a shoulder fired missile, and aircraft and a fighter jet that could cross the border and actually conduct operations on Russian soil.'

With temperatures in parts of Ukraine dropping to -10 C, military experts are warning Russian tanks stranded in a convoy south of Kiev could turn into ''40-ton freezers,' given fuel supply issues.

It call comes as Vice President Kamala Harris vowed in Warsaw that the U.S. would defend 'every inch' of NATO territory – while allied nations scrambled to funnel arms to Ukraine in what has become the largest arms effort since the Cold War.

'During Saber Strike, we're conducting air and missile defense training with our NATO allies,' U.S. Army Col. Patrick Thompson, commander of the 164th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, said in an Estonian Defense Ministry release, Estonian Public Broadcasting outlet ERR News reported. 'This training helps build interoperability between our NATO allies and our partners.'

The exercises took part in other NATO countries earlier in the week, with activities in Lithuania March 1. The Polish phase concluded March 5. It all involves 13,000 troops from 13 nations.

At the start of her trip to Warsaw, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday announced that the U.S. had delivered two batteries of Patriot air defense missiles to the NATO ally.

'Today I can announce that we have delivered those Patriot missiles systems to Poland,' she said at the start of a press briefing with Polish President Duda.

The defense systems are positioned to allow Poland and other allies contend with any stray missiles or incursions from neighboring Ukraine amid Russia's ongoing assault.

She said the U.S. had recently deployed 4,700 U.S. troops to Poland, on top of a typical rotation of about 5,000.

Her comments came even after U.S. officials were caught off guard by Poland's statement this week about transferring MiG fighter jets to U.S. control for NATO delivery to Ukraine. The Pentagon said the idea was not 'tenable.'

'I want to be very clear. The United States and Poland are united in what we have done and are prepared to help Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, full stop,' Harris said.

The United States is prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory. The United States takes seriously that an attack against one is an attack against all,' Harris said.

But there are still grave concerns among non-NATO members about whether Putin may be eyeing further territory.

For some European countries watching Russia's brutal war in Ukraine, there are fears that they could be next.

Western officials say the most vulnerable could be those who aren't members of NATO or the European Union, and thus alone and unprotected - including Ukraine's neighbour Moldova and Russia's neighbour Georgia, both of them formerly part of the Soviet Union - along with the Balkan states of Bosnia and Kosovo.

But analysts warn that even NATO members could be at risk, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on Russia's doorstep, as well as Montenegro, either from Moscow's direct military intervention or attempts at political destabilization.

President of Georgia Salome Zourabichvili told DailyMail.com about the surprise shortcomings the fight in Ukraine revealed in Russia's military, which invaded Georgia in 2008.

'We know that after the Georgian Russian war, there has been a massive effort to modernize the [Russian] military, massive resources that were devoted to that. So it's a bit strange that they didn't get more for that money, so whether it's corruption, whether it's inefficiency, I didn't know,' she said.

A diplomatic effort between the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine showed little sign of progress on Thursday.

Meanwhile, the various allied efforts to arm Ukraine has developed into the largest arms push since the Cold War, the Financial Times reported.

The nations have plowed in anti-armor weapons, drones, ammunition, fuel, and artillery shells.

In one odd but potentially crucial development, the Pentagon found a workaround to ship anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine by removing a few screws from a controller that contained classified information, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The firepower has helped slow, but not stop, the Russian advance.

Russian tanks were able to push to within just a few miles of the outskirts of Kiev, though initial assaults to the west and east of the capital were repelled as Vladimir Putin's forces face a long and bloody campaign to try and take the capital.

Kremlin troops launched two attacks on Kyiv Wednesday - one via the besieged western city of Irpin and another through the eastern district of Brovary, with video showing how a column of Russian tanks and armored vehicles was bombarded with artillery in a devastating ambush and forced to turn back.

Colonel Andrei Zakharov, commander of the tank regiment, was also killed in the ambush according to the Ukrainian defense ministry and radio chatter intercepted from Russians on the battlefield. The same transmissions suggested the column suffered heavy losses, with one tank and an armored vehicle destroyed.

It marks just the latest Russian commander to be killed in Ukraine, after two generals were slain by Kyiv's troops. Colonel Zakharov had been awarded the Order of Courage by Vladimir Putin in 2016.

Russian President Vladimir Putin 'has said right from the start that this is not only about Ukraine,' said Michal Baranowski, director of the German Marshall Fund's Warsaw office.

'He told us what he wants to do when he was listing his demands, which included the change of the government in Kyiv, but he was also talking about the eastern flank of NATO and the rest of Eastern Europe,' Baranowski said.

As Ukraine puts up stiff resistance to the brutal Russian attack, Baranowski said 'it's now not really clear how he'll carry out his other goals.'

But Western governments and NATO are acutely aware of deep concerns in Eastern and Central Europe that the war in Ukraine may be just a prelude to broader attacks on former Warsaw Pact members in trying to restore Moscow's regional dominance.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said that 'Russia is not going to stop in Ukraine.'

'We are concerned for neighbors Moldova, Georgia, and the Western Balkans,' he said. 'We have to keep an eye on Western Balks, particularly Bosnia, which could face destabilization by Russia.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10599751/Psaki-suggests-Putin-using-chemical-weapons-not-red-line-US.html

A long study published in October 2021 argued that the Russian government, through an unprecedented and extraordinary biological weapons disinformation campaign aimed primarily at the United States and secondarily at the government of Georgia, displayed an open disdain and disregard for the Biological Weapon Convention, an international treaty with 183 member states.

In March 2022, the lies regarding biological laboratories in Ukraine are deliberate and knowing. The Russian government knows with absolute certainty that none of the charges leveled at any of the facilities in Ukraine, or at the United States, are true—in the same way it knew with absolute certainty that the similar charges that it leveled for many years at Georgia’s Lugar Laboratory were not true.

False allegations undermine the authority and legitimacy of international treaties such as the Biological Weapons Convention, whose purpose is to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in this case, biological weapons.

Similarly, the Russian government has shown its equal disdain and disregard for the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international treaty with 193 member states. The Russian government did this through its years of support for the government of Syria, its denial of the Syrian government’s use of the chemical nerve agent sarin against its own citizens, and its efforts to undermine the efforts of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to carry out investigations of the Syrian government’s use of chemical munitions. It is the responsibility of the OPCW to protect the Chemical Weapon Convention and to see that it is not violated.

Now, in March 2022, as an unnecessary and superfluous accompaniment to its invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government has initiated yet another disinformation campaign, this time involving nuclear weapons and radiation munitions. Russia alleged variously that Ukraine had planned to develop and produce nuclear weapons, that Ukraine was preparing to make “dirty bombs” composed of radioactive materials to be scattered by high explosives, and that the United States may have supplied plutonium to Ukraine, from which nuclear weapons can be produced.

With these false charges, the Russian government has demonstrated the same destructive disregard for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as it previously showed for the BWC and the CWC. The Soviet Union played an instrumental role in achieving the NPT in July 1968, a treaty that presently has 191 member states.

Perhaps, one might think, only a former KGB agent who had become a head of state would think that these scurrilous disinformation campaigns were appropriate behavior for a major world power. President Putin has, after all, turned Russia into an empire of disinformation. But Putin is not alone. In the very same week, one sees the same lies—those concerning biological weapons and the United States—becoming a staple of the statements by the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, Zhao Lijian.

In one tweet, Zhao stated:

The US has 336 labs in 30 countries under its control, including 26 in Ukraine alone. It should give a full account of its biological military activities at home and abroad and subject itself to multilateral verification. pic.twitter.com/vEiytBRKuo — Spokesperson发言人办公室 (@MFA_China) March 8, 2022

Yes, 336 facilities have received funding support under the US Biological Threat Reduction Program. This program was initiated in 1997 to demilitarize former Soviet biological weapon research, development, and production facilities in Russia and the newly independent states formed on dissolution of the Soviet Union and to convert them to civilian public-health facilities.[1] The program was subsequently expanded to improve the capabilities of public-health facilities in many other countries. None of the 336 facilities are “US … labs” and none are “under its control.”

In their joint statement on February 5, 2022, Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin stated:

“The sides emphasize that domestic and foreign bioweapons activities by the United States and its allies raise serious concerns and questions for the international community regarding their compliance with the BWC. The sides share the view that such activities pose a series threat to the national security of the Russian Federation and China and are detrimental to the security of the respective regions. The sides call on the U.S. and its allies to act in an open, transparent, and responsible manner by properly reporting on their military biological activities conducted overseas and on their national territory…The sides, reaffirming their commitment to the goal of a world free of chemical weapons, call upon all parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention to work together to uphold its credibility and effectiveness.”

It is of enormous significance—and perhaps unprecedented in post-Cold War diplomacy—that the heads of state of Russia and China included such false and hypocritical remarks in a major statement.

Two of the most important countries in the world have made a mockery of truth, turned disinformation into a plaything, and are undermining all three international treaties—the BWC, the CWC, and the NPT—whose purposes are to dissuade countries from obtaining weapons of mass destruction.
