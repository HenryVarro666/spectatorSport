Today, April 5, and the forty-first day of Russia's military attack on Ukraine. We're reporting on all the current news. The article will be constantly updated.

What about today?

Key points

79% of refugees want to return to Ukraine after the war. This is evidenced by the results of a survey conducted by the Razumkov Center. Among the respondents, 89% believe that Ukraine will win this war, and only 1% do not believe it (10% find it difficult to answer).

Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, 84 defenders of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine, 42 of them posthumously. This was announced by Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov. The Minister noted that during this period, 18 officers received the rank of brigadier general: ""This is a new generation of high-ranking commanders, a reflection of the modern Ukrainian army, which is not toughened in offices, but in battle,"" Reznikov wrote on his Facebook page.

A meeting of the UN Security Council on the crimes of the occupiers in Bucha will take place today, April 5. For the first time since the beginning of the war, Zelenskyy will address the UN Security Council. This will happen today.

""Every normal person in the world understands who brought war and mass deaths to Ukraine. There is a lot of evidence that russian troops are destroying peaceful cities. Kidnapping, torturing, and killing civilians,"" the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy reports on the fortieth day of the war.

About 600 russian servicemen are being held captive in Ukraine, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk. Their fate has been repeatedly discussed at government meetings. In particular, they want to exchange some soldiers, in particular, for Ukrainians captured in 2014

The Prosecutor General's Office says that since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the occupiers have killed at least 165 children and injured 266.

Humanitarian corridors

Iryna Vereshchuk on the work of humanitarian corridors for today, April 5. A total of 7 routes are planned:

Mariupol – Zaporizhzhia by personal transport;

Berdyansk – Zaporizhzhia by personal transport;

Tokmak – Zaporizhzhia;

Severodonetsk – Bakhmut;

Lysychansk – Bakhmut;

Popasna – Bakhmut;

Hirske – Bakhmut.

The head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration reports: more than 200 people are ready to be evacuated in Lysychansk, there is no ""ceasefire"" in Rubizhne and Kreminna, but 330 residents were rescued

The humanitarian corridor in Rubizhne has not been approved yet.

Ukraine's talks with Russia

Zelenskyy suggests that there may be no meeting between him and putin. He said this in an interview with Ukrainian journalists shown on Tuesday as part of an all-Ukrainian telethon. According to Zelenskyy, even after the tragic events in Bucha, it is necessary to continue negotiations with Russia: ""Simply saying: let's not talk about anything today, this position is the easiest. The most difficult thing is to say what they did, to recognize them as an enemy, and at the same time find an opportunity to meet and find a way out on this meeting without losing their territory.""

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Epic Games raised $144 million (!) for Ukraine at a charity event at Fortnite.

Ivo Lukačovič, the founder of the Czech search engine Lista.cz, donated 100 million Czech korunas from his personal funds to the needs of the Ukrainian army. The entrepreneur explained that he was shocked by the massacre in Bucha.

Another $800 million cargo from the US military aid package is to arrive in Ukraine soon, the Pentagon said. Priority is given to weapons that are most needed by the Ukrainian military: Javelin, Stinger, UAV.

The United States also approved the sale of eight F-16 fighters to Bulgaria to increase the country's security during the war in Ukraine. Earlier, there was a suggestion that Bulgaria could hand over its Su-25 and MiG-29 aircraft to the Ukrainian army if it received fighter jets from the United States.

Assistance to refugees and those who receive them

The European Union is allocating 17 billion euros to countries that accept refugees from Ukraine.

Italy offers refugees from Ukraine to obtain a residence permit for 12 months. Both Ukrainians and third-country nationals with international protection can apply. After obtaining a residence permit, you will be able to officially get a job in the country, study in schools and universities, use health services and have some social benefits.

British MPs propose to temporarily place students and scientists from Ukraine in the country and issue them the appropriate visas, The Guardian reports. A letter with a proposal has already been sent to the British Ministry of Internal Affairs. It states that student and academic visas will help shelter more people, and continuing education will provide the necessary qualifications in subjects such as medicine and engineering, which will be vital in Ukraine after the war. To date, the government has introduced two systems that allow Ukrainians to come to Britain: at the invitation of a relative living in the country, or under a special program, which sponsors Ukrainians and provides them with housing.

News from partners

The National Gallery in London has renamed the piece of French Impressionist Edgar Degas ""Russian Dancers."" Now the work is called ""Ukrainian Dancers."" The title of this painting has been the subject of constant debate for many years in scholarly literature, but over the past month, it has received increased attention in connection with the current situation. Therefore, we decided that now is the right time to update the title of the painting so that it better reflects its plot,"" said a representative of the National Gallery.

What discussions can there be? Do you see a kokoshnik on the head of at least one of the dancers?

The United States will ask the UN General Assembly to expel russia from the Human Rights Council. ""Russia's participation in the Human Rights Council is a farce,"" said US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield in a speech in Bucharest.

Biden's statement yesterday about putin's war crimes: ""You probably remember me being criticized for calling Putin a war criminal. He is a war criminal. But we need to gather information and provide Ukraine with weapons so that they can continue to fight, and gather all the evidence so that this is a real war crimes trial. This guy is brutal. What is happening in Bucha is outrageous. And they have seen it all. I think it is a war crime. I want new sanctions, I will continue to impose sanctions.""

The US congressmen also understood that sympathy is not enough. They demand that Biden increase arms supplies to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, including long-range surface-to-air missiles, fighter jets, and anti-ship missiles.

According to US intelligence, Russia is reviewing its military targets to focus the offensive in eastern and southern Ukraine. In that case, Russia could use any of its successes to hide its failures. Russia is also likely to try to hold on to Kherson to control water supplies to the occupied Crimea and will continue to strike at major cities such as Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, and Lviv.

The Finnish Minister of Economy stated that Europe should completely abandon the import of Russian energy, despite the fact that it would worsen the living standards of Europeans. ""Russia needs to be energetically isolated because this is the only way to influence the Russian economy so much that it affects their actions,"" he said. ""Oil is now turning to red blood in Ukraine,"" the minister stressed.

From mid-April, free iodine tablets will be distributed in Romania to citizens under 40. Amid the war in Ukraine, Romania is also launching a campaign to inform its citizens about how to store and take iodine tablets in the event of a nuclear accident.

Lithuanian Ambassador to Ukraine returns to Kyiv. At the same time, the russian ambassador in Vilnius was obliged to leave the country.

Reaction to the atrocities of the russian occupiers in Ukraine

French Justice Minister Eric Dupont-Moretti offered his Ukrainian counterparts support in investigating war crimes, gathering evidence, and administering justice. ""I have offered my Ukrainian counterpart and the Prosecutor General of Ukraine operational support of France in the investigation of war crimes. Evidence needs to be gathered. Justice must be done,"" the French minister wrote.

The Canadian Foreign Minister called the massacre in Bucha a terrorist act. ""This weekend, the world saw disgusting and frantic attacks on civilians in Bucha. These terrorist acts will not go unpunished. They are clearly war crimes,"" she told a conference in Helsinki. Melanie Joly added that responsibility will surely come, and Canada will continue to support the efforts of the International Criminal Court.

What's in Russia?

A mono-protest action called ""Bucha-Moscow"" took place in the capital of Mordor. It is unknown at this time if the man was arrested. But judging by the photo, it can be seen that ordinary Moscow residents are trying to pass a man with his hands tied as soon as possible.

Ukrainian intelligence has received internal documents from the russian army, which show that the russian military does not receive the promised monetary payments. Instead of money, the occupiers are offered additional days off, and they are forbidden to complain about the lack of funding. The russian command also orders a separate list of those who refused to take part in the war against Ukraine. So the occupiers will not be able to make money on the murders.

The Horde shamelessly sells the looted items not only in the markets of Belarus but also on the Internet.

What about Belarus?

According to the operative information of the General Staff, as of the morning of April 4, the movement of columns of weapons and military equipment on the territory of Belarus in the direction of the railway stations Gomel, Yelsk, and Mozyr for loading on railway trains was noted. A significant part of the aircraft and helicopters of the Air and Space Forces of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation has been relocated from the airfields of the Republic of Belarus to the territory of Russia.

In Mozyr, 6 people standing in a square in the center of the city were detained and fined. They were accused of ""staying in one place for a long time in the presence of other passing citizens, thus publicly demonstrating their mass concentration."" Belarusians, this is just the beginning. Then the rude government will start killing just because you ""have been showing that you are alive for too long.""

Russian lies

Mordor was caught lying again: putin's regime officials and the propagandists who served them claimed that russian soldiers were not involved in the killings of civilians in Bucha. However, the analysis of satellite images refutes russia's claims that the killing of civilians in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, took place after its soldiers left the city.

Maxar Technologies has provided NYT with footage showing that many civilians were killed more than three weeks ago when the russian military controlled the city. One video taken by a local council member on April 2 shows many bodies scattered on Yablonska Street in Bucha. Satellite images show that at least 11 of them have been on the streets since March 11, when russia occupied the city.

Wikipedia has received a request from the Roskomnadzor to remove information on five articles at once:

""Battle for Kyiv (2022)"";

""War crimes during Russia's invasion of Ukraine"";

""Shelling of the hospital in Mariupol"";

""Destruction of the Mariupol Theater (2022)"";

""Massacre in Bucha.""

Is the truth hard to swallow?

Zhirinovsky's LDPR party submitted to the State Duma of the russian federation a bill to recognize the genocide of russians in Ukraine. And this is after the ethnic cleansing carried out by the occupying soldiers in Bucha, Irpin, and Borodianka.

At the same time, Russian schools began to teach lessons about the benefits of anti-russian sanctions. According to the newspaper Kommersant, teachers were sent recommendations on how to conduct classes for students in grades 5-9 and 10-11 on ""Anti-Russian sanctions and their impact on the domestic economy."" The manual says that at the beginning of the lesson the teacher should quote russian resident vladimir putin that ""russia is under unprecedented external pressure."" Also in class, students will be told about the positive effects of sanctions. At the end of the lesson, students should fill out a questionnaire and answer the question: ""Who suffers great economic losses?"" There are three possible answers: Russia, NATO countries, and all countries of the world.

The russians admitted to killing 93 people in civilian clothes. The Kremlin calls these people ""disguised militants."" In this way, they are preparing the public for what the world will see in Mariupol. Terrible civilian casualties will be explained by the fact that they are disguised ""Nazis.""

russian former president medvedev said that Ukrainians did not exist. He wrote about this on his Telegram channel: ""Deep Ukrainian culture, fueled by anti-russian poison and all-consuming lies about their identity; this is one big fake. This phenomenon has never been in history. And now it does not exist. Changing bloody and full of lying myths, the consciousness of some current Ukrainians today is the most important goal in the name of peace of future generations of Ukrainians themselves,"" Medvedev said. After these words, the physical extermination of Ukrainians became an official goal for Russia.

russia is preparing a large-scale provocation in Mariupol to accuse Ukraine of it, warns the Security Service of Ukraine. According to available data, the occupiers are preparing a large-scale falsification: they plan to gather in one place the bodies of Mariupol residents killed by the russians themselves and present them as mass victims of Ukrainian troops. To this end, false theses have recently been circulating that ""Ukrainians are using civilians as human shields."" Although this is an outright delusion. In fact, it is the russian troops who are destroying the people of Mariupol; in early March the city was already forced to bury the dead in mass graves. According to the SBU, in this way, the russian occupiers are trying to divert the attention of the world community after it became known about the atrocities of the russians in Bucha.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

Airbnb has banned users from russia and belarus from booking accommodation anywhere. A month ago, the service has already announced the termination of the lease in russia and belarus. All bookings made in these countries on the date after April 4 will be canceled.

The Prime Minister of Slovakia has stated that the country will still not pay for russian gas in rubles, as required by moscow. Previously, the Minister of Economy allowed payment in rubles, unless otherwise agreed. It seems that the Slovaks were given a very correct kick up the backside from someone.

Canada has imposed sanctions on 18 citizens of russia and belarus who facilitated the military invasion of Ukraine.

The American oil corporation ExxonMobil has frozen its project for the production of liquefied natural gas Far Eastern LNG in the russian port of De-Kastri. The cost of the Far Eastern LNG project is estimated at $4.2 billion. The launch was planned for 2027-2028.

The French Foreign Ministry said that new EU sanctions against Russia could be adopted tomorrow, April 6.

ЄС ввів вугільне ембарго проти росії, яке коштуватиме рф 4 млрд євро щорічно. Також у новому пакеті санкцій проти рф:

The French retail chain Auchan has stopped investing and supplying russia, although it will not close its stores yet. Earlier, the network refused to limit its activities in the aggressor country. The decision was made under pressure from the public, including Ukrainian employees of the network, who demanded an end to russia's funding of the war against Ukraine.

Google has removed the site of the russian Defense Ministry from the search results.

The EU has imposed a coal embargo against russia, which will cost Russia 4 billion euros a year. Also, the new package of sanctions against Russia includes:

a ban on the export to Russia of semiconductors, machinery, and transport equipment worth €10 billion;

a ban on all transactions with four key Russian banks, including VTB;

russian ships are banned from entering EU ports;

imports of a number of goods and raw materials such as wood, seeds, seafood and alcohol from russia are prohibited;

The EU has said it is also working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

Trophies of the Ukrainian Armed Forces

Tractor troops are working.

Yesterday, at one of the bases of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the russian CALIBER was shot down by an ordinary and far from new artillery gun.

Today, in the Izium district, units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine used the trophy TOS-1A Solntsepek against the occupying forces for the first time. The orcs will like it.

The new russian fascist Ka-52 helicopter has become heavier than air. Soldiers of the 95th Air Assault Brigade dealt with it quickly and professionally, aiming from the Stugna anti-tank missile system.

Today in the Donetsk region, Kramatorsk detachments shot down a Russian UAV. An enemy drone was conducting air reconnaissance.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine seized an interesting trophy: the radar reconnaissance station SNAR-10M1 of the russian army. The station is designed to detect equipment and individual targets. It can spot tanks at a distance of up to 35 km and people at a distance of 15 km! Now it will serve the Armed Forces of Ukraine!

Life considering hostilities

90 companies that have moved from the war zone to safer regions of Ukraine have already started working, said the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal. According to him, another 350 companies are in the process of redeployment. In total, applications for relocation were received from more than 1.1 thousand companies.

The President of Ukraine signed a law on preferential customs clearance of cars without paying taxes (value-added tax, excise tax, and import duty) for the period of martial law. The law also provides for the registration of cars with foreign registration under the simplified procedure in one hour. At the same time, citizens will have to pay a fee to the Pension Fund for the first registration (from 3% to 5% of the cost of the car), as well as pay for forms and numbers.

20:30 – Attention, be careful! Cyberattacks aimed at gaining access to Telegram accounts have been recorded. Criminals spread messages among Ukrainian citizens with malicious links to the alleged Telegram website in order to gain unauthorized access to accounts, including the possibility of intercepting one-time code from SMS.

Modular houses from the USA will appear in Bucha, Irpin, and Hostomel. According to former New York Governor George Patak, such homes were used in the United States after natural disasters.

Kyiv and region

As a result of the occupiers' attack, 5 bridges were destroyed in the Kyiv region:

bridge on the highway M-06 Kyiv-Chop, Stoyanka

the bridge between the village of Bucha and the city of Irpin.

bridge over the Bucha river, on the road T-10-01.

bridge on the road R-30 Entrance to the city of Irpin km 6+000

bridge on the road M-07 Kyiv – Kovel – Yahodyn km 23+000 across the Irpin river in Hostomel

It takes approximately 2-3 months to restore each, according to the Ministry of Infrastructure.

More than 600 saboteurs were detained during the war. The highest number of war crimes was recorded in the Kyiv region, now the number is 1,200, Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyi reports.

In Irpin, 1,500 volunteers volunteered for an hour to help dismantle the debris. The mayor of Irpin Oleksandr Markushyn reported about it. One hotline was not enough to answer all the volunteers, so now everyone can agree to help through an online questionnaire. Currently, local authorities are only compiling lists of applicants, and the start of work will be announced separately.

The Defense Intelligence of Ukraine reports that russian servicemen who committed atrocities in Bucha are being returned to Ukraine. As of April 4, the 64th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 35th All-Russian Army was withdrawn from Ukraine to Belarus and was near the town of Mozyr. By April 6, the personnel will be transported by rail to Belgorod, Russia. After only a two-day vacation, they plan to return to Ukraine in one of the ""hottest"" places (preliminary, Kharkiv direction). As a rule, Russian units leaving the combat zone receive much more time for recovery and rest.

Such a schedule indicates that ""special tasks"" are expected for the 64th Brigade. The first of them is the intimidation of residents of settlements in Ukraine. Those who committed the crimes of genocide in Bucha may repeat this again in other cities.

Monument to Shevchenko in the ruined Borodianka.

The Ukrainian military has regained control of the border in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, according to the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine.

In Irpin and Bucha, russian orcs shot parents in front of children, ""so that they would remember this war and respect the russians."" The children were raped. Their teeth were pulled out. This is not even fascism. These biological organisms must be destroyed without exception.

After the liberation, only 3,700 people remained in Bucha. This was stated by Mayor Anatolii Fedoruk on a telethon. In 2021, the population of Bucha was estimated at 30 thousand people. The mayor has not yet advised civilians to return to the city; de-mining work continues.

The authorities warn about the premature return to the Kyiv region, not just for the sake of it. It is still very dangerous at the moment. Yesterday a resident of the Brovary district died from an explosion of a car mined by the occupiers. A 32-year-old resident of the village of Hoholiv was on his way to the village of Ploske, where he found his car. The man ignored the instructions of law enforcement officers, did not wait for the territory to be cleared, but instead got in the car and drove home. A man opened the luggage compartment of a car in the yard of the house, after which an explosion occurred. The man received injuries to the abdomen and pelvis incompatible with life. As it turned out, the car was mined by the russian military.

This is what Borodianka became after a savage russian horde swept through the city.

22:00 – The Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine Denys Monastyrskyi told journalists of leading Ukrainian and foreign media that dozens of other locals may be under the rubble of buildings and in the forests around the city of Bucha.

The Brovary District Prosecutor's Office has instituted criminal proceedings for violating the laws and customs of war (Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine). During the investigation, it was established that in the village of Velyka Dymerka, Brovary district, 11 civilians were killed as a result of the use of firearms and artillery by russian orcs. In the village of Bohdanivka, a local resident died from shrapnel wounds during the shelling of the settlement by the occupiers.

On April 3, 2022, a civilian vehicle exploded on an enemy mine while driving on a dirt road between the villages of Rudnytske and Peremoha of the Baryshivka territorial community of Brovary district. The driver of the vehicle was killed and another passenger was injured. Kyiv Region prosecutors continue to record all war crimes of the aggressor country in order to bring the perpetrators to justice.

Today, Ukrainian border guards returned to two border checkpoints in the Kyiv region, Ivankiv and Malachevka on the border with Belarus. Both border checkpoints were captured by the russians on February 24, the first day of the war.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions

On April 4, as a result of the Russian shelling, 2 people died in Avdiivka, including one child, and 4 others were injured, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk Regional State Administration.

There is no water supply in Rubizhne, Popasna, Severodonetsk, partly in the Hirske Community and Lysychansk.

A civilian commercial dry cargo ship Azburg (flag Dominicana, shipowner Malta), located on the 16th berth of the Mariupol seaport, was shelled by russian Nazis. According to Andrii Klymenko, head of the Institute for Strategic Black Sea Studies, this happened on April 4 at about 10:40 p.m. The captain of the ship gave an SOS signal. It is reported that one crew member was injured, and a fire broke out in the engine room. In total, the ship's crew consists of 12 people, one of whom is a woman. The dry cargo arrived at the port of Mariupol on February 23 from Bulgaria.

UPD: According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, the ship Azburg fired at by the russian Nazis in the port of Mariupol began to sink. The ship is on fire. Maritime border guards promptly assisted the wounded and evacuated the crew to safety.

12:00 – The occupiers are trying to resume offensive operations in the direction of Sloviansk. They managed to capture the village of Brazhkivka. This was reported in the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

12:00 – In Rubizhne, russian fascists hit a tank with nitric acid. The head of the Luhansk regional state administration, Serhii Haidai writes. Nitric acid is dangerous if inhaled, swallowed, and in contact with skin and mucous membranes. ""Don't leave cover!

If you are indoors, close the doors and windows! Follow the direction of the wind! Follow the information!"" reports Haidai.

First aid (everyone needs to know this):

if nitric acid gets into the eyes, rinse them under running water for 10-30 minutes;

in case of contact with skin, wash the affected area with water, adding baking soda, soap;

when swallowing nitric acid, gastric lavage with plenty of water is prescribed.

13:00 – Detailed information about the hit on the nitrogen tank in Rubizhne by the head of Luhansk regional military administration Serhii Haidai. This liquid is quite toxic, and we do not know where this toxic cloud will go. We are watching the wind and waiting for the rain. Now the wind is blowing towards russia and so the russians can feel the actions of their army, but along the way, there are many Ukrainian villages and towns.

Over the past day, the russians fired 51 times at residential areas in the Luhansk region. The Horde fired mortars, artillery, rocket-propelled grenades, and used aircraft. They opened fire on Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Novodruzhesk. The shelling also damaged several civilian infrastructure and livelihoods.

On April 4, during the evacuation from Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, an evacuation convoy came under fire in Novodruzhesk; one bus was damaged, and fortunately, no one was injured.

Mykolaiv region

As a result of yesterday's shelling of Mykolaiv, 11 people died, and 61 more were wounded. ""Every day these lying and cynical creatures kill residents of my native Mykolaiv and then report allegedly about the elimination of military objects. We will find each of you. You won't get away with it,"" the Head of the Mykolaiv regional state administration Vitalii Kim promised.

The CNN camera crew came under artillery fire near Mykolaiv: ""The shell fell very close to us. We ran away, and then two more shells fell, one of which is 10 yards from one of our cars.""

11:30 – Vitalii Kim reported on a situation in the Mykolaiv region:

Authorities control the entry/exit of military equipment into the region;

there are fierce battles, but there is a lot of misinformation on the Internet. The command to 'capture Mykolayiv in 3 days' is a fake, to sow panic;

If possible, you can leave the city;

The Russian army is not even on the outskirts of the city.

14:00 – Security Service of Ukraine detained the head of the Mykolaiv district prosecutor's office. He was informed about the suspicion of treason. According to the SBU, the head of the Mykolaiv district prosecutor's office shared with the Russian occupiers the information on the latest situation in Mykolaiv and the region; dead military and civilians, prisoners, places of their detention; results of attacks on Mykolaiv; daily passwords at checkpoints in the region, etc. ""In order to catch the traitor, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) handed over simulated lists of dead servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine through a fictitious person. A few days later, these lists were already recorded by a representative of the russian federation, who was also monitored by the SBU. During the interrogation, the traitor confessed to his criminal activity and provided relevant testimony,"" the Security Service of Ukraine said in a statement.

Kherson region

In the temporarily occupied areas, where the russian fascists have established pseudo-authorities, salaries will be reduced. Thus, Gauleiter of the city of Kakhovka Pavlo Filipchuk told communal services that Russia cannot pay such salaries as Ukraine. Employees will receive half as much for their work, but ""will be paid regularly.""

In Nova Kakhovka, orcs are forcing residents to equip their positions. This is stated in the message of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Facebook.

On April 5, Mykhailo Burak, Head of the Bekhtery village council, was released from captivity. He is currently in hospital with numerous injuries, according to the Association of Ukrainian Cities.

Kherson Mayor Ihor Kolykhaiev reports: russians in the city ""work"" with activists and the military, have all the information on them. ""They had personal files for each of my profile deputies, information from the wife's line of descent to the dog's nickname.""

Arestovych does not rule out that Russia will leave the Kherson region. He said that ""the Russians themselves have already prepared Kherson for surrender. Few people know about it, but they are seriously considering leaving Kherson, in particular among their other plans."" ""It doesn't mean that Kherson will be released tomorrow, but nevertheless. In the Mykolaiv region, there is no enemy anymore, all fights are already led in the Kherson region,"" he added.

At the same time, this morning the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that after the assault, the russians had partially established themselves in Oleksandrivka in the Pivdennyi Buh direction. There are also reports that reinforcements are coming from Crimea to the Kherson region.

Units of the State Border Guard Service of the Siversk Police Department have come to the state border of Ukraine in the Chernihiv region and are providing border protection.

Sumy region

Two enemy T-72 tanks were neutralized by villagers in the Sumy region. One must have fought during World War II, and the other one is brand new from the factory. Locals say they saw that the speedometer ran less than 200 km.

In the Sumy region, the mopping-up continues. ""Konotop district continues to come to its senses from the invasion of orcs. At least three tortured Ukrainians have already been found at the sites of the former enemy camps.

Dnipropetrovsk region

Explosions were heard in Dnipro last night. It was our air defense that shot down two enemy missiles over the Dnipropetrovsk region, explained the head of the region Valentyn Reznichenko. The wreckage caused a small fire in one of the villages. No one was injured.

In the Dnipropetrovsk region, a 47-year-old local woman detonated an explosive device after picking it up. The woman died from her injuries. This was reported by the National Police. And once again reminded: do not touch explosive and unfamiliar objects! It can cost you your life! Ukraine is now just stuffed with mines!

The number of migrants from Donbas and Kharkiv region is growing in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The head of the regional council Mykola Lukashuk reported about it. According to him, 38,000 people have already been registered as temporarily displaced persons. That is, in fact, there are several times more.

Kharkiv region

In the city of Izium, the invaders equipped a field hospital in a local school.

Feldman's eco-park in the Kharkiv region has been destroyed, its owner Oleksandr Feldman said. The enclosures have been destroyed, there are few surviving animals, and they will most likely be put down. There is a chance to save several animals if they find a place to keep them.

UPD: Odesa Zoo offered to take surviving animals from Feldman Eco-park. In addition, Lutsk, Rivne, Kyiv zoos, Limpopo Zoo and other Ukrainian zoos are ready to accept predators, according to the press service of the Odesa Zoo. The question of how to take them out is currently being resolved. ""The main horror is that the territory of the EcoPark is under constant enemy fire. It is extremely difficult to take out animals. We very much hope that by joint efforts we will be able to save the wards of Feldman EcoPark, take them out from under enemy fire and place them safely in our zoos,"" the statement reads.

In the Kharkiv region, a russian occupier raped a 29-year-old woman caring for an immobile mother for more than a week. After the intimidation, he talked ""about love,"" and after receiving a refusal, he killed the woman's old mother in front of her. Ombudsman Liudmyla Denisova spoke about this and other atrocities of the russian army in the Kharkiv region.

16:30 – Residents of the temporarily occupied Izium are forcibly deported to russia, Liudmyla Denisova also said. The occupiers are setting up filtration camps and corridors through which Ukrainians are being deported to Russia.

""After bringing the city to a critical situation, the enemy offers a conditional corridor to allegedly save people, leaving them no choice,"" said the ombudsman.

18:00 – The mayor of Kharkiv Ihor Terekhov amid media reports about possible plans of the russian military to try to capture the city again recorded an appeal to Kharkiv. ""Dear citizens of Kharkiv! I understand your turmoil that arose after media reports about the possible capture of Kharkiv! But panic is what our enemy is trying to achieve from us. Kharkiv is a well-armed and well-prepared city for defense.""

Zhytomyr region

Only those people who are on duty can carry weapons in the settlements of the region. This decision of the Defense Council of Zhytomyr Region was announced by the head of the Zhytomyr Military Administration Vitalii Bunechko on his Facebook page.

In other cases, the weapons of the personnel must remain in specially equipped places for their storage. Commanders of units of the Territorial Defense Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and leaders of voluntary formations of territorial communities should strengthen control over the use of firearms, the statement said.

Western Ukraine

The Volyn Regional State administration reports that at night the Ukrainian air defense shot down an enemy missile over the territory of the region. The fall of the fragments did not cause any negative consequences.

""We believe in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, thank you for the excellent service and safety of our citizens,"" said the head of the Volyn military administration Yurii Pohuliaiko.

Two more enemy missiles were shot down by our air defense over the Rivne region.

""The missile that flew to Ternopil was shot down, but its parts fell into a warehouse with mineral fertilizers. The tank with ammonia-containing fertilizers was damaged,"" said Volodymyr Trush, head of the Ternopil Regional State Administration. Fertilizers got into the groundwater and in the evening the ammonia content increased, so residents are asked to limit the use of drinking water from wells. Delivery of drinking water to the population will be carried out. The situation, according to environmentalists, should pass in 3-4 days without significant harm to humans.

A flash mob took place at the railway station in Lviv: the anthem of Ukraine was performed by passengers of the train №714 Kyiv – Przemyśl, media representatives, and artists of the National Honored Academic Ukrainian Folk Choir named after Hryhorii Veriovka.",https://rubryka.com/en/article/41-day-war/

Kalibr missile launches by Buyan-class corvettes/Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates? Quite casual event, launching missiles all the time - rtb to Sevastopol, and launching again (from areas near Sevastopol)

Could you please confirm missile engagement by naval ships?! Where- and whatsabout?? Thanks

This flight could be related. ""Sudden and multiple"" flights from Moscow in recent weeks, could be connected to burials of Russian senior officers in the regions after joint farewell ceremonies in Moscow, not ""nukes soon evacuation""
