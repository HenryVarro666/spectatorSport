Jens Stoltenberg, Nato Secretary-General, said after chairing a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels that alliance members were ready to provide more equipment and that they “realise and recognize the urgency”.

Mr Stoltenberg rejected arguments that Nato members should only supply ‘defensive arms’.

""Ukraine is fighting a defensive war, so this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons doesn't actually have any real meaning,"" he said.

Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, said: ""There was support for countries to supply new and heavier equipment to Ukraine so that they can respond to these new threats from Russia.""

""We've agreed to help Ukrainian forces move from their Soviet-era equipment to Nato-standard equipment on a bilateral basis,"" Ms Truss added.
