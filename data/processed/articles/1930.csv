WASHINGTON, March 28 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin does not appear ready to make compromises to end the war in Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said on Monday as Ukraine and Russia were preparing for their first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks.

""Everything I have seen is he is not willing to compromise at this point,"" the senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters on condition of anonymity after Ukraine's president sketched out a potential way to end the crisis over the weekend.

""So, how far we go in trying to offer him off-ramps that undercut the sovereignty of Ukraine and the decisions that (Ukrainian) President (Volodymyr) Zelinskiy would have to make, I don’t have a good insight for you,"" the U.S. official said.

Ukraine is ready to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia but such a pact would have to be guaranteed by third parties and put to a referendum, Zelenskiy said in remarks aired on Sunday.

Speaking to Russian journalists in a 90-minute video call more than a month after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, an interview that Moscow authorities preemptively warned Russian media to refrain from reporting, Zelenskiy said no peace deal would be possible without a ceasefire and troop withdrawals.

He ruled out trying to recapture all Russian-held territory by force, saying it would lead to a third world war, and said he wanted to reach a ""compromise"" over the eastern Donbas region, held by Russian-backed forces since 2014.

Russia says it is conducting a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine with the aim of demilitarizing its neighbor. Ukraine and its Western allies call this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion.

Ukrainian officials also played down the chances of a major breakthrough at the talks, due to be held in Istanbul after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Russia's Vladimir Putin on Sunday.

But the fact that they were taking place in person at all - for the first time since an acrimonious meeting between foreign ministers on March 10 - was a sign of shifts behind the scenes as Russia's invasion has become bogged down.

On the ground, there was no sign of respite for civilians in besieged cities, especially the devastated port of Mariupol, whose mayor said 160,000 people were still trapped inside and Russia was blocking attempts to evacuate them.

But the mayor of Irpin, near Kyiv, said Ukrainian forces had seized back full control of the town. ""We have good news today - Irpin has been liberated,"" Oleksandr Markushyn said, adding that it expected further attacks and would defend itself. Reuters could not immediately verify the information.

The Kremlin, for its part, said it was alarmed by U.S. President Joe Biden's comment during a speech on Saturday that Putin must not remain in power.In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city and one of its hardest hit, people were sweeping rubble out of a classroom on the third storey of a school, where a wall had been blown out by a missile before dawn.

""This is a civilian target. It's a school!"" said Oleksandr, who had been sheltering with his mother on a lower floor of the school after their own neighbourhood was hit. ""They've not been able to take the city, so they've decided to destroy it.""

TALKS

Russia and Ukraine said their delegations would arrive in Turkey on Monday, with the talks due to start on Tuesday.

Ukrainian officials have recently suggested Russia could be more willing to compromise having seen stiff Ukrainian resistance and heavy Russian losses.

But a senior U.S. State Department official said Putin did not give that impression. ""Everything I have seen is he is not willing to compromise at this point,"" the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity after Ukraine's president sketched out a potential way to end the crisis over the weekend.

Russia's military signalled last week it would concentrate on expanding territory held by separatists in eastern Ukraine, a month after having committed the bulk of its huge invasion force to a failed assault on Kyiv.

But Ukraine said it saw no sign Russia had given up a plan to surround the capital, where the mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said 100 people had been killed, including 4 children, and 82 multi-storey buildings had been destroyed. It was not possible to verify the figures.

When the sides last met in person, Ukraine accused Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of ignoring pleas to discuss a ceasefire, while Lavrov said a halt to fighting was not even on the agenda.

Since then, they have held talks via video link and publicly discussed a formula under which Ukraine might accept some kind of formal neutral status. But neither side has budged over Russia's territorial demands, including Crimea, which Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, and eastern territories known as the Donbas, which Moscow demands Kyiv cede to separatists.

""I don't think there will be any breakthrough on the main issues,"" Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said.

In an interview with Russian journalists at the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy mentioned some form of ""compromise"" involving Donbas, although he did not suggest this might involve ceding the territory. In his latest comments he said territorial integrity remained Kyiv's priority.

BIDEN CALL 'ALARMING'

The Kremlin, which regularly denounces the West, has so far given only a measured response to Biden's surprise comment about Putin at the end of a speech in Warsaw at the weekend: ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power.""

On Sunday Biden said he was not calling for regime change.

Asked about the comment, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it ""is certainly alarming"", adding that the Kremlin would continue to pay close attention to the U.S. president's comments. Earlier Peskov said it was up to the Russian people to pick their leader.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Kyiv and the West consider this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion to try to topple the elected Ukrainian government.

Last week, Ukrainian forces went on the offensive, pushing Russian troops back in areas around Kyiv, the northeast and the southwest. Russia kept up pressure in the southeast near separatist areas, including its devastating siege of Mariupol.

Mayor Vadym Boichenko, speaking from an undisclosed location outside the city, said 26 buses were waiting to evacuate some of 160,000 trapped civilians but Russia was denying safe passage.

""People are beyond the line of humanitarian catastrophe,"" Boichenko said on national television. ""We need to completely evacuate Mariupol."" A spokesperson for Boichenko said later that nearly 5,000 people had been killed and 90% of buildings damaged, of which 40% were destroyed.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said there were no plans to open corridors to evacuate civilians from besieged cities on Monday, because of intelligence reports of possible Russian ""provocations"" along the routes.

Elsewhere, Russia's armoured columns are bogged down, with trouble resupplying and making little or no progress.

Britain's defence ministry said there had been no major change in Russia's positions in the past 24 hours, with most Russian gains near Mariupol and heavy fighting underway there.

Delegates of the two nations were set to meet Monday amid a changing battlefield, in which Ukrainian forces last week loosened Russia’s grip with a series of successful counterattacks outside Kyiv and Kherson.

“Everything I have seen is [Putin] is not willing to compromise at this point,” the senior US State Department official told Reuters.

Kyiv and Moscow are expected to discuss a possible deal that would involve Ukraine abandoning its campaign to join NATO in exchange for security guarantees and possibly being able to join the European Union, sources told the Financial Times.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday told Russian journalists that he was willing to compromise on the issue of Ukrainian neutrality.

“Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state — we are ready to go for it,” he said in Russian.

While details of the plan were hazy, Zelensky said any deal would be brokered by third parties and put to a referendum for Ukrainian voters. The president also made clear that any deal would require Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine.

Negotiations are set to begin Tuesday in Turkey, a NATO member state with close diplomatic ties to both Russia and Ukraine. It will be the first face-to-face meeting between the warring countries since March 10.

While Ukraine has retaken strategic territory around the capital city and the Crimean peninsula, Russian forces continue to pummel the southern port city of Mariupol, where street-by-street fighting has broken out after weeks of heavy bombardment.

And as the Russians signal a shift in their priorities toward the separatist-held regions of the Donbas in the east, Zelensky said they are returning to some of the brutal tactics borne of the fighting that began there in 2014.

“They are kidnapping the mayors of our cities,” Zelensky told the Economist in an interview Sunday. “They killed some of them. Some of them we can’t find. Some of them we have found already, and they are dead.”

Vladimir Putin NOT ready for compromise on Ukraine warns senior US official

Russian president Vladimir Putin is not ready to make compromises to end his invasion of Ukraine, a senior US official has warned.

The official told Reuters that Putin would not be willing to make concessions at this point despite the first face-to-face negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in more than two weeks being set to resume.

Russia has suffered significant losses during the invasion, with Ukraine claiming that 16,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, as well as substantial losses of military hardware such as tanks, aircraft, and ships.

But despite the war not appearing to go the way that Putin had planned, the Russian president does not appear ready to compromise to broker a peace agreement.

The senior US State Department official told Reuters on condition of anonymity: ""Everything I have seen is he is not willing to compromise at this point.""

The ominous prediction comes after Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky had sketched out a potential way to bring the invasion to a close.

Kyiv has now said that it will no longer consider any concessions on territory as the fighting on the ground appears to be shifting in its favour.

Nonetheless the situation for Ukrainian citizens remains desperate, with Russia blocking civilian evacuation from the besieged city of Mariupol despite Ukrainian reports that 90% of the city has been damaged by the relentless bombardment.

The talks have been arranged to begin on Monday following meetings between Putin and President Recep Erdoğan of Turkey.

Turkey has the southern coast of the Black Sea, opposite from the Crimea, and has had historic agreements with Russia over the rights of military vessels to enter the Black Sea.

Morale among Russian soldiers on the ground also appears to be low, with a report of one soldier even running over their commanding officer with a tank.

Russian forces may not even have the numbers to be able to successfully occupy Ukrainian cities, and a campaign of horrific bombardment has been carried out, most notably in the city of Mariupol.

Ukraine’s foreign minister said a cease-fire was the most his country could hope for from the talks, due to be held in Istanbul on Tuesday after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Sunday.

“We are not trading people, land or sovereignty,” Dmytro Kuleba said.

A report that Russian billionaire and mediator Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators had suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv this month underlined the tension over the talks.

The Wall Street Journal and the investigative outlet Bellingcat cited people familiar with the matter for their reports but Ukraine poured cold water on them and a US official said the cause of the symptoms was environmental, not poison.

In besieged Ukrainian cities where conditions are desperate, the threat of Russian attacks blocked exit routes for civilians, two Ukrainian officials said, including the devastated port of Mariupol whose mayor said 160,000 people were still trapped.

But the United Nations said it had been able to bring food and medical supplies into Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-biggest city and one of its hardest hit.

A predawn missile blew out the wall of a Kharkiv school.

“They’ve not been able to take the city, so they’ve decided to destroy it,” said Oleksandr, sweeping rubble out of a third-story classroom after spending the night with his mother on a lower floor because their own neighborhood had been hit.

The mayor of Irpin, near Kyiv, said Ukrainian forces were back in full control and a US defense official said the Ukrainians had recaptured the eastern town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy and were continuing to try to take back ground.

Russia’s defense ministry, for its part, said its troops had destroyed ammunition depots in the Zhytomyr region west of Kyiv and had hit 41 Ukrainian military sites in the past 24 hours. Reuters could not immediately verify any of the reports.

“Change their goals”

Tuesday’s talks will be the first in person since an acrimonious meeting between foreign ministers on March 10, a sign of shifts behind the scenes as Russia’s invasion has stalled and sanctions have hit home.

“We have destroyed the myth of the invincible Russian army. We are resisting against the aggression of one of the strongest armies in the world and have succeeded in making them change their goals,” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

He said 100 people had been killed in the capital, including four children, and 82 multi-story buildings had been destroyed. It was not possible to verify the figures.

Russia’s military signalled last week it would concentrate on expanding territory held by separatists in eastern Ukraine, but Ukraine said it saw no sign Russia had given up a plan to surround the capital, which it targeted in its Feb. 24 invasion.

Turkey’s president Erdogan, however, was more upbeat, reporting progress in telephone calls with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The Kremlin said Biden’s surprise comment about Putin at the end of a speech in Warsaw at the weekend, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power” was “certainly alarming” after earlier saying it was up to Russians to choose their leader.

On Sunday Biden said he was not calling for regime change.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” to disarm and “denazify” its neighbor. Kyiv and the West consider this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion to try to topple the elected Ukrainian government.

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said talks should not end up “selling Ukraine out,” noting the “uneasy settlement” which left it vulnerable after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.

“We need to ensure that Putin can never act in this aggressive way again. Any long term settlement needs to include a clear sanctions snapback, which would be triggered automatically by any Russian aggression,” she told parliament.

Last week, Ukrainian forces pushed Russian troops back in areas around Kyiv, the northeast and the southwest, while Russia kept up pressure in the southeast near separatist areas, including its devastating siege of Mariupol.
