0,fa7b1b0e-5d02-41f0-a714-8cfbe42a3b8a,[],2022-03-03 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the designation of Ukraine for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 18 months.

“Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,” said Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas. “In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States.”

A country may be designated for TPS when conditions in the country fall into one or more of the three statutory bases for designation: ongoing armed conflict, environmental disasters, or extraordinary and temporary conditions. This designation is based on both ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in Ukraine that prevent Ukrainian nationals, and those of no nationality who last habitually resided in Ukraine, from returning to Ukraine safely. These conditions result from the full-scale Russian military invasion into Ukraine, which marks the largest conventional military action in Europe since World War II. This invasion has caused a humanitarian crisis with significant numbers of individuals fleeing and damage to civilian infrastructure that has left many without electricity or water or access to food, basic supplies, shelter, and emergency medical services.

Individuals eligible for TPS under this designation must have continuously resided in the United States since March 1, 2022. Individuals who attempt to travel to the United States after March 1, 2022 will not be eligible for TPS. Ukraine’s 18-month designation will go into effect on the publication date of the forthcoming Federal Register notice. The Federal Register notice will provide instructions for applying for TPS and an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). TPS applicants must meet all eligibility requirements and undergo security and background checks.",https://www.dhs.gov/news/2022/03/03/secretary-mayorkas-designates-ukraine-temporary-protected-status-18-months

Anyone applying for the status, which will allow them to remain in the country, for now, must have been living in the U.S. by March 1, 2022. Ukrainians who traveled to the country after that date are not eligible, DHS said.

TPS has been a lifeline to hundreds of thousands of individuals already in the United States when problems in a home country make their departure or deportation untenable. This fact sheet provides an overview of how TPS designations are determined, what benefits TPS confers, and how TPS beneficiaries apply for and regularly renew their status.

What is Temporary Protected Status?

Congress created TPS in the Immigration Act of 1990. It is a temporary immigration status provided to nationals of specifically designated countries that are confronting an ongoing armed conflict, environmental disaster, or extraordinary and temporary conditions. It provides a work permit and stay of deportation to foreign nationals from those countries who are in the United States at the time the U.S. government makes the designation. In October 2021, there were an estimated 319,465 people with TPS and 481,980 people eligible for TPS under new designations or redesignations.

For what reasons can a country be designated for TPS?

A country may be designated for TPS for one or more of the following reasons:

An ongoing armed conflict , such as a civil war, that poses a serious threat to the personal safety of returning nationals;

, such as a civil war, that poses a serious threat to the personal safety of returning nationals; An environmental disaster , such as an earthquake, hurricane, or epidemic, that results in a substantial but temporary disruption of living conditions, and because of which the foreign state is temporarily unable to adequately handle the return of its nationals; or

, such as an earthquake, hurricane, or epidemic, that results in a substantial but temporary disruption of living conditions, and because of which the foreign state is temporarily unable to adequately handle the return of its nationals; or Extraordinary and temporary conditions in the foreign state that prevent its nationals from returning to the state in safety (unless the U.S. government finds that permitting these nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to the U.S. national interest).

Who has the authority to designate a country for TPS?

The Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to decide when a country merits a TPS designation. The Secretary must consult with other government agencies prior to deciding to designate a country—or part of a country—for TPS.

Although these other agencies are not specified in the statute, these consultations usually involve the Department of State, the National Security Council, and occasionally the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Secretary’s decision as to whether or not to designate a country for TPS is not subject to judicial review, according to immigration law.

How long are TPS designations?

A TPS designation can be made for 6, 12, or 18 months at a time. At least 60 days prior to the expiration of TPS, the Secretary must decide whether to extend or terminate a designation based on the conditions in the foreign country. Decisions to begin, extend, or terminate a TPS designation must be published in the Federal Register. If an extension or termination decision is not published at least 60 days in advance of expiration, the designation is automatically extended for six months. The law does not define the term “temporary” or otherwise limit the amount of time for which a country can have a TPS designation.

Who is eligible for TPS?

In order to qualify for TPS, an individual must:

Be a national of the foreign country with a TPS designation (or if stateless, have last habitually resided in a country with a TPS designation);

Be continuously physically present in the United States since the effective date of designation;

Have continuously resided in the United States since a date specified by the Secretary of Homeland Security; and

Not be inadmissible to the United States or be barred from asylum for certain criminal or national security-related reasons, such as individuals who have been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors.

Nationals of a designated country do not automatically receive TPS, but instead must register during a specific registration period and pay significant fees. In addition, an individual’s immigration status at the time of application for TPS has no effect on eligibility, nor does the previous issuance of an order of removal.

What does TPS authorize a noncitizen to do?

An individual who is eligible for TPS must register by submitting an application to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). If a person demonstrates eligibility and USCIS grants TPS, that person receives a temporary stay of deportation and temporary authorization to work in the United States. TPS beneficiaries are also eligible for advance parole, which provides permission to travel abroad and return to the United States, but they must apply for it separately. Beneficiaries are not eligible for any public assistance by virtue of their TPS status.

Which countries have TPS?

As of March 2022, the following 12 countries were designated for TPS and the designation had not expired:

Burma (Valid through November 25, 2022)

On March 16, 2022, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced that Afghanistan would be designated for TPS. As of publication, the formal designation for Afghanistan has yet to be published in the Federal Register.

Which countries have had TPS in the past?

Since TPS was created, the following countries or parts of countries have had TPS designations that are now terminated:",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/temporary-protected-status-overview

In compliance with the injunction, DHS has automatically extended the validity of Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) and other TPS-related documentation for TPS beneficiaries affected by the injunction through [Dec. 31, 2022]. If necessary, DHS will continue to issue appropriate future notices to continue its compliance with court orders.

However, because the appellate court has not issued its directive to the district court to make that ruling effective, the injunction remains in place at this time.

What is TPS

The Secretary of Homeland Security may designate a foreign country for TPS due to conditions in the country that temporarily prevent the country's nationals from returning safely, or in certain circumstances, where the country is unable to handle the return of its nationals adequately. USCIS may grant TPS to eligible nationals of certain countries (or parts of countries), who are already in the United States. Eligible individuals without nationality who last resided in the designated country may also be granted TPS. The Secretary may designate a country for TPS due to the following temporary conditions in the country: Ongoing armed conflict (such as civil war)

An environmental disaster (such as earthquake or hurricane), or an epidemic

Other extraordinary and temporary conditions During a designated period, individuals who are TPS beneficiaries or who are found preliminarily eligible for TPS upon initial review of their cases (prima facie eligible): Are not removable from the United States

Can obtain an employment authorization document (EAD)

May be granted travel authorization Once granted TPS, an individual also cannot be detained by DHS on the basis of his or her immigration status in the United States. TPS is a temporary benefit that does not lead to lawful permanent resident status or give any other immigration status. However, registration for TPS does not prevent you from: Applying for nonimmigrant status

Filing for adjustment of status based on an immigrant petition

Applying for any other immigration benefit or protection for which you may be eligible PLEASE NOTE: To be granted any other immigration benefit you must still meet all the eligibility requirements for that particular benefit. An application for TPS does not affect an application for asylum or any other immigration benefit and vice versa. Denial of an application for asylum or any other immigration benefit does not affect your ability to register for TPS, although the grounds of denial of that application may also lead to denial of TPS.

Countries Currently Designated for TPS

Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for TPS, you must: Be a national of a country designated for TPS, or a person without nationality who last habitually resided in the designated country;

File during the open initial registration or re-registration period, or you meet the requirements for late initial filing during any extension of your country’s TPS designation (Late initial filers see ‘Filing Late’ section below);

Have been continuously physically present (CPP) in the United States since the effective date of the most recent designation date of your country; and

Have been continuously residing (CR) in the United States since the date specified for your country. (See your country’s TPS web page to the left). The law allows an exception to the continuous physical presence and continuous residence requirements for brief, casual and innocent departures from the United States. When you apply or re-register for TPS, you must inform USCIS of all absences from the United States since the CPP and CR dates. USCIS will determine whether the exception applies in your case. You may NOT be eligible for TPS or to maintain your existing TPS if you: Have been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors committed in the United States;

Are found inadmissible as an immigrant under applicable grounds in INA section 212(a), including non-waivable criminal and security-related grounds;

Are subject to any of the mandatory bars to asylum. These include, but are not limited to, participating in the persecution of another individual or engaging in or inciting terrorist activity;

Fail to meet the continuous physical presence and continuous residence in the United States requirements;

Fail to meet initial or late initial TPS registration requirements; or

If granted TPS, you fail to re-register for TPS, as required, without good cause.

What to File

You must include the necessary forms, evidence, fees, or fee waiver request when filing your TPS application. Below is information about what you must include in your TPS package. Please also check your country’s specific TPS page to the left to see if there are any special filing instructions specific to your TPS-designated country. Forms To register or re-register for TPS you must file Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status. Eligible nationals of certain countries, or individuals without nationality who last habitually resided in those countries, can now file Form I-821 online. All applicants eligible to file for TPS under one of the current designations may file Form I-821 online. When filing an initial TPS application or re-registering for TPS, you can also request an employment authorization document (EAD) by submitting a completed Form I-765, Request for Employment Authorization, at the time of filing Form I-821. You may also file your Form I-765 request separately at a later date. Filing Form I-821 with Form I-765 may help you receive your EAD more promptly if you are eligible. You may also file Form I-765 online if filing concurrently with Form I-821 online. When you apply, if you are aware that a relevant ground of inadmissibility applies to you and you need a waiver to obtain TPS, please include a Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, with your TPS application package. However, you do not need to file a new Form I-601 for an incident that USCIS has already waived with a prior TPS application. USCIS may grant a waiver of certain inadmissibility grounds for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is in the public interest. These forms are free and available on the forms section of the USCIS website at: www.uscis.gov/forms. Evidence When filing an initial TPS application, you must submit: Identity and Nationality Evidence : to demonstrate your identity and that you are a national of a country designated for TPS (or that you have no nationality and you last habitually resided in a country designated for TPS).

: to demonstrate your identity and that you are a national of a country designated for TPS (or that you have no nationality and you last habitually resided in a country designated for TPS). Date of Entry Evidence : to demonstrate when you entered the United States.

: to demonstrate when you entered the United States. Continuous Residence (CR) Evidence: to demonstrate that you have been in the United States since the CR date specified for your country (see your country’s TPS web page to the left). Any document that is not in English must be accompanied by a complete English translation. The translator must certify that: He or she is competent both in English and the foreign language used in the original document; and

The translation is true and correct to the best of his or her ability, knowledge, and belief. Identity and Nationality Evidence

We encourage you to submit primary evidence (see below), if available. If USCIS does not find the document(s) you submit with your application to be sufficient, we will send you a request for additional evidence. If you cannot submit primary evidence of your identity and nationality, you may submit the secondary evidence listed below with your application. The following table explains the different types of evidence you can provide. Primary Evidence A copy of your passport;

A copy of your birth certificate, accompanied by photo identification; and/or

Any national identity document bearing your photograph and/or fingerprint issued by your country, including documents issued by your country’s Embassy or Consulate in the United States, such as a national ID card or naturalization certificate. No Primary Evidence If you do not have any of the primary evidence listed above, you must submit an affidavit with: Proof of your unsuccessful efforts to obtain such documents; and

An explanation why the consular process for your country was unavailable to you, and affirming that you are a national of your country. USCIS may interview you regarding your identity and nationality, and you may also submit additional evidence of your nationality and identity then, if available. Secondary Evidence Nationality documentation, such as a naturalization certificate, even if it does not have your photograph and fingerprint;

Your baptismal certificate if it indicates your nationality or a parent’s nationality;

Copies of your school or medical records if they have information supporting your claim that you are a national from a country designated for TPS;

Copies of other immigration documents showing your nationality and identity; or

The person making the affidavit should include information about how he or she knows you or is related to you, and how he or she knows the details of the date and place of your birth and the nationality of your parents. The nationality of your parents is important if you are from a country where nationality is derived from a parent. You may also provide any other document or information that you believe helps prove your nationality. PLEASE NOTE: Birth in a TPS-designated country does not always mean you are a national of that country. Please see your TPS-designated country’s nationality laws for further information. Date of Entry Evidence A copy of your passport;

I-94 Arrival/Departure Record; or

Copies of documents specified in the “Continuous Residence (CR) Evidence” section below. Continuous Residence (CR) Evidence Employment records;

Rent receipts, utility bills, receipts or letters from companies;

School records from the schools that you or your children have attended in the U.S.;

Hospital or medical records concerning treatment or hospitalization of you or your children; or

Attestations by church, union or other organization officials who know you and where you have been residing. Please see Form I-821 instructions for more details on acceptable evidence. Fees There is a fee for Form I-821 if you are registering for TPS for the first time. There is no fee for Form I-821 if you are re-registering for TPS. Other related fees, such as the biometrics services fee, vary for initial registrations and re-registrations depending on: Your age;

If you want an EAD; and

If you need to request a waiver of grounds of inadmissibility. Please review the form instructions carefully before applying. Read the Filing Fee and Special Instructions sections on the Form I-821 web page. These sections explain what fees to pay. Refer to the chart under Special Instructions for fee information. If you do not pay the proper fees (or submit a proper fee waiver request), your application will be rejected. Fee Waiver If you cannot afford the costs associated with the TPS filing, please make sure to include a fee waiver request on Form I-912, Application for Fee Waiver (or other written request). For more information about filing a fee waiver request, visit the webpages on Form I-912 and on Additional Information on Filing a Fee Waiver. If you are filing an initial application and USCIS denies your fee waiver request, you may re-file and pay the correct fees either before the registration deadline or within 45 days of the date on the fee waiver denial notice, whichever is later. If you are filing a re-registration application and USCIS denies your fee waiver request on or before the re-registration deadline, we recommend that you re-file and pay the correct fees before the re-registration deadline . If you are unable to file before the re-registration deadline, you may still re-file after the deadline and this will be reviewed under good cause for late re-registration.

When and Where to File

For information about when and where you must file your TPS application, please see the country specific pages to the left.

Application Process

Step 1: File Your Petition

Once you have prepared your TPS package with the forms, evidence and filing fees (or request for a fee waiver), you will need to send it to the address indicated on your TPS country page to the left. Please make sure you sign your application and include the correct fee amount (or fee waiver request). These are the two of the most common mistakes USCIS receives on TPS applications. Please look above at the fee chart to see what fees you must pay (a properly documented fee waiver request may be submitted). If you do not pay the proper fees (or submit a proper fee waiver request), your application will be rejected. Step 2: USCIS Receives Your Application

When USCIS receives your application, we will review it for completeness and for the proper fees or a properly documented fee waiver request. If your case meets the basic acceptance criteria, your application will be entered into our system and we will send you a receipt notice. At the top of this notice you will find a receipt number which can be used to check the status of your case online. If you do not receive your receipt notice within three weeks of filing, you can call the USCIS Contact Center at 1-800-375-5283 to request assistance. If your application is rejected at the initial review stage, you may re-file within the registration period after correcting the problems described in the USCIS notification. If your application was rejected because we determined you were not eligible for a fee waiver, you may submit a new TPS package. Go to the ‘Fee Waiver’ section above for more information. Step 3: USCIS Contacts You

If USCIS needs to collect your photograph, signature, and/or fingerprints (these are called biometrics), USCIS will send you an appointment notice to have your biometrics captured at an Application Support Center (ASC). Every TPS applicant over 14 years old must have their biometrics collected. Biometrics are required for identity verification, background checks and the production of an EAD, if one has been requested. In certain situations, such as when it’s impossible to take a fingerprint, USCIS can waive the collection of biometrics. In some cases, we may be able to reuse the biometrics previously collected in association with your previous TPS application. Even if you do not need to attend an ASC appointment, you still need to pay the biometrics fee (if required) to help cover costs associated with reusing your biometrics. Step 4: Go to the ASC

When you report to an ASC, you must bring: Evidence of nationality and identity with a photograph of you, such as a passport Your receipt notice Your ASC appointment notice Your current EAD, if you already have one If you cannot make your scheduled appointment, you may reschedule. To reschedule an ASC appointment, make a copy of your appointment notice to retain for your records, then mail the original notice with your rescheduling request to the ASC address listed on the notice. You should submit your request for rescheduling as soon as you know you have an unavoidable conflict on your scheduled ASC date. A new appointment notice will be sent to you by mail. Please note that rescheduling a biometrics appointment may cause the adjudication of your application to be delayed. If you need an accommodation due to a disability that affects your ability to go to the ASC, please go to the Disability Accommodations for the Public webpage for more information. WARNING: If you fail to appear for your ASC appointment without rescheduling, or if you repeatedly miss scheduled ASC appointments, your TPS application could be denied for abandonment. If there is an emergency need for you to travel abroad for humanitarian reasons, you may request expedited processing on your advance parole application (Form I-131) after you have appeared at an ASC for your biometrics appointment. Please see the travel section below for more information. Step 5: USCIS Determines Work Eligibility

If you are not seeking an employment authorization document (EAD), skip to Step 6. If you are... Then... Applying for TPS for the first time and seeking an EAD USCIS will review your case to determine whether you are eligible to work before we make a final decision on your TPS application. If you are found to be eligible upon initial review of your TPS application (prima facie eligible) you will receive an EAD. Note: If your application is denied and you choose to appeal to the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) or request review of your application by an immigration judge, your EAD will be extended while you are waiting for a decision. If your EAD expires, to request an extension of your EAD, you must file a Form I-765 along with evidence of your appeal to the AAO or that you have requested an immigration judge to review your TPS application. Re-Registering for TPS and seeking an EAD You will receive your new EAD when your entire TPS package is adjudicated. USCIS makes every effort to avoid backlogs at this step, but we urge you to remember that USCIS may experience a higher volume of applications in the first few months of a registration period. Step 6: USCIS Adjudicates the Application

During this phase, we may ask you for additional documents to establish your eligibility for TPS. If you receive a request for evidence (RFE) or a notice of intent to deny, it is extremely important that you respond immediately to avoid processing delays and possible denial for failure to timely respond. Upon completion of your case, USCIS will notify you if your request for TPS is granted or denied. If one of the waivable grounds of inadmissibility applies to you, USCIS will give you an opportunity to submit a Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility if you did not include this with your TPS package. Please submit this form within the time frame specified in the USCIS notice, or your case will be denied. Step 7: USCIS Approves or Denies the Application If your application for TPS is… Then… Approved and you filed an initial application USCIS will send you an approval notice and an EAD, if you requested one and haven’t received it before this step. Approved and you filed a re-registration application USCIS will send you an approval notice if you do not request an EAD.

USCIS will send you a new EAD if you do request one. Denied USCIS will send you a letter indicating the reason for your denial and, if applicable, provide you with the opportunity to appeal the denial.

Maintaining TPS

Once you are granted TPS, you must re-register during each re-registration period to maintain TPS benefits. This applies to all TPS beneficiaries, including those who were initially granted by USCIS, an Immigration Judge, or the BIA. Follow the instructions above to apply for re-registration.

Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension

Sometimes DHS must issue a blanket automatic extension of the expiring EADs for TPS beneficiaries of a specific country in order to allow time for EADs with new validity dates to be issued. If your country’s EADs have been automatically extended, it will be indicated on your country specific pages to the left.

Filing Late

Late Re-Registration for TPS

USCIS may accept a late re-registration application if you have good cause for filing after the end of the re-registration period of your country. You must submit a letter that explains your reason for filing late with your re-registration application.

If you file your TPS re-registration application late, processing may be delayed and can lead to gaps in your work authorization. Late Initial Filing for TPS

You can apply for TPS for the first time during an extension of your country’s TPS designation period. If you qualify to file your initial TPS application late, you must still independently meet all the TPS eligibility requirements listed in the Eligibility section above. To qualify to file your initial TPS application late, you must meet at least one of the late initial filing conditions below: During either the initial registration period of your country’s designation or during any subsequent initial registration period if your country was re-designated you met one of the following conditions, and you register while the condition still exists or within a 60-day period immediately following the expiration or termination of such condition You were a nonimmigrant, were granted voluntary departure status, or any relief from removal You had an application for change of status, adjustment of status, asylum, voluntary departure, or any relief from removal which was pending or subject to further review or appeal You were a parolee or had a pending request for re-parole You are a spouse of an individual who is currently eligible for TPS

OR During either the initial registration period of your country’s designation or during any subsequent initial registration period if your country was re-designated you were a child of an individual who is currently eligible for TPS. There is no time limitation on filing if you meet this condition. So if your parent is currently eligible for TPS and you were his or her child (unmarried and under 21 years old) at any time during a TPS initial registration period for your country, you may still be eligible for late initial filing even if you are now over 21 years old or married. You may file during an extension of your TPS designated country. Please check your country-specific web page for the dates of the initial registration period or periods that apply for late initial filing. PLEASE NOTE: You cannot obtain TPS as a derivative because your parent or child has TPS.

Travel

If you have TPS and wish to travel outside the United States, you must apply for travel authorization. Travel authorization for TPS is issued as an advance parole document if USCIS determines it is appropriate to approve your request. This document gives you permission to leave the United States and return during a specified period of time. To apply for advance parole, you must file Form I-131, Application for Travel Document. If you are filing Form I-131 together with Form I-821, send your forms to the address listed on the linked page above for your country. If you are filing Form I-131 separately based on a pending or approved Form I-821, check the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-131 page. If you leave the United States without requesting advance parole, you may lose TPS and you may not be permitted to re-enter the United States. If USCIS is still adjudicating your TPS application, you may miss important USCIS notices, such as Requests for Additional Evidence, while you are outside the U.S. Failure to respond to these requests may result in the denial of your application. We encourage you to read and understand the travel warning on Form I-131 before requesting advance parole, even if you have been granted TPS. If you have been unlawfully present in the U.S. for any period of time, you may want to seek legal advice before requesting advance parole for travel.

Change of Address

If your address changes after you file your application, you must notify USCIS immediately. For information about how to notify USCIS go to www.uscis.gov/addresschange.

TPS Granted by an Immigration Judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals

Step 1: If an Immigration Judge (IJ) or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) granted you TPS, you must provide USCIS with proof of the TPS grant (such as a final order from the IJ or final decision from the BIA) when you file for your first TPS benefit (such as an EAD, travel authorization, or with your first TPS re-registration application filed with USCIS). You should also submit a copy of the I-821 TPS application that the IJ or the BIA approved. Step 2: See the table below for filing information based on the first TPS benefit you are requesting after an IJ or BIA granted you TPS. If the first TPS benefit you are requesting is... Then you must... And... Your first EAD, File Form I-765 only with required fee(s) or fee waiver request. You must also submit a cover sheet that states ""DO NOT REJECT - TPS GRANTED BY IJ/BIA.""

Appealing a Denial

If USCIS denies your application, you will be informed in the denial notice whether you have 30 days to appeal to the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office (AAO). If you do not have the right to appeal because you were placed in removal proceedings when your TPS application was denied by USCIS, you can request that the immigration judge adjudicate your TPS application. You may also choose to file a motion to reconsider with the Service Center that adjudicated your TPS application by submitting: Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion The correct filing fee, see form instructions (PDF, 257.7 KB) . Or Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver (or written request) if you are unable to pay If USCIS denies your TPS application, we recommend that you consult with an accredited legal representative to determine whether you should pursue an appeal or motion. If you have been placed in removal proceedings, you may request that the immigration judge adjudicate your TPS application. If an immigration judge denies your request for TPS, you may file an appeal with the BIA.

Other Immigration Options

You might be eligible for other immigration options listed on the Explore My Options page. To apply for a lawful permanent status (Green Card), you must be eligible under one of the categories listed on the Green Card Eligibility Categories page. Once you find the category that may fit your situation, click on the link provided to get information on eligibility requirements, how to apply, and whether your family members can also apply with you. Note on Seeking Asylum: Being granted and maintaining TPS status until a reasonable period before the filing of the asylum application is considered an extraordinary circumstance for the purposes of the one year filing deadline. In other words, having TPS status “stops the clock” on the requirement to file for asylum within one year of arriving in the United States, if the one-year clock has not already expired. See 8 CFR 208.4(a)(5)(iv).

Avoid Scams

Please be aware that some unauthorized practitioners may try to take advantage of you by claiming they can file TPS forms. These same individuals may ask that you pay them to file such forms. We want to ensure that all potential TPS applicants know how to obtain legitimate, accurate legal advice and assistance. A list of accredited representatives and free or low-cost legal providers is available on the USCIS website on the finding legal advice web page. We don’t want you to become a victim of an immigration scam. If you need legal advice on immigration matters, make sure the person helping you is authorized to give legal advice. Only an attorney or an accredited representative working for a Department of Justice (DOJ) recognized organization can give you legal advice.

4,fa7b1b0e-5d02-41f0-a714-8cfbe42a3b8a,[],,"An application for TPS must include the following forms, evidence and either appropriate fees or a fee waiver request.

Forms:

Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status: To register or re-register for TPS, file this form either through USCIS’ TPS webpage or the address listed in the Federal Register for that country (excluding Venezuela). Information on how to file can be found on each country’s page within USCIS’ TPS webpage navigation.

Important: TPS applicants from Burma, Somali, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen can now submit Form I-821 online.

Form I-765, Request for Employment Authorization (EAD): It’s not necessary to file form I-765 as part of the TPS application, and the form can be filed at any time while a person holds TPS.

While not necessary, Form I-765 at the same time as Form I-821 may, per the USCIS website, “may help you receive your EAD more promptly if you are eligible.”

Form I-601, Application for Waiver of the Grounds of Admissibility (only if applicable): If a person is considered inadmissible to the United States but wants a waiver on the grounds of that judgement, this form must be filed.

Supporting Documents:

The following must be submitted with the TPS application. In all cases, do not send the original documents, but a copy of that documentation.

Identity and Nationality Evidence: This proves nationality or habitual residence in a country which has a TPS designation. Primary evidence as defined below is the most favorable documentation to file. If USCIS does not find submitted evidence to be sufficient, it will issue a request for additional evidence. At that point, secondary evidence as defined below may be submitted.

Primary Evidence:

A copy of a passport;

A copy of a birth certificate, accompanied by photo identification; and/or

Any national identity document bearing a photograph and/or fingerprint issued by country of origin, including any documents issued by that country’s Embassy or Consulate in the United States, such as a national ID card or naturalization certificate.

If none of the primary evidence is available, an affidavit with the following may be submitted:

Proof of efforts to obtain such documents; and

An explanation about why the consular process was unavailable to you, and affirmation that of either nationality or habitual residence of a country with a TPS designation.

There may be an interview as part of the process; at that time, additional evidence may be submitted.

Secondary Evidence



Nationality documentation, such as a naturalization certificate, even if it does not have a photograph and fingerprint;

A baptismal certificate if it indicates nationality or in the case of a minor, a parent’s nationality;

Copies of school or medical records if they have information supporting a claim of nationality from a country designated for TPS;

Copies of other immigration documents showing nationality and identity; or

Affidavits from friends or family members who have close personal knowledge of the date and place of an applicant’s birth and their parents’ nationality. The affidavit should include information about how he or she knows or is related to the applicant, and how he or she knows their life details, such as of the date and place of birth and the nationality of the applicant’s parents. (The nationality of parents is important if an applicant is from a country where nationality is derived from a parent.)

Date of Entry Evidence: This documentation is pretty straightforward, and it proves when an applicant entered the United States. Acceptable evidence is:

A copy of a passport;

I-94 Arrival/Departure Record; or

Copies of documents specified in the “Continuous Residence (CR) Evidence” as defined below.

Continuous Residence (CR) Evidence: This documentation shows an applicant was residing in the United States at the time their country of origin was granted TPS. Evidence of this includes, but is not limited to the list below. A full list can be found on the Form I-821 instructions.

Employment records;

Rent receipts, utility bills, receipts or letters from companies;

School records from the schools that an applicant or their children have attended in the U.S.;

Hospital or medical records concerning treatment or hospitalization of you or your children; or

Attestations by church, union or other organization officials who know the applicant.

Fees: If registering for TPS for the first time, there are a series of fees involved. If re-registering, there is no fee for form I-821. Fees can be paid with a money order, personal check, or cashier’s check, payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Credit cards, using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions, are accepted at USCIS Lockbox facilities. Included in filing for registration or re-registration of TPS is a fee for biometrics. This is a separate appointment USCIS makes with an applicant.

For form I-821, the fee varies depending on several factors. A chart of the fee structures can be found here and includes additional costs for form I-765.

The fee for I-601 is $930.

Those unable to pay fees can submit a fee waiver request, via Form I-912, Application for Fee Waiver (or other written request). For more information, visit Additional Information on Filing a Fee Waiver.

If an applicant’s fee waiver request is denied, they may re-file and pay the correct fees either before the registration deadline or within 45 days of the date on the fee waiver denial notice, whichever is later.",https://www.boundless.com/immigration-resources/temporary-protected-status/
5,fa7b1b0e-5d02-41f0-a714-8cfbe42a3b8a,[],,"If your business employs non-citizens whose authorization to work is based on Temporary Protected Status (TPS), you should learn to deal with what happens when their Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) will expire.

If your business employs non-citizens whose authorization to work is based on what's known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), you face a challenge. At some point, your TPS beneficiary workers' Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) will expire.

Yet the expiration date on the card itself can be misleading. In certain circumstances, a worker's TPS status may be extended without him or her receiving a new EAD. This article will explain why, and guide you in checking on your worker's possible ongoing TPS status and right to work.

The Work Permit Is Tied to the Worker's TPS Status

When certain emergencies arise in another country, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can designate that country's citizens, if they are already present in the United States, as eligible for TPS. TPS is a temporary designation that allows its beneficiaries to live and work in the U.S. for the duration of the emergency without fear of being placed into removal proceedings for overstaying a visa. For more information on TPS status, visit Temporary Protected Status (TPS): Who Is Eligible?

Depending on whether or not conditions in the country designated as eligible for TPS have improved since the original designation, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security can either remove the TPS designation or extend it for citizens already living in the U.S. as TPS beneficiaries. If conditions are still unsafe in the country, then beneficiaries of the TPS may receive an extension of six, 12, or 18 months. The citizens of some countries with TPS status have received multiple such extensions.

TPS Status and the Work Permit May Be Automatically Extended

Notice of an extension of TPS designation for a country is provided in the Federal Register, which is basically a daily newspaper of the federal government. When the Register announces an extension of a TPS-designated country, it will also explain all the details required to renew TPS, and how it will impact an employee's right to continue working.

You can access the register at www.federalregister.gov, and search updated TPS information about the designated country, or also check the Temporary Protected Status page of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website for any updated deadlines and dates of possible re-extension.

Make sure to maintain a system of tracking expiration dates for your employee's work authorization. There are a variety of software programs that can make the process more efficient. Find a process that works for you and make sure to follow the guidelines set forth by USCIS Handbook for Employers.

If TPS Is Automatically Extended, the Work Permit Continues to Be Valid

When TPS is extended for a country, a new renewal period opens to allow TPS beneficiaries to apply to renew TPS and their work permit. (Of course, each beneficiary must still meet all the basic TPS eligibility criteria).

DHS understands that many TPS beneficiaries cannot renew their TPS in time to receive a new EAD before their current EAD expires. Because of the potential of having an expired work permit, DHS will often automatically extend the current EAD for a set period of time (usually six months) to allow beneficiaries to receive a new EAD.

If TPS is automatically extended, the expired EAD card and a copy of the Federal Register notice is all that an employee needs as proof to legally continue working until the extension period ends. If an employee has dealt with TPS for a while, it is possible that the employee will approach you with the Register notice and information about any changes.

Because the TPS renewal process can be complex, it is likely that your employee will not come with information, but will ask you for advice on what options are available. Remember, the Register notice contains information explaining how you can document the new information on the employee's I-9 form throughout the TPS renewal process.

If your employee's TPS-designated country is found to no longer meet the requirements, once the EAD expires, the employee will no longer have authorization to work under TPS. Notice of any changes to TPS will always be provided to the employee, and can be accessed by you on the Register. The Register will walk you through what steps are required of you as an employer in this situation.",https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/why-employees-with-tps-might-legally-work-past-expiration-date-work-permit.html

8,fa7b1b0e-5d02-41f0-a714-8cfbe42a3b8a,"['Ariana Figueroa', 'More From Author', '- March']",2022-03-05 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is granting temporary protected status to shield Ukrainian nationals living in the United States from deportation, following pressure from members of Congress.

“Russia’s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “In these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States.”

Ukrainians living in the U.S. as of March 1 of this year will be eligible for TPS designation of up to 18 months; it will not apply to Ukrainians arriving after March 1. The designation will allow those in the program to be protected from deportation, as well as apply for work permits.

Our advocacy worked: yesterday, @DHSgov said they would grant Temporary Protected Status to Ukrainians living in the US – meaning they can’t be deported back to a war-torn country. This was the right move. — Mark Warner (@MarkWarner) March 4, 2022

The Center for Migration Studies in New York estimates that there are about 28,000 Ukrainians in the U.S. that would benefit from the program.

Some states with the highest populations of Ukrainians without permanent status include Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida and New Jersey.

TPS does not grant permanent U.S. status and only applies to those already in the country, not those who are fleeing. One million people have left Ukraine, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency.

U.S. House lawmakers are also pushing the Biden administration to immediately designate Student Special Relief for Ukrainians.

A letter, led by Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat, and signed by 98 members urged the president to extend both TPS and the student program for 18 months because “given the already unmet humanitarian need in the country and the effects of the armed conflict with Russia, the Ukrainian government is in no state to receive TPS and SSR eligible Ukrainians.”

SSR would allow for the temporary suspension of certain requirements put in place by DHS for a foreign student studying in the U.S. “from parts of the world that are experiencing emergent circumstances.” Some of those requirements include “duration of status, full course of study and off-campus employment eligibility.”

Russia began its invasion into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Ukraine’s health ministry reported that at least 250 civilians have been killed in the attack.

Members of Congress praised the Biden administration for the TPS designation for Ukrainians.

Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement that the TPS designation was the right thing to do “after a week of Vladimir Putin’s illegal and ruthless war against the people of Ukraine.”

“Temporary Protected Status was created by Congress for exactly this purpose — to protect people whose home countries have experienced armed conflict, an environmental disaster, or extraordinary conditions that prevent people from safely returning home,” he said.

The White House is also asking Congress to approve $10 billion in aid for Ukraine to help bolster soldiers in neighboring countries around Ukraine and to send military equipment to the country. The Biden administration has announced it would place sanctions on Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and the country as well.

Some legal groups agreed with the TPS designation, but criticized DHS for its backlog of TPS designation for Black-majority countries.

Lisa Parisio, the Director of Advocacy at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, said in a statement that the Biden administration should also use TPS for “Ethiopia, Cameroon, Mauritania and other countries whose nationals face grave danger if they are forced to return.”

“The backlog of TPS designations for Black-majority countries here in the U.S. mirrors the anti-Blackness we’re seeing as African students and others in Ukraine are denied access to escape the conflict,” she said.

CLINIC, along with nearly 200 organizations, petitioned for the Biden administration to allow Ukrainians in the U.S. to use TPS.

In a letter to the White House, a bipartisan group of 42 senators advocated for the TPS designation, arguing that “it is obviously too dangerous for Ukrainian nationals to return to Ukraine due to the ongoing armed conflict.”

Senators who led the letter include Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee; Menendez; and Ohio Republican Rob Portman, top GOP member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

“Forcing Ukrainian nationals to return to Ukraine in the midst of a war would be inconsistent with America’s values and our national security interests,” they wrote. “As a nation, we must do our part to protect the safety of Ukrainians in the United States by designating Ukraine for TPS.”

Other senators who signed the letter include Democrats Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith of Minnesota, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Michael Bennett and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.",https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/05/white-house-allows-ukrainian-nationals-to-stay-in-the-u-s-without-fear-of-deportation/

Canada announced similar relief on Thursday, as did the European Union, which said it would offer three years of protection for Ukrainian refugees.The United Nations predicted that 10 million Ukrainians, about a quarter of the country’s population, could be displaced by the Russian invasion. Already, a million people have fled the country as refugees.

Lawmakers and advocacy groups have been calling for the relief, known as temporary protected status. Some have estimated that 28,000 to 30,000 Ukrainians could be eligible for it; the designation gives them permission to stay and work in the United States for 18 months. Often, temporary protected status is extended. In this case, it will not apply to any Ukrainians who entered the country after March 1.
