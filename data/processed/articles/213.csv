‘Never give up’

Speaking to journalists after this evening's Council meeting, Secretary-General António Guterres, stressed that while the United Nations had today not achieved its primary objective to end war, “we must never give up.”

“We must give peace another chance. Soldiers need to return to their barracks. Leaders need to turn to the path of dialogue and peace,” he said.

And despite growing operational challenges, he assured that the UN is scaling up the delivery of life-saving support on both sides of the line of contact.

Dedicated UN coordinator

Against the backdrop of multiplying humanitarian needs, dying civilians and at least 100,000 Ukrainians reportedly fleeing their homes – with many crossing into neighbouring countries, underlining the regional nature of this growing crisis – Mr. Guterres announced the appointment of Amin Awad as UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine.

A close colleague of Mr. Guterres when he was chief of the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, Mr. Awad will lead the coordination of all UN efforts, including its humanitarian response, on both sides of the contact line.

“All concerned in this conflict must respect international humanitarian law and guarantee the safety and freedom of movement of UN staff and other humanitarians. Especially in a moment like this, it is important to remember that the UN…is tens of thousands of women and men around the world,” he said.

Overcoming challenges

The top UN official outlined the work of the Organization, from feeding the hungry, vaccinating children and promoting development to protecting civilians in peacekeeping operations, mediating conflicts and supporting refugees and migrants, all while “standing, delivering, extending a lifeline of hope.’”

He stressed that although the UN Charter has been challenged in the past, it has “stood firm on the side of peace, security, development, justice, international law and human rights”.

“Time after time, when the international community has rallied together in solidarity, those values have prevailed. They will prevail, independently of what happened today,” the UN chief said.

“We must do everything in our power so that they prevail in Ukraine but they prevail for all humanity,” concluded the Secretary-General.

A ‘principled stand’

Introducing the draft resolution, which her country had helped craft, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield painted a picture of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that was “so bold, so brazen,” that it threatens the international system “as we know it.”

""We have a solemn responsibility not to look away,"" she said stressing that Russia must be held accountable, and its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally withdrawn.

“Today we are taking a principled stand in this Council,” Ms. Thomas-Greenfield said. “There is no middle ground,” responsible States do not invade their neighbours.

Can't veto accountability

After the text was defeated, Ms. Thomas-Greenfield took the floor again.

“You can veto this resolution, but you cannot veto our voices; You cannot veto the truth; You cannot veto our principles; You cannot veto the Ukrainian people; cannot veto the UN Charter…and you will not veto accountability,” she underscored.

The US Ambassador said that despite the actions of a ""reckless, irresponsible"" Member State, the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine against Russia’s aggression.

‘Naked aggression’

UK Ambassador Dame Barbara Woodward described how women and children in Kyiv, pensioners in Odessa and people all over Ukraine are “sheltering from Russia’s onslaught.”

She stated that the draft resolution sent ""a message to the world that the rules we built together must be defended, because otherwise, who will be next.”

Moreover, President Vladimir Putin’s “massive invasion"" of Ukraine to remove the Government is ""a naked aggression” that must be condemned, Ms. Woodward added.

After the vote, the UK Ambassador pointed out that Russia was the only Council Member to vote against the draft.

“Make no mistake, Russia is isolated, it has no support for the invasion of Ukraine,” she said, noting that history would record what had happened today, and that the United Kingdom “stands firmly in support” of the Ukrainian people and would hold Russia accountable for its actions.

A veto against international law

After voting in favour of the resolution, France’s Ambassador, Nicolas de Rivière, said that Russia’s “premediated aggression” is killing civilians and destroying infrastructure with goal of rebuilding the Russian empire.

While other members expressed their commitment to international law, Russia vetoed it.

“Russia is alone,” he observed, adding that “within the UN and in all bodies, France will continue to mobilize with its partners to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.”

Abstentions

Indian Ambassador T. S. Tirumurti, who abstained, said that “dialogue is the only path forward,” no matter how daunting it might seem, and urged the Council to restore the difficult path forward.

Also abstaining, UAE Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh said that now that the resolution has been vetoed, the United Arab Emirates would continue to seek “inclusive and consultative processes” for a path forward.

Not an outpost

Meanwhile, as the only Permanent Council member to abstain, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun warned against actions that might “shut the door” to a negotiated settlement. He reminded that the Ukraine crisis did not occur “overnight” and that the security of one State cannot come at the expense of that of others.

“Ukraine should become a bridge between East and West, not an outpost,” he said, adding that that cold war mentalities must be abandoned to build balanced European mechanisms and all parties should return to diplomacy.

‘Ukrainian chessboard’

Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya said that he would not respond to those who had accused him of abusing his country's veto power.

He accused the draft’s sponsors of “spinning tales” about the true situation in Ukraine, including Western allies’ attempts to cover up the fact that they had been flooding the Donbas with weapons.

“You have made Ukraine a pawn in your own game… this resolution is nothing other than yet another brutal, inhumane move on this Ukrainian chessboard,” he said.

Indeed, the situation is being exploited by political and media outlets, he said, citing examples of the “height of propaganda”, including the misuse of images from Donbas to portray what was being referred to as Russian aggression.""

Speaking to the representatives of France, the UK and US, he said that there was no verifiable confirmation about the death of Ukrainian civilians; that photographs of supposed Russian artillery “is fake”; and that reports of attacks on civilian infrastructure were untrue.

Moreover, with its history of aggressions against other countries, the United States was “in no position to moralize.”

‘A seat in Hell’

Ukraine Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya asserted that he would not dignify the “diabolical script” read by the Russian Ambassador, which was in fact “a rather detailed application for... a seat in Hell.”

He recalled that during the Security Council's discussions on the situation in Ukraine earlier in the week, Russia had begun bombing his country and sending forces across the border, including through Belarus.

Therefore, he was not surprised that Russia voted against the text, he said, denouncing the actions of “the Kremlin regime.”

Mr. Kyslytsya asked the Council to remember how many times the Russian Ambassador said that his country would not invade or bomb Ukraine. But after what had happened in recent days, “how can we trust you? You have no idea what is in the mind of your President,” he declared.

The Ukraine Ambassador also noted that according to the rules of procedure, the Russian Ambassador should not have been presiding over a meeting of which his country was the subject.

Silent moment for peace

The Ukraine Ambassador asked the Council to dedicate a moment of silence “for peace… and to pray for the souls of those that have already been or may be killed”, inviting the Russian Ambassador to “pray for salvation.”

This was followed by solemn applause throughout the Chamber.

Noting that nothing could justify the bombing of hospitals and kindergartens –considered war crimes under the Rome Statute – he said that Ukraine was collecting evidence to send forward to the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Sever ties

Finally, Mr. Kyslytsya called on nations to break off diplomatic relations with the Russian Federation, and international organizations to sever ties with that country.

“You should stop wiping your feet” on the words of the Secretary-General and the work of the UN, and “show respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter,” he said.

In closing, the Ambassador maintained that while Ukraine remained open to negotiations, it was Russia that had launched an offensive that had sent “thousands of troops” into its territory.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/02/1112802

Russia on Friday vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution denouncing its invasion of Ukraine while China, India, and the United Arab Emirates abstained from the vote.

The remaining 11 council members voted in favor, allowing the draft resolution to be taken up by the 193-member UN General Assembly.

""You can veto this resolution but you cannot veto our voices,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas Greenfield told her Russian counterpart and the council.

She continued: ""You cannot veto the truth. You cannot veto our principles. You cannot veto the Ukrainian people. You cannot veto the UN charter.""

The U.S. helped draft the non-binding resolution and sought a vote to put members of the council on the record. The overwhelming rejection of Russian President Vladimir Putin's attack on its neighbor – a sovereign democracy – is another move by Western countries and their allies to further politically isolate Russia.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres later announced the appointment of Amin Awad of Sudan as assistant secretary-general to serve as the UN's crisis coordinator for Ukraine.

Awad was previously the UN's regional refugee coordinator for the Syria and Iraq Situations, and director of the Middle East and North Africa Bureau at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.",https://www.npr.org/2022/02/25/1083252456/russia-vetoes-un-security-council-resolution-that-denounces-its-invasion-of-ukra

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

The fighting in Ukraine has reached the capital. In a moment, we'll speak with a Ukrainian journalist about what he sees in Kyiv. And last night, Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that called on it to withdraw from Ukraine. NPR's Michele Kelemen has been following what led up to the vote. Michele, thanks very much.

MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott.

SIMON: What was the point of introducing the resolution and having the vote if everybody knew it would only be vetoed by Russia?

KELEMEN: Yeah, I mean, Russia's not only a veto holder. It also has the presidency of the Security Council this month, so it's a very odd scene to watch the Russian ambassador presiding over a meeting like that. But the U.S. wanted to bring up this vote to force countries to go on the record. Take a listen to what the U.S. ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, had to say before the vote.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD: To those who say all parties are culpable, I say that is a clear copout. Russia is the aggressor here. There is no middle ground.

KELEMEN: And, you know, Scott, that was a message to countries like China, which talks a lot about upholding sovereignty and the U.N. charter but has been growing close to Russia. It tried to walk a fine line and abstained in the vote, as did India and the United Arab Emirates. But the 11 other Security Council members voted for the resolution. Only Russia voted no.

SIMON: Of course, Michele, the vote comes just days after the U.N. Security Council had a meeting to try to promote diplomacy just as President Putin announced the start of the invasion. I wonder what kind of response diplomats have had to that.

KELEMEN: Yeah. You know, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres called that night the saddest moment of his tenure, and he was equally somber yesterday after Russia vetoed that resolution. Take a listen.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ANTONIO GUTERRES: The United Nations was born out of war to end war. Today, that objective was not achieved.

KELEMEN: He said the U.N. is, you know, not just the Security Council chamber. It's also aid workers all over the world who are now ramping up in Ukraine. Guterres announced a crisis coordinator for Ukraine. That's Amin Awad of Sudan. He's someone who's worked on refugees issues for a long time, and the U.N. is really worried that this conflict is going to create a new refugee crisis in Europe.

And there's another concern. About 50% of the World Food Program's wheat supplies come from Ukraine. And so if the war disrupts that, it could have a knock-on effect in other crises around the world in places like Yemen or Afghanistan.

SIMON: Michele, is there any current prospect for diplomacy on Ukraine?

KELEMEN: Well, you know, Russia and Ukraine both say they're open for a dialogue, but it's really hard to see what they're going to talk about. Russian President Vladimir Putin seems intent on regime change in Ukraine. He's described the Ukrainian government as drug addicts and Nazis, even though Ukraine's president is actually Jewish. And at the Security Council yesterday, you mostly had ambassadors hurling insults at each other. Russia's ambassador dismissed all the reports of Russian attacks that have killed civilians as fake news. Ukraine's ambassador said that Russians have no credibility and shouldn't even be presiding over the Security Council.

SIMON: NPR's Michele Kelemen, thanks so much.

KELEMEN: Thank you.

3,f9574b6a-14d7-41cc-b361-81f4d0d31e0b,"['Edith M. Lederer', 'Associated Press', 'Jennifer Peltz']",2022-02-25 15:51:26-04:00,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution on Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops, a defeat the United States and its supporters knew was inevitable but said would highlight Russia’s global isolation.

Watch the event in the player above.

The vote was 11 in favor, with Russia voting no and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining, which showed significant but not total opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of his country’s smaller and militarily weaker neighbor.

The resolution’s failure paves the way for supporters to call for a quick vote on a similar resolution in the 193-member U.N. General Assembly, where there are no vetoes. There was no immediate word on a timetable for an assembly vote.

The vote was delayed for two hours the United States and Albania, which co-sponsored the resolution, and their supporters scrambled behind the scenes to get wavering nations to support the resolution. China’s decision to abstain, rather than use its veto alongside usual ally Russia, was seen as a diplomatic achievement.

“You can veto this resolution, but you cannot veto our voices,” U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas Greenfield told her Russian counterpart. “You cannot veto the truth. You cannot veto our principles. You cannot veto the Ukrainian people.”

Brazil’s Ambassador Ronaldo Costa Filho, whose country’s vote was initially in question but turned into a yes, said his government is “gravely concerned” about Russia’s military action. “A line has been crossed, and this council cannot remain silent,” he said.

In response, Russian U.N. Ambassador reiterated his country’s claims that it is standing up for people in eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the government for eight years. He accused the West of ignoring Ukrainian abuses there.

“You have made Ukraine a pawn in your geopolitical game, with no concern whatsoever about the interests of the Ukrainian people,” he said, calling the failed resolution “nothing other than yet another brutal, inhumane move in this Ukrainian chessboard.”

China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said all efforts must be made for a diplomatic solution and stressed that a response from the Security Council “should be taken with great caution rather than adding fuel to fire.” He warned that Western sanctions “may completely shut the door to a peaceful solution” and echoed Russian claims that it is being threatened by NATO’s expansion over the years.

“Russia’s legitimate security aspirations should be given attention and addressed properly,” Zhang said, and “Ukraine should become a bridge between east and west, not an outpost for confrontation among major powers.”

Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward called Russia’s claim that it was acting in self-defense “absurd.”

“Russia’s only act of self-defense is the vote they have cast against this resolution today,” she said.

The resolution’s supporters had agreed to weaken the text to get additional support. They eliminated putting the resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which can be enforced militarily, and a determination “that the situation in Ukraine constitutes a breach of international peace and security, and that the Russian Federation has committed acts of aggression against Ukraine.”

They also changed “condemns” to “deplores” in sections about Russia’s actions.

In the draft that was put to a vote, the council would have deplored Russia’s “aggression” against Ukraine “in the strongest terms” and demanded an immediate halt to its use of force and the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders.

It would have deplored Russia’s Feb. 21 decision declaring areas of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions independent and would have ordered Russia to “immediately and unconditionally reverse the decision.” And it would have reaffirmed the council’s commitment “to the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.

In a show of support before the meeting, representatives of the 27 nations belonging to the European Union stood outside the Security Council chamber behind Ukraine’s blue and yellow flag with Ukraine’s U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya.

The Security Council resolution would have been legally binding. General Assembly resolutions aren’t legally binding but serve as a reflection of world opinion.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-live-united-nations-security-council-holds-meeting-as-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-continues
