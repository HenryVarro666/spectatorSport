CNN —

Russian troops have occupied Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant, with managers working at “gunpoint” after a fire caused by their attack was extinguished, according to Ukrainian nuclear officials.

Countries around the world swiftly condemned the episode, with the United States embassy in Ukraine warning an attack on a nuclear plant was a “war crime” and the United Nations Security Council convening an emergency meeting.

In a statement Friday morning local time, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate (SNRI) confirmed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine was occupied by Russian military forces, but said officials remained in contact with plant management.

The power plant’s six reactors remained intact, though the compartment auxiliary buildings for reactor unit 1 had been damaged, the SNRI said in its statement. Four of the remaining units were being cooled down while one unit is providing power, the statement said.

Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine’s nuclear power operator Energoatom, later reported that management were operating at “gunpoint.” He said on Telegram that Russian forces “entered the territory of the nuclear power plant, took control of the personnel and management of the nuclear power plant.”

“Today there is no connection, the station management works at invaders’ gunpoint,” Kotin continued.

“As for the staff, they were admitted in the morning to perform their duties. We do not currently have a direct connection to the station. We get information from the sources at the station.”

Kotin warned that although the reactors are safe, further attacks could lead to “disaster.”

Ukraine’s State Emergency Services (SES) had earlier confirmed several dozen firefighters had extinguished a blaze that had started in a training building outside the main reactor complex, following shelling from Russian military forces.

Reports of the fire raised concern from world leaders and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) – who called for a stop to fighting around the facility – though the IAEA said Ukrainian authorities had reported background radiation levels were normal and the fire had not affected “essential” equipment.

However the ongoing military operation around the site meant the situation was “very fragile,” IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi warned.

Speaking at a press conference in Vienna on Friday, the IAEA’s Rossi said the safety of the reactors had not been affected.

“We are fortunate there has not been a release of radioactive material and the integrity of the reactors has not been compromised,” he said. However, the operator and regulator have relayed to the IAEA that the situation on the ground is “extremely tense and challenging,” he warned.

He explained that a Russian projectile had hit a building within the site, causing a localized fire, but none of the reactors were affected and radiation monitoring systems are fully functional.

Ukrainian staff are still at the helm of operations at the plant, but “effective control” of the site was in the hands of Russian forces, Grossi said, adding: “I hope the distinction is clear.” He said that what happens next at Zaporizhzhia is “a situation that is very difficult to sustain, very fragile” while there is an active military operation and Russian forces in control. “This is unprecedented,” he said. “Completely uncharted waters.”

Grossi later told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour that although radioactive material was not released, it was a “close call.”

He told Amanpour that he had warned both sides that “the utmost restraint is to be exercised in and around this type of facility. Because wittingly or unwittingly, you can very quickly go into a disaster, and this is why we’re so concerned.”

The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the meeting that the world “narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night.”

She called Russia’s reactions “reckless” and “dangerous,” saying it put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk and threatened the safety of civilians in Russia, in the UK and across the European continent. Russian forces were also 20 miles away from Ukraine’s second largest nuclear facility, she noted.

“Nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Mr Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now.”

Zelensky pushes for no-fly zone

On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of committing a “terror attack” by intentionally firing at the power plant – potentially risking the lives of millions.

He later condemned NATO’s decision to rule out the implementation of a no-fly zone over the country.

NATO’s chief said Friday that a no-fly zone over Ukraine is not an option being considered by the alliance. “We’ve agreed that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory,” Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a press conference earlier in Brussels.

In a Facebook post, Zelensky questioned what the alliance’s members were thinking, saying, “All the people who will die from this day will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your disunity.” However, he also expressed his gratitude to NATO countries that have shown support for Ukraine.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the establishment of a no-fly zone in Ukraine by the US and it’s NATO allies could lead to a “full-fledged war in Europe,” but said Washington would continue to work with it’s allies to provide Ukrainians with the means to defend themselves from Russian aggression.

Nuclear plant under attack

Reports of the attack on the facility emerged early Friday morning, with video of the scene showing bursts of gunfire apparently directed at the Zaporizhzhia facility before dawn.

Flames could also be seen on video footage, though for some time it was unclear where the fire was or the scale of the threat posed to the facility.

Ukrainian authorities released video later on Friday from inside the facility’s control room, with an announcement ringing out on a PA system aimed at the Russian forces outside.

“Stop shooting at a nuclear dangerous facility. Stop shooting immediately! You threaten the security of the whole world!” the announcement says.

The Russian government has claimed Ukrainian “provocation” led to a firefight around the nuclear power plant.

In a video briefing, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces took the city of Enerhodar, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and the territory adjacent to it on February 28. Konashenkov claimed the plant’s technical staff continued regular work on the facilities, but that Ukrainian forces attempted a “monstrous provocation” in the early hours of Friday. Konashenkov also claimed the Ukrainians had set fire to the training building themselves.

CNN could not immediately verify any details of the firefight on the territory of the plant.

The Russian government has routinely and without evidence claimed the Ukrainian government is staging “provocations” to provoke a military response by Western governments.

It’s the not first nuclear plant to come under threat from the Russian invasion. On the first day of the assault, Russian forces seized control of the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine, the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, according to Ukrainian officials.

The Chernobyl nuclear power plant reactor exploded in 1986, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union – sparking a disaster that affected, directly or indirectly, nine million people, due to radioactive materials released into the atmosphere.

The IAEA said in a statement that Ukraine had informed it staff held at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant since Russian military forces took control of the site a week ago were facing “psychological pressure and moral exhaustion.”",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-fire-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html

KYIV, Ukraine — Russian troops Friday seized the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe after a middle-of-the-night attack that set it on fire and briefly raised worldwide fears of a catastrophe in the most chilling turn yet in Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Firefighters put out the blaze, and no radiation was released, U.N. and Ukrainian officials said, as Russian forces pressed on with their week-old offensive on multiple fronts and the number of refugees fleeing the country eclipsed 1.2 million.

With world condemnation mounting, the Kremlin cracked down on the flow of information at home, blocking Facebook, Twitter, the BBC and the U.S. government-funded Voice of America. And President Vladimir Putin signed a law making it a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison to spread so-called fake news, including anything that goes against the official government line on the war.

Multiple outlets said they would pause their work inside Russia while they evaluate the situation. CNN and CBS News announced they would stop broadcasting in Russia and Bloomberg temporarily suspended the work of its journalists there.

While the vast Russian armored column threatening Kyiv remained stalled outside the capital, Putin’s military has launched hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites around the country, and made significant gains on the ground in the south in an apparent bid to cut off Ukraine's access to the sea.

In the atttack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in the southeastern city of Enerhodar, the chief of the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said a Russian “projectile” hit a training center, not any of the six reactors.

The attack triggered global alarm and fear of a catastrophe that could dwarf the world’s worst nuclear disaster, at Ukraine’s Chernobyl in 1986. In an emotional nighttime speech, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he feared an explosion that would be “the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe.”

But nuclear officials from Sweden to China said no radiation spikes had been reported, as did Grossi.

Authorities said that Russian troops had taken control of the overall site but that the plant staff continued to run it. Only one reactor was operating, running at 60% of capacity, Grossi said in the aftermath of the attack.

Two people were injured in the fire, Grossi said. Ukraine’s state nuclear plant operator Enerhoatom said three Ukrainian soldiers were killed and two wounded.

In the U.S., Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the episode “underscores the recklessness with which the Russians have been perpetrating this unprovoked invasion.” At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, Ukraine's U.N. ambassador, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said the fire broke out as a result of Russian shelling of the plant and accused Moscow of committing “an act of nuclear terrorism.”

Without producing evidence, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed that a Ukrainian “sabotage group” had set the fire at Zaporozhizhia.

The crisis unfolded after Grossi earlier in the week expressed grave concern that the fighting could cause accidental damage to Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors at four plants around the country.

Atomic safety experts said a war fought amid nuclear reactors represents an unprecedented and highly dangerous situation.

“These plants are now in a situation that few people ever seriously contemplated when they were originally built,” said Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington. ""No nuclear plant has been designed to withstand a potential threat of a full-scale military attack.”

Dr. Alex Rosen of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War said the incident was probably the result of military units overestimating the precision of their weapons, given that the prevailing winds would have carried any radioactive fallout straight toward Russia.

“Russia cannot have any interest in contaminating its own territory,” he said. He said the danger comes not just from the reactors but from the risk of enemy fire hitting storage facilities that hold spent fuel rods.

In the wake of the attack, Zelenskyy appealed again to the West to enforce a no-fly zone over his country. But NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg ruled out that possibility, citing the risk of a much wider war in Europe. He said that to enforce a no-fly zone, NATO planes would have to shoot down Russian aircraft.

“We understand the desperation, but we also believe that if we did that, we would end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe,” Stoltenberg said.

The plant fire was the second time since the invasion began that concerns about a potential nuclear accident arose, following a battle at the heavily contaminated site of the now-decommissioned Chernobyl plant.

Russian forces, meanwhile, pressed their offensive in the southern part of the country. Severing Ukraine's access to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov would deal a severe blow to its economy and could worsen an already dire humanitarian situation.

A round of talks between Russia and Ukraine yielded a tentative agreement Thursday to set up safe corridors to evacuate citizens and deliver food and medicine. But the necessary details still had to be worked out.

More than 840 children have been wounded in the war, and 28 have been killed, according to Ukraine's government. A total of 331 civilians had been confirmed killed in the invasion, but the true number is probably much higher, the U.N. human rights office said.

In Romania, one newly arrived refugee, Anton Kostyuchyk, struggled to hold back tears as he recounted leaving everything behind in Kyiv and sleeping in churches with his wife and three children during their journey out.

“I’m leaving my home, my country. I was born there, and I lived there,"" he said. ""And what now?”

Appearing on video in a message to antiwar protesters in several European cities, Zelenskyy continued to appeal for help.

“If we fall, you will fall,” he said. “And if we win, and I’m sure we’ll win, this will be the victory of the whole democratic world. This will be the victory of our freedom. This will be the victory of light over darkness, of freedom over slavery.”

Inside Ukraine, frequent shelling could be heard in the center of Kyiv, though more distant than in recent days, with loud thudding every 10 minutes resonating over the rooftops.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said battles involving airstrikes and artillery continued northwest of Kyiv, and the northeastern cities of Kharkiv and Okhtyrka came under heavy fire.

He said Ukrainian forces were still holding the northern city of Chernihiv and had prevented Russian efforts to take the important southern city of Mykolaiv. Ukrainian artillery also defended Odesa from repeated attempts by Russian ships to fire on the Black Sea port, Arestovic said. Odesa is Ukraine's biggest port city and home to a large naval base.

The Ukrainian Navy scuttled its flagship at the shipyard where it was undergoing repairs to keep the frigate from being seized by the Russians, authorities said.

Another strategic port, Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, was “partially under siege,” and Ukrainian forces were pushing back efforts to surround the city, Arestovich said. The fighting has knocked out the city’s electricity, heat and water systems, as well as most phone service, officials said.

“The humanitarian situation is tense,” he said.

Amid the warfare, there were occasional signs of hope.

As explosions sounded on the fringes of Kyiv, Dmytro Shybalov and Anna Panasyk smiled and blushed at the civil registry office where they married Friday. They fell in love in 2015 in Donetsk amid the fighting between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces that was a precursor to the countrywide war.

“It’s 2022 and the situation hasn’t changed,"" Shybalov said. “It’s scary to think what will happen when our children will be born.”

Ukrainian security official says 840 kids have been injured KYIV, Ukraine — The head of Ukraine’s security council called on Russia to create humanitarian corridors to allow children, women and the elderly to escape the fighting. Oleksiy Danilov said Friday more than 840 children have been wounded in the war. A day earlier, the Ukrainian government put the death toll among children at 28. He spoke ahead of the latest talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, planned for this weekend. “The question of humanitarian corridors is question No. 1,” Danilov said on Ukrainian television. “Children, women, elderly people — what are they doing here?” Russian troops have encircled and blockaded several large cities in the south of the country, including Mariupol, trying to cut Ukraine off from the Black and Azov seas. Ukrainian officials have asked for help from the Red Cross in organizing corridors, describing the situation in the blockaded cities as “close to a catastrophe.” Share this -







Zelenskyy accuses NATO of giving 'green light' to continued shelling of Ukraine Furious Zelenskyy says NATO has ‘given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities’ March 5, 2022 01:14 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lashed out at NATO on Friday, saying in a speech that the 30-nation alliance “gave a green light” for the continued shelling of the country after the group rejected calls for a no-fly zone. “All the people who will die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, your disunity,” Zelenskyy said, according to an NBC News translation. “All that the NATO alliance was able to do to this day is arrange for the 50 tons of fuel for Ukraine.” Perhaps the country could use that fuel to burn the “Budapest Memorandum,” he said, referring to the 1994 agreement between the United States, Russia and Britain “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.” The Ukrainian leader has called on the U.S.-led alliance, which was founded after World War II to counter the Soviet Union, to impose a no-fly zone over the country. Earlier Friday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called the Russian invasion of Ukraine “horrific,” but said that the alliance’s core task was to keep its 30 nations “safe.” “We have made it clear that we are not going to move into Ukraine, neither on the ground or in Ukrainian airspace,” he said, adding that the only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO fighter planes into the country and shoot down Russian jets that don’t abide by it. “If we did that, we could end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war,” he said.

U.S. debates how to aid possible Zelenskyy government in exile Democratic and Republican lawmakers are eager to send billions of dollars in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine as the government there desperately tries to repel a Russian invasion and secure the safety of more than 1 million refugees fleeing the war-torn nation. But with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army steadily advancing, members of Congress and U.S. national security officials are now discussing the challenges of assisting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government if the capital Kyiv falls and Moscow installs a puppet regime. It’s a grim scenario that Biden administration officials are hesitant to acknowledge publicly — especially with Zelenskyy and his troops holding off the Russians longer than many expected — but it’s one that is increasingly being debated in Washington. “One of the challenges that we’re going to face is where is going to be the seat of Ukrainian government, and is that going to have to relocate to Lviv or someplace west of the Dnieper River? Or is that going to have to relocate to some place outside of Ukraine?” Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who serves on the Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said in a phone interview Friday. Read the full story here.

Sky News correspondent says he was injured after crew attacked by Russian 'reconnaissance squad' The chief correspondent for Sky News said a Russian “reconnaissance squad” opened fire on his news crew early this week, wounding him and striking his camera operator’s body armor while they were reporting northwest of Kyiv. In a dispatch published Friday on the U.K. outlet’s site, chief correspondent Stuart Ramsey said the crew came under “full attack” while trying to reach the town of Bucha, where they were traveling to see a Russian convoy that had reportedly been destroyed the day before. NBC News has not independently confirmed Ramsey’s account. A graphic video included in the story captures what appears to be shells striking their vehicle and the crew shouting that they’re journalists. The attack occurred while they driving down a deserted stretch of road, Ramsey said. There was a small explosion and the car's tire burst, he said, adding: “And then our world turned upside down."" “Bullets cascaded through the whole of the car, tracers, bullet flashes, windscreen glass, plastic seats, the steering wheel, and dashboard had disintegrated,” he wrote. Ramsey said he was shot in the lower back. Camera operator Richie Mockler was hit twice in his vest. The three other members of their crew escaped uninjured.

CNN to stop broadcasting in Russia amid expanding media restrictions A growing number of journalism organizations have announced they will limit work inside Russia amid a government crackdown on news coverage of the invasion the Kremlin finds disagreeable. CNN and Bloomberg News announced operation changes on Friday. ""CNN will stop broadcasting in Russia while we continue to evaluate the situation and our next steps moving forward,"" a CNN spokesperson said in a statement Friday. And Bloomberg News said it would suspend work inside the country. “We have with great regret decided to temporarily suspend our news gathering inside Russia,” Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait said Friday. “The change to the criminal code, which seems designed to turn any independent reporter into a criminal purely by association, makes it impossible to continue any semblance of normal journalism inside the country.” Other media outlets have also pulled back or gone dark. BBC News said it would suspend reporting work in Russia after it passed a law making it an offense to disseminate what it described as ""fake"" information about the country's armed forces. Russia's communications regulator restricted access to Voice of America, Radio Liberty and other foreign-based media, the RIA state news agency reported. On Friday the independent Moscow Times said it would halt publishing in its homeland. The independent Echo of Moscow radio broadcaster and TV Rain also said they were halting operations. German outlet Deutsche Welle was completely unavailable. Share this -

The 46-year-old told NBC News she felt it was an “easy, effective way to get cash in the hands of the Ukrainian people pretty much immediately.” Shortly after making the booking, Levine explained to her hosts that she wouldn’t be staying. ""Thank you for caring about us,"" Levine's host in Lviv wrote to her via Airbnb's app. ""I’m just amazed at how sincere and compassionate people can be. It brings tears to my eyes."" Meanwhile, her host in Kyiv said they were going to use the money to help those in need by supplying food, medicine and warm clothes. Just booked an #AIRBNB in Kiev. Obviously not showing up. But the reservation got $ sent directly to the people. Was super easy. Places starting around $20. Highly recommend.

Ukraine fights back on TikTok, where war is fought with memes and misinformation Many Ukrainians have embraced TikTok as a way to provide a window into the on-the-ground reality they now face. In recent weeks TikTok has become essential viewing for people seeking information on the war, offering a look at the front lines of major cities as well as daily life in Ukraine — Molotov cocktails and all. But that content is now competing with a wave of other videos purporting to be about the conflict. While there are several prominent examples of Ukrainian content creators using TikTok to communicate their lived experiences, viral videos about Ukraine on TikTok are also largely a mixed bag of misinformation. Realistic video game footage and videos predating the conflict masquerade as TikToks set in present-day Ukraine, while TikTok users outside the combat zone are cashing in on misleading livestreams and viral trends like a mythical Ukrainian combat pilot, the “ghost of Kyiv.” Read the full story here.

Convoy picks up cars and anti-Ukraine talking points ahead of Washington arrival The American offshoot of the “Freedom Convoy” that brought chaos to Canada’s capital is promising to stop traffic outside of Washington, D.C., on Saturday, but exact plans remained vague Friday as the group hit its last pit stop in Maryland. The convoy, which was organized on pro-Trump and anti-vaccine channels on the Telegram messaging app, has picked up hundreds of cars and several trucks since the group left a rural parking lot in Adelanto, California, on Feb. 22. But as its Covid mission has become less clear, the group’s channels have turned to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where conspiracy-minded thinking has flourished. While some group members have admonished Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion, QAnon and anti-vaccine contingents within the groups have seized on a false conspiracy theory that the war is a cover for a military operation backed by former President Donald Trump in Ukraine.

Vice President Harris discussing trip to Poland, Romania Vice President Kamala Harris is considering traveling to Poland and Romania next week, according to two sources familiar. The move comes as the Biden administration is attempting to support Ukraine without provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin. Thousands of refugees are flooding into Poland and Romania — both of which border Ukraine — in an attempt to escape the invasion. The visit would be Harris' second trip to Europe in the past few weeks. She attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany in mid-February as Russia was amassing troops on the Ukraine border.

Behind Russia’s ‘rush to failure’ in the early days of its invasion of Ukraine The first week of Russia's invasion of Ukraine does not appear to have gone to plan. Russia's attempts at a fast-paced assault haven't brought its forces inside Kyiv, the capital and the seat of the Western-leaning government the Kremlin appears intent on removing. Instead, the strategy has stretched supply lines and morale to a breaking point, while Russian tanks and military equipment have, at times, gotten stuck in mud or run out of gas. That's the verdict of government officials and Russian military experts. It's also the picture painted by a flood of videos shared on social media, as the world watches the war and wonders how it appears to have started off quite so badly for the Kremlin. Videos verified by NBC News show a Ukrainian civilian jokingly offering to give stranded Russian soldiers a ride before quickly pulling away, a young Russian soldier sobbing as he eats and calls his mother and a group of Russian soldiers looting a Ukrainian store for food. Most challenging of all for the Russian military, Western officials and experts say, Moscow appears to have underestimated the willingness of Ukrainian citizens to fight back.

State Dept. instructs U.S. Embassies in Europe not to retweet U.S. Embassy Kyiv's 'war crime' tweet The U.S. State Department sent an “urgent” message to U.S. Embassies in Europe to not retweet a post from the U.S. Embassy Kyiv that called Russia’s attack on Europe’s largest nuclear plant in Ukraine “a war crime,” according to an internal message obtained by NBC News. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The official Twitter account of U.S. Embassy Kyiv tweeted it was “a war crime to attack a nuclear power plant” and that “Putin's shelling of Europe's largest nuclear plant takes his reign of terror one step further.” The State Department soon after sent a memo to their public affairs offices in U.S. missions in Europe asking them not to endorse the statement. “URGENT: Do Not/Not Retweet Emb. Kyiv’s Tweet on Reactor,” the subject line of the email from the State Department’s public affairs office said. “All - do not/not retweet Embassy Kyiv’s tweet on shelling of the facility being a possible war crime. If you have retweeted it - un-re-tweet it ASAP.” As of 11:45 a.m. ET, the U.S. Embassy Kyiv’s tweet had not been taken down. Share this -







BBC News suspends work in Russia amid Putin's media crackdown BBC News said Friday that it will suspend reporting work in Russia after President Vladimir Putin's regime blocked access to several foreign media outlets. Russia's parliament reportedly passed a law making it an offense to disseminate what it described as ""fake"" information about the country's armed forces. The move is widely seen as part of Putin's crackdown on foreign and independent media services reporting on the realities of his offensive against Ukraine. ""This legislation appears to criminalize the process of independent journalism,"" BBC Director-General Tim Davie said in a statement posted on social media. ""It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development,"" he said. ""The safety of our staff is paramount and we are not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs,"" he added. Davie said BBC journalists based in Ukraine and around the world will continue to report on Russia's war against Ukraine. Share this -

NATO chief says Russia has used cluster bombs in Ukraine NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday that NATO has ""seen the use of cluster bombs"" by Russia in Ukraine. Speaking at a NATO meeting in Brussels, he said Russia's invasion was ""a blatant violation of international law."" ""We have seen the use of cluster bombs, we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which will be in violation of international law,"" he said. ""And of course NATO and NATO allies and partners are collecting information and monitoring very closely what is going on in Ukraine,"" he added. His comments come after Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, said Russia had used a vacuum bomb Monday in its invasion of Ukraine. ""They used the vacuum bomb today, which is actually prohibited by the Geneva convention,"" Markarova had said at the time after briefing U.S. Congress members. A vacuum bomb uses oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion, which can produce a blast wave of a significantly longer duration than that of a conventional explosive.

More explosions heard in Kyiv in sign assault is intensifying Up to a dozen explosions were heard in downtown Kyiv on Friday morning and air raid sirens wailed, in an apparent sign Russian missile strikes on and around the capital were intensifying. Reuters witnesses in the centre of the city of 3.4 million people could not immediately confirm the cause of the blasts, but they were more frequent than in recent days and some were louder. There were no immediate reports of casualties. While no major assault has been launched on Kyiv yet, the capital has been shelled and Russian forces unleashed fierce firepower to try to break resistance in the nearby town of Borodyanka. Drone footage from the town to the northwest of Kyiv on Thursday showed flattened houses and a badly damaged apartment block, with some homes charred and still on fire. Burned out military vehicles littered a main road. In Kyiv's Borshchahivka neighbourhood, some 18km (11 miles) west of the centre, the twisted metal remnants of a missile, which Ukrainian air defences apparently downed overnight, lay in the middle of a street a few meters from a bus station.

Kirby, who made the comment in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" said the Pentagon is working closely with the Department of Energy to assess the damage.

Zelensky urges Russia to remember Chernobyl: 'How can you forget it?' A damaged administrative building at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Friday after reports of Russian shelling overnight. Energoatom / via Reuters Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video Friday morning that the Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant could have led to a tragedy for Ukraine and for Europe and appealed to the Russian forces to remember history. Speaking in Russian, he said: “Together in 1986 we struggled with the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. You must remember the burning graphite scattered by the explosion, the victims. You must remember the glow above the destroyed power unit. You must remember the evacuation from Pripyat and the 30km (18.5 miles) zone. How can you forget it?,” he said. “And if you have not forgotten, then you cannot be silent, you must tell your authorities, go out to the streets and say that you want to live. You want to live on earth without radioactive contamination. Radiation does not know where Russia is, radiation does not know where the borders of your country are,” the leader added.

The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Friday in response to Russia’s attack and capture of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which caused worldwide alarm about the potential for a nuclear accident if the conflict in Ukraine is not contained.

The United States and its allies denounced Russia for the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine, calling it a threat to civilians and a reckless escalation. They condemned the seizure of the plant and called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Zaporizhzhia and from the former Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine.

“By the grace of God, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Mr. Putin must stop this madness, and he must stop it now. Cooler heads must prevail.”

Early on Friday, as fighting reached the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant, a fire started at a training building. The fire was extinguished, and the plant appeared to be safe on Friday. Ukrainian officials and the International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had been contained without damage to the reactors or other equipment, and that radiation levels had not increased.

“This is the first time that a state has attacked a fueled and functioning nuclear power plant,” said Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Barbara Woodward, who had called for the Security Council meeting. “It must not happen again.”

Russia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, told the council that the allegations that Russia had attacked the nuclear site were “lies” and part of an anti-Russian campaign. He said the emergency meeting had been called to “kindle artificial hysteria about what is taking place in Ukraine.”

Mr. Nebenzya offered a different account of the incident, saying that Russian troops patrolling the area of the nuclear facility had come under fire from Ukrainian forces inside the training building and had returned fire. He accused Ukrainians of setting the blaze.

“Our servicemen are not interfering with the work of the operators of the power plants and only working to ensure stability,” Mr. Nebenzya said, adding that Russia had experienced the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and did not want to see another nuclear accident.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, briefed the council from an airplane en route to Iran. Mr. Grossi said he had proposed to the Ukrainian and Russian authorities that he travel to Ukraine as soon as possible and visit both nuclear sites, Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia, to establish a framework to protect them.

Mr. Grossi said his mission would not be political and would be restricted to ensuring “the safety and security of nuclear establishments of Ukraine, which, as facts have shown, are in constant danger of accidents.” He added that the Zaporizhzhia facility was operating normally, but said he had informed the I.A.E.A. board of governors that “there is no normalcy to the situation when there are military forces in charge of the site.”

Beyond the statements of diplomats, the Security Council cannot take significant action against Russia because the country has veto power over legally binding resolutions. Russia vetoed a resolution last week that condemned its invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its troops.

The U.N. General Assembly, a 193-member body, passed a resolution on Wednesday that condemned the invasion and called for humanitarian access and a diplomatic solution. That resolution, which was politically symbolic but not legally binding, passed with 141 countries voting in favor, demonstrating Russia’s isolation on the world stage, diplomats said.

“Europe needs to wake up. The biggest nuclear power plant in Europe is on fire right now. Russian tanks are shooting at the nuclear blocks. These are tanks equipped with thermal imagers, so they know what they are shooting at.

They have prepared for it. I am addressing all Ukrainians, all Europeans and everyone who knows the word Chernobyl, who knows many casualties were inflicted by the explosion on the nuclear plant. This was a global catastrophe and its consequences were battled by hundreds of thousands of people. Tens of thousands had to be evacuated and Russia wants to repeat that and is already repeating it, but 6 times bigger.

Europeans, wake up please. Tell your politicians, Russian forces are shooting at the nuclear plant in Ukraine. Zaporizka nuclear plant city of Energodar. There are six energy blocks there. Six. In Chernobyl one energy block had exploded.

We have gotten in touch with our leaders, partners, I have already spoken to Charles Michel, Olaf Scholz, Andrzej Duda, President Biden. We have contacted head of IAEA, Grossi and also Prime Minister Johnson. We are issuing a warning, no country has ever shot at nuclear blocks except for Russia.

First time ever. For the first time ever in our history, in the history of human kind, the terrorist country has reverted to nuclear terror. Russian propaganda had warned in the past to cover the world in nuclear ash. Now this isn’t just a warning, this is real.

We don’t know for sure what the results of this fire will be, we don’t know when the explosion will happen or, God willing, not going to happen. Nobody can know or calculate for certain, but our boys have always kept the nuclear plant safe.

We made sure no provocations could happen. We made sure no one could go there or access it. We made sure no one could plant bombs there. Plant bombs and keep the world hostage to nuclear catastrophe.

We must stop Russian soldiers now. Immediately call your politicians. Ukraine is 15 nuclear blocks, if there is an explosion it is the end for everyone. End to Europe. Its the evacuation of entire Europe. Only immediate action can stop the Russian troops.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.
