In remarks from the White House, Biden also called for revoking Russia’s ""most favored nation"" status, known as permanent normal trade relations in the US. The move, which has been coordinated with G7 and EU allies, will require an act of Congress.

The United States’ ban of exporting of luxury goods to Russia, which Biden referenced in his speech, will also include items like tobacco, clothing, jewelry, cars and antiques, an administration official tells CNN.

The idea behind this, the official explains, is to continue hurting Russian oligarchs and the country’s wealthiest by depriving them of their creature comforts, as the US continues to try to put pressure around those close to Vladimir Putin. It is also aimed at removing ways for these oligarchs to shelter their money, as they are already increasingly closed off from traditional financial avenues, the official said.

So how much alcohol and seafood does the US import from Russia? The US imported 48,867 metric tons of seafood from Russia in 2021, worth about $1.2 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Crab accounted for the largest portion of those imports, with the US buying more than $900 million worth of frozen snow and red king crab last year.

The US does not sell any seafood directly to Russia, as the country banned US exports of seafood and fish in 2014.

CNN is still tracking down overall alcohol figures but according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, imports of Russian vodka to the United States accounted for only 1.3% of total vodka imports in in 2021.

The total amounts to $18.5 million dollars in 2021, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-11-22/h_de7fa3a673e0bc109d5fc99bd62cbd42

The shipments include anti-armor and anti-aircraft missiles which could be used against Russian tanks and helicopters .

The weapons are being used by Ukrainian fighters to push back Russian forces.

As fighting in Ukraine enters its third week, reports this week revealed heavily-laden military cargo jets are pouring into an airfield across the border, stacked with weapons and military equipment to help Ukraine's forces hold back the advance of Russian troops.

Throughout the buildup to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, NATO countries, including the US, insisted they would not send troops to the region amid concern that the presence of their personnel on the ground would lead to a dangerous escalation of the conflict.

That stance has continued since Moscow ordered its troops into Ukraine on the morning of February 24. Instead, NATO nations and other countries are supplying Ukraine's defence forces - vastly outgunned and outnumbered by Russia's military - with weapons and equipment that Kyiv hopes will be able to help staunch Russia's advance.

Around 17,000 anti-armor weapons have been sent to Ukraine in the last number of weeks and are being pressed into use against Russian tanks and other hardware. As of March 8, Ukrainian fighters had destroyed over 1,000 armored personnel carriers, 303 tanks, 120 artillery systems and 80 helicopters, The Kyiv Independent claimed.

The Biden administration, under pressure to expand the arsenal of weapons that Ukraine has in its conflict with Russia, is working with European allies to expedite more sophisticated air-defense systems and other armaments into the war zone, U.S. officials said Friday. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Discussions were ongoing ahead of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s planned trip next week to meet with NATO allies in Brussels and Slovakia, which along with Poland and Romania has indicated a willingness to transfer military aid to its embattled neighbor. Slovakia also possesses the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, which is used to shoot down enemy aircraft and is familiar to the Ukrainians.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the United States is committed to arming the government in Kyiv with “the kinds of capabilities that we know the Ukrainians need and are using very well.” He declined to specify what types of weapons could be included in the next wave of shipments.

“Some of that material we have and are providing. Some of that material we don’t have but we know others have, and we’re helping coordinate that as well,” Kirby said.

The administration is facing backlash over its decision earlier this week to scuttle Poland’s proposal that would have sent a number of its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via a transfer “free of charge” to the United States. Washington, citing concerns that Russia would view the move as a provocation, said the offer from Warsaw was not “tenable.”

Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded for the MiG-29 transfer. And while they have support from a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, the Biden administration, citing assessments from senior American military commanders in Europe, has said the additional aircraft would offer only minimal value to Ukraine given the contested nature of its airspace.

“We believe the most effective way to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia is to provide increased amounts of antitank weapons and air defense systems, which is ongoing with the international community,” said Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters the chief of U.S. European Command. “The Ukrainians are making excellent use of these weapons now.”

NATO countries have been limited in what they can send to Ukraine due in part to the Ukrainian military’s training, which centers heavily on Soviet- or Russian-made weapons that exist in dwindling stock.

Ukraine has sought the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, said a senior European official familiar with the situation. There are ongoing talks about that possibility, the official said, but questions remain about whether there are any that can be spared.

“Nobody wants to mishandle expectations,” said the official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Ukrainian troops also are trained on the Buk surface-to-air missile system — the same type of weapon that shot down a Malaysia Airlines civilian jet over a part of eastern Ukraine held by Russian-backed separatists in 2014. Some eastern European countries possess both systems, but in small numbers, the European official said.

Austin’s upcoming visit to Slovakia could be used to secure additional agreements to use its railways to facilitate faster transfers of humanitarian aid and fuel into Ukraine, the European official said. Unlike some other countries nearby, Slovakia has a shipping hub that operates on both European standard-gauge rail and the wider-gauge rail used in Ukraine, making it an appealing option.

Assessments of how long the Ukrainians can continue to hold out against the Russian onslaught are intertwined with what weapons they already have.

On Friday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the United States sent a letter to President Biden asking him to transfer manned and unmanned aircraft to Ukraine, saying that “despite heroic and skilled resistance,” the Russians had achieved air superiority over the Ukrainians. That went farther than U.S. defense officials, who have noted the Russians have a significantly larger air force but had been unable to control the skies over Ukraine.

“Russia’s advantage in this domain could soon develop into air dominance if the Ukrainians do not receive necessary military aid,” the lawmakers said.

The lawmakers called for the continued delivery of Stinger missiles, man-portable antiaircraft weapons, but also called for the United States to facilitate the transfer of S-300 systems.

“Providing Soviet-era platforms that Ukrainian servicemembers have previously operated and maintained will be essential to their success on the battlefield and will also protect U.S. defense technology from falling into the hands of the Russians,” lawmakers said in the letter, which was first reported by Politico.

They also urged the president to reconsider the Polish MiG decision and said the Biden administration should look for ways to send more armed drones and Su-25 aircraft to Ukraine. The jet is used by a handful of U.S. allies and partners, including Bulgaria, a NATO nation.

The lawmakers signing the letter Friday included numerous U.S. veterans.

Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a former Army Ranger who is among the signatories, said the administration was drawing a nonsensical distinction between acceptable weapons and those it considers potentially too escalatory.

“I don’t believe there is a distinction between providing a MiG and providing a Javelin and a Stinger,” he said. “These are defensive systems; we are not providing offensive capabilities because Ukraine is not on the offense, all they’re doing is fighting for their survival and trying to maintain their democracy against a Vladimir Putin invasion.”

Crow also said that while the provision of Javelins and Stingers has been useful thus far, the West must step up its contributions to give Ukraine a chance to sustain its resistance — particularly in the skies, where Zelensky’s forces are trying to prevent Russia from achieving superiority.

“Short of MiGs, they need more advanced ground-to-air missile systems,” Crow said, noting that the Stingers provided to Ukraine work well against helicopters and planes conducting low-altitude bombing runs, but aren’t enough to ground the Russian air force. “They need something that can reach out and conduct regional air defense, higher altitude air defense.”

Rep. Michael Waltz (R.-Fla.), who has served in Special Forces units and also signed the letter, said that transferring S-300 systems and components of them, such as radar, could be helpful.

Among Western weapons, the Ukrainians also could benefit from the Avenger system, which allows Stinger missiles to be mounted to vehicles, he said. Other American air-defense systems, including Patriot missiles, require too much training to make them practical in the near term.

The Ukrainians could benefit, too, from counter-battery radar systems, which scan for the originating locations of incoming artillery fire, and its equipment they’ve asked for before, Waltz said.

“At a minimum, once the Russians know you have that, they won’t be able to just sit there and lob round after round after round,” Waltz said. “It degrades their ability to just sit there and pummel you. They have to move, obviously, because now you have the ability to counter-battery.”

The Ukrainian military has 56 fighter jets left and is using them just five to 10 hours per day, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, cited that as one reason the administration had decided against transferring the MiGs to Ukraine, noting that Russian surface-to-air missile systems can reach just about anywhere over the war zone.

U.S. officials continue to speak to the Ukrainians regularly, the defense official said, and the “things they need the most” are antiaircraft and antiarmor weapons, such as Javelin missiles. For items the Ukrainians need that the United States does not have, the administration is working with allies and partners “who might have inventory.”

“We’re trying to help them further that defense in ways and with systems that they know how to use already,” the official said. “They’re good at it, and it’s having effect on the Russians.”

The Czech Republic has also sent Ukraine infantry fighting vehicles and artillery systems.

The new arms deliveries represent a stark shift from Western support for Ukraine in the earliest days of the war, when U.S. and European officials, unsure of how long Ukraine could hold out against a massive Russian invasion, were wary of delivering heavy weapons that could in turn fall into Russian hands. The deliveries also reflect a shift away from defensive systems like anti-tank rockets to more offensive weapons that Ukraine needs at a critical stage of the war.

The United States and its NATO allies have ramped up the delivery of tanks, helicopters, and heavy weapons to Ukraine as the country’s forces prepare for large-scale battles against Russian troops in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.

The United States and its NATO allies have ramped up the delivery of tanks, helicopters, and heavy weapons to Ukraine as the country’s forces prepare for large-scale battles against Russian troops in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.

The Czech Republic opened the floodgates earlier this month by shipping tanks to Ukraine, becoming the first NATO country to do so since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24. The Czech Republic has also sent Ukraine infantry fighting vehicles and artillery systems.

Other NATO countries have followed suit with their own shipments of high-end military hardware across NATO borders into Ukraine. Slovakia sent Ukraine an advanced S-300 air defense system, and the United States on Wednesday announced it would supply Ukraine with an additional $800 million worth of military hardware. That shipment includes 11 MI-17 helicopters, 200 M113 armored personnel carriers, 100 Humvees, 300 Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, heavy howitzers, thousands of shells, and other munitions.

During the first phase of the war, many Western officials believed Kyiv could quickly fall to Russian forces in a matter of days, prompting them to balk on sending heavy weapons to a government they were unsure could survive.

That all changed after Russia’s massive offensive in northern Ukraine ran aground, thanks to stiff Ukrainian resistance backed by Western supplies of anti-tank weapons and other small arms, as well as clumsy tactical missteps by the poorly equipped Russian forces.

The transfer of heavy weapons to Ukraine is far from simple. In addition to the heavy vehicles and weapons themselves, any such transfers to Ukraine require a potentially long logistical tail to back up, including training, spare parts, and mechanics to keep the vehicles operating in the war zone. (Russia has threatened to attack U.S. and NATO weapons deliveries headed into Ukraine.)

“The tank is not just a rental car,” said Ben Hodges, former commanding general of the U.S. Army in Europe. “Whenever you’re talking about transferring any sort of mechanized or armored vehicles, you have to also think about spare parts, maintenance packages, training, fuel, ammunition … to make sure they can keep things running.”

Nevertheless, a senior U.S. defense official said on Monday that several allied nations were still considering delivering tanks to Ukraine, mostly Soviet-era variants that troops in Kyiv had already been trained on. “This is equipment that Ukrainians probably are already familiar with, so the time to train on it would be relatively quick,” Hodges said.

The logistical complications have prompted some Western governments to withhold delivering larger supplies of heavy vehicles to Ukraine, despite pleas from top Ukrainian officials for more support for their outgunned and outmanned forces.

Others, particularly some politicians in Germany, fear that upgrading Ukraine’s military with heavy weapons could turn the West into a target for further Russian aggression. That debate has reportedly sparked rifts within the ruling coalition in Germany.

A top German arms manufacturer, Rheinmetall, said earlier this week it stood ready to supply up to 50 used Leopard 1 battle tanks to Ukraine, but the German government has yet to greenlight the arms transfer. Some German officials have balked at the idea, believing it would take too long to train the Ukrainians, who are versed in post-Soviet weapons systems common in Eastern Europe, on the Western-made battle tanks. Rheinmetall’s chief executive, Armin Papperger, disputed this argument, saying they could be trained in a matter of days.

In the eyes of Ukrainians, the new spate of Western arms transfers is a welcome shift but still not enough. Current and former Ukrainian officials said the West can still do more to arm the country ahead of what is expected to be a decisive new chapter in the war.

“Without additional weaponry, this war will become an endless bloodbath, spreading misery, suffering, and destruction,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted on Wednesday, listing out cities where Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians during their military offensive. “Mariupol, Bucha, Kramatorsk – the list will be continued. Nobody will stop Russia except Ukraine with Heavy Weapons.”

Ukrainian officials and government accounts have begun using the hashtag #ArmUkraineNow on social media as they call for further deliveries of heavy weaponry.

Olena Tregub, head of Ukraine’s Independent Defense Anti-Corruption Committee, said new deliveries from the West aren’t sufficient to give Ukraine the upper hand in its fight against numerically superior Russian forces. “Ukraine is being put on an IV drip to slowly die,” she said.

Still, U.S. and European officials say the new transfers signify that Washington and other European allies are now preparing to help Ukraine not just survive the Russian onslaught, but begin taking the offensive. They say the heavy weapons transfers could prove critical to Ukraine’s military success, even if Ukraine thinks the inflows are insufficient.

“Western Europe does everything they can to support Ukraine to win this war and this support is only growing in terms of quantity as well as quality,” Arvydas Anusauskas, Lithuania’s defense minister, told Foreign Policy.

Ukraine’s growing appetite for tanks—and the push from Western officials to send more of them—is also being driven by the flatter battlefield in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where tanks are easier to maneuver.

“Large chunks of eastern Ukraine are what’s called tank country, flat open ground ideally suited for mechanized warfare,” said Franz-Stefan Gady, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank. “That is why Ukraine needs main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, mid-range air defense systems, loitering munitions, etc., to stay in this fight, to battle Russian forces to a standstill, and eventually counterattack when opportune,” he said. “The key challenge for Ukrainian forces will be how to conduct large-scale combined arms operations in the face of superior Russian firepower.”

The United States began checking off some boxes on the extensive Ukrainian wish list in its newest arms delivery to Ukraine. A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity based on ground rules set by the Pentagon, said that plans are underway for Ukrainian trainers to travel into NATO countries in Eastern Europe to be trained on how to use the new systems—such as the howitzers and counter-battery radars.

Washington has also become a critical backstop for rearming NATO allies in Europe as they in turn transfer their own supplies to Ukraine. After Slovakia sent its S-300 air defense system to Ukraine, the United States deployed one of its Patriot missile defense systems to Slovakia to fill the gap. The United States also signed a major arms deal with Poland earlier this month to supply the Polish military with 250 Abrams battle tanks, potentially freeing up Poland to send some of its tanks to Ukraine—though no such decision has been announced.

Some experts argue the United States should go further and support NATO allies such as Poland transferring MiG fighter jets to Ukraine by offering to restock their air forces with older F-16 fighter jets—a transfer that some allies have balked at, and one that could be complicated when training and logistics are factored in. (Slovakia is also reportedly considering transferring its fleet of MiGs to Ukraine.)

Hodges argued that concerns among some Western countries that such military support could trigger a wider NATO conflict with Russia are overblown, and Washington needs to ramp up its weapons transfers to Ukraine further.

“We have exaggerated the risk, and the Russians know this,” he said. “We have the most powerful alliance in the history of the world scared to provide 25-year-old aircraft to a country that’s fighting for its life.”

“If we are the arsenal of democracy, then let’s be the arsenal of democracy and open the doors and push everything out that [Ukrainians] possibly need,” he added.

The debate comes at a critical point in the war, when Russia is regrouping after retreating from the outskirts of Kyiv and Ukrainian forces are cobbling together as much firepower as they can to face a new battle for control of eastern Ukraine. Pentagon officials say Russia is positioning artillery units south of the city of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, and a publicly released British Defence Intelligence report earlier this week predicted that the Kremlin would ramp up airstrikes against major population centers in the Donbas such as Kramatorsk, a major railway hub, where a Russian ballistic missile strike last week killed 59 people.

“Ukraine could be more vulnerable to heavy artillery in the Donbas considering it’s more open if they try to contest generally instead of trying to force the Russians to fight in towns and cities,” said Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews. “Personally I would start with anti-air and UAVs to give Ukraine the best shot at air power. Long-range artillery tools could also be very useful.”

The increasing flow of Western weapons could make it harder for Russia to sustain an offensive in eastern Ukraine. Western officials believe the Kremlin is hungry to notch a significant battlefield win for their forces ahead of May 9, a major holiday to commemorate Russia’s World War II victory over Nazi Germany. Experts believe that Russia will now be challenged by a lack of supporting infantry and a slowing advance in the Donbas, after the massive losses it sustained in the first month of the war.

“For certain, the offensive can’t go on forever,” said Gady, the International Institute for Strategic Studies expert. “My guess is that Russia will not have the ability to take this fight into June. So something will have to give.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/15/tanks-heavy-weapons-ukraine-russia-nato-putin-offensive/

Many shipments broke countries' longstanding traditions of not sending weapons to active war zones.

Experts say weapons like NLAWs and Javelin missiles could make a difference in the war.

Within 24 hours of Russia's invasion, Lithuania, Poland, France, Estonia, and the United States all announced military aid for Ukraine. It was the start of a flood of military supplies sent to Ukraine in just the first week of the war.

Biden approved $350 million in military aid. That became the largest-ever single transfer of arms from US warehouses to another country.

Other shipments broke countries' longstanding traditions of not sending weapons to active war zones. Germany had previously refused to send Ukraine lethal aid, instead offering 5,000 helmets in a move that drew sharp criticism. But just two days after Russia's invasion, Berlin reversed course to send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 surface-to-air missiles.

For the first time in its history, the European Union financed and purchased weapons for a country outside its borders.

By the end of the first week, the US and NATO had sent more than 17,000 anti-tank weapons. Some of what the EU and US sent are newer weapons, like Javelin and Stinger missiles. But much of the military equipment shipped by European countries are older weapons from the Soviet era.

But it remains to be seen if military aid alone can turn the tide. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked NATO for a no-fly zone, something NATO rejected. To enforce a no-fly zone, NATO would have to fire on Russian planes that violate the zone. NATO would also need to destroy Russian surface-to-air missile defenses on the ground. All of that could risk a broader war with Russia.

The latest package of assistance will contain new capabilities for Ukraine including artillery systems, artillery rounds and armored personnel carriers, Mr. Biden said in a statement. The president has also approved the transfer of additional helicopters, he said.

""The steady supply of weapons the United States and its allies and partners have provided to Ukraine has been critical in sustaining its fight against the Russian invasion. It has helped ensure that Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine,"" Mr. Biden said. ""We cannot rest now.""

The president spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for nearly an hour earlier Wednesday, during which he informed his Ukrainian counterpart of the additional $800 million, Mr. Biden said.

""The Ukrainian military has used the weapons we are providing to devastating effect,"" the president said. ""As Russia prepares to intensify its attack in the Donbas region, the United States will continue to provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend itself.""

The U.S. is also expanding the scope of intelligence it is sharing with Ukraine to be responsive to the changing tactical situation on the ground, U.S. officials said, as Russian forces reposition themselves in the south and east of the country. The Biden administration has warned Russia is preparing to launch new offensive operations in the Donbas region, which Russian-backed forces first occupied in 2014.

An official familiar with the intelligence-sharing arrangements said the effort to date had been effective both in helping Ukrainian forces identify specific Russian targets and to protect and secure Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, and surrounding areas. The new guidance, issued late last week, will ensure similar assistance continues in contested areas of the country.

""As the conflict evolves, we continue to adjust to ensure that operators have the flexibility to share detailed, timely intelligence with the Ukrainians,"" a U.S. intelligence official said Wednesday.

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the increased intelligence sharing.

While Russian forces have retreated from Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, Zelenskyy has warned the war launched by Russia in late February is entering a new phase, and evidence that Russian troops committed atrocities against civilians has continued to mount.

CBS News found evidence of mass graves and bodies in the streets of Bucha, a city outside of Kyiv, earlier this month after Russian troops left the area. The atrocities prompted global outcry, with Mr. Biden calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" last week and accusing him of committing ""genocide"" on Tuesday during a visit to Iowa.

After suffering setbacks in parts of Ukraine and failing to seize the capital, Putin on Tuesday said Russian troops will turn their attention to the country's eastern Donbas region. The Russian president vowed his ""military operation will continue until its full completion.""

The U.S. has provided Ukraine with more than $2.6 billion in military aid since the beginning of Russia's invasion, committing more than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 5,000 Javelin anti-armor systems and hundreds of Switchblade drones, among other equipment and weapons, according to the Defense Department.

The latest package of security assistance authorized by Mr. Biden includes an additional 300 Switchblade drones, 500 Javelin missiles, air surveillance radars, 11 Mi17 helicopters, 18 155mm howitzers and other military equipment, the Pentagon said.

Zelenskyy has pleaded with the U.S. and European allies to provide the country with additional heavy weapons such as armored vehicles, air defense systems and military aircraft, warning that failing to do so will result in further bloodshed and destruction.

In addition to the U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the Ukrainians have been using to great effect, the United States has also identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire additional, longer-range systems on which Ukraine’s forces are already trained, as well as additional munitions for those systems.

The United States continues to expedite the authorization and facilitation of additional assistance to Ukraine from our Allies. At least 30 countries have provided security assistance to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. In 2022, the Department of State authorized third-party transfers of defensive equipment from more than 14 countries, a number that continues to grow as Allies and Partners increase support to Ukraine.

As the war between Ukraine and Russia drags on, it is clear that Ukraine has mounted a far better resistance to Russian forces than many expected. To continue to do so, however, Ukraine will need more help from the West — and that brings with it a dangerous risk that the war could escalate to involve NATO. Russia warned the West against sending further arms to Ukraine, saying such arms convoys could now be considered ""legitimate targets"" for the Russian armed forces. Speaking to Russia's Channel One broadcaster on Saturday, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov issued a warning to the West that could lead to a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO. ""We warned the United States that pumping Ukraine with weapons from a number of countries orchestrated by them is not just a dangerous move, but an action that turns the corresponding convoys into legitimate targets,"" the deputy minister said, according to comments reported by Russia's state news agency TASS. Ryabkov said there could be consequences to what he called the West's ""thoughtless transfer"" to Kyiv of weapons such as portable anti-aircraft missile systems and anti-tank missile systems, both of which have been supplied to Ukraine by several NATO members including the U.S. and U.K.

Close observers of Russia, and its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, expressed shock and dismay at Ryabkov's comments. ""If Russia attacks Western arms shipments ... it takes the conflict to a new level, of NATO vs. Russia,"" Timothy Ash, senior emerging markets sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said on Saturday, adding that a ""critical moment in this conflict [is] coming up."" ""Does the West really realize the threat to our very system of government, and our way of life, from Putin, and is it willing to act,"" he asked. Despite Russia's latest threats, the West is in a tricky position over Ukraine because its continued support for Ukraine in terms of arms, intelligence and financial aid, defense experts and strategists argue, could make or break Ukraine's resistance and could even tilt the war's outcome in Ukraine's favor, something that seemed unimaginable when Russia invaded over two weeks ago. ""There can be a point where this balance [in the war] is shifted in favor of Ukraine,"" Wojciech Lorenz, a senior analyst at the International Security Programme at The Polish Institute of International Affairs, told CNBC. Additional support from NATO's individual members in the form of arms shipments, intelligence and other forms of aid ""really makes a difference and is why Russia is doing so badly,"" he said.

There could even come a point, he added, where Ukraine is able to not only resist Russian forces but can launch counter-offensives against them ""and reclaim lost territory."" While Ukraine has won the affection of people and governments around the world for its brave stand against Russia's invasion, Russia has been heavily sanctioned, making it geopolitically, economically and financially isolated and vulnerable. With the World Bank's chief economist predicting that Russia is edging toward a default on its foreign debt while at home, numerous foreign brands have pulled out of Russia or ceased operations there, and Russian consumers are feeling the pain of the central bank's interest rate hike to 20% to bolster the crumbling ruble.

NATO's dilemma

Aside from sanctions, which came swiftly and in a surprisingly unified way by the West, one of the biggest dilemmas for the West is how much military assistance it could and should extend to Ukraine. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but it is a pro-Western ally that's geopolitically important as a buffer state between Russia and the rest of Europe. NATO has repeatedly said that it stands by Ukraine and its leadership under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and NATO countries have unilaterally offered and delivered weaponry to Ukraine to help it defend itself.

However, Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called on Western officials to provide more support. This ranges from more actionable maneuvers — such as imposing the full weight of sanctions on Russia and providing more arms — to the more problematic plea for a ""no-fly zone"" over Ukraine. NATO has rejected the latter request, saying this could bring it into direct confrontation with Russia. Without that extra support from NATO, strategists said, Zelenskyy needs to keep Ukraine at the forefront of the world's geopolitical priorities, and to maintain other forms of support for the country. ""At this critical juncture, every significant weapons shipment he [Zelenskyy] receives, every word of support he receives and every action NATO takes helps him and help Ukraine and he's trying to keep that squarely in the political view,"" Ian Lesser, vice president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, told CNBC on Thursday.

Describing Russia's invasion and military aggression against Ukraine as ""outrageous,"" Lesser said it was still vital to keep up the momentum of support for the country, be it through emotional support which people around the world can give, or media coverage. However, he questioned how long such support could be sustained. ""There is already a shift in the discussion towards energy security, the cost to Western publics and economies, the stability of the international financial system. These are all very real issues of course but from Zelenskyy's point of view, these are all distractions from the principal problem which is the fate of his people in Ukraine."" Crucially, Lesser said, Western partners would be more inclined to keep up their support of Ukraine if they ""believe that Ukraine can make good use of it.""

Risks NATO faces

While Ukraine has a fighting chance of defeating Russia, analysts said that if the converse happens, President Vladimir Putin could be emboldened to attack NATO. ""Russia wants to change the security architecture in Europe, and wants to recreate the empire by taking control of Belarus and Ukraine at a minimum, so even if they aren't able to achieve their goals now after a few years of reorganization they will try again,"" senior analyst Lorenz said.

Lorenz said Putin's intentions in this regard were made clear last December when Russia issued demands to the U.S. and NATO that it wanted legal guarantees ruling out NATO's eastward expansion and the deployment of weapons that, as Putin said in early December, ""threaten us in close vicinity to Russian territory."" ""Russia just needs to be strategically defeated,"" Lorenz said, because if Putin feels that he has ""achieved a victory by further undermining the territorial integrity of Ukraine, or the West forces Ukraine to accept some humiliating peace conditions like the recognition of the annexation of Crimea or the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, then it will only mean that in a couple of years we'll have war between Russia and NATO.""

How will Russia retaliate?

Russia's aggression in warfare appears to be becoming more indiscriminate, with its forces attacking a children's hospital and maternity ward on Wednesday. Russia said it had not targeted civilians at the hospital, despite images indicating civilians were caught up in the attack, while Ukraine accused it again of committing a war crime. There are concerns that Russia might resort to using biological warfare against Ukraine, with intelligence officials fearing that Russia could invent a pretext to use chemical, or even nuclear, weapons either against Ukraine, or any other nation if Russia feels directly confronted.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/11/ukraine-needs-more-weapons-the-west-fears-provoking-war-with-russia.html
