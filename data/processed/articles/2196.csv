While the official declined to lay out specifics, the US has planned to target Russia’s two largest banks, as well as other financial firms, and has prepared to deploy export controls to cut off Russian access to critical Western technology for entire Russian economic sectors.

Additional members of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle and their families will also be targeted.

Discussions are ongoing late this evening between US and European officials about the final shape of the package, the official said. It will also be a topic of discussion at the virtual G7 meeting scheduled for Thursday morning, the official said.

US officials also remain on high alert for any cyber activity targeting key domestic targets including banks and critical infrastructure, the official said.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-23-22/h_1831ec828890a281e4fcfc8db92e3c4b

In an address to the nation in the immediate aftermath of the attack ordered by Vladimir Putin, the Ukrainian leader told citizens to remain calm.

“We are working. The army is working,” he said. “Don’t panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything. We will defeat everyone. Because we are Ukraine.”

Mr Zelensky also said Russia was carrying out military strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure.

The attack by Moscow began in the early hours. Mr Putin announced a military operation in eastern Ukraine, claiming it was intended to protect civilians.

In a televised address early Thursday, Mr Putin said the action was in response to threats coming from Ukraine. He further claimed that Russia did not intend to occupy Ukraine and that the responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian “regime”.

Shortly after Putin spoke in a televised address on Russian state TV, explosions could be heard in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev.

Gunfire rattled near the capital’s main airport, the Interfax news agency said, and sirens were heard over the city.

“Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes,” Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.

“This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”

The attack by Russia has been condemned internationally, with Joe Biden and Boris Johnson among those first to criticise Moscow.

German chancellor Olaf Scholz said: “The Russian attack against Ukraine is a blatant breach of international law. It cannot be justified. Germany vehemently condemns this act of recklessness committed by President Putin. We stand in solidarity with Ukraine and its people.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-russia-martial-law-zelensky-b2022093.html

Zelensky urged Ukrainians to stay home and not to panic.

On Wednesday, the Ukrainian Parliament approved a declaration of a state of emergency in the entire Ukraine, except for two eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk where it has been in place since 2014.

The move to declare a state of emergency came after Putin recognised the independence of two rebel regions in eastern Ukraine, where a nearly eight-year conflict with the pro-Russia rebels has left over 14,000 dead.

Let's take a look what martial law in Ukraine entails, previous instances of it being implemented, what the president said and how people are reacted:

Martial law in Ukraine



Martial law in any country is generally imposed in a situation of civil unrest or at a time of national crisis or when the country is in a state of war. Martial law would impose harder restrictions, including bans on meetings, movements and political parties.

Under martial law, the military forces are given the right to rule over civilian rule. It is not always necessary to declare martial law over the entire country.

What the Ukrainian President said

Zelensky said that Russia conducted strikes on Ukraine’s military infrastructure and border guards.

“Dear Ukrainian citizens, this morning President Putin announced a special military operation in Donbas. Russia conducted strikes on our military infrastructure and our border guards. There were blasts heard in many cities of Ukraine,” Zelensky said in a short video message.

He assured the citizens that the US has already started uniting international support for Ukraine.

“We’re introducing martial law on the whole territory of our country. A minute ago I had a conversation with President Biden. The US have already started uniting international support. Today each of you should keep calm. Stay at home if you can. We are working. The army is working. The whole sector of defense and security is working,” he said.

He urged people to not panic.

“No panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything. We will win over everybody because we are Ukraine.”

When was martial law last declared in Ukraine?



On 26 November, 2018, martial law was declared by the president in 10 regions of Ukraine along the Black Sea and the borders with Russia, Belarus and Moldova.

As per a BBC report, the measure was declared for 30 days after the capture of three Ukrainian naval vessels and 24 sailors by Russian forces.

During the period of martial law, Ukraine did not allow Russian men aged 16-60 into the country, except for “humanitarian cases” such as those travelling to funerals.

Citizens react to Russia’s assault on Ukraine



The sound of explosions on ground and fighter jets overhead caused widespread panic among people as flocks of frantic Ukrainian citizens started fleeing for safety.

As per a report by Al Jazeera, long queues of cars formed from the city centre towards various exits out of Kyiv on Thursday morning. People also took cover in the city’s underground stations and other safe places.

Even though local authorities urged Kyiv residents to stay at home, traffic jams formed from central Kyiv towardsZhytomyr and other exits from the city at 6am local time.

The Kyiv City State Administration asked people who are not involved with critical infrastructure and life support of the city to stay at home.

“…and be ready to follow to the shelter when the sirens turn on,” it said in a message on its official Telegram channel.

Ukrainians fleeing a Russian invasion have started trickling into Poland, with dozens arriving at the normally quiet Medyka crossing on Thursday, some carrying luggage and accompanied by children.

Officials in European Union countries bordering Ukraine, including Romania and Slovakia, said there was no big influx of refugees for now, but local media and witnesses said foot traffic was increasing.

According to a report by Reuters, Ukrainians also started trickling into Poland, “with dozens arriving at the normally quiet Medyka crossing on Thursday, some carrying luggage and accompanied by children.”

Even as officials said there was no big influx of refugees from Ukraine into Romania and Slovakia, the local media and witnesses said foot traffic was increasing.

When martial law is in effect, the military commander of an area or country has unlimited authority to make and enforce laws. Martial law is justified when civilian authority has ceased to function, is completely absent, or has become ineffective. Further, martial law suspends all existing laws, as well as civil authority and the ordinary administration of justice. In the United States, martial law may be declared by proclamation of the President or a State governor, but such a formal proclamation is not necessary. Although the U.S. Constitution makes no specific provision for the imposition of martial law, nearly every State has a constitutional provision authorizing the government to impose martial law. The power of martial law, once held to be nearly absolute, has limitations; for example, civilians may not be tried by military tribunals as long as civilian courts are functional. Nonetheless, within the bounds of court decisions, a military commander's authority under martial law is virtually unlimited. Martial law has been declared nine times since World War II and, in five instances, was designed to counter resistance to Federal desegregation decrees in the South. Although a climate of mutual aid has always existed between the military and civilian law enforcement and should continue to exist, Department of Defense personnel are limited in what they can do to enforce civil law. Military personnel cannot be used in surveillance or undercover operations, and they may not be used as informants, investigators, or interrogators unless the investigation is a joint military-civilian operation in which the military has an interest in the case's outcome.",https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/martial-law-times-civil-disorder

Dozens of people have been killed and injured from the military strikes aimed at Ukraine's biggest cities like Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. The country is mobilizing 36,000 reservists as it prepares for a full-scale invasion from the Kremlin.

Zelenskyy urged all citizens who wanted to defend their country to come forward and Kyiv would issue weapons to everyone who wants them, according to Reuters.

""We’re introducing martial law on the whole territory of our country,"" he said during a short video address on Thursday, CNN reported. ""We are working. The army is working. The whole sector of defense and security is working.""

What is martial law?

Martial law is the temporary substitution of military authority for civilian rule, according to the U.S Department of Justice.

The specifics of martial law differ from country to country, and it is usually invoked during times of war, rebellion and civil disorder.

""Martial law is essentially the absence of law,"" William Banks, a Syracuse University College of Law Board of Advisors Distinguished Professor, told USA TODAY previously. ""It's really an alien concept"" in the U.S., he added.

It generally means that military officials are in charge of applying law and not civilian leaders or police. It would apply to situations where the rule of law has broken down so much that law is no longer in place.

What does this mean for civilians in Ukraine?

By Zelenskyy invoking martial law, civilians in Ukraine will have to look to the military to enforce laws. He did not define what restrictive measures would be put in place while the law is active.

If a civilian is accused of breaching martial law, they could be tried in military tribunals if civilian courts aren't functioning, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

When has martial law been declared before?

In 2018, then Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko introduced martial law for 30 days after Russia fired upon and seized three Ukrainian naval vessels and their crews.

Former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law in 2017 across the southern third of the nation after militants tied to an Islamic State group beheaded a police chief, burned buildings and seized a Catholic priest.

It has been declared at least 68 times in the U.S. with the last time being in 1940 when the Oklahoma governor invoked martial law in an effort to prevent operation of the Grand River Dam, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

Earlier, the country imposed a nationwide state of emergency for 30 days. Introducing a state of emergency gives powers to the authorities, who can choose which ones to implement. These could include restrictions on transport, extra protection for critical infrastructure and a ban on strikes.

“We are working. The army is working,” Zelensky said, according to an English translation of part of his message from the Moscow bureau chief of the Financial Times. “Don’t panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything. We will defeat everyone. Because we are Ukraine.”

Putin’s announcement of a military campaign came just hours after Zelensky on Wednesday night rejected Moscow’s claims that his country posed a threat to Russia and made a passionate, last-minute plea for peace.

“The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,” Zelensky said in an emotional address, speaking in Russian in a direct appeal to Russian citizens. “But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.”

In his comments before the Russian assault began, Zelensky said he had asked to arrange a call with Putin but the Kremlin did not respond.

In an apparent reference to Putin’s move to authorize the deployment of the Russian military to “maintain peace” in eastern Ukraine, Zelensky warned that “this step could mark the start of a big war on the European continent.”
