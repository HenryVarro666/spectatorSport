UNITED NATIONS -- Six Western nations accused Russia of using the U.N. Security Council to launder disinformation, spread propaganda and justify an unprovoked attack on Ukraine on Friday, and the United States again warned that Moscow’s claim the U.S. has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine “is really a potential false flag effort in action.”

The meeting was originally intended for a vote on Russia’s draft resolution on humanitarian relief for Ukraine, which has been widely criticized for making no mention of Moscow’s invasion of its neighbor. But Russia canceled the vote Thursday and announced it would use the meeting instead to raise what it called new allegations of U.S. involvement in biological warfare activities. Those have been repeatedly denied by both the United States and Ukraine.

The six Western nations -- U.S., UK, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway -- delivered a joint statement just before the session saying: “This meeting and these lies are designed for one purpose, to deflect responsibility for Russia’s war of choice and the humanitarian catastrophe it has caused.”

They said that Russia, not Ukraine, has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law and has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons.

And they accused Russia of abusing its responsibilities and privileges as a permanent member of the Security Council and subverting the council's mandate to ensure international peace and security, calling its “horrific campaign of violence against the Ukrainian people ... deeply shameful.”

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, who read the joint statement, later told the Security Council not to forget why they were meeting — “because Russia knew its cynical ploy to pass an exculpatory resolution had failed” and it had to cancel Friday’s vote.

The resolution would have needed at least nine “yes” votes in the 15-member council and no veto by a permanent member to be approved. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia indicated it didn’t have the votes, accusing the West, and especially the U.S. and Albania, on Thursday of using “unprecedented pressure” on U.N. member nations to oppose the measure.

On Friday, Thomas-Greenfield reiterated what she told the council at a March 11 session called by Russia on its original bioweapons allegations: “Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program. There are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories -- not near Russia’s border, not anywhere.”

Ukraine only has public health facilities supported by the United States, the World Health Organization, and other governments and international institutions, she said.

Reiterating the Biden administration’s concern about a potential false flag effort, Thomas-Greenfield said, “We continue to believe it is possible that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people.”

Nebenzia responded by calling accusations that Russia intends to deploy biological and chemical weapons against Ukraine “real cynicism.”

“We’ve already warned about the fact that we know, and we officially warned ... about Ukrainian nationalists using chemical agents in some regions to carry out a provocation and then accuse Russia of having done it,” he said. “This is a false flag operation.”

Last week, Nebenzia said Russia’s Defense Ministry has documents charging that Ukraine has at least 30 biological laboratories carrying out “very dangerous biological experiments” involving pathogens, and the work “is being done and funded and supervised by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the United States.”

He circulated a 69-page document to council members at Friday’s meeting and claimed that the Ministry of Defense had received new details over the last week “which allow us to state that the components for biological weapons were being created on the territory of Ukraine” to implement a 2005 American-Ukrainian agreement.

“Put simply the Ukraine authorities gave the Pentagon carte blanche on the territory of Ukraine to carry out dangerous biological experiments there,” Nebenzia asserted.

Ukraine does own and operate a network of biological labs that have gotten funding and research support from the U.S. They are part of an initiative called the Biological Threat Reduction Program that aims to reduce the likelihood of deadly outbreaks, whether natural or manmade. The U.S. efforts date back to work in the 1990s to dismantle the former Soviet Union’s program for weapons of mass destruction.

“The labs are not secret,” Filippa Lentzos, a senior lecturer in science and international security at King’s College London, said in an email to The Associated Press last week. “They are not being used in relation to bioweapons. This is all disinformation.”

Britain’s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward, referring to the March 11 meeting called by Russia, said Friday: “It was nonsense then, and it is nonsense now.”

U.N. disarmament chief Izumi Nakamitsu reiterated what she told the council last week: The United Nations is not aware of any such biological weapons program"" and has no mandate to investigate the Russian claims.

Russia’s Nebenzia called the material it released on March 11 and on Friday “only the tip of the iceberg.”

He said the Ministry of Defense is receiving and analyzing more new material and will continue to keep the Security Council and the international community informed “about the unlawful activity carried out by the Pentagon on Ukrainian territory.”

Russia presented its draft humanitarian resolution on Tuesday, a day after France and Mexico announced that their own humanitarian resolution on Ukraine was being moved from the Security Council, where it was certain to face a Russian veto, to the 193-member General Assembly, where there are no vetoes.

The France-Mexico draft resolution would demand “an immediate cessation of hostilities” and deplore “the dire humanitarian consequences of the hostilities against Ukraine,” provisions not in the Russian resolution.

French Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere told reporters Thursday the resolution will be presented to the General Assembly next week. Britain’s Woodward expressed hope that it would get more than the 141 votes received by a March 2 resolution demanding an immediate halt to Moscow’s offensive against Ukraine and withdrawal of all Russian troops.",https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/west-accuses-russia-council-spread-propaganda-83534577

Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared Friday at a flag-waving rally at a packed Moscow stadium and praised his troops fighting in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, the leader of Russia's delegation in diplomatic talks with Ukraine said the sides have narrowed their differences. The Ukrainian side said its position remained unchanged.

The invasion has touched off a burst of anti-war protests inside Russia, and the Moscow rally was surrounded by suspicions that it was a Kremlin-manufactured display of patriotism.

Several Telegram channels critical of the Kremlin reported that students and employees of state institutions in a number of regions were ordered by their superiors to attend rallies and concerts marking the eighth anniversary of Moscow's annexation of Crimea, which was seized from Ukraine. Those reports could not be independently verified.

""Shoulder to shoulder, they help and support each other,"" Putin said of the Kremlin's forces in a rare public appearance since the start of the war.

Moscow police said more than 200,000 people were in and around the Luzhniki stadium. The event included patriotic songs, such as a performance of ""Made in the U.S.S.R.,"" with the opening lines of ""Ukraine and Crimea, Belarus and Moldova, it's all my country.""

Taking to the stage where a sign read ""For a world without Nazism,"" Putin railed against his foes in Ukraine with a claim that they are ""neo-Nazis."" Putin continued to insist that his actions were necessary to prevent ""genocide"" -- an idea rejected by leaders around the globe.

In the wake of the invasion, the Kremlin has clamped down harder on dissent and the flow of information, arresting thousands of anti-war protesters; banning sites such as Facebook and Twitter; and instituting tough prison sentences for what is deemed to be false reporting on the war, which Moscow refers to as a ""special military operation.""

The OVD-Info rights group that monitors political arrests reported that at least seven independent journalists had been detained ahead of or while covering the anniversary events in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

In Moscow, Putin stood onstage in a white turtleneck and a blue down jacket and spoke for about five minutes. Some people, including presenters at the event, wore T-shirts or jackets with a ""Z"" -- a symbol seen on Russian tanks and other military vehicles in Ukraine and embraced by supporters of the war.

Putin's quoting of the Bible and an 18th-century Russian admiral reflected his increasing focus in recent years on history and religion as binding forces in Russia's post-Soviet society. His branding of his enemies as Nazis evoked what many Russians consider the defense of the motherland from Germany during World War II.

The rally came as Vladimir Medinsky, who led Russian negotiators in several rounds of talks with Ukraine, said that the sides have moved closer to agreement on the issue of Ukraine dropping its bid to join NATO and adopting a neutral status.

""That is the issue where the parties have made their positions maximally close,"" Medinsky said in remarks carried by Russian media. He added that the sides are now ""halfway"" on issues regarding the demilitarization of Ukraine.

Mikhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, characterized the Russian assessment as intended ""to provoke tension in the media."" He tweeted: ""Our positions are unchanged. Ceasefire, withdrawal of troops & strong security guarantees with concrete formulas.""

Zelenskyy again appealed to Putin to hold talks with him directly. ""It's time to meet, time to speak,"" he said. ""I want to be heard by everyone, especially in Moscow.""

RUSSIAN ATTACKS

Elsewhere, Russian forces extended their bombardments Friday into a relatively unscathed part of western Ukraine, striking a warplane repair plant about 50 miles from the Polish border.

Zelenskyy said Russian forces are blockading the largest cities to create a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" with the goal of persuading Ukrainians to cooperate. He said the Russians are preventing supplies from reaching surrounded cities in central and southeastern Ukraine.

""This is a totally deliberate tactic,"" Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation, which was recorded outside in Kyiv, with the presidential office behind him.

The Russian missile strike about 4 miles from the western city of Lviv destroyed several buildings that were used to repair aircraft. It was the closest strike yet to the center of Lviv, which has become a crossroads for people fleeing from other parts of Ukraine and for others entering to deliver aid or join the fight. The war has swelled the city's inhabitants by some 200,000.

The Lviv strike appeared to be an attempt to weaken the Ukrainian military's air defenses. According to a local news article in January, the plant had been the only facility in the country that repaired MiG-29 fighter jets for Ukraine's air force.

Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovy said that work had already stopped at the plant and that no casualties had been reported. Ukraine said it had shot down two of six missiles in the volley, which came from the Black Sea.

Zelenskyy boasted that Ukraine's defenses have proved much stronger than expected, and Russia ""didn't know what we had for defense or how we prepared to meet the blow.""

Ukrainian officials said late Friday that the besieged southern port city of Mariupol lost its access to the Azov Sea, and Russian forces were still trying to storm the city. It was unclear whether they had seized it.

But British Chief of Defense Intelligence Lt. Gen. Jim Hockenhull warned that after failing to take major Ukrainian cities, Russian forces are shifting to a ""strategy of attrition"" that will entail ""reckless and indiscriminate use of firepower,"" resulting in higher civilian casualties and a worsening humanitarian crisis.

In city after city around Ukraine, hospitals, schools and buildings where people sought safety have been attacked. Rescue workers continued to search for survivors in the ruins of a theater that was being used a shelter when it was blasted by a Russian airstrike Wednesday in Mariupol.

Ludmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian Parliament's human-rights commissioner, said at least 130 people had survived the theater bombing.

""But according to our data, there are still more than 1,300 people in these basements, in this bomb shelter,"" Denisova told Ukrainian television. ""We pray that they will all be alive, but so far there is no information about them.""

Satellite images on Friday from Maxar Technologies showed a long line of cars leaving Mariupol as people tried to evacuate, as well as devastation to homes, apartment buildings and stores.

Early morning barrages also hit a residential building in the Podil neighborhood of Kyiv, killing at least one person, according to emergency services, which said 98 people were evacuated from the building. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said 19 were wounded in the shelling.

Ukrainian officials said a fireman was killed when Russian forces shelled an area where firefighters were trying to put out a blaze in the village of Nataevka, in the Zaporizhzhia region.

Two others were killed when strikes hit residential and administrative buildings in the eastern city of Kramatorsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko.

Maj. Gen. Oleksandr Pavlyuk, who is leading the defense of the region around Ukraine's capital, said his forces are well-positioned to defend the city and vowed: ""We will never give up. We will fight until the end, to the last breath and to the last bullet.""

DISPLACED UKRAINIANS

The U.N. migration agency said Friday that nearly 6.5 million people have been displaced inside Ukraine, on top of the 3.2 million who have already fled the country.

That means that around a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people have been forced from their homes.

The estimates from the International Organization for Migration suggests Ukraine is fast on course to reach the levels of displacement from Syria's civil war, which has driven about 13 million people from their homes.

The findings came in a paper issued Friday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

The projections also found that ""over 12 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation.""

The paper cited the International Organization for Migration figures as ""a good representation of the scale of internal displacement in Ukraine -- calculated to stand at 6.48 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine as of March 16.""

The U.N. refugee agency has said fighting that has followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sparked Europe's gravest refugee crisis since World War II.

""By these estimates, roughly half the country is either internally displaced, stranded in affected areas or unable to leave, or has already fled to neighboring countries,"" the agency said, alluding to Ukraine's population of about 44 million before the war began.

The paper said that 9.56 million people had been displaced by the war as of Wednesday, and another 2.2 million people were considering leaving. The International Organization for Migration estimates that more than 3 million people had fled abroad as of Wednesday.

The refugee agency, in its latest figures released Friday, said more than 3.2 million people have fled Ukraine.

SECURITY COUNCIL

Six Western nations on Friday accused Russia of using the U.N. Security Council to launder disinformation, spread propaganda and justify an unprovoked attack on Ukraine, and the United States again warned that Moscow's claim that the U.S. has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine ""is really a potential false flag effort in action.""

The meeting was originally intended for a vote on Russia's draft resolution on humanitarian relief for Ukraine, which has been widely criticized for making no mention of Moscow's invasion of its neighbor.

But Russia canceled the vote Thursday and announced it would use the meeting instead to raise what it called new allegations of U.S. involvement in biological warfare activities. Those have been repeatedly denied by both the United States and Ukraine.

The U.S., United Kingdom, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway delivered a joint statement just before the session saying: ""This meeting and these lies are designed for one purpose, to deflect responsibility for Russia's war of choice and the humanitarian catastrophe it has caused.""

The six nations said Russia, not Ukraine, has long maintained a biological weapons program in violation of international law and has a well-documented history of using chemical weapons.

And they accused Russia of abusing its responsibilities and privileges as a permanent member of the Security Council and subverting the council's mandate to ensure international peace and security, calling its ""horrific campaign of violence against the Ukrainian people ... deeply shameful.""

3,42f0160b-3a15-4ef7-93ee-b11cfa746e0f,[],,"The UN Charter establishes the membership of the Security Council. The following information is from the UN Membership research guide:

Permanent Members

According to Oppenheim's International Law : United Nations, ""Permanent membership in the Security Council was granted to five states based on their importance in the aftermath of World War II."" Sometimes referred to as the P5, the permanent members of the Security Council have a unique role that has evolved over time.

UN Research Resources on the P5:

Non-permanent Members

The membership of the Security Council is one of the most debated aspects of the United Nations. The matter of non-permanent membership has been discussed continually since 1945. In addition to discussions during the drafting of the Charter, the topic has been raised both in and out of formal UN meetings, in informal forums and scholarly articles. The question of the composition of the Security Council has been examined both within the UN in various bodies and by outside organizations, scholars and researchers. Over time, there have been many proposals and positions put forward.

Membership of Security Council

Security Council website members database provides states elected, states never elected, and membership by year

Ask DAG: Which countries have been members of the Security Council? lists membership by year and links to meetings at which elections were held

UN Member States on the Record has information on when a country was a member of the Security Council, among other things

Equitable Geographic Representation

The question of how to apportion the available seats among regional groups has been debated repeatedly. In 1953 when the General Assembly met to elect non-permanent members to the Security Council, the delegate of the USSR referred to an oral ""gentleman’s agreement"" about the number of seats to be accorded various regions (A/PV.450). Until the amendment of the Charter in accordance with A/RES/1991 (XVIII), there was no formally prescribed number of seats for any region.

From 1994-2009, the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council and Other Matters related to the Security Council was the main UN body charged with discussing this matter. The reports of the Working Group provide an overview of their proposals, discussions and recommendations. The following information about the Working Group is from the UN Charter research guide:

Additional proposals:

A/59/565: Note transmitting A more secure world : our shared responsibility : report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change

A/59/L.64: Security Council reform : draft resolution ; also known as the Group of 4 proposal for the initial sponsors of the draft resolution: Japan, Brazil, Germany, India

UN Research Resources on Equitable Representation

Research Suggestions

There are many ways to approach research on this topic.

One way is to begin with a general internet search to find positions by think tanks, NGOs or organizations. Much has been published online. Keep in mind general principles of research and carefully evaluate the perspective or opinion of the author and the quality and source of the information provided.

Another way is to begin with secondary resources such as books and articles, including scholarly sources on the United Nations. These resources often cite relevant UN documents, which can then be found in the UN Digital Library or other sources. The Resource pages of the research guides on the Security Council and the UN Charter can provide some starting points for research on secondary sources.

Another approach is to look directly into UN documents such as meeting records, letters and reports. With this approach, keep in mind that the General Assembly determines the composition of the Security Council and is the main organ where debate on this topic has happened. The Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs contains detailed studies on Article 23 about the practice of the General Assembly in relation to the elections to the Security Council. This topic may be raised in the General Assembly in relation to several agenda items which have changed over time, including the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Security Council, UN reform, and Charter amendment. States have also made statements on this matter during the general debate.",https://ask.un.org/faq/14518
4,42f0160b-3a15-4ef7-93ee-b11cfa746e0f,['Susan Kurtas'],,"According to the UN Charter, Article 23, ""The Security Council shall consist of fifteen Members of the United Nations"".

The Security Council has 15 members:

5 permanent members with veto power: China France Russian Federation United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland United States of America

10 non-permanent members, five of which are elected each year by the General Assembly for a two-year term

Originally, there were 11 members of the Security Council: 5 permanent and 6 non-permanent members. In 1963, the General Assembly recommended an amendment to the Charter to increase the membership of the Security Council:

A/RES/1991 (XVIII) of 17 December 1963

Entered into force on 31 August 1965

Increased membership from 11 to 15

Changed the number of affirmative votes required from 7 to 9

Set the pattern for geographic representation as follows: 5 from African and Asian States 1 from Eastern European States 2 from Latin American States 2 from Western European and other States



Rules 142-144 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly (A/520/Rev.19) concern the Security Council elections.

UN Charter Article 27(3) states that votes in the Security Council on non-procedural matters ""shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members including the concurring votes of the permanent members""-- this is often called the veto power of permanent members.

Amnesty International called the strike “a merciless, indiscriminate attack on people as they went about their daily business” and urged the International Criminal Court to investigate it as a potential war crime.

The international response was quick. The U.S. State Department condemned the violence in an unusually blunt statement, and the British Parliament introduced legislation denouncing apartheid—though both resisted imposing economic sanctions. By April 1, the United Nations Security Council had adopted a resolution deploring the massacre and calling on South Africa to abandon apartheid. A few weeks later, the U.N. General Assembly declared South Africa in flagrant violation of its charter.

On March 21, 1960, thousands of Black South Africans gathered in Sharpeville, near Johannesburg, to protest the white minority government’s restrictive pass laws. As the crowd grew, the police fired indiscriminately at the unarmed protesters, killing 69 people and injuring 180.

Amnesty International called the strike “a merciless, indiscriminate attack on people as they went about their daily business” and urged the International Criminal Court to investigate it as a potential war crime.

After several more days of Russian shelling and bombing of civilian areas throughout Ukraine—including a maternity hospital—the best South African President Cyril Ramaphosa could muster in response to clear evidence of human rights abuses was a series of tweets on March 10 deferentially thanking “His Excellency President Vladimir Putin” for taking his call and noting South Africa’s “balanced approach” calling for “mediation and negotiation between the parties.”

It was a far cry from the international solidarity and condemnation of apartheid brutality that Black South Africans received in the wake of Sharpeville.

South Africa today appears to be driven by a fetish for nonalignment and negotiation—even in the face of naked aggression—and nostalgia for the Cold War when Moscow offered stalwart support for the liberation movement, rather than a clear-eyed assessment of contemporary Russia and a consistent commitment to its self-proclaimed moral foreign policy. Instead, its leaders are parroting Russian security arguments identical to those once used by the apartheid regime to justify its violence against neighboring countries.

South Africa’s decision to abstain in the March 2 U.N. General Assembly vote condemning Russia’s invasion was the most dramatic sign of Pretoria’s refusal to take a principled stand. It justified the abstention—on a resolution that 141 nations backed while just five sided with Russia and 35 abstained (including 16 other African countries)—by arguing that the wording of the resolution prevented the possibility of effective dialogue.

South African diplomats argued the text did “not create an environment conducive for diplomacy, dialogue, and mediation” and “could drive a deeper wedge between the parties rather than contributing to a resolution of the conflict.”

But this position is untenable. It is premised on the false belief that Russia and Ukraine carry equal responsibility for the invasion. Russia invaded Ukraine, unprovoked. By doing so, it violated Ukraine’s right to national sovereignty that is guaranteed under international law. The South African position simply creates unwarranted moral equivalence between Russia’s unlawful aggression and Ukraine’s justified defensive posture.

Contemporary Russia is the world’s leading sponsor of far-right parties and stands for everything the ANC was created to oppose.

Morality, of course, is never the key driver of states’ foreign-policy decisions, and South Africa is no exception. Yet the government of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party spent decades appealing to the world’s moral conscience during its struggle against apartheid, and Pretoria’s diplomats have spent much of the post-1994 era fashioning an image of South Africa as a moral beacon and a defender of human rights at home and abroad. While hard-nosed realpolitik is to be expected in countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran, South Africa has set a higher bar for itself—and failing to live up to the image it has created risks jeopardizing its international standing, especially when the legal and moral issues are so starkly clear.

This fence-sitting over Ukraine is not the first time post-apartheid South Africa has strayed from its own self-proclaimed values. The moral authority South Africa developed by modeling a relatively peaceful transition to a constitutional democracy has been slowly squandered by its failure to stand up for human rights elsewhere.

Pretoria’s indulgence of Robert Mugabe’s brutal dictatorship and electoral manipulation in neighboring Zimbabwe was followed by its refusal to arrest then-Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on South African soil in 2015 (thereby violating both international and domestic law) and its inconsistent voting on gay rights at the U.N. Human Rights Council, despite South Africa’s famously progressive constitutional protections for queer people. While South African diplomats may still believe the country acts as a moral exemplar on the world stage, as Nelson Mandela famously envisioned, that assumption has long been questionable, and the government’s current approach to Ukraine could lay it to rest for good.

Economic links to Russia are a factor, but they are relatively small and do not explain South Africa’s position. Under former President Jacob Zuma’s rule, Pretoria built closer ties to Moscow, joining the BRICS group and trying to attract more Russian investment in South Africa—including a doomed nuclear power project. But traditional partners such as Germany and the United Kingdom are far more significant trading partners. Indeed, as South African analyst Mandla Isaacs has noted, only China and India among the BRICS make South Africa’s top 10 list of export markets; Russia isn’t even in the top 30. Thus, the economic consequences of criticizing Putin would be negligible.

What is driving South Africa’s behavior is not realpolitik but misguided nostalgia. The ANC is stuck in the 1980s and clings to a rose-tinted view of the old Soviet Union that aided it during the anti-apartheid struggle and trained many of its leaders, including Zuma.

The warm feelings many South Africans—and other Africans—have for the Soviet era are understandable given the economic, military, and diplomatic assistance Moscow provided to liberation movements across the continent at a time when the United States and Europe opposed them and even provided aid to their oppressors. But these loyalties and perceived historical debts have blinded South Africa’s leaders to the reality of what contemporary Russia has become.

Pretoria has failed to recognize that Putin’s Russia is not the anti-imperialist patron of liberation movements that it once adored; it is an overtly imperialist state trying to reconstitute its old empire and has become the leading global patron of far-right white nationalist parties. While the Soviet Union of course had its own imperial tendencies, contemporary Russia has actively courted xenophobic parties in Italy and Austria, helped finance far-right candidate Marine Le Pen’s campaign in France, and most famously interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through social media efforts that favored Republican candidate Donald Trump, according to the U.S. Justice Department. In short, contemporary Russia stands for everything the ANC was created to oppose.

Old loyalties and perceived historical debts have blinded South Africa’s leaders to the reality of what today’s Russia has become.

Zuma has gone so far as to claim “Ukraine is being used basically as a front, so that Russia can be brought to its knees”—precisely the same argument the apartheid regime used to justify violent incursions into neighboring countries that sheltered Zuma and his ANC comrades during the liberation struggle. “The free world wants to feed South Africa to the Red Crocodile, to appease its hunger,” the apartheid leader P.W. Botha famously said. If South Africa didn’t strike beyond its borders, the apartheid government liked to argue, a revolutionary vanguard in neighboring states threatened to gain a foothold in South Africa and bring what would be the death knell of apartheid—a one-person, one-vote democracy.

Zuma’s references to a “security risk to Russia” and Ramaphosa’s assertion that “the war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings from amongst its own leaders” about eastward expansion effectively excuse Russia’s armed aggression on security grounds—putting the ANC in the awkward position of endorsing the military logic used against it by the white supremacist regime that it fought for decades to dislodge.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the apartheid government’s military strategy was premised on what Botha called “total onslaught”—the perception that communist-backed forces were encroaching on the mineral-rich last outpost of white civilization on the African continent and had to be stopped.

By excusing Russia’s invasion, the ANC is endorsing the military logic used against it by the white supremacist regime that it fought for decades to dislodge.

South African defense spending tripled in the early 1970s as the apartheid regime watched Portugal’s colonies fall in Mozambique and Angola—a country that Pretoria invaded in 1975, leading to the arrival of tens of thousands of Cuban troops and a protracted war. In response to this perceived total onslaught, South African military leaders developed what they called “total strategy”—using the power of Pretoria’s military machine and regional economic dominance to intimidate neighboring states and target the ANC in any nation that dared to host it. The goal, as one scholar wrote in 1985, was to force neighbors “to accept de facto South African regional domination and … accommodate themselves to the apartheid system”—a foreign policy remarkably similar to Putin’s current approach to the post-Soviet space.

South Africa repeatedly invaded its neighbors in order to keep the perceived communist threat at bay. The apartheid regime assassinated ANC members and nearby civilians, armed anti-liberation movement proxies, and made military incursions into Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. While military leaders spoke of the “rooi gevaar” (red threat), what they really feared was the “swart gevaar” (black threat).

The apartheid regime used the argument of communist encroachment to gain diplomatic support and arms from the United States, from Europe, and later—when the West began to have second thoughts—from Israel, which became a crucial source during the 1980s. Although there was a nearby armed enemy in the form of Cuban troops in Angola (much as Putin points to NATO member states and U.S. weaponry in Eastern Europe today), the real fear was not so much communist invasion—after all, South Africa had developed basic nuclear weapons by the early 1980s—but the specter of postcolonial winds blowing south and bringing democratic rule to Pretoria.

Similarly, Putin today is seeking to preserve his undemocratic regime amid a sea of emerging democracies. His approach of terrorizing Ukraine to prevent the encroachment of liberal ideas at home is anathema to everything that the ANC stands for and the ideals on which a democratic South Africa was founded.

South Africa’s government likes to claim it is building bridges between the global north and south and respecting multilateral forums—even offering itself as a mediator despite Turkey and Israel being more likely and more logical candidates.

The idea of effective negotiation should not be dismissed and South Africa’s successful avoidance of outright civil war through political dialogue is a genuine point of pride for the country. Indeed, Ramaphosa himself, as a trade union leader and later as one of the chief negotiators of the South African Constitution, thinks of negotiation as his superpower—recalling in Parliament this week the role South Africa played in Northern Ireland’s peace talks.

But the current Russian position on Ukraine does not allow for the sort of negotiation Ramaphosa envisions; Putin has embarked on an unprovoked war against a sovereign state that undercuts the most basic preconditions for negotiation—a willingness to seek peace and some respect between interlocutors. Putin’s ongoing bombing of civilians and seizure of Ukrainian territory make it impossible for Ramaphosa’s 1990s negotiation template to be exported to Ukraine.

A commitment to negotiated peace does not necessitate silence in the face of human rights violations.

As admirable as his commitment to negotiated peace may be in theory, it does not necessitate silence in the face of human rights violations. A country can play a serious and effective role as a negotiator—as French President Emmanuel Macron has shown through his ongoing discussions with Putin—while still condemning acts of war that are not justified.

While more principled African peers such as Ghana and Kenya adopt a stance that respects international legal norms, South Africa is simply muzzling itself in the face of Russia’s blatant violation of the U.N. Charter on the basis of tsarist-era imperial claims to another nation’s sovereign territory that Putin has elucidated in his own writings and speeches. (And for South Africa’s nostalgic Bolsheviks, it is worth noting that Putin’s historical claim is not grounded in Soviet thought; in fact, it is premised on an explicit repudiation of Vladimir Lenin.)

Ramaphosa’s silence will also undermine the president’s brand at home. His election to the positions of both ANC presidency and South African presidency was meant to be a decisive break from the moral delinquency and epic corruption of the Zuma era and a moral renewal of the governing ANC.

Yet, the two men’s responses to Putin—Zuma backing Putin and Ramaphosa pretending there is no clear aggressor in Ukraine—demonstrate awkward continuities in the ANC’s relationship with Russia. Ramaphosa’s indifference to Russia’s violation of international law makes it hard to sustain the view that his ANC is a corrective to Zuma’s.

It turns out there is only one ANC—and it has behaved with moral cowardice on the world stage in the face of Putin’s illegal war.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/18/south-africa-ukraine-russia-putin-ramaphosa-war-diplomacy-negotiation/

Prof Akiho Shibata

Professor of International Law and Director, Polar Cooperation Research Centre (PCRC)

Kobe University (Japan)

Prof Akiho Shibata responds to an article by Dr Alan Hemmings published on The Polar Connection on 18 March 2022: Does the Antarctic Treaty System have a moral duty to respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine

As of today, 20 March, what Alan Hemmings has described as “silence” and “no responses whatsoever” from the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) continues, while the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty are busy preparing for the Working Papers/Information Papers for the upcoming 44th Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties (ATCM) to be held in Berlin, Germany, from 23 May to 2 June 2022. In fact, ATS is an awkward “system” with limited means to have one voice as a collective entity. Unless the ATCM is physically meeting, what it can do to “respond” to an urgent issue, if indeed necessary, would be:

(1) The Executive Secretary of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat in Buenos Aires, Argentina, delivers a statement after “intersessional consultations” as provided in Rule 46 of the ATCM Rules of Procedure, “when the exigencies of the circumstances require action to be taken before the opening of the next ATCM”;

(2) A joint statement of the like-minded Parties of the Antarctic Treaty, similar to the one issued by the Arctic seven members of the Arctic Council on March 3, 2022; and/or

(3) A unilateral statement by the host government regarding the convening of the 44th Meeting, after careful consultations amongst the Antarctic Treaty Parties but not necessarily based on the consensus of all the Parties.

Option (1) above would be unrealistic as any such statement will require an affirmative consent of all Consultative Parties, including the Russian Federation, according to Rule 46. Option (2) would not be an ATS response, both in its formality as well as in its substance. Formally speaking, the ATS has no procedural means to issue a politically sensitive statement without the consensus of at least all the Consultative Parties of the Antarctic Treaty (at the moment, 29 Parties out of 54). Substantively, as Alan Hemmings correctly observed, the like-minded Parties may not be “all minus Russia” in the case of the Antarctic Treaty, unlike the case in the Arctic Council. In this context, an observation by Timo Koivurova is pertinent in comparing the different legal contexts of the Arctic Council being an international forum established by a non-legally binding resolution, whereas ATCM being a treaty-based Meeting (Art. IX of the Antarctic Treaty) involving rights and obligations of the Parties under international law.

What Alan Hemmings suggested was (3) above, using the host government’s authority to postpone/suspend/cancel a ATCM as “the least-worst option” for the ATS to fulfill its moral duty in face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In fact, in 2020, Finland as the expected host of the 43rd Meeting decided to cancel it because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of course, for that occasion, I assume there were prior consultations amongst the Parties, and its decision was agreed upon by all the Consultative Parties, including the consequences of such cancellation. Alan Hemmings seems to assimilate this option with the decision of the Arctic seven not to send delegates to the Arctic Council meetings held in the Russian Federation as the Chair of those meetings and to suspend their participation in all subsidiary bodies of the Arctic Council wherever they may be held. The factual effect might be the same that those meetings will not be convened, but the legal authorities to achieve the same result as well as their legal consequences are very much different.

The policy as well as legal justifications for the German government to take such a decision, if it were to take such action in response to the Ukraine situation, would have profound significance for the future of the ATS. Here, I disagree with many of the points raised by Alan Hemmings. First, Alan Hemmings stated that “the opportunity-cost of not being able to have an ATCM may not be that high in terms of actual Antarctic outcome”, and gave examples of legally binding Measures not being adopted in the last 12 years. He also mentions there would be no “prospects of breakthrough on any significant Antarctic issue”. Being a regular participant himself, Alan Hemmings knows very well the significance and value of having annual meetings of the ATCM, where Parties exchange information and have intimate discussions as regards their Antarctic activities in light of their obligations under the Treaty and the Madrid Protocol, one such obligation being the peaceful use of the Antarctic and the prohibition of any measures of a military nature (Art. I). It is true that the ATCM can only proceed with the consensus of all the Consultative Parties, but, because it is consensus-based, a continuous and tireless effort by all involved to obtain such consensus through face-to-face discussions is so crucial, particularly in the context of the Antarctic Treaty System.

Second, Alan Hemmings seems to suggest that the stake is too high – that the postponement of ATCM should be accepted as an “inconvenience in the course of repudiating a crime”. He indicates (a) participation of Russian and Belarusian delegations in the Meeting; (b) possibility of the Ukraine delegation being absent due to the war; and (c) the place of the Meeting (Berlin) being only 900 km from the war theatre; are unthinkable.

As to (b) and (c), I think it is crucial for the German host government to ensure that all delegations, including the Ukraine delegation, are logistically and physically able to attend the Meeting in Berlin. I concur with Alan Hemmings that, if Ukraine delegation cannot participate in the Meeting due to the current situation, the Meeting should be postponed and/or re-arranged so as to make sure that the Ukraine delegation can fully participate in the Meeting. As was the case in 2020 during COVID-19, if travelling to Berlin would pose serious safety risks for certain delegations and/or, for other delegations and expert organisations (including NGOs), tremendous financial costs due to restricted flights into Europe, I concur with Alan Hemmings that the Meeting should be postponed/re-arranged, with a concrete proposal for such a postponed/re-arranged meeting in the near future. We have historical precedent to take into account political sensitivities in deciding the place of an ATCM – for example, during the apartheid era, some Consultative Parties did not have diplomatic relations with each other, making it difficult to hold the meeting in such countries.

The gist of Alan Hemmings argument is actually on point (a) above – that is, whether the ATS as a collective entity or the German host government could legally and appropriately disallow the Russian (and Belarusian) delegations to attend the next ATCM in Berlin, and, if that is not possible, his suggestion was to cancel or postpone the entire Meeting. This reasoning must be carefully examined: first, from a legal perspective, and then from the perspective of, within the legally permitted actions, what would be the best policy option for the ATS as a whole.

The legal issue here is not whether Germany can disallow the members of the Russian delegation to enter the territory of Germany, which can be done relatively easily, based on, for example, security reasons. The Antarctic Treaty Secretariat Headquarters’ Agreement provides for privileges and immunities of ATCM delegates only towards the Argentinian government as the host of the Secretariat (Art.15). Unlike the delegation to the United Nations or those meetings convened under it, with its privileges and immunities provided under the relevant Convention (see in particular Art. 4 on Representative of Members), the delegations to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings would not have such immunities from immigration restrictions, unless they try to enter the country as accredited diplomats to be posted at or return to the Russian Embassy/Consul in Germany. However, such immigration restrictions by the German host would not prevent the Russian diplomats already in Germany to attend the ATCM in Berlin. It is very common that many delegations to the ATCM include Ambassadors and diplomats posted at the embassies of the host country, especially when the Meeting is held at the capital of that country, where many embassies are located.

Thus, what Alan Hemmings suggests was to disallow the Russian (and Belarusian) delegations to participate in the ATCM itself. This measure, if enforced, will infringe an internationally protected right of the Russian Federation under Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty to attend the ATCM. Art. IX provides that “Representatives of the Contracting Parties named in the preamble to the present Treaty shall meet … at suitable intervals and places, for the purposes of…consulting together on matters of common interests pertaining to Antarctica, and formulating…measures in furtherance of the principles and objectives of the Treaty” (emphasis added). The Russian Federation as a successor state of the former Soviet Union is indeed one of the 12 original Parties to the Treaty named in the preamble, and the use of the term “shall meet” indicates it is a legally protected right to be invited and to participate in such consultation and formulation of the measures. It is also correct, as Alan Hemmings has suggested, that a delegation can voluntarily decide not to attend the meeting or participate in the specific decision-making. In such cases, if the quorum for the Meeting under the Rule of Procedure is satisfied, the Meeting is duly constituted, and any measures, decisions and recommendations adopted by “the Representatives of all Consultative Parties present” without the votes of those voluntarily absent will have their designated legal effects. There could be cases where, through established internal rules of the organisations or meetings, the voting right of a certain member/party may be suspended. Many organisations have internal rules providing for non-payment of dues as reasons for temporary suspension of voting rights. No such rules are currently established under the ATCM Rules of Procedure.

Thus, the legal question is: Can Germany as the host country or the Treaty Parties collectively disallow the Russian delegation against its will to participate in the Meeting and its decision-making and still claim the Meeting is duly constituted and its decision has legal force? Some scholars may invoke Article 60, paragraph 2 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) as a possible legal means to suspend the operation of the Antarctic Treaty in relation with Russia (more specifically, the operation of the right of Russian Federation to participate in the ATCM as per Art. IX of the Treaty) as a consequence of its material breach of the Treaty either (a) by a unanimous agreement of the Treaty Parties other than those in breach; (b) by a party specifically affected by the breach (probably by Ukraine); and (c) any party if the Treaty is of such a character that a material breach changes the position of every party with respect to the further performance of its obligations under the Treaty. This provision is rarely invoked in practice and the scholarly work is limited.

However, in the present case, the Russian aggression against Ukraine may be a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter, but to claim that such action is concurrently a material breach of the Antarctic Treaty so as to justify a suspension of Russian right under the Treaty is, to say the least, very tenuous. This discreet interpretation comes from the strict reading of the geographical scope of the Antarctic Treaty as provided in Art. VI: “[T]he present Treaty shall apply to the area south of 60 South Latitude, including ice shelves”. This provision has worked well in insulating the Antarctic Treaty System from extraneous considerations. Military operations/aggression conducted outside of this area will not by themselves violate any provisions of the Treaty.

A more relevant, but still tenuous, legal justification not to invite Russian Federation to the ATCM is to invoke the international law of state responsibility, particularly the law relating to countermeasures as a circumstance precluding its wrongfulness and in accordance with the criteria set by the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (2001). Countermeasures may be taken against a responsible state – that is, a state that is in breach of international obligation – so as to justify the non-performance of its obligation towards that responsible state. In this case, Germany or other Antarctic Treaty Parties may suspend the participatory right of the Russian Federation under the Antarctic Treaty as a countermeasure against Russia for its violation of UN Charter as well as customary international law on the prohibition of use of force against territorial integrity of another state. According to the ILC’s Articles, the countermeasures are to be taken by the “injured state” – in the present case, by Ukraine.

Article 54 of the ILC’s Articles, however, provides that these provisions do not prejudice the right of any state other than the injured states to take “lawful measures against that [responsible] state to ensure cessation of the breach” when the obligations being breached are owed to the international community as a whole. The prohibition of the use of force against territorial integrity or political independence of another state is considered as jus cogens and indeed an obligation owed to the international community as a whole. Article 54, however, is ambiguous and leaves all options open, reflecting the divergent views of states and scholars. There is a legal risk in invoking such an argument in the present context.

Considering the tenuous nature of legal arguments in justifying the suspension of participatory right of the Russian Federation in the present case, a hasty decision not to allow the Russian delegation in the Meeting room, which of course would be physically enforceable by the German government, may jeopardise the whole Meeting and all of its decisions. What Alan Hemmings indicated as “the most obvious option, if the ATCM is to proceed, is to prevent Russia and Belarus attending” is, according to my evaluation, the most legally risky option for the Germany and the Antarctic Treaty Parties to consider.

The policy implications of taking such a course of action by the German government in consultation with the like-minded Parties, which could be considered by the opposing Parties as a unilateral suspension of one provision of the Antarctic Treaty in relation to a few Treaty Parties, could also be devastating for the whole of the Antarctic Treaty System. Such a course of action, with tenuous legal basis, may instigate counter-unilateral suspension by other Parties of more significant provisions of the Antarctic Treaty – for example, the obligations to accept inspectors to their Antarctic stations as per Article VII (3) of the Antarctic Treaty and Article 14 (3) of the Madrid Protocol. These exchanges of temporary suspensions of Treaty provisions may well be the beginning of a permanent dysfunction of the Antarctic Treaty System as a whole.

The silence of the Antarctic Treaty Parties so far must be read as the significant time necessary for discreet consultations amongst the Consultative Parties to achieve one of the most difficult decisions, packaged with plausible reasons and foreseeable consequences of such decision, in its 60 years of history.

Russia hypersonic missile ‘not a game-changer’: US

Russia’s claim it used a hypersonic missile in Ukraine is not a “game-changer,” the US Pentagon’s chief has said.

The use of the hard-to-intercept hypersonics by Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has raised concerns of a dramatic escalation.

“I think the reason he is resorting to using these types of weapons is because he is trying to re-establish some momentum,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told CBS.

Austin also commented on reports that Russia is recruiting thousands of Syrian army personnel for possible deployment in Ukraine, saying “We have not seen mercenaries show up on the battlefield to my knowledge.”

US envoy to UN says claims of Ukrainians deported to Russia ‘disturbing’

US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield has said reports of thousands of residents of Ukraine’s besieged port city of Mariupol being forcibly deported to Russia were “disturbing” and “unconscionable” if true.

“I’ve only heard it. I can’t confirm it,” she said on CNN. “But I can say it is disturbing. It is unconscionable for Russia to force Ukrainian citizens into Russia and put them in what will basically be concentration and prisoner camps.”

Turkey says it is ready to host meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin

Turkey has said it is ready to host a meeting between Ukraine’s Zelenskyy and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and expressed confidence that the two sides were close to an agreement.

“Of course, it is not an easy thing to come to terms with while the war is going on, while civilians are killed, but we would like to say that momentum is still gained,” Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters in the southern province of Antalya.

Cavusoglu this week visited Russia and Ukraine as Turkey tries to position itself as a mediator.

Earlier, he told the Hurriyet Daily News that Russia and Ukraine were getting closer to agreeing on “critical” issues.

In some of his strongest words yet since Russia’s invasion on February 24, Francis on Sunday told thousands of people in St Peter’s Square in Vatican City in Rome that every day brings more atrocities in what is a “senseless massacre”.

Francis also called on “all actors in the international community” to work towards ending the war. “Again this week, missiles, bombs, rained down on the elderly, children and pregnant mothers,’’ the pope said. His thoughts, he said, went to the millions who flee. “And I feel great pain for those who don’t even have the chance to escape,’’ Francis added.

‘Constant bombardment’ in Kharkiv

Standing on a street strewn with rubble and destroyed buildings, Al Jazeera’s Assed Baig said Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv has been facing constant bombardment.

“We’ve heard heavy artillery firing all morning and all afternoon,” he said. “This is what Ukrainians here are facing: constant bombing, missile strikes, shelling, [and] heavy artillery.”

Standing in front of a courthouse that was targeted a few days ago, Baig said the impact of the shelling took out windows.

“On the opposite side of the street was residences, again completely destroyed. Workmen are actually working now to clear the drains from the rubble. We understand that behind that is a military police building. The Russians actually missed that and hit a residence building where two people died and five others [were] injured.”

According to Kharkiv’s mayor, more than 600 buildings including schools and hospitals were destroyed.

The besieged port city of Mariupol is witnessing worsening conditions, Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride said, after the city council said an art school sheltering 400 people was bombed by Russia.

“We are still waiting to see whether there are survivors,” McBride said, speaking from the western city of Lviv.

“The problem, the authorities in Mariupol say, is that they simply can’t get close to this place because of the ongoing fierce fighting in the surrounding street.”

While people are being allowed to leave through humanitarian corridors, the Russian soldiers are checking if they are civilians instead of being soldiers or fighters, he added.

10 million people forced from homes in Ukraine war: UN

Russia’s war on Ukraine has driven 10 million people from their homes, the head of the United Nations refugee agency said.

“The war in Ukraine is so devastating that 10 million have fled – either displaced inside the country, or as refugees abroad,” Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, wrote on Twitter.

“Among the responsibilities of those who wage war, everywhere in the world, is the suffering inflicted on civilians who are forced to flee their homes.”

According to UN data, almost 3.4 million refugees have left Ukraine since the war began on February 24, with more than 2 million taken in by neighbouring Poland, close to 530,000 by Romania and over 362,000 by Moldova.

Some 6.5 million are estimated to be internally displaced in the country.

Russia’s initial campaign to seize Kyiv, force regime change ‘has failed’: ISW

The Institute for the Study of War says the initial Russian campaign to seize Ukraine’s capital and force regime change has failed.

“The doctrinally sound Russian response to this situation would be to end this campaign, accept a possibly lengthy operational pause, develop the plan for a new campaign, build up resources for that new campaign, and launch it when the resources and other conditions are ready,” the United States-based group said.

But the Russian military has not yet adopted this approach and continues efforts to restore momentum to this “culminated campaign”, the ISW said.

This is creating conditions of “stalemate throughout most of Ukraine”, a bloody phase that could last for weeks or months, it added.

Anger after Johnson compares resistance in Ukraine with Brexit

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has sparked outrage by comparing the struggle of Ukrainians fighting the Russian invasion to people in the United Kingdom voting for Brexit.

In his speech to a conference of his Conservative Party in the coastal town of Blackpool, Johnson said it is the “instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom,” with the Brexit vote a “famous recent example”.

Former European Council President Donald Tusk said the prime minister’s words “offend Ukrainians, [and] the British and common sense”, while former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said the comparison was “insane”.

Boris Johnson likens Ukrainians’ fight to British people voting for Brexit. I can still remember the enthusiasm of Putin and Trump after the referendum. Boris, your words offend Ukrainians, the British and common sense. — Donald Tusk (@donaldtuskEPP) March 19, 2022

Conservative peer Gavin Barwell also criticised Johnson, pointing out that Ukraine is seeking to join the European Union and adding that voting in the 2016 referendum “isn’t in any way comparable with risking your life” in a war with Putin’s forces.

Apart from the bit where voting in a free and fair referendum isn't in any way comparable with risking your life to defend your country against invasion + the awkward fact the Ukrainians are fighting for the freedom to join the EU, this comparison is bang on https://t.co/j6qhtNvFYO — Gavin Barwell (@GavinBarwell) March 19, 2022

The UK Ministry of Defence says Ukraine’s air forces are “continuing to effectively defend Ukrainian airspace”.

“Gaining control of the air was one of Russia’s principal objectives for the opening days of the conflict and their continued failure to do so has significantly blunted their operational progress,” it added.

Chinese diplomat says NATO should have ‘been consigned to history’

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng has said that NATO should stick to what he claimed was a promise not to expand eastward.

Echoing a Kremlin talking point, the diplomat said if NATO’s “enlargement goes further, it would be approaching the ‘outskirts of Moscow’ where a missile could hit the Kremlin within seven or eight minutes”.

“Pushing a major country, especially a nuclear power, to the corner would entail repercussions too dreadful to contemplate,” he said.

He expressed an understanding for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s oft-repeated position, saying that NATO should have disintegrated and “been consigned to history alongside the Warsaw Pact”.

“However, rather than breaking up, NATO has kept strengthening and expanding, and intervened militarily in countries like Yugoslavia, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan,” he said. “One could well anticipate the consequences going down this path. The crisis in Ukraine is a stern warning.”

He said Chinese President Xi Jinping in talks with US President Joe Biden on Friday urged the parties in Ukraine to demonstrate “political will and keep the dialogue and negotiation going. The US and NATO should also have dialogue with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.”

‘The city is destroyed’: Mariupol police officer

Russian forces have pushed deeper into Ukraine’s besieged and battered port city of Mariupol, where heavy fighting shut down a big steel plant and local authorities pleaded for more help.

The fall of Mariupol, the scene of some of the war’s worst suffering, would mark a crucial battlefield advance for the Russians, who are largely bogged down outside key cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europe since World War II.

“Children, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it is wiped off the face of the earth,” Mariupol police officer Michail Vershnin said on Saturday from a rubble-strewn street in a video addressed to Western leaders.

10,42f0160b-3a15-4ef7-93ee-b11cfa746e0f,['Rfe Rl'],,"KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has threatened to break off talks with Moscow should Russian forces wipe out the remaining Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Mariupol as Moscow claimed it had taken control of the besieged and battered port city after a weeks-long battle.

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.
