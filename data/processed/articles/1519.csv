Russian forces are continuing to regroup and redeploy April 10 as part of their attempt to shift the focus of military operations to the Donbas in eastern Ukraine and securing a land corridor with Crimea in the southern part of the country. Over the past 24 hours, there have been reports of a 13 km (8 mile) long Russian military convoy heading south through the town of Velykyi Burluk, approximately 60 miles (95 km) east of Kharkiv; the images in the reports were reportedly taken April 8. These are likely to be troops previously withdrawn from northern Ukraine in a significant redeployment to fighting in the east, a process that could take at least a week.

Ukrainian authorities strongly advise citizens in Luhansk and Donetsk regions to evacuate in anticipation of a large offensive in the area once the Russian redeployment is complete. Rail evacuation services have resumed from Slovyansk, Donetsk Region, April 10 following shelling that damaged the line in Barvinkove, Kharkiv Region, April 8; trains are not departing from Kramatorsk after a missile attack on the station that killed over 50 civilians April 8.

Despite the general lull in Russian ground forces activity over the past 24 hours, clashes continue to take place. Russian forces continue to blockade and shell Kharkiv as of April 10 to prevent Ukrainians from redeploying to assist in fighting further east and have shelled Ukrainian positions in Chuhuiv to the southeast of the city. According to Ukrainian military sources, Russian troops are laying mines and improving defensive positions outside of Kharkiv. Russian forces remain in control of Izyum, from which they continue to conduct offensives south towards Slovyansk and Barvinkove though little progress has been made; the Russian convoy heading south through Velykyi Burluk is likely intended to reinforce operations in this area.

Ukrainian reinforcements reportedly joined fighting in Luhansk Region April 7, where a successful counteroffensive pushed Russian troops back from Kreminna. Fighting is ongoing in Popasna, Rubizhne, and Novotoshkivske. In Donetsk Region, Russian shelling and fighting is reported in Vuhledar, Marinke, and Avdiika; Russian forces claim to have captured Solodke. The battle for Mariupol is also continuing as of April 10 Russian forces claim to have captured the city center; Ukrainian forces reportedly attacked Russian forces stationed in the southern port but limited verifiable information regarding the fighting is available. Overall, Mariupol remains likely to fall to Russian forces over the coming weeks.

Ukrainian forces continue to conduct limited counteroffensive operations in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions; heavy fighting is reported both northeast and southeast of Kherson city. Ukraine claims to have retaken a number of towns north and west of Kherson in recent days including Osokorivka, Novovoznesenske, and Dobryanka. Ukrainian forces are reportedly moving in the direction of Kherson city from the direction of Oleksandrivka on the coast. Russian forces appear to remain on the defensive in this area and have largely withdrawn to positions within Kherson city and along the eastern bank of the Dnieper River. Russian ground offensives towards Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Kryvyi Rih are unlikely in the short term.

Russian forces continue to conduct missile strikes on several locations. Officials in Dnipro claim the airport (DNK) was completely destroyed in strikes April 10, though the runway was badly damaged in previous attacks mid-March, and further strikes were reported in Zvonetske, Dnipro Region, and Stara Bohdanivka, Mykolaiv Region, April 9-10. Further shelling and strikes are likely against targets across the country.

Protests denouncing the Russian offensive and the subsequent occupation continue. Most protests are reported in Kherson Region. Russian troops have used tear gas and opened fire on protesters on several occasions, most recently April 10, highlighting the difficulty Russian forces may encounter when attempting to impose order in some cities under their occupation.

Disruptions and Shortages

Ukrainian Railways (UZ) continues to operate evacuation trains from Kyiv and other areas, including Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvyi Rih, Zakarpattia, and Zaporizhzhia regions. Clashes and artillery strikes periodically prompt the suspension of evacuations. Large crowds continue to be reported at stations offering evacuation services. Intercity and regional rail services are available intermittently; rail services are subject to disruptions without warning. Damage to rail infrastructure at Kramatorsk will disrupt evacuation services from this area. Civilian aviation remains suspended, and the nation's seaports are closed. Following the recapture of Kyiv and northern Ukraine, some residents may start to return; the EU and Italy have both announced their intention to resume diplomatic presence in Kyiv April 10, and other governments are likely to follow suit in the coming days and weeks.

Nightly curfews are in effect in multiple regions during various time frames. Authorities in Odesa have announced an extended curfew 21:00 April 9-06:00 April 11. In Kyiv Region, a curfew is in place 21:00-06:00, with some municipality level variations. In Mykolaiv, a curfew is in place 20:00-06:00; in Zaporizhzhia the curfew runs 21:00-05:00. In Rivne, authorities have declared a curfew 22:00-06:00. In Sumy Region, the curfew is in place 21:00-05:00. Generally, civilians must stay indoors during curfew hours; exemptions exist for workers in critical infrastructure and persons seeking urgent medical care or bomb shelters. Authorities may extend or amend curfew hours on short notice, depending on local developments.

Intermittent telecommunications, internet, and utility disruptions continue across much of the country. Reports also indicate a shortage of basic supplies, including groceries and pharmaceutical products, in multiple cities facing Russian ground assaults. The most severe shortages and disruptions are consistently reported in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol, which have suffered heavy bombardments and repeated ground assaults. Similar situations are likely in other cities facing Russian ground offensives or heavy bombardments. Finally, the National Bank of Ukraine has limited foreign currency transfers and withdrawals.

Ukraine's borders with Belarus, Russia, and the Transnistria region of Moldova are closed to foreign nationals; only Ukrainian citizens can enter from these areas. Ukraine's borders with Hungary, Moldova, Poland, and Slovakia remain open. Though congestion has eased since the early days of the conflict, delays may worsen depending on conflict developments elsewhere in the country.

Context

Faced with the failure of its campaign to take Kyiv, the Kremlin appears to be making a number of changes to its strategy in an effort to regain the momentum the Russian forces have lost. Recent troop withdrawals and redeployments represent a shift back to one of Russia's more immediate objectives of seizing the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk regions, as well as securing a land bridge to Crimea. Moreover, the government in Moscow has recently appointed General of the Army Aleksandr Dvornikov, a veteran of Russia's military action in Syria and commander of the Southern Military District, to assume overall command of operations in Ukraine. While Dvornikov's presence as a theater-level commander will almost certainly result in Russian forces' becoming better coordinated, it remains unclear whether the units withdrawn from northern Ukraine for redeployment eastward can be transformed into combat-effective elements.

Ukrainian officials have accused Russian troops of various atrocities against the civilian population in occupied territories. Such revelations might make negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow more difficult, as the public might pressure senior Ukrainian political leadership not to agree to any concessions until the Kremlin accepts the blame for any war crimes that Russian troops may have committed. On the Russian side, it is likely that officials will only present concrete proposals once they feel the military position in southeastern Ukraine is relatively secure. Recent talks have failed to yield any concrete de-escalation of the conflict, though both Russian and Ukrainian positions are believed to have softened.

Advice

Avoid travel to Ukraine until the situation stabilizes; consider exiting the country if safe to do so. Where fighting or airstrikes are occurring, shelter in place until the situation becomes clear. If officials report incoming fire, stay away from windows and exterior walls. Strictly heed the instructions of local security personnel, particularly when ordered to air-raid shelters. Stockpile food, fuel, and water when possible and safe to do so. Maintain contact with diplomatic representations. Confirm that a thorough communication plan exists to ensure rapid accountability for all personnel operating in Ukraine. Reconfirm the status of public transport services, road routes, and borders before departure. Due to the threat of unexploded ordnance, consider avoiding off-road travel. Travel on well-used routes only. Do not approach suspected unexploded ordnance.

Russian forces continued to regroup and redeploy April 11 as part of their apparent attempt to shift the focus of military operations to the Donbas in eastern Ukraine and secure a land corridor with Crimea in the southern part of the country. Accordingly, Ukrainian authorities have strongly advised citizens in Luhansk and Donetsk regions to evacuate in anticipation of a large offensive in the area once the Russian redeployment is complete. Rail evacuation services resumed from Slovyansk, Donetsk Region, April 10 following shelling that damaged the line in Barvinkove, Kharkiv Region, April 8; trains are not departing from Kramatorsk after a missile attack on the station killed more than 50 civilians April 8. Local authorities had reported 227 civilian casualties in Donetsk Region, excluding Mariupol and Volnovakha, as of April 10.

According to the Ukrainian General Staff of the Armed Forces, Russian troops unsuccessfully attempted to enter Severodonetsk April 11. Russia also claimed its forces had destroyed several Ukrainian air defense systems near the city of Dnipro April 11 in what might be a renewed attempt by Moscow to establish air superiority.

The battle for Mariupol continued as of April 11. Russian forces have reportedly captured the City Council building and have divided Ukrainian defenders into two positions: around the main port in the southwest and near the Azovstal steel plant. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has claimed that ""tens of thousands"" of people have been killed amid the Russian assault on the city.

Unconfirmed reports from the Azov Regiment of the National Guard of Ukraine have claimed that Russian forces dropped an unidentified poisonous substance on Ukrainian troops in Mariupol via a drone April 11. Individuals on the ground have reportedly experienced shortness of breath and vestibulocerebellar ataxia. These reports were not immediately corroborated by independent sources nor confirmed by Ukrainian or Russian officials. If confirmed, the event would mark Russia's first use of chemical weapons in the war. Earlier April 11, the UK government warned of the possibility that Russian forces could use chemical weapons in Mariupol to facilitate their capture of the city. Overall, Mariupol remains likely to fall to Russian forces over the coming days or weeks, as unconfirmed reports also claim that Ukrainian defenders in the city are running low on ammunition.

Despite the recent lull in Russian ground forces activity, clashes continue to take place. Russian forces had continued to blockade and shell Kharkiv as of April 11 to prevent Ukrainians from redeploying to assist in fighting further east; at least 11 people have been killed in the last 24 hours in Kharkiv. According to Ukrainian military sources, Russian troops are laying mines and improving defensive positions outside of Kharkiv. Russian forces remain in control of Izyum, from which they continue to conduct offensives southward toward Slovyansk and Barvinkove though they have made little progress.

Ukrainian reinforcements have reportedly joined fighting in Luhansk Region, where a successful counteroffensive recently pushed Russian troops back from Kreminna. Fighting has also been recently reported around Rubizhne, Nyzhne, Popasna, and Novobahmutivka. In Luhansk Region, Ukrainian forces had reportedly destroyed an ammunition depot near Novoaidar as of April 11.

Ukrainian authorities have stated that an estimated 300,000 square kilometers (115,000 square miles), equating to almost half of Ukraine's territory, now require demining.

Ukrainian forces continue to conduct limited counteroffensive operations in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions; heavy fighting is reported both northeast and southeast of Kherson city. Ukraine claims to have retaken a number of towns north and west of Kherson in recent days, including Osokorivka, Novovoznesenske, and Dobryanka. Ukrainian forces are reportedly moving toward Kherson city via the vicinity of Oleksandrivka on the coast. Russian forces appear to remain on the defensive in this area and have largely withdrawn to positions within Kherson city and along the eastern bank of the Dnieper River.

Russian forces made territorial gains in Mariupol in the past 24 hours and continued to reinforce operations along the Izyum-Slovyansk axis but did not make other territorial gains. Russian forces bisected Mariupol from the city center to the coast on April 10, isolating the remaining Ukrainian defenders in two main locations: the main port of Mariupol in the southwest and the Azovstal steel plant in the east. Russian forces, including a convoy of hundreds of vehicles captured in Maxar Technologies imagery on April 8, continue to reinforce Russia’s offensive in Izyum to link up with Russian positions in Luhansk Oblast.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces bisected Mariupol from the city center to the coast on April 10, isolating the remaining Ukrainian defenders in the southwestern port and eastern Azovstal Steel Plant.

Russian forces again made little to no progress in frontal assaults in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but continue to cohere further reinforcements.

Maxar Technologies satellite imagery captured hundreds of Russian vehicles in Kharkiv Oblast redeploying to support Russian operations near Izyum.

Ukrainian counterattacks may threaten Kherson city in the coming days or weeks.

The Russian Defense Ministry is reportedly offering cash bonuses to incentivize forces withdrawn from northeastern Ukraine to reenter combat operations. Radio Svoboda published images of a document on April 10 that it reported was issued by the Russian Ministry of Defense on April 2 offering specific bonuses for Russian troops in Ukraine.[1] The document specifies large payments including 300,000 rubles for destroying a fixed-wing aircraft, 200,000 for destroying a helicopter, and 50,000 for armored vehicles and artillery. Radio Svoboda stated the payments are intended to coerce units withdrawn from the Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions to reenter combat. We have previously reported several instances of Russian soldiers refusing orders to return to Ukraine after being pulled back.[2]

Russian forces are implementing increasingly draconian measures to conscript previously ineligible personnel. The Ukrainian Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) reported on April 10 that Russian forces are now conscripting previously ineligible categories of people, including those with childhood disabilities and workers in protected industries.[3] The GUR reported that DNR/LNR authorities are enabling traffic inspectors to issue on-the-spot conscription notices and are establishing checkpoints on key highways. DNR and Russian military police are additionally reportedly destroying documents granting exemptions—such as medical records or work certificates—to forcibly conscript people.[4]

We do not report in detail on Russian war crimes because those activities are well-covered in Western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting. We will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the Ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in Ukrainian urban areas. We utterly condemn these Russian violations of the laws of armed conflict, Geneva Conventions, and humanity even though we do not describe them in these reports.

ISW has updated its assessment of the four primary efforts Russian forces are engaged in at this time:

Main effort—Eastern Ukraine (comprised of two subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv and Izyum;

Supporting effort 2—Southern axis;

Supporting effort 3—Sumy and northeastern Ukraine.

Main effort—Eastern Ukraine

Subordinate main effort—Mariupol (Russian objective: Capture Mariupol and reduce the Ukrainian defenders)

Russian forces bisected Mariupol from the city center to the coast on April 10, isolating the remaining Ukrainian defenders in two main locations—the main port of Mariupol in the southwest, and the Azovstal steel plant in the east. Several geolocated videos released by pro-Russian accounts on April 10 confirm that Russian assaults from downtown Mariupol captured the fishing port west of the Azovstal steel plant, likely confirming Russian control of the city center as well.[5] Petro Andryushenko, an advisor to Mariupol’s mayor, reported on April 10 that Russian forces are setting up checkpoints in central and northeastern Mariupol to detain or kill Ukrainian citizens that resist the Russian occupation.[6] Andryushenko additionally stated that Russian forces are building crematoria and digging mass graves for Ukrainian civilians in Mariupol, but ISW cannot independently confirm this report. Russian forces continued assaults on both pockets of Ukrainian defenders in the last 24 hours without any major gains.[7]

Subordinate main effort—Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts (Russian objective: Capture the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts, the claimed territory of Russia’s proxies in Donbas)

Russian forces continued assaults on Rubizhne, Popasna, and Severodonetsk in the past 24 hours but did not make significant territorial gains.[8] The Ukrainian General Staff claimed that Ukrainian forces repelled eight attacks and destroyed four tanks, eight armored vehicles, and seven unarmored vehicles in the past 24 hours.[9] Luhansk Oblast Head Serhiy Haidai stated on April 10 that approximately 60,000 Russian personnel are deployed in eastern Ukraine, but ISW cannot independently confirm this number or if it includes DNR/LNR troops.[10] Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Oleksiy Arestovych stated on April 9 that Russian forces have begun their major offensive on Donbas, which Kyiv expects to last 2-3 weeks.[11] Arestovych and other Ukrainian military forces stated that Russia is deploying additional unspecified units from the Southern Military District, undeployed Eastern Military District units, and forces withdrawn from northeastern Ukraine, though none of these forces have arrived in Donbas as of April 10.[12]

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv and Izyum: (Russian objective: Advance southeast to support Russian operations in Luhansk Oblast, and fix Ukrainian forces around Kharkiv in place)

Russian forces continue to redeploy to the Kharkiv area to support the ongoing Russian offensive south of Izyum toward Slovyansk and Barvinkove. Maxar Technologies satellite imagery (see below) captured a convoy of hundreds of vehicles (including armored vehicles, towed artillery, and support equipment) extending at least eight miles moving south through Vleykyi Burluk, approximately 100km north of Izyum and 90km east of Kharkiv, on April 8. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on April 10 that Central and Eastern Military District units continued to arrive in Russia’s Belgorod, Voronezh, and Kursk oblasts for further deployment to the Izyum front.[13] Russian forces likely repaired the main bridge in Izyum on April 10, supplementing their previously established pontoon bridge.[14] A pro-Russian Telegram channel depicted T-80 tanks from the 4th Guards Tank Division (which previously redeployed from the Sumy axis) at an unspecified location in Kharkiv Oblast on April 9.[15] These forces are likely deploying to support ongoing Russian operations near Izyum, which have not taken any territory in the last 48 hours.[16]

Supporting Effort #2—Southern axis: (Objective: Defend Kherson against Ukrainian counterattacks)

Russian forces launched unsuccessful counterattacks against recent Ukrainian gains in Osokorkivka (north of Kherson) and Oleksandrivka (35km west of Kherson city) on April 10.[17] Ukrainian forces claimed to strike (unclear if with airstrikes or artillery) a Russian airfield and command post in Melitopol on April 10.[18] Ukrainian counterattacks continue to put Russian forces on the defensive, and Ukrainian troops may attempt larger-scale attacks toward Kherson city itself in the coming weeks.

Supporting Effort #3—Sumy and Northeastern Ukraine: (Russian objective: Withdraw combat power in good order for redeployment to eastern Ukraine)

There was no significant activity reported on this axis in the past 24 hours.

Immediate items to watch

Russian forces will renew offensive operations in the coming days southeast from Izyum, possibly diverting first to the southwest to avoid Ukrainian defensive positions, in an effort to reach and seize Slovyansk.

Russian forces have bisected Ukrainian defenders in Mariupol and will continue efforts to complete the seizure of the remaining pockets of Ukrainian resistance.

Russian forces may conduct attacks to seize Rubizhne, Popasna, and Severodonetsk in the coming days, although they may wait for reinforcements and for Russian troops to complete the encirclement of this area along the Izyum-Slovyansk-Debaltseve road.

In the last 24 hours, heavy fighting has taken place in eastern Ukraine, especially in the Izyum salient, in Kharkov oblast. There the units of the Russian 1st Combined Arms Army are facing several Ukrainian brigades that, thanks to their artillery, would be making the attackers pay a high price. In Mariupol, Chechens, Donetsk militiamen and Russians continue to make small gains. Meanwhile, analysts continue to doubt Russia's ability to profit from the troop buildup it is achieving in the east.

The last day of war has seen heavy fighting in northeastern and eastern Ukraine, especially around Izyum, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. Let us remember that the Russians try to cut the Ukrainian salient in Severodonetsk with the intention of reaching Kramatorsk, for which they advance both diagonally, from Izyum, and in front of the salient, from the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Lugansk. It is not just about pocketing the Ukrainians by isolating some of their units, but also about avoiding the trench network, which we already explained and which is mostly designed to defend against attacks from the east. Thus, using the assets of the 1st Combined Arms Army as a hammer, while the 5th Army and several independent units act as an anvil, Russia would try to destroy and isolate up to 4 Ukrainian brigades.

Russia, as far as we know, continues to amass men and troops around this region. Today we have been able to see satellite images that confirm that the number of units assigned to the area continues to increase, with overflowing camps in Valuiki and Agoshevka (Belgorod Oblast), among other areas.

Russian camp in Valuiki, Belgorod Oblast. Note the defensive mounds.

Undoubtedly, concentrating up to four Russian armies (6th, 35th, 5th and 1st) in such a narrow area, which implies tens of thousands of soldiers and thousands of vehicles of all kinds and, on paper, a fire capacity (and motion) overwhelming. However, Western analysts at least agree that they doubt that the Russian device has as great a combat capacity as the numbers suggest.

The first set of arguments put forward has to do with the number of Russian casualties suffered in the last forty-six days by the Russian side. Covering them, even with a partial mobilization like the one we mentioned a couple of days ago, implies doing it with soldiers who do not have the same level of education as those they replace. As it would be said in boxing, with numerical equality, it would be a much less powerful ""pound for pound"" army and in which one by one, the soldiers, non-commissioned officers and junior officers would have less training. According to some analysts, like those of the ISW, although based almost exclusively on Ukrainian sources, Russia would be recruiting even people who were previously unfit for service. All for not resorting to mass mobilization and escalation.

The second group of arguments refers to the material. Let us remember that Russian losses have been heavy, giving open sources figures of up to more than a thousand vehicles captured by the Ukrainian side and almost 500 Russian battle tanks lost, among other things. This would mean, according to some quite accurate calculations in our opinion, up to 33% of Russian main battle tanks lost in 45 days of fighting. In this situation, Russia would have had to remove completely outdated tanks, such as T-72A, from warehouses. Even in the case of armored vehicles, BMP-1s have been seen in days gone by. None of these platforms offers a minimum of guarantees against modern systems, with which the Russian combat capacity would also be eroded in this aspect, as the Army is proportionally older than the one that started the war. In addition, it is also questionable that in a few weeks Russia can put an acceptable number of tanks in combat order, to cover the losses suffered, since it is usually a slow process.

The third group of arguments is related to logistics, Russia's true Achilles' heel in the early stages of the war. Since the Ukrainians focused on attacking Russian logistics lines, which were already inadequate, even if Russia concentrated its forces in a smaller area, it solved part of the problems, as a whole it would still be very weak in this section. In addition, a greater concentration also implies not only the predictable formation of funnels, but also greater exposure to Ukrainian attacks.

The last group of arguments would have to do with more intangible aspects. Some, such as problems of unity of command, would have been partly solved by Russia by choosing a single general to command the whole Russian effort. Others, such as low troop morale, desertions, and even refusal to fight by entire units, are more difficult to assess, but will certainly play a role in Russian performance. Especially in a region where the fights will be less mobile and the number of deaths, as well as high, more concentrated. In addition, there is an important aspect within the Russian attrition, with implications that are difficult to assess, but undoubtedly important. The attrition of some of the main Russian units, such as the Airborne Forces (VDV) and the 1st Guards Tank Army, is much greater than that of the units that we could call the second line, which undoubtedly represents a notable decrease. .

Beyond this, it is almost impossible to see on the map what objectives on the ground could translate into a military victory that would bring Ukraine to the negotiating table ready to accept some of the Russian demands, so they would have to come to an situation in which they de facto control everything that they pretend to control. After all, other Russian demands, such as denazification, had been set aside as far as we know, while neutrality would have already been accepted by Ukraine. This does not prevent them from trying to maintain control of some points such as Kherson at all costs, which, at least in principle, would not be within the ""logical"" area that the Russians would try to acquire, but which would serve as an asset in a future negotiation.

By fronts, in the last few hours there have been hardly any territorial changes, the news being the following (which starting tomorrow we will collect by oblast to clarify the report):

North: No news.

Northeast: The bombardments continue both on Kharkiv and on other towns, including the use of cluster munitions that today would have been recorded live. the Ukrainians boasted of destroying an entire Russian BTG belonging to the 70th Motorized Rifle Regiment in Donetsk Oblast, including the battalion commander while he was aboard the BMP-3 commanded by him. The Ukrainian high command affirmed yesterday that the Russian troops could attempt an operation in the direction of Dnipro and not towards Sloviansk, the attacks in this direction being a feint aimed at fixing Ukrainian units on the ground.

East: In Lugansk oblast, Russian bombardments continue on Sievierodonetsk and Popasna. In Donetsk, meanwhile, they continue to punish Marinka and have managed to gain some ground towards Verkhnotoretske.

South: In Mariúpol, Russian and Chechen troops and the militias of the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk have continued to tighten the siege in the port areas in the south-west of the city. A video has been published with the alleged surrender of up to 160 Ukrainian marines (unconfirmed) who would join those who already surrendered days ago. The Russian Army would have tried to recover Osokorkivka and Oleksandrivka without result, both in the Kherson oblast.

International context, diplomacy and sanctions

Today the official visit of the Austrian Chancellor, Karl Nehammer, to Russia was scheduled to meet in person with President Putin. Thus, he was the first representative of an EU Member State to meet with him, although he stated that it was not a ""friendly visit"".

This conversation It would have been ""very direct, open and tough"" with the Russian President in which his most important message to Putin is that ""this war must end, because there are losers on both sides."" The Chancellor also states that he does not have an optimistic impression, since ""it is evident that a large-scale offensive is being prepared."" He also assures that he has made it clear to President Putin that the sanctions will remain and that they will be tightened as long as people continue to die in Ukraine.

President Zelensky, for his part, publishes that he has spoken with the Prime Minister of Norway Jonas Gahr Støre on the course of the war, war crimes and the need for those responsible to be held accountable, as well as to improve cooperation including in the energy sector. In fact, Norway is one of the countries that can help member states reduce their dependence on Russian gas through increased supply on their part. He has also talked with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, on the need to strengthen sanctions, support provided to Ukraine and punish the aggressors.

In addition, he had a telephone conversation with the President of the African Union, the President of Senegal Macky Sall. Zelensky confirms that he echoes the Organization's statement on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and that he has been informed about the struggle of his people and also about the crimes that are occurring on his territory.

In Foreign Affairs Council held today, the High Representative Josep Borrell has reported on his visit to kyiv and they have addressed the situation in Ukraine from different perspectives.

Regarding sanctions, the Foreign Ministers have focused on how to implement the sanctions to avoid possible loopholes and will also continue discussing “to see what else can be done”. As Borrell points out, ""nothing is off the table, including sanctions on oil and gas."" However, and as expected, today was not a meeting to make decisions and he insists that it is necessary to distinguish between oil and gas:

“It is important to make the difference between oil and gas. Last year, in 2021, the oil import bill was four times higher than the gas bill. We are talking about 80.000 million euros on the one hand and 20.000 million euros on the other. It is important to start with oil, which is a high bill and easier to replace.”

In addition, it is an asymmetric shock, given that each Member State has a different level of dependence on Russian fuels. The High Representative underlines the need to build European strategic autonomy in energy matters through renewable energies and, in particular, hydrogen.

In this connection, they spoke about the European Commission's “Global Gateway” strategy published last December, which provides a “geostrategic approach to connectivity”.

In their statement, they reaffirm that they will continue to support Ukraine and that they are ready to continue doing so on a military level through the European Peace Facility. With the latest mobilized funds, the EU has planned for the moment to allocate 1.500 million euros in military aid regardless of the individual contributions of the Member States.

The meeting was also attended by the Foreign Ministers of Norway and Iceland with whom they exchanged views on the aggression and the response to it, as well as on their cooperation also within the framework of NATO. In addition, and in relation to the latter, it can be noted that US officials say that Finland and Sweden seem to be ready to join NATO in summer.

During the Council, they have also discussed disinformation, propaganda and the battle for the story, something that we have also emphasized in our previous reports. Likewise, another worrying situation is the food one, since the Russian troops are destroying the stocks of wheat and preventing its export, so that the scarcity increases as the Ukrainian ships cannot leave from their ports. In this sense, they discussed how to face these challenges, taking into account that African countries are particularly exposed.

Of course, he has also addressed the humanitarian situation, referring in particular to the persistent situation in Mariupol where hundreds of thousands of civilians continue to be unable to be evacuated.

A noteworthy fact is that before addressing all the aforementioned issues, they met by videoconference with the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, and with the Prosecutor of Ukraine. The EU will provide financial assistance to carry out the investigation, but also on the ground through the Non-Executive Mission that was already in Ukraine before the war started (EUAM). The troops of the Mission will cooperate with the Prosecutor General of Ukraine precisely to ensure the investigation and collection of evidence.

On the other hand, the Director of UN Women (UN Women), Sima Bahou, has demanded the investigation of sexual violence in Ukraine after her recent visit to Moldova. However, she points out that these allegations must be independently investigated to ensure justice and accountability.

From February 24 to yesterday, the United Nations Office for Human Rights it has recorded 4.335 civilian casualties. On the one hand, 1.842 people have died, including 148 children, while 2.493 have been injured, including 233 children.

Meanwhile, Russia continues to maintain that the attacks on towns like Bucha were not caused by Russian troops.

Lastly, it can be noted that Croatia has expelled 24 members of the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, of which 18 have diplomatic status, and that companies Ericsson y Société Générale, Swedish and French respectively have stopped providing their services in Russia.",https://www.revistaejercitos.com/en/2022/04/11/guerra-de-ucrania-dia-47/
