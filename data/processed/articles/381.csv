Kiev front.

To the West of the capital, Russian forces seem to have abandoned their positions in Bucha as well as Hostomel AB, retreating North.

To the East of the capital, a Ukrainian counterattack seems to have breached through Russian lines South of the Chernihiv pocket (near Shestovytsya) and reopened one of the supply roads, effectively lifting the siege. Ukrainian forces also pushed East from Brovary all the way to Nova Basan (50km along the H07 road). Further South in the Chernihiv Oblast, Ukrainian troops have advanced on Makiivka.

The Russian MoD had advertised its intentions on withdrawing troops from the ""Northern Front"" (Kiev to Sumy) several days ago. It seems we are seeing two things: A Russian withdrawal of troops and a Russian retreat.

The US DoD estimates that 20% of the Russian units in the area are being withdrawn from Ukraine and sent back to Belarus and Russia to refit and regroup. In some areas, those units were replaced by fresh ones, while in other locations, they were not. Which leads to the other point: A Russian retreat! If the focus of Russian operations is to be shifted to the East and South of Ukraine, and if Russian positions are to be depleted of 20% of their strength, it does make sense for the remaining ones to pull back to more defensible lines.

It is worth mentioning that Ukrainian forces in the area are not watching this withdrawal/retreat passively: They are harassing, ambushing and shelling Russian convoys, meaning that said withdrawal isn't as smooth as the Russian MoD would have hoped it to be. Also keep in mind that Kiev, Chernihiv and Sumy are still within range of Russian artillery and aviation and are still being targeted.

Russian long range strike hit the Kremenchuk refinery in Poltava, yesterday, damaging its storage facility. Kremenchuk is one of Ukraine's two functionning oil refineries and the largest in output by a long shot. Large fire visible afterwards. Russia also launched long range missile strikes on Poltava and Dnipro airports/airbases last night.

Kharkiv.

The city might not be besieged but it is on the receiving end of daily shelling and bombing. A Russian missile strike on Lozova destroyed a Ukrainian railway logistics node, yesterday, but also led to several civilian casualties. Hospitals in Kharkiv struggle to adapt to ""Battlefield Medicine"": Patients present symptoms and wounds doctors usually do not see or deal with. Crush injuries (When a building collapses), internal damage/bleeding (shockwave exposure) and shrapnel wounds (shelling/bombing). Those injuries often lead to higher mortality rates. Amputations are a more common sight while many patients become paraplegic or are forced to live with shrapnels inside of them as removing them would be more dangerous than not...

Lughansk and Donetsk.

Fighting South of Izyum, in Popasna, in the southern suburbs of Rubizhne and outside of Severodonetsk. Russian shelling of Krasnohorivka, Lysychansk and Troitske. Russian shelling and advance toward Avdviivka. Heavy fighting outside of Marinka for control of the N15 road. Fighting in Velikaya Novoselka and Zolotaya Niva. DNR troops claim to have advanced into Novobakhmutivka, bringing them 50km South of Kramatorsk's outskirts.

Mariupol.

Both the Illich and Azovstall Iron and Steel Works have been completely detroyed in the fighting. The Illich factory was the second largets steel plant in Ukraine. Heavy fighting inside the Azovstall factory where Ukrainian defenders have been based and fighting from for weeks. beside the Azostall plant, the Ukrainian defences are based on the Illich plant, part of the port and portions of the Prymorsky and Levoberezhnyi districts (Raions).

Kherson and Nikolayev.

Fighting in the Kherson Oblast. Keep in mind Kherson city is in the hand of the Russians. Western and Ukrainian maps have constantly shown us that the Russians have fully retreated to the left bank of the Dnieper since giving-up their advance on Nikolayev. French and Russian maps, however, have always showed a Russian presence along the Dnieper;s right bank, in the direction of Kryvyi Rih. Considering that the head of the military administration of Kryvyi Rih Oleksandr Vilku was complaining yesterday about constant Russian Grad MLRS shelling on his town, there must be Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper within 30 to 40km of Kiyvyi Rih.

Zaporizhzhia

A Ukrainian protest inside Energodar was dispered with stun grenades. The Russians seem to have given-up on an all out assault on Zaporizhzhia and are holding position along the line Kamyanske-Orikhiv-Hulyaipole.

Summary.

Western Aid: The West is about to send another $300 million to Kiev. The war, damages to the Ukrainian infrastructure and the Russian blockade of Odessa have terrible consequences for the Ukrainian economy.

Western (military) Aid: The Czech Republic is about to transfer 56 upgraded BMP-1 to Ukraine. Those were originally East German. The UK is about to send Land Rovers and Foxhound armoured vehicles to Kiev. Meanwhile, Washington is in discussion with other NATO memberstates to collect ex-Soviet tanks and artillery (with their ammunition) that are still in service in several Eastern European countries, so they can be sent to Ukraine.

Our job is hard! The reasons? Selective Exposure and Confirmation Bias!

Back in the (Golden?) Olden days when newspapers were the main source of information and when your dad had to slap the sh*t out of the television so the image would stop cycling while the family was trying to watch the evening news, there were few sources of information. The majority of us had to rely on television and newspapers, while the more curious about us had to visit the local library to try and find other sources. You were given what you were given, whether you liked it or not!

Nowadays, one is spoilt for choice: Somebody connected to the internet can in a matter of hours be exposed to more information than the average person was likely to come across in a lifetime in seventeenth century England. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. It is good because one is (in theory) able to find any information about anything. It is bad because we have a tendency to shun information we do not like (or do not agree with) and instead, seek information that goes our own way, stroke our own ego and bias and reflect our own opinion.

What does it mean for us? It means that information is nowadays extremely biased. Some mainstream media have given up trying to be neutral and objective and publish what one could call ""op-Eds"" rather than news bulletins. That is journalists giving us their point of views rather than giving us facts and data. The same is to be found online. However, even journalists and bloggers who try to be neutral and objective have a slight bias and this is normal and part of human nature.

This makes our job extremely difficult. Currently, Russian sources for this conflict talk about the slow but successfull operations in the Donbass and sweep under the carpet the Russian retreat in the North. Likewise, many Ukrainian and pro-Ukraine sources (including a majority of Western publications) amplify/exaggerate the Ukrainian achievements in the North and completely ignore the reversals in the Donbass.

At Defensionem, we spend hours looking at data and information from both sides. It is made more difficult by the fact both Ukrainians and Russians seem to be writing in Elvish, which makes accurate translation difficult (The Elvish thing is a joke, please don't shoot). It is even more difficult when both sides have different names for towns and cities! Some can be recognised easily but others are headache inducing!

And then, when we publish maps and reports, we are guaranteed to upset half of our followers... Because the human mind is programmed to accept more readilly informations that confirms one's own bias, perception and opinion and dismiss data one does not agree with.

The truth is always in the middle...
