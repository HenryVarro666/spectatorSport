Russia's ambassador to Lithuania ""will have to leave the country"", the Lithuanian foreign ministry said in a statement.

""Lithuania stands in full solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, who are victims of Russia's unprecedented aggression,"" Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said in a statement.

""The war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine will not be forgotten,"" he added.

Lithuania also said it would close Russia's consulate in the port city of Klaipeda and said its envoy to Moscow ""would return in the near future"".

Meanwhile, neighbouring Latvia said it would take steps regarding its own diplomatic ties with Russia, without giving specifics.

""Taking into account the crimes committed by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine, Latvia will tighten diplomatic relations with the Russian Federation,"" Foreign Minister Edgar Rinkevics tweeted. ""Specific decisions will be notified once internal procedures have been completed.""

Ukrainian authorities said they had found 421 civilian casualties near Kyiv by Sunday and were investigating possible war crimes in Bucha, a description also used by U.S. President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and, in reference to Russia's broader offensive, by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.

On the same day, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis announced on Twitter that Lithuania’s Ambassador to Ukraine would head back to Kyiv.

“Lithuania stands in full solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, who are victims of Russia’s unprecedented aggression. We are therefore lowering the level of Russia’s diplomatic representation,” Landsbergis said.

In response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the government also closed down the Consulate General of Russia in Klaipėda. The foreign ministry of Lithuania summoned representatives of Russia’s embassy in Vilnius and informed them of the decision.

Lithuania strongly condemned the atrocities committed by Russian forces in several previously occupied Ukrainian towns, including the massacre in Bucha.

“Unfortunately, what the world saw in Bucha can be only the beginning. We will be able to discover even more evidence of cruel war crimes in other towns upon their liberation. The war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine will not be forgotten,” Landsbergis said.

Lithuania supports all measures to ensure the accountability of the Russian armed forces for violations of human rights and the international humanitarian law in Ukraine, the government added.

Lithuania’s Ambassador in Moscow will also return to Lithuania “in the near future”.

Commenting on the decision made on Monday, Linas Kojala, director of the Eastern Europe Studies Centre, tweeted: “Formally, it is a downgrade of diplomatic ties, though it is difficult to see how they could be maintained”.

A week ago, Russia expelled four Lithuanian diplomats following Lithuania’s decision to declare four employees of the Russian Embassy as persona non grata “for activities incompatible with their diplomatic status” earlier in March.",https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/lithuania-expels-russian-ambassador/

Lithuania's foreign minister urged European countries not to buy Russian oil or gas, warning them not to finance ""war crimes"" amid the discovery of mass civilian killings in the Ukrainian city of Bucha.

""Russian army of mass murderers retreat from Bucha reveals full scale of atrocities,"" Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis tweeted on Sunday. ""We can only imagine what is going on in other occupied territories.""

He added: ""No other way arround — buying [Russian] oil&gas is financing war crimes. Dear EU friends, pull the plug. Don't be an accomplice.""

Nearly half of Russian gas exports go to European countries, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The US has already said it would ban Russian energy imports amid sweeping economic sanctions.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, threatened last week to stop exporting gas to Europe if countries Russia designated as ""unfriendly"" — which includes the US, UK, and European Union countries — don't pay in rubles.

Landsbergis is the latest Western leader to slam Russia after hundreds of civilians were found buried in mass graves in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha over the weekend. Ukrainian officials and journalists also recorded corpses throughout the streets after Russian forces retreated from areas near Kyiv that had been occupied for weeks.

United Nations and EU leaders called for investigations into possible war crimes, while the US accused Russia of ""atrocities."" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces committed genocide.

On Monday, Landsbergis said Lithuania expelled Russia's ambassador to the country, and said the Lithuanian ambassador to Ukraine would return to Kyiv.",https://www.businessinsider.com/lithuania-diplomat-says-buying-russian-oil-financing-war-crimes-ukraine-2022-4
