0,5f3032db-8714-4f7b-b99a-fa7aa92d6d3d,"['Hindustan News Hub', 'Http']",2022-03-31 08:52:00+00:00,"Vladimir Putin signed an order on the beginning of the spring conscription. For the first time since the Second Chechen campaign, people will actually be drafted into the army during the war. The Russian Defense Ministry plans to replenish the armed forces by 134.5 thousand people. This is less than a year ago, said the head of the department, Sergei Shoigu. We understand what has changed since this year, who is subject to conscription, and whether a conscript can be sent to fight in Ukraine.

Failure to appear at the military enlistment office is considered evasion from service. For this, they can be imprisoned for up to two years. At the same time, after the repayment of a criminal record, a citizen is again subject to conscription – until he turns 27 years old.

Important: upon admission to a university, the deferment is issued not by the educational institution itself, but by the military registration and enlistment office. The student is obliged to appear there in person with a registration certificate and a certificate from the university. It must indicate the date and number of the enrollment order, the current course, the date of graduation. Next, the student undergoes a medical examination and receives a decision from the draft board on the postponement. At the same time, the military department does not give a respite from the army.

Companies must send a list of employees in need of a deferment to the Ministry of Digital Development by May 1. Then the department will transfer this data to the Ministry of Defense. There they will form the final list and send it to the military registration and enlistment offices.

In addition, a presidential decree was recently issued on deferment from the army for employees of accredited organizations in the IT sector. Men under the age of 27 with higher education and work experience in the industry for at least a year will be able to get a deferment. The rules also apply to IT-specialists with a lower length of service, if they graduated from a university a year before being appointed to a position.

Currently, the State Duma is considering a bill obliging to come to the military registration and enlistment offices without a summons. He was not allowed to move for almost four years and was adopted in the second reading on February 22 – the day the recognition of the DPR and LPR was ratified.

The bill allows serving a summons to appear in the military registration and enlistment office not only in person, but also by registered mail. The document will be considered received if the conscript himself or his adult relative signed it. Refusal to receive a letter will be processed by postal employees according to special rules – they will be approved by by-laws.

If the letter is late, and the conscript misses the appearance for the commission, then he himself must come to the military registration and enlistment office within two weeks after receipt and report this.

Military registration and enlistment offices may not send summons. If she did not come, the conscript must appear there himself within two weeks from the beginning of the next conscription campaign.

Policemen are offered to be relieved from the obligation to deliver conscripts to the draft board. They will search for and detain only those against whom a criminal case has been opened due to service evasion.

So far, the bill has not been passed. The last, third, reading is scheduled for April. Therefore, given the current rules now the summons can only be served in person – at the place of residence, study or work.

For non-appearance on the agenda or call of the military registration and enlistment office, a warning is issued. However, only for the first time. Also, the evader faces a fine of 500 to 3000 rubles. Administrative responsibility is also provided for failure to inform the military registration and enlistment office about moving to a new place of residence or a change in marital status.

But there is also a stricter article 328 of the Criminal Code – “Evasion of military and alternative civilian service.” It can be imprisoned for up to 2 years. According to the statistics of the Judicial Department at the Supreme Court, about 600 people are involved in this article in Russia every year.

On March 9, the Ministry of Defense for the first time recognized the participation of conscripts in hostilities in Ukraine. How this happened – the department did not explain. The Ministry of Defense assured that “practically” all of them were returned to Russia. Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that conscripts in Ukraine do not fight.

For the first time, the Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers spoke about sending conscripts to war. The Moscow Times released interviews with relatives of such servicemen. Similar posts appeared onmedusa“* And “Rain»* (the authorities of the Russian Federation consider foreign agents). Relatives of the servicemen complained that documents were taken away from the guys: passports and military cards, and the command itself signs contracts for them to transfer to a contract. The Senator of the Federation Council Lyudmila Narusova also spoke about the fact that conscripts are forcibly sent to Ukraine. And Kyiv even held briefings for captured Russians, who said that they were taken out of Russia by deceit.

And although Shoigu assures that conscripts “will not be sent to any hot spots,” based on all the data indicated, we can conclude that such the risk still exists. If you find yourself in a similar situation, you should contact human rights defenders. For example, in the “Committee of Soldiers’ Mothers” or “Memorial” (the authorities of the Russian Federation consider it a foreign agent).",https://hindustannewshub.com/russia-ukraine-news/spring-conscription-against-the-backdrop-of-the-war-in-ukraine-what-russians-need-to-know-the-moscow-times/
1,5f3032db-8714-4f7b-b99a-fa7aa92d6d3d,[],2022-03-31 13:08:40.708000,"Russia is preparing to bolster its army with 134,500 new conscripted troops. The defense ministry claimed the draft has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine.

The conscription is part of an annual draft Russia has every spring, which usually begins on April 1. This year’s draft comes a little more than a month after Russian forces embarked on a “special military operation” in Ukraine.

Fierce fighting by Ukrainians has prevented many victories for Russians, and reported losses are mounting. Despite the resistance, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the new conscripts will not be deployed to any “hot spots.”

""Most military personnel will undergo professional training in training centers for three to five months,” Shoigu said. “Let me emphasize that recruits will not be sent to any hot spots.”

RUSSIAN FORCES ‘WALKING AWAY’ FROM CHERNOBYL, HEADING TO BELARUS: PENTAGON OFFICIAL

Russia’s Defense Ministry doesn’t have a good track record of keeping conscripts, as opposed to professional soldiers, out of fighting. Earlier this month, the ministry admitted it had sent conscripts into Ukraine as part of supply units. Ukrainian forces captured the conscripts, forcing Russia to admit its move.

""Unfortunately, we have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine,” the ministry said at the time. “Practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to Russia.”

Russia holds two semi-annual conscription drafts from October through December and again from April through July. Typically, the draft is for men ages 18 to 27, though boys as young as 16 can be drafted, according to the Institute for the Study of War.

The Defense Ministry conscripted roughly 261,000 men last year.

Conscripts’ basic training lasts for two months before another round of advanced training, which takes between three to six months. Russian law typically doesn’t allow conscripts to fight with fewer than four months of training.

As Russia reinforces its army with homegrown troops, it has also tried to recruit fighters from abroad. Earlier this month, unnamed U.S. officials said they believed Russia was calling on Syrian fighters to join the fight in Ukraine.

“We believe that the reports are accurate that the Russians are trying to recruit Syrians, in particular, to sign up and fight in Ukraine,” a senior defense official said earlier this month. “We find that noteworthy that he believes that he needs to rely on foreign fighters to supplement what is a very significant commitment of combat power inside Ukraine as it is.”

Last week, NATO officials said they believed Russia had lost nearly 20% of its fighters in Ukraine. The organization estimated Russian deaths to be between 7,000 and 15,000.

The Ukraine Invasion Update is a semi-weekly synthetic product covering key political and rhetorical events related to renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine. This update covers events from March 25-29. All of the ISW Russia’s team’s coverage of the war in Ukraine – including daily military assessments and maps, past Conflict Updates, and several supplemental assessments – are available on our Ukraine Crisis Coverage landing page.

Key Takeaways March 25-29

The Kremlin is falsely presenting its partial withdrawal of Russian forces from Kyiv and Chernihiv as a major Russian concession in service of peace talks with Ukraine. In reality, Russian forces are withdrawing to recuperate after suffering severe losses in their failed operations to seize those cities.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko continues to withstand Russian pressure to enter the war in Ukraine on Russia’s behalf.

The Kremlin is intensifying its internal censorship and crackdown on entities in Russia that do not cover the war in the Kremlin’s preferred terms.

The Kremlin denied reports of increased conscription on March 26 but is likely beginning a broader mobilization that will coincide with Russia’s annual spring conscription on April 1. These new conscription drives are unlikely to generate effective Russian combat power for many months, at the earliest.

The Kremlin maintained its defamatory narratives about claimed US involvement in Ukrainian biolaboratories and Russian nuclear capabilities to discredit and intimidate the West.

The Kremlin continued to downplay the effects of Western sanctions on the Russian economy and threatened the West with counter-sanctions leveraging Russian energy exports.

Key Events March 25-29

Negotiations:

Russian and Ukrainian negotiators met in Istanbul, Turkey, on March 29 as part of ongoing peace talks. The Kremlin is falsely framing the withdrawal of its forces that failed to capture Kyiv as a Russian concession. Kremlin rhetoric following the meeting was more open to further discussion and Ukrainian demands than throughout the first month of the invasion, but the Kremlin likely retains its maximalist objectives in Ukraine, and peace talks are unlikely to progress in the near future.

The Kremlin's claimed withdrawal of forces around Kyiv, which it seeks to portray as a “huge step” towards peace, is a cover for an ongoing redeployment of Russian forces after their failure to take Kyiv. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Colonel-General Alexander Fomin claimed on March 29 that Russia will “drastically reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions” and provide details on Russia’s claimed withdrawal later this week.[1] Chief Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky falsely framed this claimed withdrawal as a “huge step” toward peace that requires “counter-movement” from Ukraine.[2] The Kremlin is attempting to falsely portray the failure of its campaign to encircle Kyiv, which ISW assessed had failed as of March 19, as an olive branch requiring a Ukrainian concession.[3] Russian forces continue to fight to hold their front-line trace near the city, and Russian forces have been withdrawing into Belarus for rest and refit for several days – prior to the Russian announcement on March 29.[4] Russia’s redeployment of forces to other fronts and continued shelling around Kyiv are not concessions and should not be treated as such by Ukraine and its partners.

Kyiv remained firm that Ukraine must receive separate security guarantees if it abandons its NATO aspirations. Ukrainian officials called for the establishment of a security guarantee system for Ukraine (involving Russia, China, the United States, Germany, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and France) if Ukraine drops its NATO aspirations.[5] None of those countries have publicly committed to such a system and are unlikely to do so; Kyiv will therefore likely refuse Russian demands to commit to not joining NATO.

Ukraine's delegation offered possible limited concessions on territorial control but stated all Russian forces must withdraw prior to any territorial negotiations. Ukraine’s delegation presented an agreement stating Ukraine would not join NATO, would adopt a neutral status, and would not host foreign forces if Russia provided security guarantees and withdrew all its forces from Ukraine. Ukraine also offered a fifteen-year negotiation period on the future of the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula.[6] Zelensky emphasized in a March 27 interview with Russian media that Russia should return its forces to the positions they held before the February 24 invasion prior to any dialogue on control over the Donbas.[7] Zelensky left open the possibility of conceding parts of eastern Ukraine, emphasizing that “Ukrainian land is important, yes, but ultimately, it's just a territory,” but also said that Ukraine would not compromise Ukrainian territory without “iron-clad” security guarantees.[8] Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said on March 29 that Ukraine will sign an international agreement on security guarantees only after holding a national referendum on the issue.

The Kremlin said Ukraine’s proposal was “clearly formulated” after previously falsely claiming Kyiv refused to provide a firm position and stated the Kremlin will consider Kyiv’s proposal before responding. Medinsky stated on March 29 that Russia proposed to “expedite” plans to schedule a meeting between Zelensky and Putin to occur prior to the conclusion of negations.[9] Medinsky stated Russia’s delegation will pass Ukraine’s “clearly formulated position” to President Putin, after which Moscow will give a response, but did not specify a timeline for further meetings.

Russian Domestic Opposition and Censorship:

Kremlin crackdowns on coverage of the war are increasingly prompting self-censorship among Russia’s few remaining independent outlets. The Russian Investigative Committee announced it is investigating more than 10 criminal cases of “fakes about the Russian army” as of March 25.[10] Russian authorities continue to arrest individuals Russian President Vladimir Putin deemed “scum and traitors” for sharing what the Kremlin claims is false information about the war.[11] Russian state censorship is increasingly prompting self-censorship by Russian media outlets. Russian media censor Roskomnadzor demanded on March 27 that Russian media refuse to publish interviews with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.[12] Leading independent Russian news outlet Novaya Gazeta announced on March 28 that it is suspending operations until after the war following warnings from Roskomnadzor.[13]

Ukrainian reporting successfully forced the Kremlin to respond to rumors about the absence of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu from Kremlin broadcasts and reports. Shoigu reappeared in a Kremlin-published video on March 26 following a two-week absence.[14] Ukrainian Internal Affairs Minister Adviser Anton Gerashcenko claimed on March 26 that Shoigu’s condition has deteriorated following a heart attack at an unspecified date and that the March 26 video was previously recorded on March 11, though ISW cannot independently verify this claim.[15] Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov has also not appeared in public for several weeks.

Kremlin Narratives:

The Kremlin denied reports of increased conscription on March 26 but is likely beginning a broader mobilization.[16] Russia’s Defense Ministry denied claims on March 26 that it is calling Russian reservists to military enlistment offices and instead claimed that Ukrainian intelligence is issuing fake calls imitating Russian officials.[17] Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) stated on March 28 that Russia will begin conscription through the BARS-2021 (Combat Army Reserve of the Country) program on April 1, 2022, alongside the normal semi-annual conscription cycle on April 1 to “conceal mass mobilization measures.”[18] Such a recruitment drive would be unlikely to provide Russian forces around Ukraine with sufficient combat power to restart major offensive operations in the near term. Russia’s pool of available well-trained replacements remains low, and new conscripts will require months to reach even a minimum standard of readiness.

The Kremlin continues to advance information operations seeking to discredit the US government’s cooperation with Ukraine, claiming it is conducting an “investigation” into what it claims are US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine that could be used to conduct chemical attacks. Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov stated on March 25 that Russia will continue to investigate what it claims are US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine.[19] The Russian State Duma’s Deputy Chair of CIS Affairs Viktor Vodolatsky announced on March 26 that Russia planned to present the results of its investigation into alleged US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine to the United Nations.[20] Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev stated on March 29 that the United States must explain its financing of alleged Ukrainian biolaboratories.[21] Patrushev also falsely accused the United States of developing bioweapons that can selectively target specific populations on March 29.[22]

Peskov claimed that US reports of Russia's use of banned munitions are attempts to divert attention from US-funded biolaboratories in Ukraine.[23] The Donetsk People’s Republic denied claims on March 26 that Russian forces used white phosphorous munitions in Ukraine.[24] Izvestiya correspondent Lenoid Kitrar claimed on March 26 to have visited the Chernobyl laboratory for the study of radioactive waste and alleged that Ukrainian workers confiscated important documents before abandoning the facility.[25]

Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev outlined the conditions under which Russia would use nuclear weapons on March 26 in an effort to intimidate the west.[26] Medvedev’s stated conditions were: the use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies; an attack on Russian critical infrastructure that paralyzes their nuclear response forces; or an act of aggression against Russia or its allies that threatens the existence of the state. The Kremlin is leaving the extent of what it considers an existential threat to Russia or its allies (notably including Belarus) intentionally ambiguous. Medvedev separately noted that the 2010 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, later extended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, is subject to a unique clause wherein “international treaties are only valid as long as the circumstances that gave rise to them exist,” and that those circumstances have disappeared, implying that Russia is no longer obligated to follow the treaty.[27]

Russian Reactions to Sanctions:

The Kremlin continues to claim it can weather the effect of Western sanctions and promised to implement counter-sanctions that will further isolate Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated on March 28 that Russia will create a package of countermeasures in response to unfriendly US actions. Lavrov also stated that Russia will restrict entry into Russia from “unfriendly states.”[28] Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Maturov claimed on March 27 that Russia will rebuild all of its supply chains within 3-6 months, which is highly unlikely.[29] Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing income tax breaks from 2021 to 2023 on March 26 to mitigate the impacts of sanctions.[30] Russia also banned foreigners from withdrawing funds from the Russian financial system on March 25.[31] Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev stated on March 25 that the West’s “stupid sanctions” are strengthening domestic support for the Kremlin.[32] Lavrov stated on March 25 that most states will not join the West’s sanction “games” and accused the West of launching a “hybrid, total war” with sanctions.[33] The Kremlin remains focused on downplaying the effect of sanctions for a domestic audience but is unlikely to mitigate the damage to its economy.

Belarus:

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko continues to withstand Russian pressure to enter the war in Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. Lukashenko reiterated on March 25 that he does not have “plans to fight in Ukraine” and that Belarusian citizens “do not accept war at a genetic level.”[34] However, Belarus continues to logistically support Russia’s military operation. The Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs announced on March 26 that any Belarusian citizens who fight against Russia in Ukraine or who sabotage Belarusian infrastructure will face terrorism charges. The ministry additionally blamed Belarusian opposition leaders for coordinating a “criminal” foreign battalion - a reference to a pro-Ukrainian Belarusian volunteer unit that is operating in Ukraine.[35]

Russian Occupation:

The Kremlin is intensifying efforts to establish a formal military regime in occupied areas of Ukraine and is kidnapping Ukrainian citizens in a likely attempt to reduce Ukrainian resistance and use civilians as hostages in future negotiations. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stated on March 29 that Russian forces have kidnapped nearly 30 Ukrainian officials, activists, and journalists and forcibly deported over 40,000 Ukrainian citizens to Belarus and Russia.[36] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied this report and improbably claimed Russia has no data on Russian arrests of Ukrainian officials.[37] Russian forces are additionally increasing steps to establish an occupation regime in Ukraine. The Kremlin's United Russia party opened an office on the outskirts of Mariupol on March 25 to disseminate party newspapers, propaganda, and cellphone SIM cards.[38] Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister for Crimea Georgy Muradov announced the formation of civil-military administrations in occupied southern Ukraine on March 26 and claimed Russian TV channels are broadcasting in Kherson and south of Zaporizhzhia.[39]

Drivers of Russian Threat Perceptions:

Kremlin officials claimed US President Joe Biden’s March 26 statement in Poland that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power” demonstrates the US has no interest in diplomacy. The White House later clarified that “the president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region” and was not calling for regime change in Russia.[40] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on March 26 that Biden’s comments about Putin “narrow the window of opportunity” for bilateral relations.[41] Russian media additionally mischaracterized Biden’s statements to claim the US will deploy US forces to Ukraine.[42]

The Kremlin is attempting to leverage its energy exports to Europe to prop up the ruble as Western restrictions on Russian energy exports erode this Russian economic lifeline. The United States and the European Commission (EC) announced a new task force on March 25 to supply Europe with 15 billion cubic meters of US liquified gas to wean European nations off of their reliance on Russian fuel.[43] EU Foreign Affairs and Security Policy High Representative Josep Borell stated on March 28 that the EU plans to abandon the Russian gas market within two years.[44] Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that European importers pay for Russian energy in rubles on March 23, a direct attempt to restore the value of the ruble and mitigate the effect of international sanctions.[45] G7 energy ministers rejected Putin’s demands to pay for Russian gas with rubles on March 28, citing breaches in existing gas import contracts.[46] Separately, Ukraine is likely attempting to limit the willingness of states to import Russian energy. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Qatari energy producers to increase their exports to Europe to undercut Russia’s efforts to put pressure on European markets through an energy crisis on March 26.[47]

NATO and EU countries continue to provide lethal and non-lethal military aid to Ukraine and bordering NATO countries and increased defense measures to counter Russian aggression.

Sweden announced on March 25 that it will increase its defense spending by $300 million to provide support to Ukraine.[48]

Estonian president Alar Karis called for a permanent NATO presence on the eastern border on March 28.[49]

The US Department of Defense deployed six Navy electronic warfare aircraft and 240 troops to Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank on March 28.[50]

US President Joe Biden’s new 2023 budget proposal includes $6.9 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative and for NATO to counter Russian aggression.[51]

Abkhazia's military reportedly moved to high-readiness status in response to NATO exercises in Georgia on March 27.[52]

3,5f3032db-8714-4f7b-b99a-fa7aa92d6d3d,['Associated Press'],2022-03-31 00:00:00,"As Moscow’s forces bog down in Ukraine, many young Russians of draft age are increasingly jittery about the prospect of being sent into combat. Making those fears particularly acute is an annual spring conscription that begins Friday and aims to round up 134,500 men for a one-year tour of military duty.

Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu pledged at a meeting of the military brass this week that the new recruits won’t be sent to front lines or “hot spots.”

But the statement was met with skepticism by many in Russia who remember the separatist wars in the southern republic of Chechnya in the 1990s and early 2000s when thousands of poorly trained young men were killed.

“I don’t trust them when they say they won’t send conscripts into combat. They lie all the time,” said Vladislav, a 22-year-old who is completing his studies and fears he could face the draft immediately after graduation. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing reprisals.

All Russian men aged 18-27 must serve one year in the military, but a large share avoids the draft for health reasons or deferments granted to university students. The share of men who avoid the draft is particularly big in Moscow and other major cities.

Even as President Vladimir Putin and his officials say that conscripts aren’t involved in what Russian authorities call “the special military operation in Ukraine,” many appeared to have been taken prisoner during its initial days. Videos emerged from Ukraine of captured Russians, some being shown calling their parents, and were put on social media.

The mother of one of the prisoners said she recognized her 20-year-old draftee son in a video even though he was shown blindfolded.

“I recognized him by his lips, by his chin. You know, I would have recognized him by his fingers,” said the woman, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Lyubov, for security reasons. “I breastfed him. I raised him.”

The Defense Ministry was forced to walk back its statements and acknowledge that some conscripts were sent to Ukraine “by mistake” and were taken prisoner while serving with a supply unit away from the front.

There have been allegations that before the invasion, some conscripts were forced to sign military contracts that allowed them to be sent into combat — a duty that is normally reserved only for volunteers in the army. Some of the captured soldiers said they were told by their commanding officers that they were going to a military exercise but suddenly found themselves fighting in Ukraine.

Lyudmila Narusova, a member of the upper house of the Russian parliament, spoke in early March about an entire company of 100 men who were forced to sign such contracts and were sent into the combat zone — and only four survived. Military officials did not comment on her allegation.

Svetlana Agapitova, the human rights commissioner in St. Petersburg, said Wednesday that relatives of seven soldiers had written to her to complain the men had been forced to sign the contract and sent to Ukraine against their will. She said two of them already had been brought back to Russia.

In recent years, the Kremlin has emphasized increasing the share of volunteer contract soldiers as it sought to modernize the army and improve its readiness. The force of 1 million now has over 400,000 contract soldiers, including 147,000 in the infantry. If the war drags on, those numbers could be insufficient to sustain the operations.

The Kremlin could eventually face a choice: Keep fighting with a limited number of troops and see the offensive stall, or try to replenish the ranks with a broader draft and risk public outrage that could fuel anti-draft sentiment and destabilize the political situation. Such a scenario occurred during the fighting in Chechnya.

Dmitry, a 25-year-old IT expert, has a deferment that should keep him out of the draft for medical reasons. But he’s still nervous like many others, fearing authorities could abruptly waive some deferments to bolster the military.

“I hate the war. I think it’s a total disaster,” said Dmitry, who also asked that he not be identified by his last name, fearing reprisals. “I fear that the government could change the rules and I could face the draft. They also were saying for months that they wouldn’t attack Ukraine, so why should I trust what they say about the draft now?”

Proposed legislation would facilitate the draft by allowing military recruiters to call up conscripts more easily, but the bill has been put on hold for now.

Still, it added to the public’s anxiety.

Alexei Tabalov, a lawyer who advises conscripts, said medical panels at recruitment offices often admit youths who should be exempt from service because of illness. Now, he added, their attitudes could grow even tougher.

“It’s quite probable that doctors may shut their eyes to conscripts’ illnesses and declare them fit for military duty,” Tabalov said.

In addition to lowering the medical standard for draftees, there are fears that the government could try to impose some sort of martial law that would ban Russian men from leaving the country and, like Ukraine, force them to fight.

“We have received a lot of calls from people fearing mobilization,” Tabalov said. “People now are afraid of everything in this situation. No one even thought before about the need to analyze the law on mobilization.”

The Kremlin has strongly denied any such plans, and military officials insist the army has enough contract soldiers to serve in Ukraine. Still, many Russians remain skeptical of the officials’ denials, given their track record.

“What kind of trust could there be if Putin says one day that conscripts will not be sent there … and then the Defense Ministry recognizes that they were there?” Tabalov asked.

An existing law allows for a 21-month alternative civil service in hospitals, nursing homes and other facilities for those who view military duty as incompatible with their beliefs, but military conscription offices often broadly ignore requests for such service.

“We are worried that in the current militarist mood, military conscription offices can take a tougher attitude and reject appeals for the alternative civil service,” he said.

4,5f3032db-8714-4f7b-b99a-fa7aa92d6d3d,[],2022-03-29 00:00:00,"In the spring, 134.5 thousand young men will be sent to military service in the Russian Federation, which is less than a year earlier.

Russian citizens sent to military service in the spring of 2022 will not be sent to any hot spots. This was allegedly stated by Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Tuesday, March 29, at a conference call, writes Interfax.

“All servicemen of last year’s spring conscription will be transferred to the reserve after the expiration of their service life and sent to their places of residence,” he added, noting that 134,500 young men will be sent to military service in the spring, which is less than a year earlier.

According to Shoigu, the military service of the majority of conscripts in spring 2022 will begin with vocational training. It will last from three to five months.

In Russia, the draft campaign begins on April 1.

Also at the conference call Shoigu declaredthat “the main tasks of the first stage of the special operation of the Russian Federation have been completed, and this allows us to focus our main efforts on achieving the main goal – the liberation of Donbass.”

He informed that the combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine “is significantly reduced.”

According to the head of the Russian Defense Ministry, the Russians “gained air supremacy, practically destroyed the Ukrainian Air Force and its air defense system.” And the Naval Forces of Ukraine “ceased to exist.”

Recall that on March 23, the media drew attention to the fact that Shoigu did not appear in public for the second week. He has not been seen since March 11. Also, from that day on, the head of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov did not appear in public.

A few days later, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, said that Shoigu was being treated after a heart attack. And Shoigu had a heart attack after Russian President Vladimir Putin was reprimanded for the complete failure of the invasion of Ukraine.

Actual dollar value will be lower depending on final requirements, budget authority, and signed sales agreement(s), if and when concluded.”

Security experts hail move

Some security experts, who spoke with Saturday PUNCH on Friday, hailed the proposed acquisition, saying it could be a game-changer in the onslaught against terrorists.

They said it would also enhance the capability of the military to deal decisively with the bandits-turned-terrorists, especially since the authorities appeared unwilling to deploy the Super Tucano jets against them.

According to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the sale includes the Bell-made Cobras; 28 General Electric-made T700-401C engines (24 installed, four spares); 2,000 Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System used to convert unguided missiles into precision-guided missiles; M197 20mm machine gun; Night Vision Cueing Display; commercial variant GPS with Standard Positioning Service; communication equipment; electronic warfare systems; AN/AVS-9 Aviator’s Night Vision Imaging System and targeting and navigation systems. It also includes $25m for institutional and technical assistance to the Nigerian Armed Forces.

Reports had indicated that the US State Department approved the sale of military hardware to Nigeria after lawmakers lifted their objections over human rights concerns.

An intelligence and security risk management consultant, Kabir Adamu, noted that the nature of the threat elements in Nigeria required air capability that was ideal for urban warfare and precision-style interdiction attacks.

“These two requirements can be met by combat helicopters. This is in addition to meeting the requirement for rapid response as part of a light force capability that all modern military and security forces should have. I, therefore, welcome this acquisition and see it as a possible game-changer in the current conflict dynamics in the country,” he stated.

Adamu noted that drones would be a good addition to the military arsenal, both for intelligence gathering and the fact that there were multiple theatres of conflict the military was engaged in.

A former Director of the Department of State Services, Mike Ejiofor, said the attack choppers were good, but they must be put into effective use, especially in the North-West and North-Central, where there had been massive kidnappings and killings since the terrorists relocated from the North-East.

He added, “Who knows when it is coming? If it’s something that is ready for delivery soon, it is fine. But the question is; where are the Tucano jets we bought earlier? However, they should help us in operating these platforms. We also need effective drones.

“The greatest challenge we have is that we can’t quickly locate them (terrorists) when they are coming; the Air Force could bomb them on their way, but that has not happened. What they have been doing is to come within an area view and tell us that a number of persons have been killed.”

The Chief Executive Officer, Agent X Security Limited, Timothy Avele, also said the choppers and drones would help in the fight against terrorism.

He said, “It’s a good move. I will advise that they should be used mainly as a quick response force immediately. They should be used especially in Kaduna, Niger Katsina, Zamfara and Sokoto states, and other emerging volatile zones. It should be noted that, for better results, long endurance, all-weather drones for 24/7 aerial surveillance and monitoring must be used to complement these helicopters and of course, human intelligence is necessary too.”

A retired US Army Captain and security consultant, Bishop Johnson, said the Nigeria Air Force must be careful with the deployment of the attack helicopters to minimise collateral damage.

He stated, “With these kinds of military packages from the United States, they are usually very specific on how this equipment, especially aircraft, should be deployed. The most important factor they usually consider is that the aircraft is not used against innocent Nigerians and is not used to commit human rights violations.

“Other than that, I think they should be deployed where necessary and where they can add value to the Nigerian Air Force to tackle the security challenges Nigeria is facing right now.”

He said the Air Force had in recent times been more careful not to kill innocent persons, noting that the deployment would normally be based on operations and intelligence received.

Another security expert, Oladele Fajana, urged the military to ensure that the rights of people were not violated and that innocent persons were not killed.

“Without getting rid of these terrorists, Nigeria will not have peace; so, if those things can be hastened and delivered to Nigeria, they should be deployed immediately, because this war is not a conventional one. The enemies are within. The security personnel alone can no longer fight this war. We need technology. If deployed, they’re going to help,” he stated.

Also, a security consultant, Mr Yemi Adeyemi, said the military would need to exercise care in the way it handles the fighter helicopters when they finally arrive in Nigeria.

“The Air Force should be careful so they don’t harm innocent lives. It is a delicate matter, which is why they should always be trained and retrained on how to tackle this war,” he added.

However, a Fellow of the International Institute of Professional Security and certified golden member of the International Security Association, Switzerland, Jackson Olalekan-Ojo, said all the government needed was the political will to flush out terrorists from Nigeria and not the acquisition of fighter helicopters.",https://infodailyng.com/war-putin-signs-decree-enlists-134500-young-men-into-russian-army/
