Ukrainian forces have been trying in the last few days to regain territory from the Russians, according to a senior US defense official, who described them as “able and willing” to do so.

Here's the situation on the ground:

Counterattacks near the capital: A Ukrainian counterattack north and west of the capital appeared to have made some headway, jeopardizing Russian efforts to encircle Kyiv and threatening the ability of Russian forces to resupply the forward units that are exposed to the north of the city.

Retake Makariv: One such area is Makariv, a strategic town 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Kyiv. After days of fighting, Ukrainian forces regained control of the town, the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a Facebook post Tuesday. CNN could not confirm the claim. Makariv had sustained significant damage from ongoing Russian airstrikes, with video showing widespread devastation. If Ukrainian forces consolidate their control of Makariv, it would become more difficult for Russian forces to secure the western approaches to Kyiv and then push further south.

North of Kyiv: There are also indications that Russian forces have suffered setbacks to the north of Kyiv in areas they have held almost since the beginning of the invasion. A brief video geolocated by CNN showed Ukrainian troops walking in the town of Moschun, about 20 miles (35 kilometers) north of the capital. Ukrainian drone video geolocated during the weekend showed the destruction of Russian armor in the same area.

Flooding of Irpin River: Satellite images from Monday showed growing flooding from the Irpin River. CNN previously reported that a dam along the Dnieper River was flooding the Irpin River basin and its tributaries. The river is critical to the Russian advance toward Kyiv; if the Russians cannot cross it, they can't take Kyiv from the west. It's unclear how the dam began flooding: whether the gates were opened on purpose by the Ukrainians, or it was hit by a military strike.

Borodyanka: Some 12 miles (20 kilometers) north of Makariv is the town of Borodyanka, which has been held by Russian and Chechen forces since early in the campaign. If the Ukrainians were to take Borodyanka, forward Russian units could be cut off. The battlefield is fluid, and the Russians could reverse recent losses. But if the Ukrainians hold Makariv and extend their control over the area, Russian positions between the town and Kyiv would become vulnerable, further impeding their goal of pushing south beyond the main east-west highway to encircle Kyiv.

Kherson and Mykolaiv: A senior US defense official said Ukrainians are fighting to take back the southern city of Kherson, as well as pushing Russian forces from the northeast of Mykolaiv to have to reposition south of the city. The official cautioned that the US cannot say whether these moves are part of a “larger operational plan” by the Ukrainians or not, but called the Ukrainian defense “nimble” and “agile.""",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-22-22/index.html

Ukrainian drone video geolocated during the weekend showed the destruction of Russian armor in the same area.

Additionally, the flooding of the Irpin River may pose logistical difficulties for Russian troops in the area, as could the destruction of a railway bridge north of Irpin.

If Ukrainian forces consolidate their gains, the Russians' most advanced positions at Bucha and Hostomel immediately north of Kyiv could become vulnerable to encirclement.

The Russians' capture of the Antonov air base at Hostomel just after the invasion began was short-lived, preventing them from using it as an airbridge. Russian forces have artillery positions near the Antonov base, according to recent satellite imagery.

Some 12 miles (or about 20 kilometers) north of Makariv is the town of Borodyanka, which has been held by Russian and Chechen forces since early in the campaign. If the Ukrainians were to take Borodyanka, forward Russian units could be cut off.

At present, the southern route out of the capital is still open, and according to CNN teams that have traveled the route, it is frequently congested with traffic bringing supplies into Kyiv.

Russia's inability to complete the encirclement of the capital over nearly four weeks has come as a surprise to the Western officials, some of whom predicted that Kyiv would fall within 72 hours of the invasion beginning.

To justify the invasion and previous occupation of the Donbas region, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly argued that Ukrainians in the eastern parts of the country are ethnic Russians living under Ukrainian occupation.

“People who identify as Russians and want to preserve their identity, language and culture are getting the signal that they are not wanted in Ukraine,” Putin said in a recent address to Russian citizens. Russians seem to believe him, as does Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to former president Donald Trump, who wrote about “legitimate ethnic problems” in Ukraine.

Research in political psychology shows that Ukraine’s Russian-speaking population does not require rescue by Russia — or even want it. Here’s what we know.

Most Russian-speaking Ukrainians feel Ukrainian

In Ukraine, the language people speak cannot be equated with ethnic identity. A large representative study from 2013 examining the identity of Ukrainians living in various regions of the country found that the vast majority consider their ethnic identity as Ukrainian — the lone exception was in Crimea. More than 90 percent of people living in western and central Ukraine call themselves Ukrainian. But strong Ukrainian identification can be found also in predominantly Russian-speaking parts such as southern, eastern Ukraine and even Donbas — where 70 percent or more identify as Ukrainian.

The study’s authors, Maria Lewicka and Bartłomiej Iwańczak, looked also at other identities: people’s attachment to their place of residence, city, Europe; as well as to their professions and religion. They found two general clusters of identification: one of them is prevalent in places such as Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea, where national or ethnic identities do not play a crucial role; the other, in which national Ukrainian identity dominates, is visible in Lviv, Kyiv and Rivne, but also in mainly Russian-speaking cities such as Cherkasy, Dnipro or Kharkiv. In other words, Ukrainian civic identity is strong even in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking areas.

When Ukrainian political psychologist Vadym Vasiutynskyi asked more than 1,300 Russian-speaking inhabitants of Kyiv, Luhansk, Odessa and Simferopol to choose among several different ways of describing themselves, 37 percent chose “Ukrainian citizen,” while another 34 percent of respondents chose “Russian-speaking citizen of Ukraine.” Only 18 percent declared “Russian” as their main identity.

The identification of Russian-speaking Ukrainians with Ukraine is not unique. There are many countries where two or more languages are commonly used, for example Switzerland or Canada. There are also countries such as Ireland where the Indigenous and official national language became a minority language. Although language is an important transmitter of cultural values and ethnic identity, no one would negate the right of an English-speaking Dubliner to define herself as Irish.

We studied how Russian-speaking refugees identified themselves

This strong commitment to Ukraine among Russian-speaking immigrants is visible also among those who emigrated from the country before the conflict. In a study of two linguistic communities of Ukrainian immigrants in Poland, we found that although people whose native language was Ukrainian expressed stronger Ukrainian identification than Russian-speakers, those who said their native language was Russian also expressed very positive emotions about being Ukrainian, and strong ties to other Ukrainians.

In less than two weeks, since the Russian invasion began, an estimated 1.7 million Ukrainian civilians have fled their country. More than 1 million Ukrainians have recently crossed the border into Poland, while smaller numbers headed to safety in Hungary, Romania, Moldova and Slovakia.

Our studies of past waves of Ukrainian immigration to Poland, including after the 2014 war in the Donbas, found that strong national ties among the arriving Ukrainians have a positive impact on their well-being and psychological adaptation. The Russian-speaking immigrants and refugees who were more proud of their Ukrainian identity, and had stronger ties to Ukraine, expressed lower acculturation stress — they had fewer integration problems based on value incompatibility or discrimination. Acculturation stress can amplify PTSD and cause depression, so this Ukrainian identity probably became a buffer against mental health problems among Russian-speaking immigrants.

Ukraine’s Russian speakers are defending Ukraine

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is a native Russian speaker. Former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, a prominent leader of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, was also raised speaking Russian. Both Zelensky and Tymoshenko received enormous electoral support in the Ukrainian-speaking parts of the country. And Russian-speaking Ukrainians are fighting for their country, defending Kharkiv and other cities against the invading Russian army.

Although Ukraine’s constitution identifies the Ukrainian language as the sole national language — and further legislation has made Ukrainian the dominant language in education, law and media — these language policies have not caused Russian-speakers to give up their Ukrainian identity. Ukrainian volunteer battalions during the long-standing separatist war in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, for instance, included a large proportion of Russian speakers.

Many Russian-speaking Ukrainians readily switch between Russian and Ukrainian, speaking Russian at home and Ukrainian in public. In a 2021 nationwide survey by the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation, 22 percent of Ukrainians declared Russian as their native language — but 36 percent said that they speak Russian at home.

The fact that many Ukrainians speak Russian at home reflects the dramatic history of eastern Ukraine, including a genocidal famine of the 1930s — and decades of the Soviet Union’s efforts to “russify” the region with the large-scale resettlement of ethnic Russians to eastern Ukraine’s large industrial centers.

In February, the Russian government claimed a need to “evacuate” this region to protect Russians from ethnic violence. But the long history of Soviet-imposed discrimination has made the Russian-speaking population even more Ukrainian, following a well-studied pattern. Today’s Russian-speaking Ukrainians have developed a strong national commitment to Ukraine. This is why the only “liberation” they are asking for today is an end to the Russian violence.

In 2021, he received the Nevitt Sanford Award for Outstanding Professional Contributions to Political Psychology. Currently he focuses on the linguistic aspects of Ukrainian immigrants’ well-being as part of LCure project of the Foundation for Polish Science (co-led by Justyna Olko).

Russian troops trying to surround the city of Kyiv are now at risk of getting surrounded themselves after Ukrainian forces went on the counter-attack, with footage showing a tank getting blown to smithereens and rocket artillery raining down on Putin's troops.

Heavy fighting is going on to both the west and east of Kyiv as Ukrainian troops - who have suffered through a month of dogged defending under heavy bombardment - are attempting to retake the initiative from Russian invaders by launching attacks of their own.

Makariv and Moschun, two cities to the west of the capital, have 'probably' been re-taken by Kyiv's troops - the British Ministry of Defence said overnight - meaning there is now a 'realistic possibility that Ukrainian forces are able to encircle Russian units at Bucha and Irpin'.

If those units - which include part of a 40-mile convoy spied near the Ukrainian capital in the early days of the war - do get surrounded, then they will be unable to reinforce or resupply themselves and may end up surrendering, inflicting one of the largest defeats on the Russian military of the entire war.

Ukraine has also forced back Russian troops to the east of the city, according to the Pentagon, driving them between 15 and 20 miles down the main highway in the direction of Chernihiv. Counter-attacks are also known to be underway at Mykolaiv and Kherson, in the south, and Izyum, in the north-east.

And on Thursday morning, Ukraine destroyed a Russian tank-carrier ship docked in the captured port city of Berdyansk - scoring a direct hit on the vessel which subsequently exploded. It marks the largest Russian ship lost so-far, and an embarrassing error for Putin because it was Russian state media that revealed its location.

At least 1,800 Russian vehicles have been destroyed in the invasion, according to independent monitoring groups, though Ukraine puts the figure far higher - more than 3,000, including cars and trucks

NATO now estimates that Putin has lost up to 40,000 men during his invasion - killed, wounded and captured - representing more than a quarter of the total force he arrayed before giving the order to attack.

Observers and experts have been warning that losses that severe risk making parts of his army combat ineffective, meaning they will struggle to operate on the battlefield and will be vulnerable to Ukrainian counter-attack.

Russian offensives have been stalled on almost all fronts for days now, with the Pentagon saying earlier this week that Ukraine's generals - who have been skilled in defence - are now switching to offence, and are 'able and willing to take back territory' captured by Russia.

Ukraine's armed forces reported 250 aircraft flights in the last 24 hours, a marked increase from the day before.

There were also fierce exchanges of artillery fire in Irpin even as Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said 'the small city of Makariv and almost all of Irpin is already under the control of Ukrainian soldiers'.

What is clear is that Ukrainian civilians continue to bear the brunt of the war.

'There's going to have to be a further, massive scaling up of assistance within Ukraine in the coming weeks,' said WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan.

'I have never, myself, seen such complex needs, and so quickly in a crisis that has developed so fast,' he said. 'We have reached maybe, for once, an appropriate level of horror at what's happening in Ukraine.'

Ukraine's president made an impassioned plea for global street protests against Russia's bloody month-old invasion and for democratic leaders amassed in Brussels for emergency summits on Thursday to send more advanced weaponry.

In a late-night television address from the emptied streets of the besieged capital Kyiv, a defiant but visibly tired Volodymyr Zelensky appealed in English for the world to help ensure his nation's survival.

'The world must stop the war,' he said. 'Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities, come in the name of peace, come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.'

Addressing leaders of the G7, NATO and the European Union meeting in the Belgian capital, he called for a step-shift in weapons deliveries, including more advanced fighter jets, missile defence systems, tanks, armoured vehicles and anti-ship missiles.

'Freedom must be armed,' he said bluntly, as a heavily armed guard kept watch close by - a stark reminder that Zelensky's own life, and the life of his nation, are in acute peril.

Zelensky admitted the last month had been 'long' and left him heartbroken, but he hailed Ukrainians' willingness to fight. 'This is a war for independence and we must win,' he said, flitting between Ukrainian, English and his native Russian. 'We will rebuild every city, we will bring the invaders to justice for every crime,' he said. 'All our people will live in a free Ukraine.'

His appeal came exactly one month after Russian tanks rolled over the border, bringing a conflict that has already killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians, and thousands more soldiers on both sides.

More than 10 million Ukrainians have fled their homes, as cities have faced sustained Russian bombardment from land, sea and air.

In the southern port city of Mariupol alone, 100,000 people are trapped without food, water or power and enduring fierce shelling by Russian forces.

In the city's hospital, local officials said staff have evacuated patients to the basement, where they are treated by candlelight beside 600 to 700 other residents seeking what little safety they can.

Experts say Russia's once-vaunted military has been bogged down by dogged resistance and has turned to long-range bombardment in the hope of breaking Ukrainian resolve.

Washington said Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin's bombing campaign amounted to war crimes, escalating a confrontation between Moscow and the West that has rivalled the worst crises of the Cold War.

'We've seen numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, as well as other atrocities,' US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

'Based on information currently available, the US government assesses that members of Russia's forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.'

So far the conflict has not spilt over into direct military conflagration between Russia and NATO, but Ukraine's allies fear that Moscow may up the ante with a chemical, biological or even tactical nuclear attack.

Facing mounting diplomatic and economic pressure, Putin's regime has responded by warning Russia could use nuclear weapons if it faces an 'existential threat'.

In the back-to-back Brussels summits, US President Joe Biden and other leaders are expected to bring pledges of more lethal weapons to Ukraine and more punishing sanctions for Russia's already crisis-wracked economy.

But they will also have to weigh how to deter further Russian escalation, without risking an all-out war with Russia.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has said the summit will see leaders agree to 'major increases of forces' on the alliance's eastern borders, including four new battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.

NATO officials believe that - armed with an arsenal of Western anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons - Ukrainian forces may have already killed as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers and wounded perhaps 30,000 to 40,000.

Putin's regime officially puts the number of Russian fallen at under 500, and has introduced draconian censorship laws to prevent independently verified news about what it calls a 'special military operation.'

Recent days have brought claims of Ukrainian forces not only repelling attacks from the much larger and much better armed Russian military, but launching counteroffensives and winning back territory around Kyiv.

To blunt the damage done by sanctions, Putin said Wednesday that Russia will only accept payments in rubles for gas deliveries to 'unfriendly countries', which include all European Union members.

The manoeuver sharpened growing debate in Europe - which is heavily dependent on Russian energy imports - about possible bans on Russian oil and gas.

Moscow has warned an embargo would prompt a 'collapse' of the global energy market.

While Europe has appeared fractured on the question of an oil embargo, there are also signs of fissures within Putin's regime.

Moscow confirmed that Anatoly Chubais - a former Kremlin chief of staff who oversaw liberal economic reforms in the 1990s - quit his post as a Putin advisor. He has reportedly fled the country in protest at the war.

Russia still has a vital friend in China, which dismissed suggestions that Moscow should be expelled from the G20 group of countries.

But Scott Morrison, prime minister of G20 member Australia, said he believed that Putin attending a leaders' summit in Indonesia later this year would be 'a step too far.'

Nearly a month into the invasion, peace talks have agreed on daily humanitarian corridors for refugees, and Ukraine says it is willing to countenance some Russian demands subject to a national referendum.

But it has refused to bow to demands to disarm and renounce its pro-Western ambitions.

The latest military push represents a remarkable turnaround for the Ukrainian military from the early days of war, when the capture of Kyiv by the numerically superior Russian forces seemed all but certain in the eyes of Western leaders and defense analysts.

But experts caution that Ukraine may have just a small window of opportunity to seize on this momentum. Russian troops could learn from their initial blunders and begin to camouflage tactical positions, forward lines, and command posts, as well as to fortify logistics hubs with berms and other earthworks.

“The Ukrainians, if they are going to mount any kind of large-scale offensives, are probably going to have to do it in the next few weeks before the Russians are able to fortify the ground they’ve taken,” said Mick Ryan, a recently retired two-star general in the Australian Army. “Otherwise the Russians will dig in and they’ll be very difficult to dig out.”

Other experts say the United States and its NATO allies need to step up the delivery of weapons and other military supplies to Ukraine quickly so they can retain their momentum.

“The Ukrainian military has performed way above expectations,” said William Taylor, a scholar at the U.S. Institute of Peace think tank and former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. “But in order for them to continue, it’s going to require a lot of support from NATO and from the United States. And that needs to come now.”

So far, Ukraine has been most successful on the counteroffensive instead of mounting attacks from scratch, hitting Russian troops away from the front lines and at weak points, such as blowing up the lead vehicles of a 40-mile Russian military convoy that was aimed at the capital in the early days of the war and blowing up bridges to foil ground movements.

The intelligence arm of Britain’s Ministry of Defense assessed on Wednesday night that Ukrainian forces had probably retaken the towns of Makariv and Moschun to the east of the capital and could realistically encircle Russian forces in Bucha and Irpin directly to the west, according to a statement. Irpin, where Ukrainian forces blew up a bridge to stop Russia’s advance, has seen some of the heaviest fighting of the war so far.

Ukrainian troops have also begun to have military success in the south and east, where Russia’s monthlong offensive has seen more success. British defense intelligence officials assessed on Thursday that Ukraine launched strikes at a landing ship and ammunition storage depots in Russian-occupied Berdyansk, in ongoing efforts to disrupt Russia’s military supply chain and hurt morale. Ukraine has also repeatedly repulsed Russian forces advancing on Mykolaiv, near the port city of Odesa. U.S. defense officials also believe that the town of Izyum, southeast of Kharkiv, that was overtaken by Russia last week is also being contested.

“Against the odds, they have snarled up Russia’s invading army, inflicting defeat after defeat,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at a NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday. “The heroism of Ukraine has changed the geopolitics of Europe.”

U.S. defense officials and diplomats tracking the conflict describe Ukraine’s military gains as a surprise success story, given how many forces Russia had amassed on the country’s borders in the months leading up to the invasion.

They point to a combination of the Ukrainian military’s savvy tactics, the arms supplies and multiyear military training missions Western countries have sent to Ukraine, and Russia’s military blunders and ineptitude.

“There’s another big factor here: Ukraine’s fighting spirit,” added one U.S. diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to speak publicly. “They’ve shown us, and more importantly [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, that they’re not just going to keel over, that they are wholly unified in the fight against Russia.”

But Russian troops have begun making tweaks to their approach, despite officials and experts pointing out the seeming lack of an overall Russian command structure for the war—as well as the deaths of numerous senior Russian military figures on the front lines.

Yet some military analysts see the Russian tweaks as less of a strategic move and more of a face-saving measure, as the Russian military’s command structure has been decimated by the losses of top generals and colonels on the battlefield.

“You can’t get food, you can’t get ammo, and you have nobody really telling you what to do,” said Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and CIA paramilitary officer. “Why not just stop what you’re doing?”

Satellite imagery shared with Foreign Policy and others by the space technology company Maxar last week showed Russian forces using berms to protect and conceal armored units near Antonov Airport, located less than 20 miles from Kyiv, where Russia has sought to build an air bridge to attack the Ukrainian capital, as well as in the nearby towns of Zdvyzhivka and Berestyanka.

U.S. and European officials have also said Russia is considering plans to send in reinforcements: a motley force that could include conscripts, foreign fighters from Syria, and members of the paramilitary Wagner Group. Some Wagner Group members are already engaged in battle against Ukrainian troops in the Donbass region.

But officials and experts are not sure whether the introduction of new troops could further compound Russia’s command problems.

One Ukrainian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media, said that many of the Russian conscripts already sent into the fight were in their late teens and had little specialized combat training. Many of them thought they were being deployed for training exercises in western Russia and Belarus.

“As we see, their Army is bullshit,” the official said. Russia’s strategy is an effort “to try to beat us with [sheer] numbers of their troops,” the person said. “They’re trying to fight an ancient war, like in the 19th century. They don’t act like a modern army.”

Meanwhile, weapons have continued to flow to Ukraine from the West, with U.S. officials telling reporters that the first deliveries of a new $800 million weapons package announced by U.S. President Joe Biden is likely to begin landing in Europe in the coming hours.

The shipment will restock Ukraine’s supply of Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. A senior U.S. defense official said on Wednesday that the Western anti-air systems have prevented Russian pilots from lingering in Ukrainian airspace.

The British government said on Wednesday night it would provide 6,000 new defensive missiles to Ukraine and over $30 million in new military aid commitments. Washington has also begun consulting with NATO about providing anti-ship missiles to Ukraine, a senior U.S. administration official said on Thursday, a move aimed at helping Ukrainian forces repel Russian naval and amphibious assaults from the Black Sea.

But even as Ukraine’s military strength has earned Kyiv plaudits in Western capitals, the question of further military integration with the United States and Europe remains taboo.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has recently pressed Western countries to accept Ukraine as a member of NATO and the European Union, but that is unlikely to happen in the near term.

Zelensky has also criticized NATO for not doing more to aid Ukraine’s fight against Russia, while touting the effectiveness of his country’s military.

“Never, please, never tell us again that our army does not meet NATO standards,” he said in a televised address on Thursday. “We have shown what our standards are capable of.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/24/ukraine-russia-counterattack/
