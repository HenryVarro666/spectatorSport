Ukrainian forces liberated several villages in Kharkiv and Kherson region. Russian Army crossed the river near Izium and have broken through Ukrainian lines.

Polesia Frontline

includes Kyiv and Zhytomyr Oblast

Local authorities denied information about Ukrainian offensive and encirclement of Russian troops in Bucha and Hostomel. Heavy fighting was reported near Makariv. Russian artillery attacked Ukrainian positions at Nova Buda, Ozershchyna and Nalyvaikiva.

Russian forces unsuccessfully attempted to break thought Ukrainian lines in the vicinity of Brovary.

Zhytomyr Oblast

There was no change on the ground in Zhytomyr Oblast.

Northern Frontline

includes Chernhiv and Sumy Oblast

Chernihiv Oblast

The regional capital of Chernihiv is de-facto besieged. The last free roads leading from/to the city are now in the fire range of Russian troops. The situation in Slavotych remains difficult. Russian snipers are active in the area, there are KIAs among Ukrainian defenders.

Sumy Oblast

Russian troops have entrenched in the vicinity of Sumy, complicating the possible operation to lift the siege of the regional capital. Ukrainian troops have switched to offensive in Trostianets, they no longer just defend the northern part of the town.

Sloboda Frontline

includes Kharkiv and Luhansk Oblast

Kharkiv Oblast

Ukrainian 92nd Mechanized Brigade attacked Russian positions at the eastern outskirts of Kharkiv. As the result of the attack, Ukrainian troops liberated Mala Rohan and Vilkhivka.

Russian forces crossed Seversky Donets south of Izium and have broken through Ukrainian lines. The enemy breakthrough was stopped at Kamyanka and Tykhotske. The status of Ukrainian troops in the southern part of Izium is unclear.

Luhansk Oblast

Russian forces continue to bomb Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk and Popasna, but they didn’t advance on the ground.

Pryazovia Frontline

includes Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia Oblast

Donetsk Oblast

Russian forces claim they have captured the area between Verkhnotoretske and Panteleimonivka. I couldn’t verify the information at this moment, but it’s good to keep it in mind for the next summaries.

Zaporizhzhia Oblast

There was no change on the ground in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

Mariupol

The area under Ukrainian control is slowly shrinking. French President Macron said that France, Greece and Turkey are working on a humanitarian operation to evacuate civilians from Mariupol.

Southern Frontline

includes Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblast

Mykolaiv Oblast

Russian troops left Snihurivka. I cannot verify the fate of the Russian element in the area of Inhulka, Yavkyne and Partyzanske, so I decided to keep the uncontrolled territory there. Let’s hope we all learn more tomorrow.

Kherson Oblast

Ukrainian troops liberated Novovorontsovka on the edge of Kherson Oblast in the north.

Wow, what a day! Let’s treat this as a recap.

Thanks to Russia, cats and dogs are working together with the French, to do something that should’ve been done weeks ago.

x 🚨 Pres Macron just announced that 🇫🇷, together with 🇹🇷 and 🇬🇷, is planning an ""exceptional humanitarian operation"" to evacuate civilians from #Mariupol. Paris has been in contact with Mariupol's mayor and the 🇫🇷 President will discuss this issue with Putin ""in the coming hours"". — Pierre Morcos (@morcos_pierre) March 25, 2022

The key here is that French President Emmanuel Macron hasn’t told Vladimir Putin yet. This isn’t some bullshit drawn-out negotiation. France, Greece and Turkey are working together to make it happen, and France will tell Putin, not ask for permission. Putin might threaten in return, which would lead to a standoff. Russia could blockade entrance to the Azov Sea. The whole area is heavily mined, so relief ships would be in great danger. Any evacuation would lead to shelling of the refugees making a run for the waiting ships. And Russians might try to block any escape, for fear of Azov members and other Ukrainian forces blending in and getting out. So this is by no means an easy operation. But so glad it’s being worked on.

Kyiv/northern front: No territory changed hands. Artillery battles playing out in NW Kyiv, while another Russian attempt to break through Brovary on the northeastern side was repulsed by Ukraine. Makariv was declared liberated a couple of days ago, but Ukraine reports heavy fighting continues around that town.

Kharkiv/Sumy/Northeast front: Ukrainian forces pushed Russians out of two villages east of Kharkiv, offering some relief to the besieged city. In Sumy Oblast, Russian forces are once again on the offensive, though no territory changed hands.

Donbas front: Russian troops made gains in their efforts to fully encircle Izyum, gaining about 10 kms of ground to its southeast. This town is critical for both resupplying Ukrainian forces in the region, and because the Donets river that runs through the middle of the city creates a natural barrier to the Russian advance. Russia is most active on this front, and it’s clear they’re going to redouble their efforts here. Mariupol hangs on. Taking the city is costing Russia dearly, by the looks of all the destroyed equipment and dead bodies (drone footage, but forewarned) on Twitter and Telegram.

Mykolaiv/Kherson/Crimea/South front: Ukraine was confirmed to have liberated Snihurivka and Novovorontsovka in the region.

Top-right arrow is Novovorontsovka, bottom-left is Snihurivka. Ukraine liberated both today.

With Snihurivka taken (the bottom arrow), that’s a lot of Russian forces cut off to its northeast, though no one (aside from the Ukrainian and Russian armies) really knows what’s left up there. I’m torn between rooting for Russia to have pulled back, allowing Ukraine to roll up that territory with minimal loss, and having Russian forces trapped up there, easier pickings for the defenders. Regardless, that weird, under-resourced, and always doomed effort reaching out to Kryvyi Rih is officially over, just when I had finally learned to spell that city’s name without looking it up.

To stress again (as I did in a previous update), the New York Times report that Ukraine had a presence in Kherson was utter bullshit, a mangling of a Pentagon report that Ukraine was now challenging Kherson Oblast, the administrative region. And it’s doing so, as far as we can tell, by shelling Kherson’s airport, currently occupied by Russia. The traditional media has done a great job covering the refugee and humanitarian crisis, but an abysmal job covering the military side. Don’t assume they know what they’re talking about just because they’re The New York Times or other such mainstream news outlet.

Meanwhile, I’ve been saying that Russia’s weakness would embolden violence in the central Asian countries it has meddled in. For example, Armenia holds disputed territory in Azerbaijan, held with the help of Russian “peacekeepers.” Well, so much for that peace.

x More horrible developments in Karabakh today - killed and wounded among Karabakh Armenians as Azerbaijan launches offensive. Will update heavily on it tomorrow, have just filed my final Ukraine piece and am exhausted now. — Neil Hauer (@NeilPHauer) March 25, 2022

Russia’s fall from grace will embolden not just an effort to retake many of these disputed territories, but could also spark new violence in some of Russia’s hinterland regions. Indeed, it might even be in China’s interest to quietly prod some of those along. Expect a lot of violence in the years ahead now that the myth of the Russian Bear has been shattered.
