PMs Mateusz Morawiecki of Poland, Petr Fiala of Czech Republic, and Janez Janša of Slovenia, along with Polish deputy-PM Jaroslaw Kaczynski, yesterday embarked on a perilous three-hour train journey to besieged Kyiv to meet with the Ukrainian leadership.

Arriving in the Ukrainian capital late afternoon yesterday, the EU and NATO leaders were the first foreign heads of state or government to come to Kyiv since the beginning of the Russian invasion on February 24.

According to a statement released by the Polish government earlier on Tuesday, the three leaders acted as representatives of the European Council. Their visit was meant to express “the unequivocal support of the entire European Union for the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine” and “present a broad package of support for Ukraine and Ukrainians”.

Although confirming that they had been informed of the trip, EU officials slightly distanced themselves from the initiative and denied the three Central European leaders had an official EU mandate.

In Kyiv, where Russia’s sustained shelling continued and several casualties were reported on Tuesday, they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.

It is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made. It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance.

Explosions could be heard across the city as the meeting took place, and a curfew was introduced by mayor Vitali Klitschko until at least Thursday morning.

Thanking them for this unprecedented show of solidarity, Zelensky said that their visit was “a powerful expression of support for Ukraine”.

“With allies like this we will win the war,” the President, who briefed the Central European leaders on the military and humanitarian situation in the country, told reporters.

PM Shmyhal declared that “devastating” sanctions against Russia were discussed during the meeting, and Poland’s de-facto leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski called for an international peacekeeping mission to be deployed in Ukraine.",https://kafkadesk.org/2022/03/16/czech-polish-and-slovenian-leaders-head-home-after-daring-visit-to-kyiv/

The three EU heads of government stressed in their message that Europe stands with Ukraine in its defence against Russia’s aggression. Negotiations revolved around securing further material help for Ukraine and expanding sanctions on Russia.

Together with representatives of Poland and Slovenia, Prime Minister Fiala expressed his admiration and support for Ukraine at a press conference in Kyiv after talks were held between the two parties on Tuesday evening.

All three EU heads of government also stressed the need to continue to supply the country with weapons. Poland’s President Mateusz Morawiecky added that Ukraine should be awarded candidate status for EU membership as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Slovenia’s Prime Minister Denys Jansha told his Ukrainian counterparts that their country was also fighting the wider European family of nations by defending its basic values of freedom, democracy and the rule of law.

The delegation to Kyiv also included Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński, who expressed his condolences with all of the victims of the fighting and called for a NATO or wider international peace mission in Ukraine that would be active on the territory of Ukraine and able to defend itself.

Ukraine’s President Zelensky said that the “visit is a powerful expression of support for Ukraine”, adding that with “friends and neighbours such as these” he was “certain that Ukraine can win”.

The visit had been discussed at last week’s informal meeting of EU leaders in Versailles and had the approval of both the European Commission and other EU member states, Poland’s Prime Minister said. Leading Czech state officials, as well as politicians from a wide range of Parliamentary parties expressed their support for Mr Fiala’s decision to meet with his Ukrainian counterparts in person.

The Czech Prime Minister returned to Prague around noon on Wednesday. Aside from praising the bravery of the Ukrainian people, he also remarked that he had been impressed by the ability of the country’s leaders to remain strategic and rational in their thinking despite working in dangerous wartime conditions. He also offered further details on some of the topics that were discussed.

“We discussed the possibility of the formation of a wider international coalition of states, not just of the EU but of NATO for example, that would offer asylum to soldiers of the Russian Federation who decide not to fight and desert. We also spoke about the possibility of the EU being represented in Kyiv via a diplomatic mission that would be based there.”

The Czech prime minister also said that the topic of establishing a no-fly-zone had been touched on during the talks. While he admitted that the establishment of a NATO no-fly-zone was not realistic in the coming days, he said that Ukrainians would be able to secure their airspace by themselves if they are provided with the necessary weapons and military hardware.",https://english.radio.cz/czech-polish-and-slovenian-pms-meet-zelensky-kyiv-8745001

The government officials from Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia arrived in Kyiv by train — a highly risky journey that was kept secret until they boarded because of security concerns, officials said.

The trio are the first foreign leaders to visit Ukraine since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his deadly invasion Feb. 24.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal publicly welcomed them in a tweet that said, “The courage of true friends of [Ukraine]!

“Discussing support of #Ukraine and strengthening sanctions against the Russian aggression,” Ukraine’s PM added.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Czech Republic Prime Minister Petr Fiala tweeted photos of themselves, Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa and Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński seated around a map spread out on a long table as they traveled to Ukraine.

“It is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made. It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny,” wrote Morawiecki — whose chief of staff said the trip had been planned over the past few days but was kept hush-hush because of security worries.

An EU official said there was no “formal mandate” for the meeting but called it “a very valid initiative.”

It’s a fine line.”Hours earlier, powerful explosions rocked the city of some 2.8 million residents before dawn in what Ukrainian authorities said were airstrikes and shelling.

Four people were killed in the attacks, which included a 15-story apartment building being hit, authorities said.

Afterward, Kyiv’s mayor, former heavyweight boxing champ Vitali Klitschko, announced the curfew beginning at 8 p.m. local time.

He said residents were forbidden from moving around the city without special permission until 7 a.m Thursday unless they’re headed to bomb shelters.

Meanwhile, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators also planned to hold a second day of talks as the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine entered its 20th day.

The talks between the two sides failed to make a breakthrough Monday, though they had expressed some optimism.

Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said the negotiators would discuss “peace, ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops and security guarantees.”

The Red Cross and the United Nations refugee agency say millions of people face food and medicine shortages along with the threats of deadly shelling and air attacks.

Three European leaders are expected to travel to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv on Tuesday before a 35-hour curfew for civilians takes effect as Russian forces advance and the city is under sustained shelling.

The prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic – all NATO member countries – are to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki tweeted on Tuesday that he and his deputy prime minister, Jarosław Kaczyński, as well as Czech Republic Prime Minister Petr Fiala and Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša would be traveling to Kyiv as representatives of the European Council.

""Europe must guarantee Ukraine's independence and ensure that it is ready to help in Ukraine's reconstruction,"" he wrote.

The Polish government also announced the trip in a statement in English on their website.

International community has been informed about the visit by international organizations, i.a. the UN.""

Meanwhile, Zelenskyy, appearing virtually, addressed leaders of the UK Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF).

""We can still stop the killing of people and that is something we can do together — stop the destruction of democracy and do it now on our land or else they will also come to you,"" he said Tuesday during the meeting hosted by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Leaders of Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway attended in-person at the Lancaster House in London.

Zelenskyy is seeking to extend martial law until April 24 and to require men ages 18 to 60 to stay in the country to fight. Ukraine's parliament is expected to vote on the measure this week.

The Ukrainian leader appealed for more weapons to counter Russia’s military. He said Ukraine's forces are rapidly using up weapons and other hardware supplied by Western nations, and he asked northern European leaders to ""help yourself by helping us.""

This comes before a 35-hour curfew is to go into effect in Kyiv on Tuesday evening.

When Russia launched the war three weeks ago, fear of an imminent invasion gripped the Ukrainian capital, and residents slept in subway stations or crammed onto trains to flee the city. But as the Russian offensive became bogged down, Kyiv saw a relative lull. U.S. officials say Russian forces were about 9 miles from the center of the city as of Monday, according to The Associated Press.

But large explosions thundered across Kyiv before dawn Tuesday from what Ukrainian authorities said were artillery strikes. Zelenskyy said barrages hit four multi-story buildings in the city and caused dozens of deaths.

The early morning shelling hit the Svyatoshynskyi district of western Kyiv, adjacent to the suburb of Irpin, which has seen some of the worst battles of the war. Flames shot out of the 15-story apartment building and smoke choked the air as firefighters climbed ladders to rescue people. The assault blackened several floors of the building, ripped a hole in the ground outside and blew out windows in neighboring apartment blocks.

In a message posted to Telegram, Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said the curfew takes effect at 8 p.m. Tuesday and ends at 7 am. Thursday. Announcing military command’s decision, he warned that movement throughout the city without special passes was prohibited unless people are headed to bomb shelters.

""Today is a difficult and dangerous moment,"" he said.

He said civilians should prepare not to leave home for two days, unless sirens warning of air raids go off. Then, in that case, residents should be prepared not to leave shelters during that time-period.

""The capital - the heart of Ukraine - will be defended!"" Klitschko added. ""And Kyiv, which today is a symbol and outpost of European freedom and security, we will not give up! We will not be brought to our knees! Today the efforts of every Kyivan are important.""

Klitschko appealed to the men of Kyiv to ""come back"" and defend their city and said volunteers were needed to build fortifications and prepare and deliver food for defenders and vulnerable citizens.

""Men of Kiev! Come back! We need to protect our city and our future!"" he said. ""Instead of sitting somewhere and sympathizing! Ukrainians have shown the world their courage and willingness to fight for their land. Only together we will survive! Glory to Ukraine!""

The U.N. has described the flood of people crossing into Poland and other neighboring countries as Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since World War II.

The International Organization for Migration revealed on Tuesday that more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded, according to The Associated Press.

Russian and Ukrainian negotiators also planned to hold a second day of talks as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reached its 20th day. The Ukrainian government said new aid and evacuation efforts would take place Tuesday along nine corridors around the country, including the Kyiv region. But past evacuation attempts have repeatedly failed amid continued fighting.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said an evacuation involving 30 buses was planned from Sumy in northeast Ukraine. The organization said it still had not gotten aid to Mariupol, an encircled port city of 430,000 where local officials estimate a lethal siege has killed more than 2,300 people and left residents desperate for food, water, heat and medicine.

LONDON — Three European leaders staged a defiant show of support for Ukraine on Tuesday, traveling to its besieged capital, Kyiv, even as a relentless Russian artillery bombardment left apartment towers in the city ablaze, forcing terrified residents to flee into the street with only the clothes on their backs.

The dramatic visit by the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, which unfolded in tight secrecy as they crossed the Ukrainian border by train after dawn, was a strikingly personal gesture. But it caught other European leaders off guard, angering some and baring uncomfortable divisions in how best to demonstrate Western solidarity with Ukraine.

It also came as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia disparaged the second consecutive day of negotiations with Ukraine, undercutting the faint glimmers of hope raised from talks the day before that both sides were looking for a way to halt the war.

The Kremlin slapped retaliatory sanctions on President Biden and other senior American officials. Mr. Biden announced his own plans to travel to Europe next week to showcase the unity of the NATO alliance in the face of Russian aggression.

A spokesman for Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the three visitors were “de facto” representing the European Union in Ukraine. In Brussels, however, officials said the trio did not have the E.U.’s blessing, and some European diplomats complained that the trip was too risky, given the Russian forces encircling Kyiv.

Others said they admired the audacity of the group, which also included Prime Minister Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic and Prime Minister Janez Jansa of Slovenia, casting it as a powerful symbol of the backing for Ukraine among countries on Europe’s eastern flank, where the specter of Russian aggression looms larger than in Paris or London.

Still, for all the symbolism of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine’s leaders under the threat of Russia’s rockets, Ukraine was facing the devastating barrage largely on its own. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, imposed a 35-hour curfew, starting on Tuesday evening, which suggested the capital was entering an even more difficult phase of its grinding struggle to hold off Russian troops and tanks.

“This is their attempt to annihilate the Ukrainian people,” President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an emotional video address to the Canadian Parliament, repeating his plea for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over the country. “It is an attempt to destroy our future, our nation, our character.”

Mr. Zelensky asked the lawmakers to imagine if the CN Tower in Toronto were shelled like the towers in Kyiv. His language has become more pointed, even scolding, with each speech to a Western audience, revealing his frustration with leaders who have resisted more direct military involvement out of fear that it would entangle them in a wider conflict with Russia.

The Ukrainian leader, who has become a hero to many in the West, is scheduled to speak via video to Congress on Wednesday, where he is expected to amplify his pleas for more help and increase the pressure on the United States and its allies.

Mr. Biden is planning to announce $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday, according to White House officials. The administration last week announced $200 million in security assistance for Ukraine and has made available a total of $2 billion in such funding.

On Tuesday evening, the Polish state broadcaster carried video of the Czech, Slovene and Polish leaders meeting Mr. Zelensky and other officials across a long table, with Ukraine’s blue-and-yellow flag behind them.

The Prime Ministers of 🇵🇱 @MorawieckiM, 🇸🇮 @JJansaSDS and 🇨🇿 @P_Fiala arrived on the behalf of @EUCouncil to #Kyiv today. The courage of true friends of 🇺🇦! Discussing support of #Ukraine and strengthening sanctions against the Russian aggression. — Denys Shmyhal (@Denys_Shmyhal) March 15, 2022

“They are here to support us,” Mr. Zelensky said at a news briefing after the meeting, which also was shown on Ukrainian television. “It is a great, courageous, right, friendly step. I am confident that with such friends, such countries and neighbors and partners, we can really win.”

A photograph posted earlier on Mr. Morawiecki’s Twitter account showed the three men poring over a map, seated in what appeared to be a train carriage en route to the Ukrainian capital.

“It is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made,” Mr. Morawiecki said in the Twitter post. “It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance.”

The White House announced that Mr. Biden would fly to Brussels for an extraordinary summit meeting of NATO on March 24. That may result in further economic and military aid for Ukraine but will likely fall short of Mr. Zelensky’s request for a no-fly zone. Administration officials declined to say whether Mr. Biden planned to meet with the Ukrainian president, whom he has called a hero. But they said Mr. Biden may go on to somewhere in Eastern Europe to meet with refugees streaming out of Ukraine.

The river of people fleeing the war continued unabated on Tuesday, as Russia claimed to have seized control of the strategic Kherson region in the south. Russian forces kept up their pounding of civilian targets in Kyiv, where Ukrainian troops were fortifying intersections with sandbags, tires, and iron spikes.

A pre-dawn rain of rockets on Kyiv shattered windows, left craters in buildings, and turned a 16-floor apartment house into a towering inferno. The fire spread quickly after a missile struck the building, blowing a jagged hole at its entrance. Firefighters rescued residents from windows by ladder through billowing smoke. By midafternoon, they had carried out two bodies encased in black bags.

“I came out with nothing,” said Mykola Fedkiv, 85, a retired geologist. “I left everything, my telephone, my medicines, everything.”

When the missile struck, Mr. Fedkiv fled his 12th-floor apartment and made his way down the stairs. He climbed through the blasted entrance hall and found himself in the bomb crater. People pulled him out by his arms. He stood outside for hours, hoping to re-enter his apartment to collect personal documents. Asked where he planned to stay the night, he responded, “God knows.”

Conditions were even more desperate in the coastal city of Mariupol, which has been pummeled by Russian forces in a two-week siege that has left some residents crushed in the rubble and many others dying in a winter freeze with no heat, food, or clean water. Officials can no longer account for the number of dead and missing.

Officially, 2,400 civilians killed in Mariupol have been identified, but Pyotr Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city government, said he believed the toll was far higher, possibly as many as 20,000. Ukrainian estimates of the number of people trapped have ranged from 200,000 to 400,000.

Mr. Andryushchenko said 2,000 vehicles had managed to escape Mariupol on Tuesday and that another 2,000 were packed and ready to leave. Officials told civilians to “delete all messages and photos from phones” in case Russian soldiers searched them for signs of support for Ukrainian forces.

The perils of reporting accurate information from Ukraine’s combat zones were further underscored Tuesday with news that a Fox News cameraman and a Ukrainian colleague had been killed in an attack on Monday outside Kyiv — raising to at least three the number of journalist fatalities in Ukraine in the past few days.

In Kherson, a southern city under Russian occupation, the mayor said that members of Russia’s national guard were rounding up activists who opposed Russia’s presence, possibly trying to recruit them through coercion.

“They’re all in the city, in the jail,” the mayor, Igor Kolykhaev, wrote in several text messages, referring to the activists. Russian troops, he said, “collect them, hold them, work them over and release them.”

Kherson was the first major city to fall to Russian forces after the Feb. 24 start of the invasion. Although Kremlin officials had predicted that the Ukrainian people would welcome their “liberation” by Russian troops, residents of Kherson have been defiant, regularly gathering in the central square to protest the Russian presence, even when Russian troops fire into the air to disperse them.

Russia claimed to have captured the entire Kherson region, potentially strengthening its ability to push west toward the strategic port cities of Mykolaiv and Odessa. A senior Ukrainian military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that Russian forces were in control of much of the Kherson region, but said Ukrainian forces were attacking their positions and inflicting losses.

Negotiations via video link between Russia and Ukraine continued for a second day on Tuesday, though Mr. Putin doused prospects of any imminent breakthrough. In a phone call with the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, Mr. Putin complained that “Kyiv is not demonstrating a serious attitude toward finding mutually acceptable solutions,” according to the Kremlin.

Mr. Putin also continued to struggle in the information battle with Ukraine. On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron of France said his country could offer diplomatic “protection” to a Russian state television employee who was detained and fined over an on-air antiwar protest on Monday.

The employee, Marina Ovsyannikova, burst onto the live broadcast of Russia’s most-watched news program on Monday evening, yelling, “Stop the war!” and holding a sign that read, “They’re lying to you here.”

Russia also faced further isolation from Britain, which imposed sanctions on more than 370 people it labeled oligarchs, political allies of, or propagandists for Mr. Putin. Among those blacklisted: Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president of Russia; Mikhail Mishustin, the current prime minister; and Mikhail Fridman, the billionaire founder of Alfa Bank, one of the country’s largest private banks.

Russia, for its part, said it had sanctioned 13 Americans including Mr. Biden, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III in response to American sanctions against Mr. Putin and other officials. Also on its list was Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, and Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.

Mr. Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, shrugged off the news, suggesting in jest that the Kremlin’s announcement might have missed its intended mark. The president, Ms. Psaki said, is a “junior, so they might have sanctioned his dad by mistake.”

Moscow attacked its neighbor in late February, following a seven-year standoff over Ukraine’s failure to implement the terms of the Minsk agreements, and Russia’s eventual recognition of the Donbass republics in Donetsk and Lugansk. The German- and French-brokered protocols were designed to regularize the status of the regions within the Ukrainian state.

Russia has now demanded that Ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join NATO. Kiev insists the Russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force.",https://www.rt.com/russia/551961-prime-ministers-heading-kiev/
