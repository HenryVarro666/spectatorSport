The Panamanian-flagged civilian ship “HELT”, taken hostage by invaders the day before yesterday, was sunk by gunfire from a Russian warship.

We have now received voice messages exchanged by the boatswain with a representative of the shipowner.

""Know this, it's all Russia's fault, they started the war and they bombed HELT too,"" was the message sent by the boatswain of the downed ship, not knowing if he and the crew would be able to escape.

According to reports, the boatswain and the cook had survived and were trying to locate the rest of the crew. Meanwhile, the dry cargo ship was completely sunk. A Russian Navy ship prevented the rescue operation by threatening to open fire.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the aggressor fleet has already shelled five civilian ships, one of which was completely sunk, and another with a cargo of 600 tons of diesel fuel has been on fire for several days, which the hijackers do not allow to extinguish.

In addition, three civilian ships remain hostage to the invaders and cannot move because of a threat from the Russians.

POLICY

Office of the President of Ukraine re talks with Russia

Officially, Ukraine and Russia reached understanding on the establishment of humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians. Same corridors will be used for the provision of medicine and food into the cities with the most concentrated fighting with the possibility of temporary cease fire (only in the areas of humanitarian help). With this goal, special channels of network and collaboration will be created. Logistic procedures are to be established shortly. “We hope to continue to discuss other aspects of the truce soon.” stressed Podoliyak.

Prime Minister of Ukraine

The Blietzkrieg failed. None of the regional centers in Ukraine are surrendering to the enemy. Ukraine is transitioning to a state of total resistance. In cities and villages, people are blocking the military vehicles, attacking the convoys, and capturing Russian soldiers.

The whole world stands with Ukraine. Thousands of international volunteers are coming to Ukraine to fight on the side of freedom. Ukraine has received tons of weapons from its allies.

The world helps us financially. Today was signed a memorandum on macro-financial support from the EU amounting to 1.2 billion Euros. Within the next hours, an agreement will be signed on creating a multi-donor monetary fund including a World Bank loan amounting to $1.8 billion.

Ukraine is also calling on international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency to demand from NATO to immediately close Ukrainian sky over Nuclear power plants.

Ukraine is also calling on the UN and Red Cross. After attacking civilians, Russian troops are seen by the whole world as terrorists. They don’t allow to provide help for the wounded. In several cities, children, the elderly, and pregnant women are trapped by the enemy. Many of them have been surviving without electricity, heat, water supply, food, and medical help for a few days now. The invader doesn’t create green corridors for evacuation. Ukraine demands to ensure green corridors to evacuate and help everyone who needs it.

Despite enemy attacks, all systems ensuring the proper functioning of the state are intact. There is undeniable stability in the work of Ukrainian Government. Despite the war, Ministry of Social Policy and Pension Fund have paid all pensions to almost 13 million retired citizens in Ukraine. The Government prepared an assistance program for all Ukrainians who have lost their jobs. Every employee and sole proprietor who lost their job due to war will receive 6500 UAH unconditionally during March.

Ukrainian Railways started procuring food, fuel, medicines, electricity, and other important goods and services for the population. The enterprise will be in close contact with military administrations to address the most pressing needs of people and the state.

Ukrainian Government is creating four funds that will be used to rebuild the country.

1. Fund for the Restoration of destroyed property and infrastructure. With the aim to rebuild every house, apartment, school, kindergarten, hospital, bridge, and road that the invaders destroyed.

2. Fund for Economic Recovery and Transformation. Ukraine will address it`s partners to provide ‘Ukrainian Marshall Plan.’

3. Debt Service and Repayment Fund. Focus of the fund will be arround fulfillment of all Ukrainian obligations. On March 1, the Ministry of Finance made a coupon payment of $292 million on Eurobonds. In the face of Russian invation financial aid to support Ukrainian obligations will be welcomed and needed.

4. Affected Business Support Fund. Tasked with helping business return to it1s full scale activities.

Prosecutor general of Ukraine

Russia is attacking Ukrainian cities in violation of international humanitarian law.

Russian forces are using cluster munitions and other weapons prohibited by international humanitarian law to bomb civilian population.

1000 civilians are dead, more than 20 children have been killed, 1 million of Ukrainians left the country.

Russia is liable as a state on international and individual levels. If Russia is not held accountable the credibility of international law will be permanently undermined.

International community was unanimous on imposing sanctions on Russia. “We welcome the decision of the prosecutor of international criminal court to proceed with investigation of Russian and Belarus crimes against Ukraine.” underlined Venediktova.

Ukrainians are also investigating Russian crimes to ensure criminal accountability of these crimes.

Ukraine appeal the international community to commence investigations in the committed war crimes. Lithuania and Poland are already investigating the war crimes on the territory of Ukraine.

The international community should consider strengthening sanctions against Russia, as well as persons involved in planning and executing the military operation on Ukraine.

No Russian should benefit from the assets that are being held abroad in safety until now. We are establishing a task force to freeze and seize these assets. These possessions should be directed to Ukraine post-war reconstruction.

ECONOMY

The Ministry of Economy of Ukraine

The Ministry of Economy of Ukraine sent a number of appeals to influential companies and institutions with a request to apply severe measures against Russia, calling for the implementation of the following restrictive measures:

• To companies: Moody’s Corporation, AM Best Rating Services, S&P Global, Fitch Group – lower Russia’s credit rating to the minimum, which will cause mass requirements to repay debt obligations and will make Russian economy more vulnerable.

• To the International Bureau of Expositions – close Russian pavilion at Expo 2020 in Dubai and exclude Moscow from the list of candidates to hold Expo 2030.

• To the members of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade – apply the widest embargo on Russian products or apply a non-automatic licensing, which will decrease the export of Russian goods to a minimum. In particular, steel and raw goods.

• To the International Labour Organization – revoke ILO membership of Russia and Belarus, who cynically trampled internationally recognized fundamental rights, freedoms, and guarantees that form the foundation of the organization.",https://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/ukraine-war-bulletin-march-3-800-pm-est
5,f817d09f-40c5-47b4-8ba5-e0b71d72267b,"['Tara John', 'Anneclaire Stapleton', 'Joseph Ataman', 'Vasyk Didyk']",2022-03-04 00:00:00,"Shehyni, Ukraine (CNN) The gray asphalt road that leads to Ukraine's Shehyni border crossing with Poland has for the past week seen 30-mile tailbacks as people try to flee the country, often saying tearful goodbyes to the family members and friends staying behind to fight the Russian invasion.

Wednesday brought a different sight: groups of young men, laden with heavy bags and military kit, entered Ukraine from Poland as they answered President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for ""citizens of the world"" to fight ""Russian war criminals.""

Among them, New York resident Vasyk Didyk, a 26-year-old carpenter wearing a fluorescent Carhartt beanie who is originally from Ukraine.

""This is our motherland,"" he told CNN in Shehyni. ""We couldn't stay in our comfortable lives in America and watch what is happening here.""

I haven't been back to Ukraine in four years -- but it wasn't even a choice.

Didyk, accompanied by his friend Igor Harmaii, had spent 24 hours traveling from New York to Poland before crossing back into his homeland carrying a canvas backpack and pulling a suitcase on wheels.

He has no military training and came despite his parents, who do not live in Ukraine, weeping on the phone when they heard he was joining the fight.

""I haven't been back to Ukraine in four years -- but it wasn't even a choice,"" he said. ""I had to come and help my country.""

The world has watched in horror since Russia invaded Ukraine late last week, triggering what could be the largest land war in Europe since World War II. And Zelensky's defiance has not only united Western opposition to Russia, but also inspired foreign volunteers and Ukrainians abroad to fight for the cause.

""This is not just Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" Zelensky said on Sunday. ""This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules, and peaceful coexistence.""

Ukrainian embassies have been helping recruit foreign fighters, while at least one senior politician from a Western government that has previously prosecuted those who joined foreign wars indicated support for citizens taking up arms in Ukraine.

""If people want to support that struggle, I will support them doing that,"" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC on Sunday

Asked by CNN whether it consented to French foreign fighters in Ukraine, the French government said: ""Ukraine is a war zone, classified as a red zone in the travel advice, updated on a permanent basis and available under the following link (Travel advice). As a result, we formally advise against any travel to Ukraine.""

The question was not directly answered by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a press briefing on Wednesday

When asked about American foreign fighters he said the US has been ""clear for some time"" in telling ""Americans who may be thinking of traveling there not to go.""

Vasyk Didyk (left) and Igor Shehyni (right) arrive in Ukraine on Wednesday after more than 24 hours of travel from New York.

If Americans want to help Ukraine, ""there are many ways to do that, including by supporting and helping the many NGOs that are working to provide humanitarian assistance; providing resources themselves to groups that are trying to help Ukraine by being advocates for Ukraine,"" he said.

On Thursday, Zelensky said the first of 16,000 foreign fighters were making their way to Ukraine ""to protect freedom and life for us, and for all,"" he said. CNN has not been able to confirm those numbers.

""An attack on Europe""

In the English city of Milton Keynes, more than 1,200 miles west from Shehyni, British builder Jake Dale said the call for foreigners to join Ukraine's International Legion inspired him to book a flight to Poland on Friday. He aims to cross into Ukraine by Saturday afternoon.

""As soon as I heard his [Zelensky's] call -- it made me think he needs help,"" the 29-year-old said from his home he shares with his girlfriend and two children. ""I think it is a worthy cause to risk my life, and my girlfriend feels the same. Obviously, she gets upset, as anyone would, but she supports it as she can see I want to help.""

Back in 2015, Dale wanted to join a Kurdish militia group, the People's Protection Units, or YPG, which was leading the fight against ISIS in Syria, but decided against it due to warnings by the British government.

This time, he is not worried about the potential legal trouble he could face on his return from Ukraine. ""I'm willing to deal with it,"" he said after the British government distanced itself from Truss's comments.

During a trip to Poland, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK was not ""actively"" supporting volunteers going to fight. ""I can understand why people feel as they do, but we have laws in our country about international conflicts and how they must be conducted,"" Johnson told reporters.

Dale is heading to Ukraine with Peter Hurst, a 36-year-old former infantry soldier with the British Army, who did a tour of Afghanistan before leaving the military in 2011.

The father of five, who lives in the northern English town of Pontefract, spoke to CNN on a video call while he picked out kit from an army supplies store in a nearby town. He said wanted to fight to protect democratic values and freedoms.

British citizen Jake Dale (left) is pictured with his family. Peter Hurst (right) is pictured with his wife on their wedding day. Both men plan to be in Ukraine by Saturday.

""It feels like an attack on Europe. If you don't help stop war there [in Ukraine], it will probably spread,"" he said.

Both Hurst and Dale met this week on a Facebook group -- created to help supply British medical and military aid to Ukraine. They have been working with a liaison -- whose name is listed on an information pack sent by the Ukrainian embassy -- who will provide them with body armor and vests in Poland.

Dale has spent £300 ($400) buying kit and plane tickets and worries about the financial impact of him not working. ""It will be a strain on my family when I leave,"" he said. ""But I am sure we will be fine.""

Not everyone is supportive of the idea of foreign fighters in Ukraine.

US-based extremist tracking organization SITE Intelligence Group has warned of the involvement of outfits such as Azov, a paramilitary group whose logo is the Wolfsangel, a symbol appropriated by Nazi Germany

""Following Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine, far-right communities online have rallied to the side of groups like Azov, both in terms of fundraising and stating their intent to fight alongside them,"" a SITE report says.

The British government has told those without military training to avoid the fight.

On the Facebook group Hurst and Dale met on, one user warns : ""That is absolutely no place to be for someone with no weapon handling skills and doesn't speak the language. Apart from being a danger to others it's not fair on the lads themselves.""

Dale says he is aware of such warnings but insists his skills as a qualified mechanic could be useful.

""People can say it is wrong to go in without a military background, but I believe by fighting alongside Ukrainians, I am answering their call for help,"" he said. ""Putin's regime is ruthless -- it is not just Ukraine we are protecting.""

""As long as we have to""

Ukrainian citizen Valery, who asked for his last name not to be published, lives in eastern France, but felt compelled to return to visit his elderly parents as Russia massed troops on Ukraine's border.

The February 24 invasion began soon after he arrived in Kyiv, where it was heralded with pre-dawn warning sirens.

""I woke up around five o'clock in the morning with the very strange sound,"" he said. ""I thought I was still dreaming. I couldn't believe my ears. But the sound was so persistent I couldn't fall asleep any further.""

How useful can I be to my country? The first thought was to join the army and check how useful I can be. Valery

Valery said his mind then turned to one thing: ""How useful can I be to my country? The first thought was to join the army and check how useful I can be.""

After enlisting at a conscription center, the 45-year-old said he ""felt this sense of nausea"" when he received his weapon, realizing normality had been shattered. ""Kyiv has been a very peaceful town since 1943,"" he said.

Valery is serving with five others in a military unit. ""Many of them have families, have children. Nonetheless, they joined,"" he said, adding that morale is high within the forces. ""There is a lot of determination to defeat the enemy.""

All foreign fighters share that determination -- but the people crossing into Ukraine vary wildly in terms of their organization and experience.

CNN spoke to a group of six volunteers, made up of Americans and one Briton, with military equipment in a packed train station in Pzsemysl, Poland. ""If more people would have joined the fight in 1936 we wouldn't be dealing with fascism now,"" the British man said. Most said they are veterans; one said he is not and has never fought in a war.

None speaks Ukrainian, Russian or Polish, and they did not have a translator or a plan to get to the conflict.

""We've tried to get in touch with (the) embassy but (traffic) crashed all the websites,"" one said. ""There's women and children dying indiscriminately and you know -- we gotta be here,"" said another.

Elsewhere, CNN spoke with a band of Brits and Canadians who had met each other in a Polish airport, all determined to cross the border and join the Ukrainians in battle.

Wali, who is French Canadian, said he had served as a sniper in Afghanistan and volunteered previously to fight against ISIS in 2015. He added that he has contacts in Ukraine who can supply him with weapons. ""My friend ... called me and said, OK, we really need you,"" he said.

Back at the border crossing in Shehyni, New Yorkers Didyk and Harmaii wrangle with their canvas backpacks and wheeled suitcases.

When asked how long they plan on staying in Ukraine, they both pause and say almost at the same time: ""As long as we have to.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/europe/ukraine-foreign-fighters-russia-intl-cmd/index.html
6,f817d09f-40c5-47b4-8ba5-e0b71d72267b,"['Analysis Nathan Hodge', 'Tara John', 'Josh Berlinger']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"Moscow (CNN) Russia's assault on Ukraine is just a week old, but its consequences have already been catastrophic.

In the seven days since Russian troops invaded their western neighbor, hundreds of people have been reported dead and one million have fled for their lives . Energy prices are skyrocketing and food prices could be next

No one can say for sure what will happen in the coming days and weeks, but years of relative peace and stability in Europe have already been ruptured, and should the fighting stretch on for months, the crisis could have even greater ramifications.

What happens to Kyiv?

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been very clear about his basic goals in invading: He wants to disarm Ukraine, sever its ties to the NATO military alliance and end the Ukrainian people's aspirations of joining the West.

He has also said he wants to rid the country of what he calls the ""gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people,"" a baseless and highly-charged reference to Ukraine's democratically-elected government and its Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelensky

Russian forces are encircling the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in an apparent push to topple the government, and a 40-mile-long military convoy is edging toward the city, which has been targeted by multiple rocket and missile attacks in recent days.

Zelensky has vowed to keep fighting, but he is under no illusions that Putin's forces ""want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.""

Should those forces take the capital, Ukraine does have other politicians who might be eager to fill the ranks of a pro-Russian puppet regime.

One of Putin's top allies in Ukraine is Viktor Medvedchuk , a prominent politician and oligarch. He faces allegations of treason in Ukraine and has been under house arrest, but his exact whereabouts are unclear.

Territorial goals

Russian forces are also waging campaigns far from Kyiv, attempting to take control of key cities in Ukraine's south and southeast, including Kherson.

The mayor of Kherson effectively admitted that Ukrainian forces had ceded control of the city on Wednesday, saying in a statement on his Facebook page that residents would have to accept the direction of ""armed people who came to the city's administration"" -- in other words, Russian forces.

One former NATO Commander told CNN: ""It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea."" Richard Shirreff, NATO's former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, said the land corridor was ""an obvious objective.""

""He's had Crimea in the Russian Federation since 2014, he's only been able to supply it across the Kerch Strait bridge, and so of course he's looking to establish that land corridor down off the Sea of Azov,"" Shirreff added.

If Russian forces capture the port city of Odessa, it is possible to imagine Moscow creating a land bridge extending all the way across southern Ukraine, potentially even linking Transnistria -- a separatist enclave in Moldova, where Russian troops are stationed -- to Odessa, Crimea and southern and eastern Ukraine.

A partitioned Ukraine

Parts of modern-day Ukraine previously belonged to interwar Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania -- and before that, to the Austro-Hungarian empire. If Putin has partition in mind, Galician Ukraine and the city of Lviv -- close to the Polish border -- could potentially be a part of a sort of rump Ukrainian state, while Russia focuses its attentions on the east of the country.

A division along these lines could make Ukraine ""look like Germany in the Cold War era, with western Ukraine more dependent on Europe, and the Eastern part"" sucked into the Russian spheres of influence, which include Belarus, Russian historian and author Alexander Etkind told CNN.

That kind of redrawing of borders may be an expansionist fantasy, but it could separate out what Moscow -- justifiably or not -- perceives as a more nationalist part of Ukraine.

Scorched earth battle tactics

So far, Ukrainian forces have managed to hold their own against the bigger and much better equipped Russian military

US officials have noted how stretched Russia's supply lines have become even in the early stages of invasion. As one senior US official explained to CNN, Russia anticipated a fast victory and may have neglected to plan for sufficient resupply of its forces.

But US administration officials expect Russia to ramp up its operations in Ukraine, and Putin has previously shown scant regard for human rights or the rules of modern warfare.

Russia's air force backed President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war, providing overwhelming firepower to crush the country's armed opposition groups and flattening entire neighborhoods in the process.

Experts fear the Kremlin could resort to this kind of scorched earth policy in Ukraine, should resistance efforts continue to thwart their plans.

Former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus said Monday that the Russian military had already started using such tactics, including cluster bomb munitions. He also said the Kremlin was bringing in thermobaric munitions -- sometimes known as vacuum bombs -- which create a prolonged pressure wave that can suck the oxygen out of a room or a person's lungs. Use of such weaponry in civilian areas is proscribed by international humanitarian law.

""I fear we'll see more of that,"" Petraeus said. ""They will rubble some cities, I suspect, because in some ways they almost have to depopulate areas or they are not secure in them, and we've seen them do that in the past.""

The US Ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said Wednesday that Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine: ""We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield.""

US President Joe Biden said Wednesday he believes Russia is intentionally targeting civilians in Ukraine -- but declined to say whether he believed war crimes were being committed.

Sanctions

The Kremlin acknowledged Wednesday that Russia's economy is taking ""serious blows,"" as unprecedented sanctions and the country's growing isolation piles pressure on its tottering financial system.

International companies have begun shutting down or suspending their Russian operations.

Apple, the world's most valuable company, announced Tuesday it had stopped selling all of its products in Russia due to the invasion of Ukraine, while Boeing and Airbus are suspending their support for Russian airlines.

Russia's energy riches haven't been directly targeted by Western sanctions, but many of the world's biggest oil companies are quitting the country or halting new investments. Moscow is also finding it harder to sell shipments of Russian crude oil to traders and refineries worried about being caught in the net of financial sanctions.

But experts say Putin has overseen a push to wean Moscow's oil-dependent economy off the dollar in recent years, and has limited government spending and stockpiled foreign currencies.

Putin's economic planners have sought to boost domestic production of certain goods by blocking equivalent products from abroad. Moscow has meanwhile amassed a war chest of $630 billion in international reserves -- a huge sum compared to most other countries -- that can be spent if sanctions bite.

Its pilots and air defenses have prevented Russian fighter jets from conquering the skies. And a band of savvy Ukrainian cyberwarriors are so far beating Moscow in an information war, inspiring support at home and abroad.

To the surprise of many military analysts, Ukrainian troops are mounting a stiffer-than-expected resistance to Russian forces up and down battle lines across a country the size of Texas, fighting with a resourcefulness and creativity that U.S. analysts said could trip up Russian troops for weeks or months to come.

The Ukrainians are also exploiting a bungled beginning to Russia’s all-out assault. Armed with shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons, they have attacked a mileslong Russian armored convoy bearing down on Kyiv, the capital, helping stall an advance plagued by fuel and food shortages, and stretching a march that was expected to take a handful of days into possibly weeks.

To be sure, Russia’s invasion is only a week old. The strategic southern city of Kherson fell on Wednesday; the Kremlin’s army has intensified its bombardment of Kyiv and other cities; and, despite a flow of fresh arms pouring in from the West, Ukrainian leaders say they desperately need more weapons to destroy Russian tanks and down Russian warplanes.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/us/politics/russia-ukraine-military.html
