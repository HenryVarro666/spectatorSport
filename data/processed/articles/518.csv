Ukrainian forces launched its first serious counter-attack and reached the border of Kherson Oblast again. Russian forces didn’t advance much today.

Polesia Frontline

includes Kyiv and Zhytomyr Oblast

Kyiv Oblast

Russian forces didn’t conduct any offensive operation in the area. The main focus of the enemy forces was to resupply and refuel units on the contact line and secure the rear.

The enemy sporadically shelled Ukrainian positions in the vicinity of Brovary, but didn’t launch any assault.

Zhytomyr Oblast

There’s been no change on the ground in Zhytomyr Oblast.

Northern Frontline

includes Chernhiv and Sumy Oblast

Chernihiv Oblast

Russian Army continued partial blockade of Chernihiv and shell the city.

Sumy Oblast

There’s been no change on the ground in Sumy Oblast. Russian forces continued to hit Sumy with airstrikes and artillery.

Sloboda Frontline

includes Kharkiv and Luhansk Oblast

Kharkiv Oblast

Russian troops resumed offensive operation towards Izium, but didn’t succeed to capture southern part of the town. Ukrainian forces ambushed a Russian convoy near the town and destroyed several vehicles. The enemy continued to bomb Kharkiv.

Luhansk Oblast

Russian forces entered northern part of Rubizhne. They claimed to have taken the city, but the released video shows only a small portion of the northern outskirts. Ukrainian forces successfully repelled today’s attacks on Sievierodonetsk and Popasna.

Pryazovia Frontline

includes Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia Oblast

Donetsk Oblast

Russian troops entered the gray zone in the industrial zone near Avdiivka, but didn’t gain any new ground towards the town. Situation in the south remains the same.

Zaporizhzhia Oblast

There’s been no change on the ground in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

Mariupol

Mariupol is witnessing heavy street fighting, house to house combat. Ukrainian held territory is slowly shrinking, but due to the lack of footage, we are unable to determinate the actual situation in the city. Ukrainian forces are reportedly preparing a de-blocking operation.

Southern Frontline

includes Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblast

Mykolaiv Oblast

Ukrainian forces launched a counter-offensive towards Kherson. The operation was supported by elements of 28th Mechanized Brigade that arrived to Mykolaiv from Odesa. Ukrainian troops pushed alongside road M-14 and liberated Posad-Pokrovske (in Kherson Oblast).

It’s currently unclear what is the status of Russian spearheading element in the area of Pisky and Yavkyne.

Kherson Oblast

Ukrainian forces liberated Posad-Pokrovske, as mentioned above. In the north, Russian forces reached a village of Mala Shestirnya. Ukrainian troops reportedly stopped the advance in there for now.

We know that Ukraine has pushed Russian forces away from Mykolaiv in Southern Ukraine, and halted any hope Russia has of capturing the grand city of Odesa anytime soon. We also have seen confirmed that they’ve pushed out to Posad-Pokrovske, half the distance from Mykolaiv to Kherson, the largest Ukrainian city currently under Russian control. And that’s where things get murky. Because either Ukraine has pushed east and has opened up a 2-prong approach into Kherson, or all they’ve managed to do is create a little breathing room around Mykolaiv. These two maps (here and here) were released around the same time, both claiming to be based on reports from Ukraine’s general staff. The first one shows Ukrainian control of the village of Snihurivka, east of Mykolaiv, as well as that smattering of villages in between.

The second one still gives Russia control of that territory:

Both maps come from thus-far reputable and fair sources (though pro-Ukraine), but much depends on how those individuals shift through conflicting and confusing information to try and suss out the reality on the ground.

Obviously, we hope the first map is correct, but we must guard against confirmation bias, and make sure that we don’t consider something “confirmed” until there’s corroborating evidence. We had video of Ukrainian forces in Posad-Pokrovske, which was geolocated and affirmed by multiple OSINT (open source intelligence) sources, and then confirmed by Ukraine general staff. Here, there’s just … confusion.

Same thing northwest of Kyiv, where Ukraine has been on the move. Russia, unable to attack, is now digging in for dear life. But how effective, exactly, is that Ukrainian assault? At least one report making the rounds on Twitter claiming that Ukraine is moving as far north as Poliske, on the Belarus border.

I dug in, and found the most recent report report from Ukraine’s general staff:

There were no significant changes in the situation in the Volyn region. [Emphasis mine.] In the Polissya direction, separate units of the occupiers are defending the settlements of Poliske, Kropyvnya, Zakharivka, Oliva, Zhovtneve, Ozershchyna, Lypivka, Kopyliv, Motyzhyn, Buzova, Horenychi, Bucha, and Demydiv.

Oh, and reading through that update:

In the South Buh direction, the enemy is operating in the settlements of Pravdine, Petrovske, Novohryhorivka, Novomykolaivka, Chervone, Greyhove, Mykhailo-Larine, Ingulka, Hrystoforivka, Maryanivka, Novooleksandrivka, Partizanske, Snihurivka, Krylinka, Kalynivka, Vylochu, Vyloka It does not conduct active offensive operations, regroups, deploys reserves, and replenishes ammunition.

Could the situation have changed in the last seven hours since that report was posted? Of course! But as of now, there’s no confirmation. So remember, in the fog of war, be skeptical of new information, no matter how much you might want it to be true, until it can be properly confirmed by multiple sources.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/3/19/2086901/-Ukraine-Update-Meet-every-battlefield-s-constant-companion-the-fog-of-war
2,dedf9653-3a30-4e56-8330-902e17d96bbd,['Sara Adm'],2022-03-21 14:10:42+02:00,"Villagers are given standing room only, while the elderly were rushed into a van. “Grandpa, we’re here,” shouts a local’s daughter, Viktor, from the door of the bus, as he sits a little puzzled in the van. The panic is real; at any moment the shelling could resume, a bombardment that residents say has littered the village of Posad-Pokrovske in southern Ukraine with cluster munitions.

As the two-vehicle convoy reached the pockmarked road towards the town of Mykolaiv, shells again tarred the horizon with a plume of black smoke. Sitting in the back of the van, Vitali collapses, using his grimy orange work gloves to wipe the tears from his eyes.

“Civilians! They killed everyone, they are bastards, they are reptiles, parasites,” he said. “They don’t fight troops, they fight people. Do you understand? Kill everyone. Worse than the fascists.”

Next to him sits Viktor, who remembers the last time a war of this ferocity was fought in this part of Europe. “Of course I remember,” he said calmly. “I saw how the Germans attacked us. They didn’t intimidate people.”

Airstrikes, graduated rockets, cluster munitions, the inhabitants remember two weeks of intense bombardments as evidenced by the fabric of Posad-Pokrovske. Barely a building is unscathed, with most of the roofs missing, and a house is demolished to shreds of fabric. The village’s gas main burst, the intense hiss of a leak a stark reminder that the small settlement is no longer fit to live.

The village school has had an entire wall ripped out, the stairs that were once teeming with children now echo with a ghostly creak, as shattered glass is stomped on. Soldiers come out of the doors of some houses. The Ukrainian marines who hold Posad-Pokrovske, the last colony before the Russian positions defending Kherson airport, remain vague about their positions. But their target is clear: the airport outside Kherson, used as a Russian base, which is already badly hit by Ukrainian bombing.

One of these marines is Daniyel Salem, a former Lebanese soldier. Salem is married to a Ukrainian and he joined the army at the start of the war. “Our mission is to kill these m*thef**kers,” he said, joking that he would love to turn his budding TV career into a Netflix series in which he gets to assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin. “This place used to be a place of joy,” he said, pointing to the party hall around him, “where they used to show movies. Life has been drained of it.”

The road between the strategic port city of Mykolaiv and Kherson, under Russian control, testifies to Ukrainian courage and Russia’s slow loss of control over the advances once announced. Ukrainian forces have made significant gains along the 40 kilometer (25 mile) road between the outskirts of the two cities, and the farmlands it divides are scarred by the impacts of shells from this intense fighting. Although vulnerable to another reversal, Ukraine’s gains have exposed the limits of Russian military might on the fringes of its supply chains, as well as the tenacity of forces around Mykolaiv fighting for their homes and the defense of the Third Ukraine’s largest city, Odessa, which lies further west along the Black Sea coast.

Damaged Ukrainian armor lies outside Posad-Pekrovske, and along the road signs of days of fighting pepper the landscape. Russian bombardment also regularly finds its target, with rockets landing near the highway on several occasions witnessed by CNN with their brush ablaze. Ukrainian artillery was also seen in action on Sunday, firing north from Kherson.

Ukrainian progress has refreshed life in the city of Mykolaiv, with shops reopening and usurping the fear of encirclement that haunted last week. Vitaly Kim, the regional leader whose regular Telegram messages have rallied Mykolaiv in unison during wartime and also alerted the city to daily changing threats, appeared more relaxed. On Saturday, Kim posted photos of a pair of socks he had been sent with “Russian ship, fuck you” stitched on them, in reference to the defiant defenders of Snake Island. For his birthday last week, the governor received a convertible car with a captured Russian machine gun welded to its trunk, which his police chief still drives triumphantly around the city.

On Sunday, Kim called on residents to help pick up the bodies of dead Russian soldiers that had been left on the battlefield, asking residents to put them in bags before temperatures rise above freezing. Kim sent CNN a series of photos of the abandoned bodies, adding, “There are hundreds of them, all over the area.”

Yet Ukraine’s slow progress towards Kherson has also come at a high cost. On Friday morning, a massive explosion ripped through two military installations near central Mykolaiv, with the apparent missile strike tearing through half of the barracks and reducing another to rubble. The Ukrainian military did not release a toll from the strike, citing operational security. But two military officials told CNN the death toll likely stood at 30. A medical official also said 40 people were injured.

A trauma unit received many injured, its beds overflowing on Friday afternoon. A blindfolded soldier with a bloody head asks his injured friends by name. Another, Alexander, suffered both broken legs when the building he was sleeping in partially collapsed. “I was on the third floor,” he said. “When it hit, everything fell apart… I found myself on the second floor, in my t-shirt and my underwear,” adds Alexander. He rubs his eyes to hide the tears, then continues: “We know the enemy, we finally have to see and hear. I don’t know. How many deaths does it take for everyone to see?”

The shelling continued over the weekend, with Saturday dusk lit by tracer fire and at least eight shells hitting a target south of the city. Moscow may be losing ground here, but it’s doing everything to crush and smother what it can’t have.",https://goodwordnews.com/russia-may-be-losing-ground-in-the-battle-of-mykolaiv-but-its-still-looking-to-crush-what-it-cant-have/

Following the Pope's condemnation of the war in Ukraine, the Archbishop of Canterbury is expected to call for a ceasefire during his Easter sermon.

He will say: “Let this be a time for Russian ceasefire, withdrawal and a commitment to talks.

As you said, the main problem is due diligence of the countries trying to join EU, but the problem is they fear going all-in on the EU because there is no real carrot / reward system, and they can easily get stagnated in a situation where they are mid ways in their request without getting anything over it.

Removing some of the power EU countries have to stop the process and having a more clear progress line that can be continuously evaluated with rewards increasing as you get closer to EU access (ensuring standards are maintained and not watered down). That way the countries can feel better on betting on the EU and not feel like they are going to maybe waste years with reforms that could potentially harm them for little to no gain due to any EU country blocking them.



There are always ways to speed up the process... you can see that in the eastern expansion in the 2000s. If there is a will for the EU to do it, they can. However, my main idea is just moving the overseer role away from countries and into more neutral agents that can both investigate in more depth the countries and offer rewards for better integration into the EU (aka, starting convergence funds earlier).",https://www.resetera.com/threads/russia-has-begun-a-full-scale-invasion-in-ukraine-read-staff-posts.556366/page-860
