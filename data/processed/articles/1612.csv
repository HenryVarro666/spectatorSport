The main electric supply to the plant — site of the 1986 explosion and meltdown that traumatized the world — was cut off on Wednesday, with Ukrainian authorities blaming Russia's invading forces for the blackout and warning that it could lead to ""nuclear discharge.""

A Ukrainian national emergency services agency said if power to the plant's cooling systems — which keep spent nuclear fuel safely surrounded by water — is not ensured, it could create a ""radioactive cloud"" that would blow over ""other regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Europe.""

The U.N.-backed global nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, downplayed concerns of an imminent radioactive release, saying the spent fuel was old enough and there was enough water around it in the cooling tanks to prevent a disaster, even without power. The IAEA and Ukrainian officials said backup diesel generators at the site would also be able to keep vital systems running for two to three days.

On Thursday, Russia claimed the power supply cable had been restored by a team of engineers who crossed into Ukraine from Belarus, but the IAEA and Ukrainian officials said work to repair the line was still ongoing.

Then came the warning from Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency that ""a man-made catastrophe is planned at the Russian-controlled Chornobyl NPP [Nuclear Power Plant], responsibility for which the occupiers will try to shift to Ukraine.""

CBS News is seeking information on the alleged plot by Russia from U.S. officials and the IAEA. American and European officials have warned for many weeks, even before Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, that the Russian leader could seek to stage ""false flag"" attacks to blame on Ukraine as a pretext for military action.

The Ukrainian government said in its Friday statement that Chernobyl remained completely disconnected from IAEA monitoring systems and was ""de-energized,"" noting, two days after the power cut, that the ""service life of the available diesel generators is designed for 48 hours of maintenance of safety systems.""

Russian forces in control of the plant ""refused to grant access to the station to Ukrainian repair people,"" Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said in the statement on Friday. Among the engineers sent from Belarus, it claimed, were Russian ""saboteurs"" pretending to be nuclear scientists who came ""to organize a terrorist attack.""

Russian forces quickly seized the Chernobyl site after launching their invasion on February 24. Ukrainian officials have said the team of plant operators who ensure safe operations at the decommissioned facility have tried to continue carrying out their work, but under the orders of Russian troops and without being allowed to leave the compound at all.

Russia has since captured another of Ukraine's nuclear power plants — a fully functioning one and the largest in Europe.

All normal modes of communication between Chernobyl and the Ukrainian government have been cut.

A State Department spokesperson told CBS News on Friday that the U.S. condemned Russia's seizure of the Chernobyl plant and called on Russian forces to immediately withdraw from all of Ukraine's nuclear facilities and allow power and safe working conditions to be restored.

""Russia knows the importance of being a responsible nuclear power, and it should act like one,"" the spokesperson said, calling the country's actions ""profoundly irresponsible and dangerous.""

Asked on Thursday about concerns over safety at Chernobyl, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the U.S. ""should be concerned, but we haven't yet seen anything that takes us from concerned to 'it's a complete crisis.'""

Matt Kroenig, who worked on both nuclear and Russia related issues under the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations, told CBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge this week that Putin was weaponing Ukraine's civilian nuclear facilities as part of a strategy to terrorize, and potentially to stage a major nuclear event.

""It may be a nuclear threat without resorting to the use of [nuclear] weapons,"" said Kroenig. ""If there were to be an accident at these plants, it could be quite serious. We've seen serious accidents in the past at Chernobyl and Fukushima, and so I think that may be part of the strategy here, of holding the plants at risk and making people worry about a potential nuclear disaster.""

Short of initiating an actual nuclear disaster, Kroenig said Putin may also be using his forces' control of both Chernobyl and Ukraine's sprawling, still-functioning Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to ""terrorize the Ukrainian people and the world more broadly"" as his military invasion was suffering unexpected delays as it closed in on Ukraine's major cities.

""The worst-case scenario,"" said Kroenig, a former CIA officer who's currently deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, ""is that you could have a nuclear meltdown.""

If the cooling systems at Chernobyl are allowed to fail, ""the nuclear core could literally melt down so that radioactive material could melt, it could get into the Earth's crust, could get into the water supply… so this is potentially a serious ecological disaster.""

Kroenig did not go as far as to suggest that Putin could stage an attack on one of Ukraine's nuclear facilities, but he said Putin's actions could lead to a major nuclear event.

Any deliberate attack on a nuclear power plant would constitute a war crime under the Geneva Conventions, a series of laws signed by all United Nations member states, including Russia, that regulate acts of war.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-chernobyl-russia-putin-orders-terrorist-attack-nuclear-plant-kyiv-says/

The daughter of a overnight staffer being held hostage in Chernobyl has warned the plant is being held by Russian forces who 'have no clue about nuclear security protocols' after Kyiv's intelligence agency claimed Putin's forces are preparing to fake a terror attack at the site to try to blackmail the world.

Natalia Ruemmele has warned that staffers who usually work 12 hour shifts have been maintaining the nuclear plant at gunpoint for more than two weeks since Russian forces seized control of the site as she pleaded with Moscow to agree to a ceasefire and allow a shift change.

Ukrainian intelligence earlier warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops to create a 'man-made catastrophe' at Chernobyl which he plans to blame on Ukrainian 'saboteurs' in order to justify further escalating his war against the ex-Soviet country.

Ukrainian spies say the 'terrorist attack' will be carried out by Russian operatives who moved in yesterday amongst a group of 'specialists' sent by Belarus to take over safety operations at the partially-destroyed nuclear power plant, which was seized by Russian forces in the opening days of the invasion.

Belarus sent the team in after Putin's men disconnected Chernobyl from monitoring systems which report the status of its nuclear safety systems to UN watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and cut power to the plant - meaning water used to keep its fuel rods cooled will no longer automatically top itself up.

Power to the plant was cut more than 40 hours ago leaving the reactors reliant on diesel generators that 'have a 48-hour capacity' before radiation leaks become 'imminent, according to transmission system operator Ukrenergo.

Nuclear safety experts say Chernobyl has diesel generators which should have automatically kicked in after the power was disconnected to keep pumps running, after which water which cools nuclear fuel rods at the plant will start to evaporate - exposing the rods which could then start to burn and create a cloud of radioactive ash. All that should be needed to prevent that is for Russians to top up the water manually, which could be done with a water truck.

Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency on Friday that technicians have started repairing damaged power lines at the decommissioned Chernobyl power plant in an effort to restore power supplies, the UN nuclear agency said.

The Ukrainian nuclear regulator said Friday that workers repaired one section of the lines, but there still appears to be damage in other places. Repair efforts would continue despite 'the difficult situation' outside the plant, which was taken by Russian forces early in the invasion, the IAEA said.

The Ukrainian regulator said additional fuel was delivered for generators, but it remains important to fix the power lines as soon as possible. The IAEA reiterated that the disconnection 'will not have a critical impact on essential safety functions at the site.'

But Kyiv's Main Intelligence Directorate believes Moscow's actions show it is laying the ground for a manufactured nuclear catastrophe. They say Russian forces have been collecting the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers who died fighting at Hostomel airport - the site of clashes close to Kyiv - in refrigerated lorries so they can be taken to Chernobyl and posed up as saboteurs.

Putin's motivation is to 'blackmail the global community' for sanctioning Russia and providing weapons to Ukraine, which have battled the Russian leader's forces to a near-standstill with heavy losses. At the same time, the disaster - which would almost certainly cause radioactive fallout to land on Russia - would also be used to justify the use of further force against Ukraine.

Though Kyiv's account cannot be independently verified, it comes against the backdrop of Russian attacks on other nuclear reactors in the country - at Zaporizhzhia in central Ukraine and Kharkiv in the east - which Ukraine has said are 'nuclear terrorism'.

Zaporizhzhia power plant was attacked last week, sparking a fire near one of the reactors which Russian forces initially prevented fire crews from extinguishing. Kharkiv's Institute of Physics, which houses a reactor, was also shelled this morning - though no damage was caused to the nuclear facility.

Meanwhile the head of a nuclear research facility in the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv said on Friday that the grounds of the institute had been struck by Russian shells during recent fighting, but the core housing nuclear fuel remains intact.

He warned, however, that any future damage to equipment in the core could pose a danger.

'The facility, in working condition, doesn't present any danger whatsoever,' said Mykola Shulga, director general of the National Science Centre Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology.

'However, if there is physical damage, a nuclear fuel leak is possible, radioactive elements (could escape) outside,' he said, speaking inside the facility. 'This obviously would be a huge, huge problem for the environment. In other words, what would happen would be comparable to a similar situation at any nuclear power station.'

While the inner areas of the institute were unscathed, some of the outer walls of the building were damaged by shrapnel and windows were blown in.

It comes against the backdrop of western governments saying Russia appears to be laying the groundwork to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine - an attack that would also be blamed on Kyiv with the aim of justifying a further increase in violence.

Ukraine has also today accused fighter jets of staging a 'false flag' attack on Belarus as a pre-text to getting Alexander Lukashenko's troops involved in the fighting.

Kyiv said two Su-25 bombers crossed the border from Belarus this afternoon, carried out attacks on Ukrainian soil, and then bombed Belarus itself. Defence minister Olexiy Reznikov said the attack was planned by Russia.

'The purpose of this provocation is to force the current leadership of Belarus into war against Ukraine. Moscow is trying to bind you with blood,' he said.

Lukashenko has so-far refused to get his men involved in the war, after commanders reportedly quit rather than join the fighting. The 'false flag' operation came immediately after the dictator met Putin in Moscow to discuss trade links, and agreed Russian would supply Belarus with modern military equipment.

Ukraine's defence ministry later said it expects Belarusian forces to cross the border and join in the fighting at 9pm (7pm GMT) tonight - though is not yet any sign that Minsk has joined the invasion.

But Russian forces continued pounding the city of Mariupol on Friday night and elsewhere Moscow's men stopped some buses of people trying to flee the Kyiv region, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

In a video address, Vereshchuk said some planned evacuations were successful, including 1,000 people who were evacuated from the village of Vorzel in the Kyiv region. Ukraine says 1,582 civilians have died there in 12 days after the invasion.

Jen Psaki, spokesman for the White House, said Russia is engaged in an 'obvious ploy' to justify its own use of chemical weapons in Ukraine by pumping out disinformation that America is secretly developing the weapons in Ukraine in laboratories close to the Russian border.

'Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,' she said earlier this week.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a similar statement yesterday, saying: 'The stuff that you're hearing about chemical weapons is straight out of their playbook.

'They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans. And so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a... fake story ready to go.

'You've seen it in Syria. You saw it even in the UK. That's what they're doing. It is a cynical, barbaric government.'

Joe Biden warned Friday that Putin will pay a 'severe price' if he uses chemical weapons in Ukraine - but again repeated that American troops would not be sent into the country to prevent the outbreak of World War Three.

'The United States and our allies and partners continue to work in lockstep to ramp up the economic pressures on Putin and to further isolate Russia and the global stage,' Biden said in his announcement from the White House.

Biden also said he will revoke Russia's 'most favored nation' trade status over its invasion of Ukraine, another step in the series of harsh economic sanctions he and U.S. allies have imposed on Moscow.

He noted that revoking the favored trade status 'is going to make it harder for Russia to do business with the United States, and doing it in unison with other nations that make up half of the global economy will be another crushing blow to the Russian economy that's already suffering very badly from our sanctions,' he said.

He also reiterated that American troops will not fight in the Ukraine.

'We will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine,' adding that a 'direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War III– something we must strive to prevent.'

Meanwhile civilian volunteers trained in Odessa on Friday, learning to use rifles and other defence techniques as the city's mayor warned that Russian forces could soon surround the southern Ukrainian port city on three fronts.

In a different part of the city, a group of women crafted camouflage nets by cutting up old pieces of cloth.

It came a day after Russia's deputy energy minister, Yevgeny Grabchak, said power had been restored to the decommissioned plant, after Ukraine said earlier this week that Putin's forces had cut the electricity.

However, the intelligence update disputed this, and repeated an earlier warning that if the electricity is cut, the plant's emergency diesel generators that provide back-up power to safety systems can only last 48-hours.

Earlier this week, Ukraine pleaded with Russia to observe a ceasefire so engineers could go into Chernobyl and restore the power. This was refused, Ukraine said.

'The occupiers refused to grant access to the station to Ukrainian repairmen,' the update continued.

'Instead, 'Belarusian specialists' went there on the instructions of Alexander Lukashenko. Among them, under the guise of nuclear power plants, Russian saboteurs also come to organize a terrorist attack.'

On Wednesday, IAEA also said it had lost contact with the captured Zaporizhzhia power plant, just hours after warning of a potential unfolding disaster at Chernobyl.

The agency said warning systems at Zaporizhzhia - Europe's largest nuclear power plant - had stopped broadcasting updates in the days since Russian forces shelled the site, resulting in international condemnation.

IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said Wednesday he was 'concerned about the sudden interruption' of the data flows to the watchdog's Vienna headquarters.

He added that the reason for the disruption in updates from the power plants was not clear but the IAEA was still receiving data from other nuclear facilities in Ukraine, including three other operational nuclear power plants.

Also on Wednesday, Ukraine warned Chernobyl could be 48 hours away from leaking radiation, and the country's nuclear company Energoatom warned that radioactive substances could be released if an electricity outage at the site continues any longer, as it makes it impossible to cool spent nuclear fuel.

Energoatom has said that work to repair the connection and restore power to the plant - the site of the world's biggest nuclear disaster in 1986 - has not been possible because fighting is under way in the region.

The company said there were about 20,000 spent fuel assemblies at Chernobyl that could not be kept cool amid a power outage.

Their warming could lead to 'the release of radioactive substances into the environment. The radioactive cloud could be carried by wind to other regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and Europe,' it said in a statement.

Without power, ventilation systems at the plant would also not be working, exposing staff to dangerous doses of radiation, it added.

Russia took control of the defunct atomic plant on the first day of the invasion and has since captured a second nuclear site - Zaporizhzhia - the biggest in Europe.

Energy operator Ukrenergo also said their power has been entirely cut to the plant and its security systems.

The plant 'was fully disconnected from the power grid,' Ukrenergo said in a statement on its Facebook page, adding that military operations meant 'there is no possibility to restore the lines'.

The recent developments have now added increasing concern about safety and security around the region.

Last week staff at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were captured on video pleading with Russian soldiers directing fire on the building before they overtook it.

The nuclear power plant, which creates around 20 percent of Ukraine's electricity, was captured after a fierce gun battle between Russian President Vladimir Putin's men and Ukrainian defenders that sparked a fire in a six-story training building.

Eventually, emergency crews were allowed to go in and douse the flames at the Zaporizhzhia plant before Russian troops moved in and occupied the site.

The United Nation's nuclear monitoring agency said that, fortunately, none of the site's six reactors had been directly damaged and radiation levels remained normal.

The IAEA said later on Wednesday it saw 'no critical impact on safety' from the power cut at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine.

The Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog said Wednesday that Ukraine had informed it of the loss of electricity and that the development violates a 'key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply.'

But it tweeted that 'in this case IAEA sees no critical impact on safety.'

The IAEA said that there could be 'effective heat removal without need for electrical supply' from spent nuclear fuel at the site.

Speaking to MailOnline Claire Corkhill - Professor of Nuclear Material Degradation at Sheffield University - said that while power being cut at Chernobyl was concerning, the spent nuclear fuel would not lead to a nuclear 'meltdown'.

'With the electricity supply to the Chernobyl site unavailable, there are several areas of concern with regards to the safety of the nuclear material stored there,' she said.

The first issue, she explained, is that spent fuel from reactors one and three is kept cool in metal casings in a pond (that looks like a large swimming pool).

'This material produces heat through radioactive decay and requires constant cooling, which is achieved by pumping fresh cool water into the ponds,' she said.

'With no power supply, this water could slowly evaporate, potentially resulting in contamination of the building by low levels of radioactive isotopes.'

The second issue, she said, concerns the monitoring of radioactivity levels in reactor four - the reactor that exploded in 1996.

'It is essential that radiation monitoring systems are able to constantly monitor the situation inside reactor 4 so that we can be aware of any potential reasons for concern about the exposed nuclear fuel that resides there,' Prof. Corkhill said.

'Another serious concern is the maintenance of the ventilation system in the New Safe Confinement structure,' she continued. The Chernobyl New Safe Confinement is the huge cover - or sarcophagus - that was placed over reactor four in 2016.

'This prevents further degradation of Reactor number 4 and the hazardous exposed nuclear fuel within, and is essential to the future decommissioning of the site.

'If there is no power to this structure, we could see the complete failure of the 1.5Bn euro decommissioning programme to make the site safe once and for all.'

While Prof. Corkhill said there the loss of power would unlikely lead to a wide scale released of radioactivity, she said it was more likely there would be 'severe contamination within one of the spent fuel storage facilities.'

Prof Corkhill's research focuses on understanding the long-term evolution of radioactive waste material in disposal environments and she provides independent advice to the UK government's radioactive waste management and disposal policies.

She is leading a British team that is making a key contribution to the huge clear-up operation at the stricken Fukushima nuclear power station in Japan after developing material that simulates the most dangerous radioactive debris remaining in the reactors.

On February 24, Russia invaded Ukraine and seized the defunct plant, site of a 1986 disaster that killed hundreds and spread radioactive contamination west across Europe.

The Chernobyl site has been under the control of Russian troops since last week.

The cause of the damage to the power line serving it was not immediately clear.

On Tuesday the UN atomic watchdog IAEA said that the site was no longer transmitting data and voiced concern for staff working under Russian guard.

The situation for the staff 'was worsening', the IAEA said, citing the Ukrainian nuclear regulator.

The defunct plant sits inside an exclusion zone that houses decommissioned reactors as well as radioactive waste facilities.

In 2016, the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement was put in place to cover the reactor. It was designed to prevent further release of radioactive contaminants for 100 years.

More than 2,000 staff still work at the plant as it requires constant management to prevent another nuclear disaster.

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi on Tuesday called on 'on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there.'

He also repeated his offer to travel to Chernobyl or elsewhere to secure 'the commitment to the safety and security' of Ukraine's power plants from all parties.

'The Director General indicated that remote data transmission from safeguards monitoring systems installed at the Chernobyl NPP had been lost,' the IAEA said in a statement yesterday.

Safeguards keep track of nuclear material and waste products generated by nuclear power plants.

The IAEA urged Russian authorities to allow the 210 staff members who are being held captive at Chernobyl to leave, arguing that although radiation levels in the area are relatively low, it is necessary to ensure a 'safe rotation' of staff.

It comes after the Vienna-based UN body said Ukrainian authorities reported an attack on a nuclear facility in Kharkiv on Sunday - though no increase in radiation levels had been reported at the site.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10602703/Putin-planning-man-catastrophe-Chernobyl-Ukrainian-intelligence-claims.html
2,f1713f86-43d8-414d-a95d-d6d1462a5eb3,"['Tim Lister', 'Mohammed Tawfeeq', 'Olga Voitovych', 'Simone Mccarthy', 'Tara John']",2022-03-13 00:00:00,"Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) Russia expanded its offensive to western Ukraine on Sunday, firing missiles near the city of Lviv and hitting a large military base close to the Polish border, reportedly killing dozens of people and drawing the war closer to the borders of a NATO country.

The attack came the day after the Kremlin threatened to attack Western weapons shipments to Ukraine.

As the invasion runs into its third week, the northwest city of Lviv has largely been spared from Russia's relentless bombardment. The picturesque city has instead become ground zero for displaced Ukrainians. Hundreds of thousands of them have flooded into the city in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the Polish border about 43 miles (70 kilometers) away.

But Russia's war is moving closer to the cultural hub. Russian forces fired more than 30 missiles at Yavoriv military training ground on Sunday, according to Lviv's military administration. Located between Lviv and the Polish border, the military base has held joint drills with NATO and Western military personnel, including the United States.

A witness, who was on the base when the strike happened, told CNN of hearing a ""sudden clap"" from a bomb shelter, adding that the explosion craters were 10 meters deep and there are fears people are under the rubble.

Local authorities say 35 people were killed and 134 injured at the military base, in what Ukraine's Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov described as a ""terrorist attack"" on peace and security ""near the EU-NATO border.""

There were no reports of foreign nationals among the casualties so far, say Ukraine defense officials. The strike came the day after Russia launched a missile attack in the northeastern city of Lutsk, only 70 miles from the Polish border.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that it was only a matter of time before Russia's military assault on Ukraine expanded to members of NATO -- unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone in Ukraine.

""Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war,"" Zelensky said in a video address Sunday posted to his Facebook page. ""Now, I repeat again, if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries.""

US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that the strikes on Lviv were a sign that the war was not going to plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,"" Sullivan said.

Ambulances are seen traveling to and from the Yavoriv military base on March 13, 2022.

A senior US official told CNN Sunday that Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones. Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development in Russia's invasion, and could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country.

When asked by CNN about reports of Russia's request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement, ""I've never heard of that.""

As attacks on civilian areas continued throughout the weekend, a new round of Russian-Ukrainian talks has been set for Monday.

Zelensky alluded to the talks in his remarks Sunday, saying his country's delegation ""has a clear task -- to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for.""

US President Joe Biden spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday evening, according to a White House official. Macron had spoken to Putin on Saturday in a joint call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

American journalist killed in Ukraine

Heavy fighting continued Sunday, with Britain's Ministry of Defense saying Russia was attempting to ""envelop"" Ukrainian forces in the east of the country as it advanced from Crimea westwards towards Odessa.

Russian troops continue to focus on the capital Kyiv. Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin leader of Russia's Chechnya region, reportedly told Russian soldiers outside of Kyiv that the key task is to seize the capital, Russian state news network Russia 24 reported on Sunday.

Amid a growing civilian toll in Ukraine, American journalist Brent Renaud, 50, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to social media posts by Kyiv region police. Two other journalists were wounded by Russian troops, the police added.

Renaud ""paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty, and ruthlessness of the aggressor,"" an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement on Telegram.

The US State Department confirmed Renaud's death on Sunday. ""We are horrified that journalists and filmmakers—noncombatants—have been killed and injured in Ukraine by Kremlin forces,"" department spokesman Ned Price said on Twitter. ""This is yet another gruesome example of the Kremlin's indiscriminate actions.""

Social media footage has emerged of a journalist identified as Juan Arredondo, a filmmaker and visual journalist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School, at Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv, in which he describes being shot at by Russian forces while driving through a checkpoint in Irpin on the way to film refugees leaving the city.

The exact circumstances of the attack against the two journalists are yet to be determined.

TIME released a statement Sunday saying Renaud was in the region working on a TIME Studios project on the global refugee crisis.

""We are devastated by the loss of Brent Renaud. As an award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Brent tackled the toughest stories around the world often alongside his brother Craig Renaud,"" TIME Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal and President and COO Ian Orefice in the statement.

Ukrainians take to the streets to protest

Ukrainians continue to protest Russian occupation. The southern city of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces, saw the biggest protest since the invasion on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the streets to protest against suspected Russian plans to turn the southern Ukrainian oblast into a breakaway republic.

Residents of Kherson turned out en masse on Sunday, March 13, in the largest protest the city has seen since the invasion began and it came under Russian occupation.

Waving Ukrainian flags, the protesters chanted anti-Russian slogans, filled with expletives about Putin, according to videographer Artem Ivanov, who is on the ground in Kherson.

Ihor Kolykhaiev, the mayor of Kherson, said in a video posted on Facebook Sunday that mass protests show ""Kherson is Ukraine"" and insisted that he retains administrative control of the city.

But the mayor also said that the city had been cut off from humanitarian aid and was running out of resources. He said that the city ""can't receive a humanitarian cargo here, food is finishing in the stores, we are running out of gas, we only have diesel oil left at the gas stations. We are running out of the medications and insulin.""

""Our main weapon is unity,"" he added.

In recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for the ""Kherson People's Republic."" If true, the move would mirror Moscow's establishment of two Russian-backed breakaway states in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.

Putin recognized the independence of those two territories in the days leading up to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine as part of his pretext to launch an assault on the country.

School demolished by Russian strike

Russia's air offensive on Sunday also bore down on heavily populated areas around the country. Nine people were killed in a Russian bombardment in Mykolaiv Sunday, local officials said. The strategic southern city has resisted Russian occupation and impeded an apparent push towards the major port of Odessa to the west.

A school in the village of Zelenogai, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Mykolaiv, was demolished by a Russian military strike, Mykolaiv regional administrator Vitali Kim said.

Kim said that the military strike left several people either dead or in critical condition. ""Some people got under the rubble and we are evacuating them,"" Kim said.

Missiles also destroyed an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, while the northern city of Chernihiv was struck for the third night in a row, hitting a high-rise building, the regional head, Vyacheslav Chaus, said.

In the eastern region of Luhansk, much of which is now occupied by Russian forces, the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been ""massive shelling"" of several towns, including Kreminna and Rubizhne, which had prevented buses from leaving with civilians.

The Ukrainian military thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, a new satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows.

The bridge first appeared in satellite imagery from Maxar on March 10, appearing to have been destroyed. An additional photo, published on social media on March 13, also shows the pontoon bridge destroyed, in addition to nearby Russian military vehicles.

Ukrainian forces in Kyiv's suburb of Irpin have so far repelled the Russian forces' attempted advance towards the Ukrainian capital city. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed by the Ukrainians, the river poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military.

Also on Sunday, Ukraine's National Energy Company Ukrenergo completed repair work and resumed power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the company announced. The plant's electrical system was damaged during a Russian attack on March 9. Later on Sunday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that the staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment.

As the devastation mounts, Zelensky said the key task Sunday is to get the humanitarian convoy that is traveling towards the besieged city of Mariupol to its destination. Mariupol has been under siege for more than a week. Much of the city is without power and water.

Mariupol's city administration confirmed Sunday night that the convoy was still stuck some 50 miles to the west.

As the city waits, officials said it had suffered 22 bombing attacks in the last 24 hours and ""to date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia.""

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that nine of the 14 evacuation routes declared Sunday had allowed civilians to escape fighting. About 3,950 people were rescued in the Kyiv region and 1,600 were able to escape from the Luhansk region in the east of the country, according to Vereshchuk.

""The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,"" Vereshchuk said. ""The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city.""

New round of talks

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said Sunday that the next round of Russian-Ukrainian talks will take place on Monday, via video link.

""Again. Negotiations go non-stop in the format of video conferences,"" Podoliak said on Twitter. ""Working groups are constantly functioning. A large number of issues require constant attention.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency RIA earlier on Sunday that the talks would continue on Monday.

Podoliak said earlier Sunday that he believed that talks in the next few days will ""achieve concrete results.""

""Our proposals are on the table. They are very tough. Among them, the withdrawal of troops, the ceasefire,"" Podoliak said in a video posted on Twitter.

This comes after Leonid Slutsky, a Russian delegation member for talks with Ukraine, said ""significant progress"" has been made in negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation since the beginning of talks, Russian state news agency RIA reports.

Talks between Ukraine's and Russia's top diplomats last week in Turkey, however, yielded no discernible progress.

In Russia, authorities continue to violently repress all dissent. Riot police arrested more than 658 people in 35 Russian cities on Sunday, as the number of those detained grows, according to an independent human rights group, OVD-Info.

Images of brutal arrests have flooded social media showing people dragged off the streets by Russia's riot police. OVD-info also reported cases of house searches of human rights activists, police officers stopping people on the street to check through bags, as well as phone records.

According to the monitoring group, more than 5,000 people have been arrested across Russia for participating in anti-war protests since last weekend and over 14,633 protesters have been detained in dozens of cities since the start of the invasion on February 24.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-13-intl-hnk/index.html
3,f1713f86-43d8-414d-a95d-d6d1462a5eb3,['Stephanie Weaver'],,"According to the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin is ""preparing a terrorist attack on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,"" the government agency claimed Friday.

According to a social media post on Twitter, the department said that a ""man-made catastrophe"" is planned at the plant and will be manipulated to appear as if Ukraine was responsible for it.

""Putin is preparing a terrorist attack on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. A man-made catastrophe is planed [sic] at the CNPP controlled by Russian forces, for which the occupiers will try to shift responsibility to Ukraine,"" the department wrote.

These claims come just days after Ukraine closed the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that was disconnected from the nation’s power grid by Russian forces, potentially jeopardizing the cooling of nuclear material at the site. The plant is currently cut off from the electricity and is disconnected from the International Atomic Energy Agency's monitoring systems.

The department said Russian forces refused to give access to the station’s Ukrainian repairman, and instead, nuclear energy specialists from Belarus came, but under their guise, Russian saboteurs came in to organize a terrorist attack.

The agency also noted the Russian occupiers are preparing ""to create evidence"" of the involvement of Ukrainian defenders in the terrorist attack, claiming in the area of Antonov airport in Gostomel, Russian car refrigerators were noticed with Russians collecting bodies of fallen Ukrainian defenders to take them to the nuclear power plant and show them as killed ""diversants of Ukraine.""

""Without getting the desired result from the ground military operation and direct negotiations, Putin is ready to commit to the nuclear blackmail of the world community for the sake of actions to support Ukraine,"" the government agency wrote. ""Narazí and Ukraine, and the world, and Russia itself understand that the statements about Ukraine's involvement in the creation of nuclear danger are only a production based on a non-dangerous scenario.""

The department continued, ""Despite this, Putin's similar actions will have catastrophic consequences for the whole world. Looks like this is exactly what the Russian dictator is counting on, demanding unacceptable actions.""

The Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba announced Wednesday that the only electrical grid supplying the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and all its nuclear facilities is damaged. He called on the international community to ""urgently demand Russia to cease fire and allow repair units to restore power supply.""

""Reserve diesel generators have a 48-hour capacity to power the Chornobyl NPP. After that, cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent. Putin’s barbaric war puts entire Europe in danger. He must stop it immediately,"" he continued.

More than 200 workers have been working at gunpoint since Russian soldiers seized the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on Feb. 24, FOX News reported. Overnight shift employees who were supposed to work only for 12 hours have been running operations at the plant for two weeks.

Among the nuclear engineers, there is Natalia Ruemmele's 63-year-old father.

RELATED: Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant loses power, sparking fear of radiation leaks

""Basically, the power plant is held by people who have no clue about the nuclear security protocols,"" Ruemmele told Fox News via Zoom from Munich, Germany.

For more than 40 hours now, the power has been cut off at the NPP, leaving facilities on reserve diesel generators that ""have a 48-hour capacity,"" according to transmission system operator Ukrenergo.

Despite the power loss at Chernobyl, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported it ""sees no critical impact on safety.""

Chernobyl is the site of one of the world’s worst nuclear disasters, where a nuclear power reactor exploded and burned in 1986.

""The Chernobyl disaster caused irreversible damage to the environment that will last for thousands of years,"" Greenpeace announced in its 2016 study of the accident. ""Never in human history has such a large quantity of long-lived radioisotopes been released into the environment by a single event.""

Chernobyl plant still without external power supply, Ukrainian inspectorate says

Ukraine’s State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate says the electricity supply to the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant has not yet been restored, despite Russia’s energy ministry claiming on Thursday that Belarusian specialists had fixed the issue.

Ukraine warned on Wednesday that there was an increased risk of a radiation leak at the plant, which suffered the world’s worst nuclear accident in 1986, after a high-voltage cable was severed during fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces and its external electricity supply was cut off.

When the external electricity supply is severed, an emergency diesel generator kicks in.

The inspectorate said attempts to restore the external power supply at the site, which sits near Ukraine’s border with Belarus and is currently occupied by Russian forces, were “in progress”.

Erdogan says inadequate Western response to Crimea crisis opened door to war

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has criticised Western powers for failing to adequately respond to Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, suggesting a stronger reaction to the move at the time could have prevented Moscow’s current offensive.

Erdogan added that Ankara, which has attempted to position itself as a mediator between Moscow and Kyiv, hoped “moderation and common sense will prevail and the weapons will fall silent as soon as possible”.

UN says 564 civilians killed in Ukraine

The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR) has confirmed the deaths of 564 civilians in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, including 41 children.

OHCHR added the real toll is thought to be considerably higher since it has not yet been able to corroborate reports from areas where intense fighting is ongoing.

“Civilians are being killed and maimed in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks, with Russian forces using explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas,” it said.

“These include missiles, heavy artillery shells and rockets, as well as air strikes.”

Mayor estimates two million remain in Kyiv

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has said he believes there are nearly two million people still left in the Ukrainian capital.

Klitschko told the Reuters news agency that the city, normally home to some 3.5 million people, had enough vital supplies to last a couple of weeks and that supply lines remained open for now.

His brother Wladimir, who was also speaking to Reuters as part of a joint interview, added that some people who had fled Kyiv after Moscow launched its offensive were now returning to take part in the city’s defence as concerns mount over a possible large-scale assault by Russian forces.

Russia could surround Odesa on three sides, mayor warns

The mayor of Odesa has warned Russian forces could soon surround the Ukrainian port city, located in the country’s southwest, on three fronts.

Gennadiy Trukhanov suggested Moscow’s forces would seek to advance from territories they have occupied in Ukraine’s Mykolaiv region towards Moldova’s separatist-controlled Transdniestria region, where Russian troops are based.

Such a move could cut Odesa, which sits on the Black Sea, off from the rest of Ukraine.

“Also, we think that while this is happening, Russian landing ships could surround us from the sea,” Trukhanov added.

Who are the volunteer fighters referred to by Russia?

Putin has said Russia should allow volunteer fighters from Syria and other countries to join Moscow-backed separatists fighting Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine.

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said there had been been “more than 16,000 applications” from potential recruits, mostly from the Middle East.

Many of them were individuals who had fought alongside Russian forces in the battle against the ISIL (ISIS) group, he claimed.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed that the potential recruits include fighters from Syria.

Damascus is a staunch ally of Moscow, which intervened in the Syrian civil war in 2015 to support President Bashar al-Assad, turning the tide of the conflict in his favour.

Where are the Russian forces near Kyiv now?

A huge Russian military convoy that had been stationed outside Kyiv since last week appears to have dispersed, according to a United States-based satellite-imaging company, as the city braces for a possible ground assault.

Maxar Technologies said satellite images taken on Thursday showed that the 64km (40 miles) long line of vehicles, tanks and artillery has broken up and been redeployed.

The assessment came as a senior US defence official said on Thursday that Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from the northwest had edged 5km (3 miles) closer to the city in the previous 24 hours, placing them just 15km (9 miles) from its centre.

Meanwhile, a separate tranche of soldiers advancing on the capital from the northeast was about 40km (25 miles) from the city, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added at a Pentagon news briefing.

The official said the “multiple lines of advance towards Kyiv” indicate Moscow aims to encircle the city.

Ukraine has told the UN’s nuclear watchdog that it has lost all contact with the radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl next to the defunct power plant, which is now held by Russian forces.

“Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] that it had lost today all communications with the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant [NPP], the day after the Russian-controlled site lost all external power supplies,” the IAEA said in a statement, adding that before, there was contact by email.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Russia has launched a full-scale war in Ukraine , unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending troops and tanks from multiple directions in a move that could rewrite the world's geopolitical landscape. Ukraine's government pleaded for help as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee.Ukrainian authorities have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in the port city of Mariupol, which has been encircled by Russian forces and cut off from deliveries of food and medicine.Mariupol officials said Friday that 1,582 people had been killed in the 12 days since the siege began.""There is a humanitarian catastrophe in the city and the dead aren't even being buried,"" Mariupol's mayor's office said in a statement Friday, calling for Russian forces to lift the siege.Ukrainian authorities have accused Russian forces of shelling evacuation routes and preventing civilians from escaping the city of 430,000 people.Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency on Friday that technicians have started repairing damaged power lines at the decommissioned Chernobyl power plant in an effort to restore power supplies, the U.N. nuclear agency said.On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said that Chernobyl, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, was knocked off the power grid, with emergency generators supplying backup power.The Ukrainian nuclear regulator said Friday that workers repaired one section of the lines, but there still appears to be damage in other places, the IAEA said. Repair efforts would continue despite ""the difficult situation"" outside the plant, which was taken by Russian forces early in the invasion, it said.The Ukrainian regulator said additional fuel was delivered for generators, but it remains important to fix the power lines as soon as possible. The IAEA reiterated that the disconnection ""will not have a critical impact on essential safety functions at the site.""The Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog said that it still isn't receiving data from monitoring systems installed to monitor nuclear material and activities at Chernobyl, but transmission from the Zaporizhzhia plant - Ukraine's biggest, which Russian forces seized last week - has been restored after being lost earlier this week.Russian regulators said Friday that the country's internet users will be blocked from accessing Instagram, saying it's being used to call for violence against Russian soldiers.In Moscow's latest move to restrict access to foreign social media platforms, communications and media regulator Roskomnadzor said in a statement that it's restricting national access to Instagram. It said the platform is spreading ""calls to commit violent acts against Russian citizens, including military personnel.""Roskomnadzor cited a Thursday tweet by Meta spokesman Andy Stone conveying a company statement saying it had ""made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules on violent speech, such as 'death to the Russian invaders'.""The U.S. Department of Commerce announced Friday that it will restrict the export of U.S. luxury goods to Russia and Belarus, as well as ""certain Russian and Belarusian oligarchs and malign actors located worldwide,"" as a result of their actions in Ukraine.At least 549 civilians, including 41 children, have been killed in Ukraine since Russian forces invaded on Feb. 24, according to the latest figures from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Meanwhile, at least 957 civilians, including 52 children, have been injured, OHCHR figures show.A Russian attack severely damaged a maternity hospital in the besieged port city of Mariupol, Ukraine said.

He said that consultations will continue on ways to negotiate an end to hostilities.Efforts to set up safe passage for civilians over the weekend fell apart amid continued shelling. But the Russian Defense Ministry announced a new push Monday, saying civilians would be allowed to leave the capital of Kyiv, Mariupol and the cities of Kharkiv and Sumy.Russia's top negotiator Vladimir Medinsky, said he expects that humanitarian corridors in Ukraine will finally start functioning Tuesday. He said no progress has been made on a political settlement, but voiced hope that the next round could be more productive.""Our expectations from the talks have failed, but we hope that we would be able to make a more significant step forward next time,"" Medinsky said. ""The talks will continue.""French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian criticized Russia's offer of humanitarian corridors for Ukrainian civilians as a ""trap"" that could possibly lead to more bombing in Ukraine.Le Drian referred to Russia's tactic of bombing and then offering humanitarian corridors in the past, citing Aleppo in Syria and Grozny, in Chechnya. He said in such cases Russia's proposal of establishing humanitarian corridors actually led to more bombings after negotiations failed.""We must not fall into traps,"" Le Drian said Monday in France's southern city of Montpellier after a meeting of European ministers.""I'm even wondering if in Russian military schools there are classes to explain: 'bombing, corridor, negotiations, breach (of negotiations), we start it all again'. It's quite tragic but unfortunately it sends shivers down your spine,"" he said.Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba on Monday called for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying Russian planes were targeting civilians.""The Russian Air Force dominates in the skies and continues bombing our cities and killing many civilians,"" Kuleba told George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America.""U.S. and NATO officials have rejected calls from Ukrainian officials to impose a no-fly zone, saying doing so could provoke Russia, perhaps pulling other European countries and NATO members into the conflict. The U.S. and NATO have offered other military aid, including a possible deal to send aircraft to Ukraine.The next round of talks between Ukraine and Russia will be held on Monday, Ukrainian official Davyd Arakhamia said Saturday.Arakhamia is head of the parliamentary faction of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Servant of the People party and a member of Ukraine's delegation at the talks.Monday's will be the third round of talks as the two sides try to negotiate a cease-fire and safe passage corridors for civilians.Russian forces have now seized two Ukrainian nuclear power plants and are advancing toward a third, Ukraine's president said during a call with U.S. senators Saturday.Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the third plant currently under threat is the Yuzhnoukrainsk nuclear power plant, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Mykolaiv, one of several cities the Russians were trying to keep encircled Saturday.One of the plants under the Russians' control is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in the southeastern city of Enerhodar, the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe. The other is Chernobyl, which is not active but is still staffed and maintained. Previous Russian shelling sparked a fire at the Zaporizhzhia plant that was extinguished without a release of radiation.Technical safety systems are intact and radiation levels are still normal at the Zaporizhzhia plant, according to the country's nuclear regulator, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Saturday.Two out of the six reactors at the plant, Europe's biggest, are now operating after Russian forces took control of the site, the nuclear regulator told the IAEA.Ukraine has four nuclear plants with a total of 15 reactors.Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order directing state agencies and departments to ensure their contractors are complying with economic sanctions imposed in response to Russia's attacks on Ukraine.

The United States has also more than doubled its military presence in Poland, which is a member of NATO, to 9,000 troops in recent weeks.Russia's state communications watchdog has ordered to completely block access to Facebook in Russia amid the tensions over the war in Ukraine.The agency, Roskomnadzor, said Friday it decided to cut access to Facebook over its alleged ""discrimination"" of the Russian media and state information resources. It said the restrictions introduced by Facebook owner Meta on the RT and other state-controlled media violate the Russian law.A week ago, the watchdog announced ""partial restrictions"" on access to Facebook that sharply slowed it down, citing the platform's moves to limit the accounts of several state-controlled Russian media. Facebook and Twitter have played a major role in amplifying dissent in Russia in recent years.The move against Facebook follows the blocks imposed Friday on the BBC, the U.S. government-funded Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle and Latvia-based website Meduza as the government seeks to uproot independent sources of information about the invasion of Ukraine.Facebook's parent company Meta tweeted in response: ""We have been closely following the invasion in Ukraine and taking steps to help protect and support our community."" They also listed a few actions the company has already taken to combat this blcok.Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven major world powers say that those responsible for Russian military attacks on civilians in Ukraine must be held accountable for their crimes, amid reports of the use of cluster bombs and other banned munitions.In a statement after talks in Brussels on Friday, the G7 ministers said they are ""deeply concerned with the catastrophic humanitarian toll taken by Russia's continuing strikes against the civilian population of Ukraine's cities.""They underlined that ""indiscriminate attacks are prohibited by international humanitarian law,"" and that they ""will hold accountable those responsible for war crimes, including indiscriminate use of weapons against civilians.""The ministers also welcomed the investigations and evidence-gathering being done to establish what war crimes might have been committed in Ukraine.The International Criminal Court prosecutor has launched an investigation that could target senior officials believed responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide amid a rising civilian death toll and widespread destruction of property.The BBC says it is temporarily suspending the work of all its journalists in Russia after the country's lawmakers approved legislation criminalizing reporting of the war in Ukraine that differs from the government line.Tim Davie, director-general of the British broadcaster, said the legislation ""appears to criminalize the process of independent journalism."" He said the corporation was halting newsgathering work by its journalists and support staff in Russia ""while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development.""""The safety of our staff is paramount and we are not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs,"" he said.Davie said the BBC's Russian-language news service would continue to operate from outside Russia.The Russian parliament voted unanimously Friday to approve a draft law criminalizing the intentional spreading of what Russia deems to be ""fake"" reports. It could be signed by President Vladimir Putin and take effect as soon as Saturday.A Western official says a huge Russian military convoy advancing on Kyiv has made little progress for several days.The official said the convoy, which has been estimated at up to 40 miles (64 kilometers) long, had become a huge traffic jam that included damaged or destroyed vehicles.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence, said the convoy had been attacked from the air by the Ukrainians, but that Ukraine's ability to do so was limited.The official assessed that Ukrainian forces remain in control of much of the country's territory but that Russia holds the cities of Kherson, Melitopol and Berdiansk in the south.Multiple Western officials have said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has advanced more slowly than planned, with Russian forces meeting stiff Ukrainian resistance and encountering myriad logistical problems.Russian President Vladmir Putin said Thursday that what he calls a ""special military operation"" was on course to meet its goals.President Vladimir Putin says Russia is ready for talks with Ukraine but insisted that it must meet Moscow's demands.Putin told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that Ukraine must agree to demilitarize, accept Moscow's sovereignty over Crimea and surrender territory to Russia-backed rebels in the east, the Kremlin said in its readout of Friday's call.Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 following the ouster of the country's former Moscow-friendly leaders and cast its support behind the rebels in eastern Ukraine.Putin recognized the separatist ""people's republics"" as independent states just before he launched an invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, citing their plea for military assistance.Russian and Ukrainian negotiators on Thursday held the second of two rounds of talks, reaching a tentative agreement on setting up safe corridors to allow civilians to leave besieged Ukrainian cities and the delivery of humanitarian supplies. They also agreed to keep talking on ways to negotiate a settlement, but Putin's tough demands make prospects for a compromise look dim.Ukrainian negotiators said the parties may conduct another round of talks over the weekend.Russian forces are advancing on Mykolaiv, another key city in southern Ukraine, the regional governor warned Friday.In a video message posted on social media, Mykolaiv Oblast Gov. Vitaliy Kim said Russian troops are moving on Mykolaiv city from two directions and that some have already entered the city limits but are not yet inside in significant numbers.The city is preparing to defend itself, according to Kim.Russian troops are shelling Europe's largest nuclear power station in Ukraine.""We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire,"" Andriy Tuz, spokesperson for the plant in Enerhodar, said in a video posted on Telegram. ""There is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe.""The plant accounts for about one quarter of Ukraine's power generation.The fighting at Enerhodar, a city on the Dnieper River that accounts for one-quarter of the country's power generation, came as another round of talks between the two sides yielded a tentative agreement to set up safe corridors inside Ukraine to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid.The mayor of Enerhodar said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city's outskirts. Video showed flames and black smoke rising above the city of more than 50,000, with people streaming past wrecked cars, just a day after the U.N. atomic watchdog agency expressed grave concern that the fighting could cause accidental damage to Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors.The Pentagon has established a channel of direct communication with the Russian ministry of defense to avoid unintended conflict related to the war in Ukraine.A U.S. defense official said the ""de-confliction line"" was established March 1 ""for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation."" The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the communication line has not been announced.Associated Press Writer Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report.U.S. President Joe Biden's administration on Thursday announced new sanctions against Russian oligarchs and others in President Vladimir Putin's inner circle as Russian forces continue to pummel Ukraine.Those targeted by the new sanctions include Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, and Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, one of Russia's wealthiest individuals and a close ally of Putin. The U.S. State Department also announced it was imposing visa bans on 19 Russian oligarchs and dozens of their family members and close associates.""These individuals and their family members will be cut off from the U.S. financial system; their assets in the United States will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use,"" the White House said in a statement announcing the new penalties.The White House described Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, as a ""top purveyor of Putin's propaganda.""The property of Usmanov and the others will be blocked from use in the U.S. and by Americans. His assets include his superyacht, one of the world's largest. Usmanov's private jet, one of Russia's largest privately owned aircraft, is also covered by the sanctions.Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Russian military has offered safe corridors to civilians to allow them to leave areas of fighting in Ukraine.Putin, speaking in a video call with members of his Security Council, has charged that Ukrainian nationalist groups are preventing civilians from leaving.The Russian leader said the groups were also using civilians as shields, taking up firing positions to provoke the Russian retaliatory fire. Putin's claim couldn't be independently verified.The Russian military says it has only struck military facilities and haven't targeted residential areas, a claim that has been contradicted by the abundant evidence of massive casualties and damage to residential areas of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and other cities in Ukraine documented by The Associated Press.Putin reaffirmed his claim that the Russian military was fighting ""neo-Nazis,"" adding that some Ukrainians were also ""fooled by nationalist propaganda.""He hailed the Russian military as heroes and ordered additional payments to families of the soldiers who were killed and servicemen who were wounded in action.A growing number of international companies, including Apple, Disney and Ford, are dialing back operations in Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. See the list here Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to sit down for talks while urging the West to offer a stronger military assistance to Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion.In a sarcastic reference to a long table Putin used for his recent meetings with foreign leaders and Russian officials, Zelenskyy said: ""Sit down with me to negotiate, just not at 30 meters,"" adding, ""I don't bite. What are you afraid of?""During Thursday's news conference, Zelenskyy said that prospects for another round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiations don't seem promising, but emphasized the need to negotiate, adding that ""any words are more important than shots.""He said the world was too slow to offer support for Ukraine and prodded Western leaders to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to deny access to the Russian warplanes. The U.S. and NATO allies have ruled out the move that would directly pit Russian and Western militaries.Zelenskyy charged that if the West remains reluctant to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine, it should at least provide Kyiv with warplanes.The mayor of Enerhodar says Ukrainian forces are battling Russian troops for control of the city that has Europe's largest nuclear plant.The U.N. human rights chief says military operations in Ukraine are ""escalating further as we speak"" and warned of ""concerning reports"" of the use of cluster bombs.Michelle Bachelet said the Ukrainian town of Volnovakha in the eastern Donetsk region, where pro-Russian separatists seized territory in 2014, leading to a drawn-out military conflict, ""has been almost completely destroyed by shelling,"" with residents hiding in basements.She spoke Thursday during an ""urgent debate"" at the Human Rights Council, where country after country spoke out against Russia's invasion. Many Western envoys sported blue or yellow ties, scarves, jackets or ribbons on their lapels - colors of the Ukrainian flag.Delegates will vote Friday on a resolution that would create a three-person panel of experts to monitor human rights and report on rights abuses and violations in Ukraine.U.S. Ambassador Sheba Crocker said her country was ""deeply alarmed"" by reports of ""Russia's deployment of weapons such as cluster munitions and thermobarics against cities where innocent people are sheltering."" She urged countries to vote for the resolution.Chen Xu, China's ambassador, hailed diplomatic talks between Russia and Ukraine but said his country opposed efforts to ""politicize"" human rights. He said China would vote against the resolution.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office says a second round of talks with Russia about the war in Ukraine has begun in neighboring Belarus.A video released by Zelenskyy's office Thursday showed the informally dressed Ukrainian delegation walking into the meeting room where they shook hands with Russian delegates in suits and ties.The talks are aimed at stopping the fighting that has sent more than 1 million people fleeing over Ukraine's borders, but the two sides appeared to have little common ground.Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Ukraine that it must quickly accept the Kremlin's demand for its ""demilitarization"" and declare itself neutral, formally renouncing its bid to join NATO. Putin has long contended that Ukraine's turn toward the West is a threat to Moscow, an argument he used to justify last week's invasion.The talks came as the Russian military made significant gains in the south of Ukraine as part of an effort to sever the country's connection to the Black and Azov seas.The U.N. refugee agency says 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion less than a week ago, an exodus without precedent in this century for its speed.The tally from UNHCR amounts to more than 2 percent of Ukraine's population on the move in under a week. The World Bank counted the population at 44 million at the end of 2020.The U.N. agency has predicted that up to 4 million people could eventually leave Ukraine but cautioned that even that projection could be revised upward.In an email, UNHCR spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams wrote: ""Our data indicates we passed the 1M mark"" as of midnight in central Europe, based on counts collected by national authorities.On Twitter, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote: ""In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighboring countries.""A Russian official says troops have taken the Ukrainian port city of Kherson - a claim that the Ukrainian military denies.The city is under Russian soldiers' ""complete control,"" Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Wednesday.He said that the city's civilian infrastructure, essential facilities and transport are operating as usual and that there are no shortages of food or essential goods.Konashenkov said talks between the Russian commanders, city administrations and regional authorities on how to maintain order in the city were underway Wednesday. The claims could not be immediately verified.A senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday that they have seen claims that the Russians have taken Kherson, but that the Ukrainian military is rejecting that claim.""Our view is that Kherson is very much a contested city at this point,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to make military assessments.Ukrainian officials have reported a powerful explosion in central Kyiv, between the Southern Railway station and the Ibis hotel, an area near Ukraine's Defense Ministry.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office told The Associated Press on Wednesday night that it was a missile strike.Officials said it wasn't immediately clear how damaging the strike was, whether there were any casualties or where exactly the missile hit.The Southern Railway station is one of two stations that make up the main passenger rail complex that thousands have used to flee the war over the past week. The two stations are connected by an overhead corridor that crosses over about a dozen tracks.The stations are about 3 kilometers (2 miles) from Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the square that was the site of huge protests in 2014 and 2004.A top aide for Russian President Vladimir Putin says Ukrainians are on their way to Belarus for talks that have been scheduled for Thursday.""As far as I know, the Ukrainian delegation has already departed from Kyiv, is en route ... We're expecting them tomorrow,"" Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian delegation, told reporters Wednesday eveningAccording to Medinsky, the two sides agreed on the Brest region of Belarus, which borders Poland, as the site of the talks.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office confirmed to The Associated Press that the delegation is on its way, but gave no details on the time of the arrival.Some 836,000 people have fled Ukraine since Russia launched an invasion there on Feb. 24, according to the latest figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). About 453,000 of them have gone to neighboring Poland, UNHCR said.As the war in Ukraine continues to unfold, one Bay Area nonprofit is working to help get both their volunteers and animals out of the country to safety. Learn more about it here Ukrainian man Slava Chupryna says both of his grandmothers are no strangers to war zones growing up during World War II. Liudmila Reshetniyk is one of them. She's living out of a tiny eight by 16-foot bunker beneath their home. Every day she takes turns cooking meals in frigid temperatures wearing a bullet-proof vest. At 14 years old she was accustomed to hearing bombs go off in the factory she worked in during the second World War.Now, at age 83, she told her grandson she's still ready to fight.""She is a true survivor, she will do everything possible to defend Ukraine,"" Chupryna said. ""She said if she has to, she will grab a pitchfork and go stand up for Ukraine."" Get the full story here President Biden is expected to announce in his State of the Union address Tuesday that the U.S. will ban Russian carriers from its airspace, according to a person familiar with his remarks.Ukraine has effectively asked that Russia be kicked off the internet.In a letter sent Monday to the president of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Ukraine's deputing minister for digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, cited the ""atrocious crimes"" of Russia's invasion, including it's alleged breach of the Geneva Conventions in attacking civilian targets.Federov said the crimes ""have been made possible mainly due to the Russian propaganda machinery"" and cited cyberattacks ""from the Russian side"" that have impeded the ability of Ukrainians and their government to communicate.Federov asked that ICANN revoke, permanently or temporarily, the domains .ru and .su and shut down the root servers in Moscow and St. Petersburg that match domain names and numbers.""Russian citizens must feel the cost of war,"" government spokesperson Oleksandr Ryzhenko said Tuesday.ICANN had no immediate comment but the regional internet naming authority for Europe and the former Soviet Union, RIPE NCC, rejected the request.In an email to members, RIPE's executive board said it believes ""the means to communicate should not be affected by domestic political disputes, international conflicts or war.""Kicking Russia off the internet would be an annoyance to Russian hackers but it wouldn't stop them since they could still use different top-level internet domains. But it would badly isolate the Russian public from international discourse.The United Nations' top court has scheduled hearings next week into a request by Ukraine for the court to order Moscow to halt its invasion.Kyiv filed a case with the International Court of Justice on Saturday accusing Russia of planning genocide in Ukraine and asking for urgent ""provisional measures"" instructing Moscow to halt hostilities.Lawyers for Ukraine will present arguments March 7 supporting its request. Russia's lawyers will be given time to respond on March 8.Ahead of the hearings, the court's president, U.S. Judge Joan E. Donoghue, sent an urgent message Tuesday to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov underscoring the necessity for Russia to ""act in such a way as will enable any order the Court may make on the request for provisional measures to have its appropriate effects.""The International Court of Justice rules in disputes between states. It often takes years to reach decisions, but orders on provisional measures are often delivered quickly.The United States says it is expelling a Russian ""intelligence operative"" working for the United Nations, in addition to the 12 members of the Russian Mission to the United Nations whose expulsions were ordered Monday for engaging in espionage.The U.N. was informed Monday that the U.S. was taking action to expel a staff member working for the U.N. Secretariat, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric confirmed.""We regret that we find ourselves in this situation but are engaging with the host country,"" he said Tuesday.Dujarric refused to comment further on grounds of privacy and the sensitivity of the issue but did say ""what makes this decision a little difficult to understand is that the staff member was scheduled to end his assignment on March 14.""The U.S. Mission to the United Nations said in a statement Monday that the 12 Russian diplomats had ""abused their privileges of residency in the United States by engaging in espionage activities that are adverse to our national security.""A spokesperson for the U.S. Mission said Tuesday: ""On Feb. 28, the United States also initiated the process to require the departure of one Russian intelligence operative working at the United Nations who has abused their privileges of residence in the United States."" The spokesperson was not authorized to speak publicly and commented on condition of anonymity.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged US counterpart Joe Biden to deliver a strong and ""useful"" message about the Russian invasion at his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, in an exclusive interview with CNN and Reuters from the bunker in Kyiv in which he is leading his military's response. In the rare interview on Tuesday afternoon, Zelensky said that as long as Moscow's attacks on Ukrainian cities continued, little progress could be made in talks between the two nations. See the full story here Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday evening that the Russian forces fired at the Kyiv TV tower and Ukraine's main Holocaust memorial, among other civilian sites targeted on the sixth day of the Russian invasion.Ukraine's State Service for Emergency Situations said the strikes on the TV tower killed five people and left five more wounded.Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, posted a photo of clouds of smoke around the TV tower, and Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko shared a video of it being hit. Klitschko said an electrical substation powering the tower and a control room on the tower were damaged as the result.The head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, Andriy Yermak, said on Facebook that a ""powerful missile attack on the territory where the (Babi) Yar memorial complex is located"" is underway.Babi Yar, a ravine in Kyiv, is where nearly 34,000 Jews were killed within 48 hours in 1941 when the city was under Nazi occupation. The killing was carried out by SS troops along with local collaborators.A rocket attack on an administrative building in Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine has killed at least six people and injured another seven, Ukrainian officials said. A senior administration official told ABC News the U.S. has learned that Russia continues to plan for a ""devastating"" attack on Ukraine, warning that ""the Russians -- will crush Ukraine.""Google on Tuesday said it had blocked RT and Sputnik, Russian state-linked channels, from YouTube in Europe.""Our teams continue to monitor the situation around the clock to take swift action,"" the company said.ABC7's parent company Disney says it will stop releasing films in Russia because of the invasion in Ukraine. In a statement, Disney cited not only the invasion but also the humanitarian crisis it has unleashed in Europe.

Born two months premature to American parents, the twins were moved from Kyiv to Poland in a rescue evacuation on Monday.

On the day Russia invaded Ukraine, Max and his wife drove from their home in Germany to Poland, and then crossed the border into Ukraine. With fear, they moved in the opposite direction of the long line of cars that intended to flee the country and that was snarling the roads for miles.

Traveling diagonally across the country on Feb. 24, they encountered unmistakable signs of possible violence to come, from dozens of Ukrainian military checkpoints, tanks patrolling the roads and sandbags piled high on the street.

Not venturing to the country would have broken the couple’s decade-old dream to have a family. Their Ukrainian surrogate mother was soon expected to give birth to their twin daughters.

“Just our children not being with us was something we couldn’t live with,” Max said.

Now when his daughters smile at him, the war fades away. They were born prematurely on March 4. But he knows that any day, war could be coming closer to his family. Air raid sirens sound day and night, and much of the twins’ first days in the world have been spent in the hospital’s underground shelter.

Max said he didn’t know if, when and how his new family of four would be able to return home to safety. He spoke on the condition that his last name not be used because many of his relatives did not know he and his wife had turned to surrogacy.

The Russian war in Ukraine has devastated cities and killed more than 500 Ukrainian civilians, with no end to the fighting in sight. The war has also engulfed the lives of foreign couples seeking to become parents. Nearly every day, Ukrainian surrogates give birth to the children of foreign couples, and these parents are struggling to evacuate their children or even meet them for the first time.

Commercial surrogacy is legal in Ukraine for heterosexual married couples who are medically unable to have children or who have unsuccessfully tried to become pregnant several times using in vitro fertilization. The country’s favorable laws — biological parents are listed on the baby’s birth certificate — and affordable prices, generally around $40,000, have attracted many aspiring parents.

Most parents visit Kyiv, the capital, once before their child’s birth, to visit agencies, potentially undergo in vitro fertilization and sign a surrogacy contract. Then, the process of a surrogate becoming pregnant may take multiple attempts over years.

At least a dozen companies offer surrogacy in Ukraine, and BioTexCom, one of the leading agencies in Kyiv, estimates that it arranges at least a thousand births each year. The agency had expected to have 100 babies born by month’s end. Many of these newborns will be born in Kyiv, where fighting has neared hospitals, far from the parents who wait anxiously from outside Ukraine’s borders to take them home.

Sam Everingham, the founder of Growing Families, a nonprofit based in Australia that supports people navigating surrogacy, said that he had heard from about 90 panicked couples with newborns or babies soon expected in Ukraine. Surrogacy agencies, many of them based in Kyiv, once courted parents with images of chubby-cheeked babies and sonograms. Now, the agencies’ social media pages are filled with grim updates of the staff members’ upended lives and their attempts to keep surrogates and newborns safe in bleak shelters.

Some agencies, like New Hope Surrogacy, have relocated pregnant surrogates to safer regions of the country, or outside of it altogether. However, if these women give birth in neighboring countries with different laws about paid surrogacy, the biological parents’ rights could be jeopardized.

The number of stranded babies is growing. Denis Herman, BioTexCom’s legal adviser, said the agency was caring for 30 newborns, most of them in Kyiv.

“We have a lot of babies born during this time,” Mr. Herman said. “We cannot stop this process. We have to find some ways to deal with it.”

BioTexCom believes that the babies are safer in the bomb shelters in Kyiv than being transferred in haste, Mr. Herman said.

Mr. Everingham has heard about “an ongoing flow” of parents traveling into Ukraine despite the risk.

Televised scenes of Russian strikes have terrified parents, including a new Canadian father who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his religion forbade surrogacy. His son was born in Kyiv shortly before the war began. He and his wife are in Turkey, trying to figure out a plan to extract their son, mired by deep stress and depression as they follow the news.

“I don’t know what to do and where to go,” said the 41-year-old man, who lives in Toronto. “The joy of our child has taken over by the fear we might never get to hold him and lose him forever.”

The parents who have managed to extract their children through a combination of luck, connections and timing, say they feel immense responsibility to help evacuate their surrogates and others left behind in Ukraine.

Sasha Spektor, who lives in Chicago with his partner, Irma Nuñez, met his twin boys, Lenny and Moishe, for the first time on Tuesday. His sons had just traveled from Kyiv to Poland, a journey that took about 18 hours.

They were born two months prematurely in Kyiv at the beginning of war, on Feb. 25. The couple, their friends and supporters made hundreds of calls to locate resources in Kyiv, like baby formula and medical equipment, and to find the twins a way out of the war zone. The couple previously told their story of bringing their sons to safety to The Washington Post and NPR.

Eventually, they were able to secure an evacuation with the help of a volunteer Ukrainian ambulance crew and Project Dynamo, a nonprofit based in Tampa, Fla., conducting rescue missions out of Ukraine.

Meeting their sons was amazing, the new father said, adding that they were so gentle, and so tiny.

Their surrogate, Katya, crossed into Poland with the twins and another baby and its parents. Several days later, she returned to Ukraine, to reunite with her 6-year-old son in Lviv with the hopes of fleeing the country together.

“There are other people I feel responsible for,” Mr. Spektor said. “It was just as hard for me to part with her and just let her go back into Ukraine. She is one of us.”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/11/world/ukraine-russia-news
