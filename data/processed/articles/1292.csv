0,b22f18f3-3e31-43b0-b2d7-d5b5f6975ce7,['Associated Press'],,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — About 300 people were killed in the Russian airstrike last week on a Mariupol theater that was being used as a shelter, Ukrainian authorities said Friday in what would make it the war’s deadliest known attack on civilians yet.

Meanwhile, in what could signal an important narrowing of Moscow’s military objectives, the U.S. said Russian forces appear to have halted, at least for now, their ground offensive aimed at capturing the capital, Kyiv, and are concentrating more on the fighting for control of the Donbas region in the country’s southeast — a shift the Kremlin seemed to confirm.

Col.-Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, said the main objective of the first stage of the operation — reducing Ukraine’s fighting capacity — has “generally been accomplished,” allowing Russian forces to focus on “the main goal, liberation of Donbas.”

The seeming shift in Moscow’s stated war aims — after weeks in which Vladimir Putin denied Ukraine’s right to exist as an sovereign country and appeared bent on capturing many of its cities and toppling its government — could point to a possible exit strategy for Russia, which has suffered fiercer resistance and heavier losses than anticipated.

“ Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Ukrainian forces have been counterattacking and have been able to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometers, or 22 miles, east of Kyiv, while Kremlin rejects U.S. military intelligence indicating Kherson is again contested. ”

In fact, the Russians are no longer in full control of Kherson, the first major city to fall to Moscow’s forces, a senior U.S. defense official said. The official said the southern city is being contested by the Ukrainians in heavy fighting. The Kremlin denied it had lost full control.

The Donbas is the largely Russian-speaking eastern part of the country where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014 and where many residents have expressed support for Moscow.

In Mariupol, the bloodshed at the theater fueled allegations Moscow is committing war crimes by killing civilians, whether deliberately or by indiscriminate fire.

For days, the government in the besieged and ruined port city was unable to give a casualty count for the March 16 bombardment of the grand, columned Mariupol Drama Theater, where hundreds of people were said to be taking cover, the word “CHILDREN” printed in Russian in huge white letters on the ground outside to ward off aerial attack.

In announcing the death toll on its Telegram channel Friday, the city government cited eyewitnesses. But it was not immediately clear how witnesses arrived at the figure or whether emergency workers had finished excavating the ruins.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s national-security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Friday the theater bombing was an “absolute shock, particularly given the fact that it was so clearly a civilian target.” He said it showed “a brazen disregard for the lives of innocent people.”

The scale of devastation in Mariupol, where bodies have been left unburied amid bomb craters and hollowed-out buildings, has made information difficult to obtain.

But soon after the attack, the Ukrainian Parliament’s human rights commissioner said more than 1,300 people had taken shelter in the theater, many of them because their homes had been destroyed. The building had a basement bomb shelter, and some survivors did emerge from the rubble after the attack.

“This is a barbaric war, and according to international conventions, deliberate attacks on civilians are war crimes,” said Mircea Geoana, NATO’s deputy-secretary general.

He said Putin’s efforts to break Ukraine’s will to resist are having the opposite effect: “What he’s getting in response is an even more determined Ukrainian army and an ever more united West in supporting Ukraine.”

While the Russians continue to pound the capital from the air, they appear to have gone into a “defensive crouch” outside Kyiv and are focused more on the Donbas, the senior U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon’s assessment.

“They don’t show any signs of being willing to move on Kyiv from the ground,” the official said.

The official also said the U.S. has seen indications that Russia is beginning to draw on Russian soldiers in Georgia for deployment to Ukraine.

Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Ukrainian forces have been counterattacking and have been able to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometers, or 22 miles, east of Kyiv as Russian troops fall back on their overextended supply lines. In the south, logistical problems and Ukrainian resistance are slowing the Russians as they look to drive west toward the port of Odesa, the ministry said.

The Russian military said 1,351 of its soldiers have died in Ukraine and 3,825 have been wounded, though it was not immediately clear if that included pro-Moscow separatist forces fighting in the east or others not part of the Defense Ministry, such as the National Guard. Earlier this week, NATO estimated that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in four weeks of fighting.

Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor suggested in a Friday interview with MSNBC that 16,000 was a reasonable current estimate of the Russian military death toll.

Moscow is bristling at the tightening noose of sanctions around Russia’s economy. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Western pressure amounts to “total war.”

“And the goals are not hidden,” he said. “They are declared publicly — to destroy, break, annihilate, strangle the Russian economy and Russia on the whole.”

For civilians, the misery is growing more severe in Ukrainian towns and cities, which increasingly resemble the ruins that Russian forces left behind in their campaigns in Syria and Chechnya.

In the village of Yasnohorodka, some 50 kilometers, or 31 miles, west of Kyiv, Russian troops who were there earlier in the week appeared to have been pushed out as part of a counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces.

The tower of the village church was damaged by a blast, and houses on the main crossroads lay in ruins. Loud explosions and bursts of gunfire could be heard.

“You can see for yourself what happened here. People were killed here. Our soldiers were killed here. There was fighting,” said Yasnohorodka resident Valeriy Puzakov.

Tens of thousands of people have left Mariupol in the past week, most of them driving out in private cars through dozens of Russian checkpoints.

“Unfortunately, nothing remains of Mariupol,” said Evgeniy Sokyrko, who was among those waiting for an evacuation train in Zaporizhzhia, the closest urban center to Mariupol and a way station for refugees. “In the last week, there have been explosions like I’ve never heard before.”

Oksana Abramova, 42, said she ached for those left behind in the city, who have been cut off from communication with the shelling of cell, radio and TV towers and do not have the means to escape.

“All the time I think about how they are, where they are. Are still hiding, are they alive? Or maybe they are no longer there,” she said.

In Kyiv, ashes of the dead are piling up at the main crematorium in the capital because so many relatives have left, leaving urns unclaimed. And the northern city of Chernihiv is all but cut off.

Chernihiv lost its main road bridge over the Desna River to a Russian airstrike this week. Follow-up shelling then damaged a pedestrian bridge, trapping remaining inhabitants inside the city without power, water and heat, authorities said. More than half of Chernihiv’s prewar population of 285,000 is thought to have fled.

In other developments:

• The U.S. and the European Union announced a move to further squeeze Russia economically: a partnership to reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian energy and dry up the billions of dollars the Kremlin gets from the sale of fuel.

• Russia said it would offer safe passage starting Friday to 67 ships from 15 foreign countries that are stranded in Ukrainian ports because of the danger of shelling and mines.

• The International Atomic Energy Agency said it has been told by Ukrainian authorities that Russian shelling is preventing workers from being rotated in and out of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, which requires constant monitoring of its spent fuel.

• Russia’s military claimed it destroyed a massive Ukrainian fuel base used to supply the Kyiv region’s defenses, with ships firing a salvo of cruise missiles, according to the Interfax news agency. Videos on social media showed an enormous fireball near the capital.

For the vulnerable — the elderly, children and others unable to join millions heading westward — food shortages are mounting in a country once known as the breadbasket for the world.

In relentlessly shelled Kharkiv, hundreds of panicked people took shelter in the subway, and a hospital emergency room filled with wounded soldiers and civilians.

Mostly elderly women lined up stoically to collect food and other urgent supplies this week, as explosions thudded in the distance. Fidgeting with anticipation, a young girl watched as a volunteer’s knife cut through a giant slab of cheese, carving out thick slices, one for each hungry person.

Hanna Spitsyna took charge of divvying up the delivery of food aid from the Ukrainian Red Cross. Those waiting each got a lump of the cheese, dropped into plastic bags that people in line held open.

“Among those who stayed, there are people who can walk on their own, but many who cannot walk, the elderly,” Hanna said. “All these people need diapers, swaddle blankets and food.”

But as people continue to disappear, Russians open fire on protesters and medicines run low, two female journalists, whose identities we are protecting, say the people of Kherson are coming under increasing strain.

Monday 21 March

“21st, night, Monday …” This is the first line of Anna Akhmatova’s poem. We all know Russian literature very well. But now we cannot admire it. Russian culture cancellation is not just a trend, but a sincere feeling of rejection of everything Russian.

In the morning we are in a good mood, welcoming spring at last. There are about 100 people at the rally. We chat with friends, admitting we don’t really want to run away when we stand like this, together, among brave citizens … We are told we can buy wine nearby. Exactly five minutes after that, the shooting and explosions start, the siren sounds … We know we have to run straight to the museum – the closest place to hide.

The occupiers threw light and tear grenades at the people and started firing. An old man was wounded in his legs, bleeding heavily. The rest were beaten with rifle butts and boots, and three protesters were detained. We are very scared, but not ready to give up so easily yet.

Journalist Oleg Baturin is with us again. Again he writes bold critical posts on social media. We promise to meet each other after the war.

He said he spent more than a week in Russian captivity. Even though he omitted the more terrifying details, it was scary. It’s good that he had a thick, warm jacket – it softened the blows. They were interested in who organised the rallies in Kherson.

The fate of many of the abductees is still unknown. Many village heads and mayors of small towns who refused to cooperate with the occupiers were arrested. It’s especially hard for the ATO members – they are subjected to brutal beatings. Russians say they will spare no one.

At night, for the seventh time, our army hit Russian military hardware in Chernobaevka. The whole world is laughing – with what persistence Russians get there in order to lose everything.

Tuesday 22 March

Gritting our teeth, we went to protest. Unfortunately, we forgot the water. We stood for literally 10 minutes when the shooting started and teargas reached us. The scarf did little to help, we swallowed smoke; tears flowed.

But when the next grenade fell right at my feet – cinematically spinning, I made a jump worthy of a world champion of high jump. I successfully landed next to the office door and a strong guy pulled me inside. I came to my senses, cleared my throat, and decided to rush outside, striving to be back, but my eyes burned badly, so I listened from a distance as the daredevils returned and continued to send Russians to hell. Grenades flew around for a long time.

The Russians defiantly and brutally beat those who were leaving the rally, detaining several men. People decided not to protest openly in the main square.

The deputy of Kherson regional council, Sergei Khlan, wrote on his Facebook account that the invaders plan to introduce their currency, roubles, into circulation in the territory of the temporarily occupied Kherson region from April.

Russian soldiers continue to loot. They robbed another store on the outskirts of Kherson at night.

Children are born in Kherson. The whole city donated to buy a stroller for a newly born little Kherson citizen. But because of the blockade, the city lacks baby food.

Wednesday 23 March

Today a director of a local theatre, city deputy and opinion maker, Alexander Kniga, was kidnapped. According to his family, at 7am, nine cars drove up to their house and took him away in an unknown direction. Closer to 10pm, Alexander was returned home. He is all right. He said they demanded he name the organisers of the rallies. The Russians cannot believe that the people of Kherson themselves go to Freedom Square to express their wish to remain Ukrainian.

Today only about 50 people came to the rally. The Russian Guard attacked protesters with batons.

They try to apply a combination of sticks and carrots. In Chernobaevka, the Russians tried to distribute their humanitarian aid. No one got tempted. They left the aid in the village. The locals burned it down. Mighty people!

On the website of Kherson City Hall, you can apply to search for the missing.

Thursday 24 March

Exactly a month ago, at 5am, we were informed that the war had begun. Since 1 March, Kherson has been occupied and time has stopped here.

A new state flag of Ukraine was hung out at the Kherson City Hall today. The old one suffered in battles – the cable on which it was attached was broke, and the flag itself burned out and frayed.

The whole country shares memories of the first day of the war. I have a personal story: on the first day of the war, my son, a doctor, returned heartbroken from the hospital, where they tried to save the lives of our soldiers who fell under the shells. “Mum, they are torn to shreds, they shouted so loudly …” You can’t get used to the horrors of war.

People are leaving the villages that are completely looted. Before that, they release cows and goats so that the cattle will not die on their leads. At home, farmers leave jars with jam and a note in Russian for invaders: “Guess where the poison is?” Occupiers continue to search and loot activists’ homes.

At 5pm I am slowly walking home and see that a Z-car is driving along. I slow down even more – and it slows down, too. It’s tinted glass, so I don’t see who’s having fun there, but this game of nerves triggers adrenaline and we move at that pace for another five minutes until I turn the corner … They could abduct me easily.

Friday 25 March

I left the house and immediately came across the Russian Guard. I walked in the opposite direction, feeling their gaze on my back.

We listened to our news on the radio and suddenly Ukrainian broadcasting disappeared and was completely replaced by Russian.

From April, they want to start teaching the Russian syllabus in schools. They are going to remove Ukrainian fiction and historical literature from libraries. Let’s see how this experiment ends.

Finally, it became clear how people manage to get out of the siege. It’s just a matter of money. Departure price is $800 to $1,500. There is a Telegram channel where people discuss the details of the deal, share stories of checkpoints, expose fraudsters who take money and disappear. There are secret trails and guides.

Those who decide to leave on their own are at great risk. It’s a roulette wheel. A friend dared to leave. Her route was Kherson-Stanislav-Aleksandrovka-Nikolaev-Odesa-Moldova (Chisinau).

The humanitarian disaster continues. According to volunteers, we have more deaths from lack of medication than from bullets.

Saturday 26 March

Kherson residents whose houses were hit by shelling will be supplied with new windows at the expense of the city.

The UN promises to agree on the opening of a humanitarian corridor to Kherson on 26 March to bring in medicines and food.

The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, in southern Ukraine, has posted photographs of a long Ukrainian flag draped down the wall of the city hall.

Russian forces are normally stationed at the city hall but don't appear to have intervened.

There have been several protests by Ukrainian civilians in the square where the building is located since Russian forces moved into Kherson.

The photographs show workers on a crane mounting the new flag.

""On the night when the city council was shelled, the wire which held our national flag was damaged. And the flag itself should have been replaced a long time ago -- it had faded and frayed,"" Kolykhaiev said in a Facebook post.

""Today we found a way to replace it. Have a nice day, my Hero City,"" Kolykhaiev added.

Kherson, a key port city on the Black Sea, in southern Ukraine, was overrun by Russian forces on March 2, after days of heavy bombardment and shelling.

People living in Kherson have described days of terror confined to their apartments and houses, fearful to go outside for even basic necessities -- their city now a dystopian shell of the home they knew and loved.

“Kherson is contested territory again,” a senior US defense official said, claiming Russian forces no longer control the area and Ukrainians were continuing to wage a fierce fight there.

Kherson, which sits at the mouth of the Dnieper River that bisects Ukraine and is directly north of the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014, was the first and only major population center that had been taken by Russian forces since the start of the invasion last month.

The city has been the site of regular protests against Russian forces, who dispersed protestors with live rounds earlier this week.

The Kremlin denied that it had lost control of Kherson, with Russian Col. Gen. Sergey Rudskoy claiming Friday, “Kherson and most of the Zaporozhye region are under full control,” according to state-run news outlet Sputnik.

The news comes after several successful Ukrainian counterattacks in the north. Getty Images

But Rudskoy added that Russia is now considering limiting its invasion — which Rudskoy called a “special operation” — to the Donbas region in the east, where Kremlin-backed separatists have been fighting against Ukraine since 2014.

“The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which … makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,” Rudskoy claimed in a speech Friday, ignoring reports of Ukrainian victories and Russian losses.

“Our forces and resources will be concentrated on the main thing – the complete liberation of Donbas,” he said.

The Pentagon acknowledged the Russian about-face Friday.

“This is a relatively new decision by the Russians” a senior US defense official said.

The news came as:

The senior US official said Russia is trying to move reinforcements in from the former Soviet state of Georgia to supplement its forces in Ukraine. The official added that there were no signs Belarus — a Kremlin ally that was used as a base for Russian President Putin’s forces in the early days of the invasion — would be sending troops to Ukraine.

Russian guided missiles were failing to hit their targets at a “significant” rate of between 20 and 60 percent, according to a Pentagon analysis.

-Some soldiers in Russia’s National Guard have refused to fight in Ukraine, according to a report by the Times of London. A dozen troops with the Guard — an internal military force that answers directly to Putin — have argued that their work contracts only apply to Russian territory and that there’s no legal basis to deploy them to Ukraine.

Russian cruise-missiles struck a Ukrainian Air Force command center in the western part of the country, causing “significant damage,” according to a CNN report. “A total of six cruise missiles were released by the Russians. Some of them were hit by air defense,” Ukrainian authorities said. “The rest struck several structures, causing significant destruction to the infrastructure.”

The United Nations said more than 1,000 civilians are confirmed killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began, adding that the death toll was likely higher because of limited information coming from active combat zones. “Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,” the UN said in a statement.

The Ukrainian advance on Kherson comes after successful Ukrainian counterattacks in the north also retook a handful of Kyiv suburbs and disrupted supply lines crucial to Russian designs on the Ukrainian capital.

“Clearly they overestimated their ability to take Kyiv … to take any population center,” the senior defense official said of the Russians.

Ukrainian forces also destroyed a large Russian landing ship Thursday in the port city of Berdyansk, too, reportedly disrupting efforts by Moscow to resupply its flagging troops.

As Russian morale continues to sink, a Russian brigade commander was reportedly killed, deliberately, by his own troops after his unit suffered massive losses in Ukraine, a Western official said Friday. Reported to be “Colonel Medvechek, commander of 37 Motor Rifle Brigade,” the officer could likely be the same higher-up who was reported run over by a tank under his command and wounded on Thursday.
