Sullivan told ABC News ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Jonathan Karl on Sunday that before the war began, declassified intelligence ""indicated that there was a plan from the highest levels of the Russian government to target civilians who oppose the invasion.""

""So this is something that was planned,"" he told Karl, adding that some units may have acted without direction from their leaders, frustrated by the level of opposition they've encountered from Ukrainians.

""I do think some of these units engaged in these acts of brutality, these atrocities, these war crimes, even without direction from above. But make no mistake, the larger issue of broad-scale war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine lies at the feet of the Kremlin and lies at the feet of the Russian president,"" he said.

When asked if the acts amounted to genocide as suggested by United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who visited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv this week, Sullivan noted that the State Department usually makes that legal determination after an investigation and legal analysis.

""But let's set legalities aside for a minute...I think we can all say that these are mass atrocities. These are war crimes,"" he said.

In one of the latest incidents, at least 52 people, including five children, were killed during a missile strike at a train station in eastern Ukraine. Images of bodies strewn across luggage showed the magnitude of the attack, which injured at least 100.

Since the war began, the Biden administration has been steadily implementing sanctions meant to cripple the Russian economy and Putin's funding of the invasion.

In the latest package, the U.S., in conjunction with its European Union and G-7 allies, imposed a ban on all new investments in Russia, increased sanctions on two major banks and sanctioned Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters. But while the U.S. has banned Russian oil imports, European governments have not.

Asked if it was time for Europe to ban Russian oil and gas and imports, which come to an estimated $850 million per day, Sullivan said the president had been clear that the U.S. was able to do so ""without imposing massive costs on the American people"" but would continue to work with European allies to limit dependency.

""He is now working on a daily basis with his European colleagues on steps Europe can take to wean itself off of Russian oil and gas,"" he told Karl. ""In fact, the United States is surging gas exports to Europe in order for them to reduce their dependence on Russia.""

Karl followed up: ""But you hear the frustration from President Zelenskyy. We heard it from the mayor of Kyiv that the money continues to flow, that the ruble is not in rubble as the president said...The money is still flowing and flowing in pretty dramatic levels.""

""If you look at independent projections of the Russian economy, it is likely to fall by something like 10 to 15% this year,"" Sullivan said. ""It is likely to cease to be one of the world's major economies because of the economic pressure we have put on them.""

Sullivan also said the economy is being ""artificially propped up"" by Russian banks.

""Banks…are not allowed by the Russian government to sell dollars to customers. That's how they're protecting the ruble. But that has huge economic costs on the -- on the Russian economy,"" he added. ""We will continue to squeeze the Russian economy so that Russia and the Kremlin feel the pain from what they have done in Ukraine.""

Sullivan conceded that although Putin has suffered several setbacks in his mission to topple the Ukrainian government, his tight grip on media has prevented Russians from hearing the truth.

""They are not getting the truth, for example, Jon, about the fact that the Russians lost and the Ukrainians won the battle for Kyiv,"" he said. ""Kyiv stands despite Russia's effort to conquer the capital city of their neighbor and they were unable to do that, and they suffered a significant military defeat there.""",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/russia-planned-attacks-ukrainian-civilians-national-security-adviser/story?id=83983530

“We, in fact, before the war began declassified intelligence and presented it,” Sullivan said on ABC’s “This Week,” “indicating that there was a plan from the highest levels of the Russian government to target civilians who oppose the invasion, to cause violence against them, to organize efforts to brutalize them in order to try to terrorize the population and subjugate it. So this is something that was planned.”

2,d9cd7f88-2ffd-4d04-8b07-fa270afe119e,['Ed Pilkington'],2022-04-10 00:00:00,"The White House has doubled down on its condemnation of Russian targeting of Ukrainian civilians as war crimes, describing recent events including a missile strike on a railway station as “cruel and criminal and evil” – but stopping short of classifying the brutal attacks as genocide.

Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, took to the TV political shows on Sunday to decry Russia’s “systematic targeting of civilians, the grisly murder of innocent people, the brutality, the depravity” in Ukraine.

He said recent atrocities “absolutely constitutes war crimes”.

But speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, he declined to categorise the horrors of Russia’s war as “genocide”.

Asked if recent attacks could be described as anything but genocide, Sullivan replied: “The label is less important than the fact that these acts are cruel and criminal and wrong and evil, and need to be responded to decisively.”

Sullivan elaborated on his unwillingness to wield the term “genocide” in an interview with ABC’s This Week. He said the state department would gather evidence through its specialist unit and in time make a legal analysis according to the definition of genocide under international law.

“We haven’t reached a determination on genocide,” he said. “That is a determination that we work through systematically.”

Sullivan said that in the face of Russian atrocities, the US was determined to keep arms and military assistance flowing to support Ukrainians.

A new CBS News poll released on Sunday suggests the policy is overwhelmingly popular with Americans, with 72% of respondents saying the US should send weapons and supplies to Ukraine and only 28% saying it should not.

Debate about whether to call Russia’s actions a genocide has intensified after the missile strike on Kramatorsk railway station in eastern Ukraine. At least 50 people including five children were killed.

Genocide was first codified in international law in 1948 through the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide adopted by the general assembly of the United Nations. Under the UN definition, genocide includes killing and otherwise inflicting destruction “in whole or in part” on “a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.

The need to prove a conscious assault against an entire group of people sets the legal burden very high. By contrast, “war crimes” are defined under international law as a range of specific acts that are more easily prosecuted including “wilful killing”, torture or inhuman treatment, destruction of property and violation of the rights of prisoners of war.

Investigations are under way to gather evidence of possible war crimes relating to the brutal Russian campaign. They include efforts in the Ukrainian town of Bucha where mass graves were found following the withdrawal of Russian troops.

In the wake of the Bucha atrocities, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of genocide. But Biden has side-stepped the term while embracing another highly fraught legal concept under international law by accusing Putin personally of being a “war criminal”.

In Congress, politicians of both main parties have been willing to embrace the idea that genocide is unfolding in Ukraine.

The Democratic majority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said last week: “When we murder wantonly innocent civilians because of who they are, whether it be their religion, race, or nationality, that is genocide. And Mr Putin is guilty of it.”

On Sunday, Liz Cheney, a Republican member of Congress from Wyoming, also evoked genocide.

“This is clearly genocide,” she told CNN, adding that Europe needed to understand that it was funding Putin’s “genocidal campaign” by buying Russian oil and gas.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/10/white-house-doubles-down-condemns-russian-attacks-war-crimes

""To organize efforts to brutalize them in order to try to terrorize the population and subjugate it. So this is something that was planned.""

The big picture: The International Criminal Court last month launched an investigation into allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed in Ukraine, charges the Kremlin has denied.

Ukrainian prosecutors have opened some 5,600 cases of alleged war crimes since the beginning of the Russian invasion.

President Biden said last week that Russian President Vladimir Putin should face a war crimes trial for the alleged massacre of civilians by Russian forces in the Kyiv region city of Bucha.

Worth noting: Jeremy Fleming, the head of British intelligence agency GCHQ, said last week that Putin's ""Plan B has been more barbarity against civilians and cities.""

Sullivan noted to Karl that ""individual soldiers or individual units got frustrated because the Ukrainians were beating them back"" and they'd been ""told they were going to have a glorious victory and just ride into Kyiv without any opposition with the Ukrainians welcoming them.""

""And when that didn't happen, I do think some of these units engaged in these acts of brutality, these atrocities, these war crimes even without direction from above,"" he added.

The bottom line: ""I do think some of these units engaged in these acts of brutality, these atrocities, these war crimes, even without direction from above,"" Sullivan said.

US national security advisor Jake Sullivan said Russia's violence against Ukrainian civilians was ""planned.""

His comments come after footage from Bucha began circulating in early April and appeared to show bodies lying in the streets and indiscriminate killings of civilians.

""The images that we've seen out of Bucha and other cities have been tragic. They've been horrifying. They've been downright shocking, but they have not been surprising,"" Sullivan said on ABC News ""This Week"" on Sunday.

""So this is something that was planned.""

In a recent visit to Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described a scene of only ""death"" as the bodies of hundreds of civilians were found following Russia's withdrawal from the area.

Russian officials have claimed the massacre of civilians in Bucha was a hoax meant to frame the Russian military, but experts have said Russia's claims fall apart under scrutiny.

Sullivan said on Sunday that it's possible that Russian soldiers and military units became ""frustrated because the Ukrainians were beating them back.""

The lists ""supposedly existed in large cities like Cherson, where they were afraid of people who connected with each other and gathered in public places to demonstrate against the occupants,"" Zelenskyy said.

WASHINGTON, April 10 (Reuters) - The United States is committed to providing Ukraine with “the weapons it needs” to defend itself against Russia, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Sunday as Ukraine seeks more military aid from the West.

Sullivan said the Biden administration will send more weapons to Ukraine to prevent Russia from seizing more territory and targeting civilians, attacks that Washington has labeled war crimes.

“We’re going to get Ukraine the weapons it needs to beat back the Russians to stop them from taking more cities and towns where they commit these crimes,” Sullivan said on ABC News’ “This Week”.

Moscow has rejected accusations of war crimes by Ukraine and Western countries.

Speaking later on NBC News’ “Meet the Press"", Sullivan said the United States was “working around the clock to deliver our own weapons . . . and organizing and coordinating the delivery of weapons from many other countries.”

“Weapons are arriving every day,” Sullivan said, “including today.”

The United States has sent $1.7 billion in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24, the White House said last week.

Weapons shipments have included defensive anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles, as well as ammunition and body armor. But U.S. and European leaders are being pressed by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to provide heavier arms and equipment to engage Russia in the eastern region of the country, where Russia is expected to intensify its military efforts. read more

In excerpts of an interview with CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" that will air later on Sunday, Zelenskiy expressed skepticism that the United States would deliver the weapons he said are needed.

Whether Ukraine can beat back the Russian incursion ""depends on how fast we will be helped by the United States. To be honest, whether we will be able to survive depends on this,"" Zelenskiy said.

""I have 100% confidence in our people and in our armed forces, but unfortunately I don't have the confidence that we will be receiving everything we need.""

On Friday, Ukrainian officials said more than 50 people were killed in a missile strike on a train station in city of Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region, where thousands of people had gathered to evacuate.

Russia's invasion has forced around a quarter of the population of 44 million to leave their homes, turned cities into rubble and killed or injured thousands.

Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" its southern neighbour. Ukraine and Western nations have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for war.

Russia on Saturday appointed a new general to lead its forces in Ukraine, Aleksandr Dvornikov, who had significant military experience in Syria.

With that background, Sullivan said he expects Dvornikov to authorize more brutality against the Ukrainian civilian population.

Republican U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, speaking on CNN’s “State of the Nation"", urged the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with both offensive weapons such as tanks and planes and defensive systems like anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles.

""I think we need to do everything that Zelenskiy says he needs at this point, given the just unbelievable battle that they have put up,"" she said.

A CBS News poll released on Sunday showed widespread support among Americans for sending more weapons to Ukraine.

According to the poll, which was conducted last week as news of Russian attacks on civilians unfolded, 72% of those surveyed favor sending more weapons, while 78% support economic sanctions on Russia.
