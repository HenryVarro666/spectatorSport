The first video was shared online on Sunday morning and appears to show rockets being fired at three armoured vehicles in the Ukrainian south-eastern city of Mariupol.

The aerial footage, which was circulated by several unverified accounts, shows a BTR-82 APC and KamAZ-63968 'Typhoon' vehicle being targeted successfully. It is not clear when the strike took place.

The BTR-82A is an advanced 8x8 wheeled armoured personnel carrier (APC) being manufactured by in Russia for use by the armies of Russia and Kazakhstan.

The second video footage was also shared online on Sunday and shows a drone strike on a Russian command centre in southern Ukraine.

The footage was released by the Ukrainian Army who said it shows the Russian command and control center destroyed near Vasylivka, in the Mykolaiv region by a Bayraktar drone.

It is unknown if or how many casualties there were involved in both strikes on Russian forces.

It comes as Russia escalated attacks in western Ukraine on Sunday with a deadly airstrike on a military base where Ukrainian troops had trained with NATO forces, bringing the conflict closer to Poland and prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to renew his pleas for a no-fly zone.

Zelenskyy called Sunday a 'black day,' and said none of the activities at the military base would have threatened Russian territory.

Explosions have been heard on the outskirts of the western Ukrainian city of Lviv after Russian forces launched an attack on a military base just 12 miles from the Polish border, killing at least nine people and injuring dozens more.

According to Ukrainian sources, Vladimir Putin's forces had launched a missile strike on the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, also known as Yavoriv military complex, just before 6am this morning.

Initial reports suggested the base had been targeted by eight missiles, but Maksym Kozytskyi, Governor of the region later confirmed 30 cruise missiles had been fired, killing 35 people and injuring 134.

An American journalist was also killed Sunday and another injured when their vehicle came under fire from Russian forces outside Kyiv.

Meanwhile, continued fighting in multiple regions caused more misery throughout Ukraine and has provoked international outrage.

Now in its third week, the war has forced more than 2.5 million people to flee Ukraine. Thousands of civilians and soldiers have been killed.

Meanwhile, the death toll in the strategic southern port city of Mariupol, facing acute deprivation amid a prolonged siege, has topped 2,000, officials there said.

Efforts continued to get help to Mariupol, which aid agencies say is facing a humanitarian catastrophe.

A humanitarian column headed there had to turn back again on Sunday, a city official said, after the Russians 'did not stop firing'.

A total of 2,187 residents have now died in days of relentless Russian bombardment, the city council said Sunday.

'The enemy is holding the city hostage by performing real acts of genocide,' said Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.

Zelensky has accused Moscow of both blocking and attacking humanitarian convoys, although he said Sunday that another 125,000 people had been evacuated that way across Ukraine.

'Russians are bombing the city even during official negotiations,' Defence Minister Reznikov said. 'They have no dignity, no honor, no mercy.'

Talks between the two sides have yet to yield a ceasefire, but Ukrainian and Russian representatives will meet via video-conference Monday, a Zelensky adviser and a Kremlin spokesman both said.

'And our goal is that in this struggle, in this difficult negotiating work, Ukraine will get the necessary result... for peace and for security,' Zelensky said early Monday.

'We see significant progress,' Leonid Slutsky, a senior member of Russia's negotiating team, told state-run television network RT Sunday.

It comes after the Ukrainian President visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kiev on Sunday to boost their morale and award them medals for their bravery.

'Guys, get well soon. I believe that the best gift for your statement will be our common victory!' said Zelensky, according to an English translation of a tweet posted by the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.

Ukraine's military published several videos it says show its prized Bayraktar TB2 drones at work destroying targets controlled by Russian forces.

Over the weekend, the Ukrainian army commander-in-chief's Facebook page posted five clips showing the strikes, though giving little detail of the exact locations or targets.

The drones have been hailed as a game-changer by the Ukrainian military, and have been credited with destroyed large numbers of Russian armored vehicles, gaining heroic status among the Ukrainian people.

The videos have been keenly recieved, amassing some 1.2 million Facebook views as of Monday, with many reposted on other networks to vast audiences. Insider was unable to verify the footage, or the named targets.

The first, dated March 12, purported to show the destruction of a Russian electronic warfare system near Kyiv.

""Our Bayraktar TB2 operators masterfully 'tested' the enemy's electronic warfare system in the Kyiv region,"" said its caption.

The footage appears to have been taken with a camera held close to a monitor screen, a common format for Ukraine's Bayraktar videos. Someone's reflection could be seen and a buzz of chatter was also recorded.

Another 18-second video posted on Saturday said one of the drones had destroyed a multiple rocket launcher.

""Bayraktars in action!"" the post said. ""Hundreds of saved lives of our fellow citizens, especially civilians!""

Later that day, a third video post claimed a Bayraktar had taken out a Russian army command post:

Neither of those videos gave a location.

A final video dated March 13 claimed to show the destruction of an artillery fire control point — a system to coordinate and direct ranged weapons.

Ukraine had between five and 20 of the drones in service before the invasion, according to The New York Times.

The drones can reach altitudes of 25,000 feet and fly for 27 continuous hours, per their manufacturers.

They can be operated remotely from up to 300 km away, with each one capable of bearing four laser-guided bombs or rockets, for a total payload of some 150 kilograms.

Dramatic drone footage has emerged of Russian vehicles and a command centre apparently under fire by the Ukrainian army.

A new video shows rockets being fired on Russian forces in the port city of Mariupol where the invaders bombed a maternity and children’s hospital last week, killing at least four people.

Plumes of dark smoke and flames began rising from the BTR-82 APC and KamAZ-63968 ‘Typhoon’ vehicles after the explosions.

According to the latest Ukrainian estimates as of March 14 cited by the Kyiv Independent, Vladimir Putin has lost more than 12,000 troops, 77 planes, 90 helicopters, 389 tanks, 1,249 armoured personnel carriers and 64 multiple rocket launchers.

Even though the Ukrainian army continues to push back against the aggressor in Mariupol, at least 2,500 people have been killed in the city since the war started, according to Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych.

Civilians there have been trapped for days without food, water or access to medicine.

Another aerial clip released yesterday morning allegedly shows the Russian command and control center near Vasylivka, in the Mykolaiv region, wiped out, the Daily Mail reported.

President Volodymyr Zelensky slammed the Kremlin for ‘torturing’ the tens of thousands of women, children and elderly who have spent more than a week without vital supplies and electricity.

Numerous attempts to evacuate people through ‘humanitarian corridors’ have also been impaired by savage attacks from Russian troops.

The UK’s health secretary Sajid Javid condemned the recent air strike on the hospital, stressing it was ‘an appalling atrocity’ and ‘a war crime’.

‘Under international law you cannot attack health facilities, hospitals,’ he told Sky News.

‘The most recent information I have from the World Health Organisation is they now have documented evidence of at least 31 such attacks on health facilities, hospitals, including shelling a couple of days ago, a cancer hospital as well.’

But according to Ukrainian health minister Viktor Lyashko, Russia has destroyed seven hospitals that cannot be rebuilt and damaged 104.

Six medical workers have also been killed in the airstrikes so far.

A heavily pregnant woman who was pictured being evacuated from under the wreckage of the hospital in Mariupol also became the latest victim of the shelling alongside her unborn baby, it was announced this morning.

The horrifying image showing her stroking her bloodied lower abdomen went viral following the bombing, which Russia has branded as ‘fake news’.

The footage emerged as the war entered its 18th day, with a constant attack from Russia in a bid to seize Kyiv.

The first video, which was posted online early Sunday, purportedly shows rockets being fired at three armored vehicles in Mariupol, Ukraine's south-eastern city. Russian forces have been facing tough resistance from Ukrainian armed forces, who now have reportedly killed thousands of Russian soldiers and destroyed hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles.

Breaking Russians' Confidence

The ariel footage taken from defender drones shows a BTR-82 APC and a KamAZ-63968 'Typhoon' vehicle being successfully targeted. However, the video is unverified but reports claim that the attack on the Russians took place in Mariupol. The exact date of the attack is unknown.

The second video, which was also posted online on Sunday, depicts a drone strike in southern Ukraine on a Russian command center. The second video footage was posted by the Ukrainian Army, which claimed that it showed a Bayraktar drone destroying a Russian command and control center near Vasylivka in the Mykolaiv region.

Both the strikes on Russian forces resulted in huge losses. However, it is unclear how many died in the attack.

The first video shows constant bombing on the multiple Russian armored vehicles including a BTR-82 APC and a KamAZ-63968 waiting in a row, with all the targets hit successfully. The BTR-82A is a Russian-made advanced 8x8 wheeled armored personnel carrier (APC) that will be used by Russia's and Kazakhstan's forces.

The vehicles can be seen exploding as rockets hit them. In the second footage, the Russian command center can be seen bombed multiple times, with one bomb hitting the center of the building, following which it explodes.

Russian Hostilities Continue

Amid all these Russian forces continue to attack different Ukrainian cities as the war entered its third week. According to reports, Vladimir Putin's forces launched a missile strike on the International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, commonly known as the Yavoriv military facility, just before 6 am on Sunday morning, according to Ukrainian sources.

Initially, it was reported that eight missiles were fired at the base, but the region's governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, later stated that 30 cruise missiles were fired, killing 35 people and injuring 134 others.

More than 2.5 million people have been forced to evacuate Ukraine as a result of the conflict and thousands of civilians and military have died as a result of the war.

While Russia's side of the conflict appears to have been surprisingly light on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, that is changing.

The Latest:

POSTED: 4:20 PM EST—

A ZALA KYB loitering munition was downed in Kyiv. This is the first known evidence of loitering munitions being used in the conflict. These systems have proven to be decisive in recent wars and are extremely challenging to reliably defend against. The ZALA KYB is a class of loitering munition that would be especially useful for engaging fixed soft targets or targets of opportunity and scouting ahead of friendly forces when equipped with an optical payload.

As noted earlier, we are also seeing more Russian UAV footage, mostly spotting and providing bomb damage assessment for artillery strikes, which is in line with Russian fighting doctrine:

Russia is loosening up a bit on frontline videos from the conflict, as well, in an apparent shift in its information operations strategy. Below shows an airborne raid on Hostomel Airport, where the An-225 was destoryed, which has been an incredibly hotly contested locale since shortly after the invasion began. It is not clear what wave of Russian assault the video is from, but the battle there has supposedly been extremely bloody, with the airport changing hands multiple times over a number of days:

Ukrainian TB-2 drones have been very busy and losses have apparently been limited, which is quite astonishing:

The Ukrainian armed forces have released videos on the Internet showing the use of the Bayraktar TB2 to destroy the Russian Electronic Warfare (EW) system and command post near Kyiv as well as 9K317 Buk-M2 TELAR Russian air defense missile systems.

Currently, 257 Bayraktar platforms are into service with Turkey, Qatar, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan. This drone holds the record in Turkish aviation history for endurance (with 27 hours 3 minutes) and an altitude of 7,600m.

The Bayraktar TB2 is a Turkish-made medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) manufactured by the Turkish Company Baykar Defence. The drone can be remotely controlled or conducted autonomous flight. The whole system consists of Bayraktar TB2 done, a ground station, a ground data terminal, a remote display terminal, an advanced base with generator and trailer modules.

The Bayraktar TB2 can conduct intelligence, persistent aerial Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, but can be also armed with four air-to-surface smart guided missiles that provide high strike precision against static and mobile targets. The armed UAV Bayraktar TB2 is a multi-purpose platform as it can also perform target acquisition using the onboard laser designator. It has a length of 6.5 m, a wingspan of 12 m, and a maximum take-off weight of 700 kg with a payload capacity of 150 kg.

Citing information from the Army-Technology website, Bayraktar TB2 features a monocoque design integrating an inverse v-tail structure. The fuselage is made of carbon fiber, Kevlar and hybrid composites, whereas the joint segments constitute precision computer numerical control (CNC) machined aluminum parts.

This Bayraktar TB2 drone is powered by a single Rotax 912 internal combustion injection engine developing 105 hp. The engine is positioned between the tail booms and fuel is stored in bladder tanks. It can fly at a maximum speed of over 220 km with a maximum cruising range of up to 6,000 km. It can reach a maximum altitude of 8.2 km and has a flight endurance of 27 hours.

The Bayraktar TB2 is equipped with the Baykar Real-Time Imagery Transmission System (BGAM) providing real-time image transmission and processing solutions to the defense industry. The BGAM allows high-resolution, non-delay live broadcasts to be monitored by multiple users at the same time. The BGAM is a web-based application that allows users to watch live broadcasts securely on the network or on tablets using the mobile application via the internet.

The BGAM system automatically stores all transmitted imagery into 30-minute files. While monitoring live imagery, users can take multi-tag notes on the system. Saved tags and labels will facilitate, at a later date, the search through archive videos. In a similar way, based on these notes, a mission log can be created and then exported.
