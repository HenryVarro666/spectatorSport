1,cad3ff42-fe49-42ab-89d9-1898891d4dc6,[],,"KYIV, Ukraine (AFP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made an impassioned plea Thursday for citizens worldwide to pour onto streets and squares in global protest against Russia’s bloody month-old invasion.

In a late-night television address from the emptied streets of his nation’s besieged capital Kyiv, a defiant but visibly tired Zelensky appealed in English for worldwide solidarity.

“The world must stop the war,” he said. “Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities, come in the name of peace, come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.”

His appeal came one month after Russian tanks rolled over the border, bringing a conflict that has killed untold thousands of civilians and soldiers on both sides.

More than ten million Ukrainians have already fled homes and cities under sustained Russian bombardment from land, sea and air.

There is growing evidence that Russia’s once-vaunted military has become badly bogged down, and has been forced to turn to long-range bombardment to break Ukrainian resolve.

In the southern port city of Mariupol alone, 100,000 people are trapped without food, water or power and enduring fierce shelling by Russian forces.

In the city’s hospital, local officials said staff have evacuated patients to the basement, where they are treated by candlelight beside 600-700 other local residents seeking what little safety they can.

The US government on Wednesday said the Kremlin’s bombing campaign amounted to war crimes, further escalating a confrontation between Moscow and the West that has rivalled the worst crises of the Cold War.

“We’ve seen numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, as well as other atrocities,” said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

“Based on information currently available, the US government assesses that members of Russia’s forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.”

So far the conflict has not spilt over into direct military conflagration between Russia and NATO, but there are growing fears Russia may up the ante with a chemical, biological or even tactical nuclear attack.

US President Joe Biden is in Brussels for back-to-back emergency NATO, G7, and European Union summits from Thursday that will bring pledges of more lethal weapons for Ukraine, more punishing sanctions on Russia’s already crisis-wracked economy and warnings about further escalation.

Ukrainian resistance

NATO officials believe that — armed with an arsenal of Western anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons — Ukrainian forces may have already killed as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers and wounded perhaps 30,000-40,000.

Putin’s regime officially puts the number of Russian fallen at under 500, and has introduced draconian censorship laws to prevent independently verified news about what it calls a “special military operation.”

But Ukrainian civilians continue to bear the brunt of the war.

Zelensky admitted the last month had been “long” but hailed Ukrainian resistance that has been much more ferocious than Russia expected and would endure for as long as it takes.

“This is a war for independence and we must win,” he said in the late-night address, flitting between Ukrainian and his native Russian.

“We will rebuild every city, we will bring the invaders to justice for every crime,” he said. “All our people will live in a free Ukraine.”

Recent days have brought claims of Ukrainian forces not only repelling attacks from the much larger and much better armed Russian military, but launching counteroffensives and winning back territory around Kyiv.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that “the small city of Makariv and almost all of Irpin is already under the control of Ukrainian soldiers.”

AFP journalists reported fierce exchanges of artillery fire in Irpin.

British military intelligence said Ukraine had “probably retaken Makariv and Moschun” to the northwest of the capital and “there is a realistic possibility that Ukrainian forces are now able to encircle Russian units in Bucha and Irpin.”

Putin responds

Facing mounting diplomatic and economic pressure, Putin’s regime has responded by warning Russia could use nuclear weapons if it faces an “existential threat,” and launched tit-for-tat retaliation against the West.

Moscow moved to expel US diplomats in retaliation for Washington’s move earlier this month to remove 12 of Moscow’s US-based representatives to the United Nations.

In an effort to blunt the damage done by sanctions to the national currency, Putin said Wednesday that Russia will only accept payments in rubles for gas deliveries to “unfriendly countries,” which include all EU members.

The maneuver sharpened growing debate in Europe — which is heavily dependent on Russian energy imports — about possible bans on Russian oil and gas.

Moscow has warned an embargo would prompt a “collapse” of the global energy market.

While Europe has appeared fractured on the question of an oil embargo, there are also signs of fissures within Putin’s regime.

Moscow recently confirmed that Anatoly Chubais — a former Kremlin chief of staff who oversaw liberal economic reforms in the 1990s — quit his post as a Putin adviser. He has reportedly fled the country in protest at the war.

Russia still has a vital friend in China, which pushed back against suggestions that Moscow should be expelled from the G20 group of countries.

But Scott Morrison, prime minister of G20 member Australia, said he believed that Putin attending the summit would be “a step too far.”

NATO reinforces

In the latest sign that the war has reinvigorated NATO, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg announced it would send more reinforcements to guard against Russia expanding its campaign.

The leaders at Thursday’s summit will agree to “major increases of forces” including four new battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.

The allies will also offer “additional support” to Kyiv against nuclear and chemical threats, he said.

But NATO members, while maintaining a steady supply of anti-tank and short-range anti-aircraft missiles, have refused Zelensky’s demands for a no-fly zone over Ukraine or shipment of warplanes to the Ukrainian air force, fearing all-out war with nuclear-armed Russia.

Nearly a month into the invasion, peace talks have agreed on daily humanitarian corridors for refugees, and Ukraine says it is willing to countenance some Russian demands subject to a national referendum.

But it has refused to bow to demands to disarm and renounce its pro-Western ambitions.

Ukraine’s lead negotiator Mykhaylo Podolyak said the peace talks were encountering “significant difficulties.” Moscow accused the United States of undermining the process.

Tip of an iceberg

The World Health Organization warned on Wednesday that the humanitarian disaster in Ukraine was only getting worse.

“The problems we face so far… are really the tip of an iceberg of need,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said.

“And there’s going to have to be a further, massive scaling up of assistance within Ukraine in the coming weeks, because I have never, myself, seen such complex needs, and so quickly in a crisis that has developed so fast.”

“We have reached maybe, for once, an appropriate level of horror at what’s happening in Ukraine,” he said.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/on-one-month-anniversary-of-invasion-zelensky-urges-world-to-protest-russian-war/

Zelenskyy continued: ""This is only the beginning for Russia on the Ukrainian land, Russia is trying to defeat the true freedom of Europe, of the world.

""It tries to show that people don't matter, that's the reason we all must stop Russia.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for global protests to demand an end to the Russian invasion of his country, while also urging NATO to provide Kyiv with “effective and unrestricted” aid to end the bloody war.

Zelenskyy’s call for solidarity late on Wednesday came as the Russian invasion entered its second month and as NATO members and Western leaders prepared for a series of key summits in Brussels.

“Come from your offices, your homes, your schools and universities, come in the name of peace,” the Ukrainian leader said in an emotional video address that was recorded in the dark near the presidential offices in Kyiv. “Come with Ukrainian symbols to support Ukraine, to support freedom, to support life.

“Say that people matter. Freedom matters. Peace matters. Ukraine matters.”

When Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, many experts expected a swift toppling of Ukraine’s government. But with Wednesday marking four full weeks of fighting, Moscow appears bogged down in a grinding military campaign.

The month-long conflict has killed and wounded thousands of people and driven a quarter of Ukraine’s population of 44 million from their homes.

NATO estimates that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in four weeks, a figure that stands in stark contrast to the 15,000 soldiers Russia lost over 10 years in Afghanistan.

In its latest update on March 2, Moscow said nearly 500 soldiers had been killed and nearly 1,600 wounded.

Ukraine has also released little information about its own military losses, and the West has not given an estimate, but Zelenskyy said nearly two weeks ago that about 1,300 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed.

Ukraine also claims to have killed six Russian generals. Russia acknowledges one general having been killed.

The fighting has also laid large areas of some Ukrainian cities to waste, with satellite pictures from the US firm Maxar Technologies showing buildings in cities such as besieged Mariupol and Chernihiv on fire.

The mounting death toll and destruction of civilian buildings has prompted the United States and rights groups to accuse Russia of war crimes.

Zelenskyy, in his Wednesday address, said he expected “serious steps” from the NATO and Western leaders and appealed to Western countries to stay united in the face of Russia’s efforts to “lobby its interests” with “some partners” to bring them over to its side.

“We will see who is a friend, who is a partner and who has sold out and betrayed us,” he said. “Together we should not allow Russia to break anyone in NATO, the EU or G7, to break them and drag them to the side of war.”

He also noted that Ukraine has not received the fighter jets or modern air-defence systems it requested.

He appealed for more assistance, saying Ukraine also needs tanks and anti-ship systems.

“We ask that the alliance declare that it will fully assist Ukraine to win this war, clear our territory of the invaders and restore peace in Ukraine,” he said.

“It has been a month of defending ourselves from attempts to destroy us, wipe us off the face of the earth,” he added.

“We have lasted six times longer than the enemy had planned … but the Russian troops are destroying our cities, killing civilians indiscriminately, raping women, kidnapping children, shooting refugees, capturing aid columns, and looting.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/24/ukraines-zelenskyy-urges-global-protests-to-mark-1-month-of-war

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

India’s foreign exchange reserves fell by $9.64 billion to $622.275 billion during the week ending March 11, 2022, as the rupee depreciated against the US dollar amid the rise in crude oil prices and capital outflows due to sustained selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). This is the biggest fall in reserves in nearly two years after it plunged by $11.98 billion during the week ending March 20, 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit India and FPIs pulled out funds.

Putting severe pressure on the rupee, foreign investors withdrew Rs 41,617 crore in March. This outflow has come after withdrawals of Rs 45,720 crore in February and Rs 41,346 crore in January. With this, FPIs have pulled out Rs 225,649 crore (excluding FPI investments in IPOs) since October 1, 2021, mainly anticipating an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. Moreover, Brent crude prices soared to a near 14-year high of $140 as the Russia-Ukraine war intensified.
