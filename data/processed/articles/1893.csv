It covered eight tanks with fuel and there is a risk of it spreading to other tanks.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, accused Ukraine on Friday of bombing a ""gasoline depot"" in the city about 40 km from the border from two helicopters.

There are no victims or injuries as a result of the incident, however, due to a fire, the residents of the houses on three streets near the development are being resettled, says Tass.

The incident occurred when two Ukrainian Armed Forces helicopters entered Russian territory at low altitude and carried out two air strikes on Belgorod.

As a result of the strikes there was a fire at the Belgorodnefteprodukt JSC oil depot. Information about the fire at 90 Konstantin Zaslonov Street was received at 05:51 Moscow time. Fire was assigned the highest difficulty rank.

«they are burning eight tanks with fuel, each of which has a volume of 2 cubic meters,” the alert highlighted.

As a result of the bombing, it was also damaged one of the printing houses in the Belgorod region. The employees were evacuated, the director of the printing house Konstantin Lakhnov told TASS.

The missile hit the building next to the Rosenergouchet printing house, a branch of a Ukrainian company. The demining process will start later.

More than 194 people from the Ministry of Emergency Situations intervened in extinguishing the fire, the department's press service reported, who were joined by a fire train and 59 rescue teams.

Authorities fear the fire could spread to other tanks, an emergency services source told TASS. ""In total, there are 27 reservoirs on the territory of the company, 14 of them with a volume of 2 thousand cubic meters.""

Firefighters, using armored shields, cool tanks that are not affected by the fire.

The oil depot staff was evacuated. There were no casualties.

The Rospotrebnadzor laboratory did not reveal an excess of the maximum permissible concentration of harmful substances in the fire area.

The situation in Belgorod

Residents of houses on three streets near the company – Pochtovaya, Makarenko and Konstantin Zaslonov – are resettled because of the fire.

Evacuated residents are delivered to the Belgorod Arena. The first bus brought 19 people, including five children. They prepare hot drinks and dry rations. Some people decided to get to the Belgorod Arena sports complex on their own means of transport. Some of the residents went to visit relatives for a while.

Evacuated residents will be able to return home as soon as the Emergency Situations Ministry puts out the fire, Belgorod Mayor Anton Ivanov said.

Fuel situation in the region

According to the Tass report, queues formed at local gas stations. However, ""there are no problems with fuel in the Belgorod region and they are not expected: all suppliers are working as usual,"" the region's governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

Because of the fire, the authorities are dedicated to changing the logistics chains of fuel supply at gas stations. Rosneft distributes reserves from the base in Gubkin throughout the region.

The gasoline, taking into account the redistribution, will be enough for all the gas stations to work for a period of five to 13 days.

If necessary, the stations will be completely provided of gasoline from the Kursk and Voronezh regions, Russian Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov said.

According to AFP, the spokesman for the Russian presidency, Dmitri Peskov, warned that this event could affect the dialogue between Russia and Ukraine.

“It is clear that this cannot be considered as something that will create the appropriate conditions for the continuation of the negotiations,” the spokesman declared.

This is the first time, since the beginning of the conflict, that Russia denounces attacks of this type on its territory. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov has yet to comment on the matter.",https://en.ultimasnoticias.com.ve/news/world/Russian-oil-depot-fire-after-Ukrainian-attack/

In the videos from Belgorod, some 25 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border, two Mi-24 helicopters were seen flying low before firing missiles at the depot - a tactic designed to avoid Russian radars, honed through training from the UK and other Western countries.

Both Ukraine's foreign and defence ministries said they could neither confirm nor deny that Kyiv was behind the attack. ""I am a civilian,” Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister cryptically replied when asked on Friday.

It is the second time this week that Russian officials have accused Ukraine of attacking targets in Russia, prompting some Ukrainian officials to warn that it could be a ""false flag"" used by Moscow to justify reprisals.

But this is the first time Ukraine is alleged to have conducted a full-blown air strike in Russian territory and if true, could mark a major escalation in the war and highlight Kyiv’s growing confidence since resisting Moscow’s invasion in late February.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/04/01/ukrainian-helicopters-blow-fuel-depot-daring-dawn-raid-inside/
