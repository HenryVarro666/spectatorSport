BBC News Published 18 March

The burnt-up wreckage of a Russian tank lies in the dirt, while in an accompanying photo next to it, a Ukrainian soldier carries the armaments said to have caused the destruction.

The images posted to Twitter by the Ukrainian Armed Forces are labelled with a triumphant caption, declaring that this was the result of ""hits from Javelins on [Russian] military equipment"".

The Javelin, a shoulder-held anti-tank weapon that shoots heat-seeking rockets hurtling towards targets up to 4km (2.5 miles) away, can be controlled by a portable unit that doesn't look much different from a video game console - but can send a metre-long projectile straight through the side or top of an armoured tank.

The very presence of the American-made weapons ""causes panic"" among Russian troops, the Ukrainian military claims - and it is about to get 2,000 more of them.

Javelin missiles are among the items promised to Ukraine by the US in a new $800m (£608.3m) military assistance package announced by President Joe Biden on Wednesday.

Other armaments include drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky.

But will these shipments help Ukraine overcome Russia's more numerous - and better equipped - invasion force?

What will the US send to Ukraine?

The new US aid for Ukraine includes a wide range of military equipment, ranging from 25,000 sets each of body armour and helmets to rifles and grenade launchers, thousands of other anti-tank weapons and more than 20m rounds of ammunition.

Besides Javelin missiles, the most powerful weapons include 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, once famously used to shoot down Soviet planes in Afghanistan.

The US also plans to ship 100 ""tactical unmanned aerial systems"" - small drones - which are often hand-launched and small enough to fit into rucksacks.

Soldiers can use them to scope out the battlefield or, in some cases, to attack, essentially creating flying bombs that can be flown into targets from a distance.

Mr Biden's announcement on Wednesday brings the total amount of US military aid pledged for Ukraine to $1bn in the past week alone - a huge acceleration when compared to the $2.7bn provided between 2014 and the start of 2022.

It is a ""significant development"" and addresses previous shortfalls, according to John Herbst, a former US ambassador in Kyiv.

""There's no question that [Biden] and his team have been too timid in providing support for Ukraine,"" Mr Herbst said. ""And they have responded to that pressure.""

What will this mean against Russian ground and air offensives?

Military experts say that the US-supplied anti-tank weapons are likely to have the most impact in Ukraine.

The invading Russian forces ""are primarily mechanised forces"" - meaning armoured convoys - so ""the best thing you can do is take them [vehicles] out"", said former US Army Colonel Christopher Mayer.

Ukraine has received a variety of anti-tank systems from several countries, which helps increase the ""lethality"" of Ukraine's forces against Russian vehicles, Mr Mayer said.

""If you give them a variety of anti-tank systems, it provides them with multiple opportunities to punch through whatever particular defensive armour protection systems that tank has,"" he said.

And while their claims can't be independently verified, Ukrainian officials say they are putting the weapons to good effect. As of 16 March, they claim to have destroyed more than 400 tanks and over 2,000 other Russian vehicles.

Anti-tank weapons, however, do nothing to help Ukraine combat Russia's air force, which for three weeks has been striking targets across the country.

The man-portable, shoulder-fired Stinger system is the only anti-aircraft weapon included in the US aid package.

The system has been seen in conflicts around the world since 1981. It was most famously used in Afghanistan, where US-supplied Stingers helped bring down hundreds of Russian aircraft and helicopters during the Soviet occupation.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Ukrainian Ministry of Defence image of a Russian helicopter being shot down by its forces early in March.

It is effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft at up to about 3,800m (12,400ft), making it relatively useless against higher-flying Russian bombers.

Mr Herbst said that the administration's mention of Stingers as part of the aid package to Ukraine is a ""sign of weakness"".

""They do need more Stingers, there's no doubt about that,"" he said. ""But they need higher altitude anti-aircraft weapons as well…that's a serious omission.""

What has the US not sent?

While the White House has hinted that higher-altitude weapons - such as the Soviet-era S-300 anti-aircraft missile - might be headed to Ukraine via third countries, no formal announcement has been made.

Officials in Slovakia have expressed a willingness to send the systems to Ukraine, provided they receive replacements. Two other Nato allies - Greece and Bulgaria - also reportedly have the systems.

The US has also dismissed proposals to have Poland transfer its Mig-29 fighter jets to Ukraine to allow them to do more to contest the skies.

US officials have described the plan as not ""tenable"" due to the increased risk of open conflict between Nato and Russia.

Mr Mayer, however, said that the transfer of Mig-29 or similar jets by US allies - with the administration's blessing - would be an effective way of helping Ukraine fight for control of its skies.

He noted that the Soviet Union provided both aircraft and pilots to North Vietnam to operate against US aircraft without starting a wider confrontation.

What have other countries done?

The US isn't alone in providing military aid to Ukraine. At least 30 other countries have provided help, including €500m ($551m) from the European Union, a historic first.

After the US announced the new assistance package, however, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that ""more support"" was urgently needed.

""Even more than we get now,"" he said, calling for ""air defence systems, aircraft [and] enough lethal weapons and ammunition to stop the Russian occupiers"".

Mr Mayer said he believes that the US weapon supplies pledged to date are perhaps only enough to allow the Ukrainians to ""die heroically"".

""We must be more aggressive about giving them what we have,"" he said. ""We should at least give them the same quality, and quantity, of stuff as the Soviet Union gave to North Vietnam during our war with them.""

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Ukrainian soldiers unloading US-made Javelin anti-tank weapons just weeks before Russia's invasion on 24 February

Mr Herbst said that additional assistance packages will ""probably"" be needed in the future - and that they'll only be effective if they allow Ukraine to challenge Russia's air force.

""The key to me is whether or not we're sending something that hits Russian air assets at 30,000 feet or above,"" he said.

While no firm announcements have been made thus far, President Biden vowed that more help will be on the way - and that the US is working to help Ukraine acquire the longer-range air defence systems it needs, without providing details.",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60774098
1,5223c4f8-8c2c-4bf0-9d88-75a5463745ba,"['Eleanor Watson', 'Cbs News Reporter Covering The Pentagon.']",,"The U.S. has given more than $2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration, with about $1 billion last week alone, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made an impassioned plea for more from Congress, asking for more defensive assistance as his country struggles to fight off the Russian invasion.

There are some items Ukrainians want that the U.S. cannot provide, either because of a lack of inventory or the risk of provoking a wider war.

""No-Fly Zone""

Zelenskyy has asked the U.S. to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine to diminish the Russian bombardment continuing to devastate the country. A no-fly zone would require American forces to police the airspace over Ukraine, which would almost certainly lead to a direct conflict between the U.S. and Russia. President Biden has drawn a red line that no U.S. forces will fight in Ukraine.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on his trip to Europe this week said there is no such thing as a ""no-fly zone light."" If the U.S. sets up a no-fly zone, it means the U.S. is in a conflict with Russia, he said.

MiG-29 fighter jets

Absent a no-fly zone, the Ukrainians are seeking other avenues to help defend their skies, like fighter jets. Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly Soviet-era fighter jets, including the MiG-29 fighter jets. Some former Warsaw Pact countries, like Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria, have these jets in their inventories. The Polish government announced earlier this month it was willing to transfer its MiG-29s to the U.S. at Ramstein Airbase in Germany, where the U.S. could transfer the jets to Ukraine. But the Biden administration rejected this idea because flying aircraft from a U.S. base in Germany could be seen by Russia as an escalation of the conflict. Members of the U.S. Congress are still pushing for Ukraine to get MiG-29s somehow.

S-300 air defense system

The S-300 surface-to-air missile system is capable of shooting down aircraft and cruise missiles. It's a Russian-made air defense system, so the U.S. does not have any in its inventory. But there are NATO countries, including Slovakia, Greece and Bulgaria, that have these systems.

The minister of defense of Slovakia said this week that Slovakia would be willing to immediately give an S-300 system to the Ukrainians if it receives a backfill system from the U.S. or other NATO allies. The U.S. has said only that it has no announcements to make. Germany and the Netherlands have subsequently said they would lend a Patriot air-defense system to Slovakia to fill the gap left by the S-300.

Military assistance the U.S. is providing

Javelins

FILE: Javelin FGM-148 shoulder missile launcher U.S. Army

The U.S. has provided over 7,000 Javelin anti-tank systems to Ukraine, according to the White House. The hallmark of the Javelin is its ""top attack"" capability: the missile flies 150 meters into the air and then strikes the tank from the top, where the armor is the thinnest. The Javelin is a shoulder-mounted weapon forces are able to carry with them. This missile system is considered a ""fire and forget"" weapon because it uses infrared guidance to find the target as soon as it's fired so that the operator can move immediately after launching or can prepare to fire another one.

Stinger anti-aircraft systems

Stinger anti-aircraft weapon system U.S. Army

The Stinger is a portable surface-to-air missile system designed to go after aircraft. The Stinger missile's range can target planes and helicopters flying below 13,000 feet. Like the Javelin, the Stinger is a ""fire and forget"" system that uses an infrared guide to home in on a target. According to the White House, the U.S. has provided the Ukrainains with around 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems. The Stinger rose to fame in the 1980s, when the CIA provided the Mujahideen in Afghanistan with the weapon, giving them an effective means of targeting Soviet aircraft.

Tactical unmanned aerial systems

In its most recent announcement of aid to Ukraine, the Biden administration listed ""100 tactical unmanned aerial systems"" or drones. U.S. officials have told CBS News the specific drones are the Switchblade drones from AeroVironment. The drones are considered ""kamikaze drones"" because they explode after hitting the target. There are two versions, the Switchblade 300 which is designed to go after personnel, and the Switchblade 600 which goes after armored equipment like tanks.

Other U.S. assistance

In addition to the different systems above, the Biden administration in its most recent $800 million package of assistance is providing Ukraine with:

100 grenade launchers

5,000 rifles

1,000 pistols

400 machine guns

400 shotguns

Among that weaponry are US- and British-made anti-tank weapons, the Javelin and NLAW, respectively.

But Ukraine makes its own anti-tank missile, the Stugna-P, which has been used effectively against Russian armor.

Stugna-P: the Ukrainian anti-tank missile the Russians fear — Russian tanks are dying at the hands of another anti-armor system you may have yet to hear of.

The Stugna-P anti-tank guided missile packs a wallop and it is torturing Russian tanks. This is a home-grown Ukrainian weapon that the defenders have mastered. The laser-guided system has a long-range and ample penetration capability.

It provides an additional anti-tank option beyond the Javelin, NLAW, and AT-4. The use of the Stugna-P is so straightforward that even a former Ukrainian politician, now turned soldier, is firing it against the Russians.

Stunga-P: Soldiers can hide and use remote control

The Stugna-P, also known as the Skif, which is the export version, is produced by Kyiv-based Luch Design Bureau. The great thing about the Stugna-P is that it can be set up on a tripod and camouflaged. Then the operators can hide up to 164-feet away from the launcher.

It is fired by remote control from a module that looks like a laptop. The crew is safe-from counter-fire in their covered and concealed positions. After launch, Russian tanks never know what hit them.

A former legislator becomes a Stugna-P ace

The Stugna is so easy to use that a former Ukrainian Member of Parliament has put on an army uniform and become an anti-tank warrior with the weapon. 42-year-old Tetiana Chornovol became a lawmaker in 2014, then put her political career on hold to cover the Donbas border war as a journalist.

After the invasion, Chornovol had seen enough on the sidelines and wanted to be a soldier. The mother of two has been assigned as a Stugna operator in the Kyiv area of operations. You can see photos of her with the Stugna here.

Here's how she used the Stugna-P

Chornovol has seen combat with the Stugna-P. ""We saw tanks appearing and we literally ran to our position. I ran to my operator's case,"" she told a reporter in this video. ""I switch it on and see tanks on the screen. They just entered with the range of my missile. I took aim and destroyed the first tank … I shot it right at the fuel cells and the ammunition load was detonated. The tank literally flew off the road and now it is somewhere in the road ditch in the forest.""

It's all over the internet

The Stugna-P has been so successful that there are just too many videos of it knocking out Russian tanks on social media to fully list in this article. Here's one video that shows the trajectory of the missile flying straight then arcing upward to zoom down on top of the Russian tank.

Get them to the battlefield

The Stugna-P entered into service with the Ukrainian military in 2011. There are about 100 launchers in use and the Luch Design Bureau can't make them fast enough.

Long-range armor penetrator

The anti-tank weapon has a range from 328 feet to 3.1 miles. The flight time is a few seconds to 25 seconds, depending on the target's range. The missile's warhead can be a high-explosive anti-tank or high-explosive fragmentary round. It can penetrate through explosive-reactive armor.

Manually guide it or fire and forget

The launcher weighs 71 pounds and must be placed on a tripod. It has a thermal image camera with a television guidance unit. The control mechanism is in a laptop with a joystick that allows the soldier to guide the missiles manually or leave it in fire-and-forget mode and let the laser guidance mode do its damage.

If a Stugna-P can be fired by someone with no prior military experience, like a former politician, it shows how valuable this system is. Easy to understand and straightforward to use, the Stugna-P is a true force multiplier. Look for it to continue to ambush Russian tanks for the duration of the war.

3,5223c4f8-8c2c-4bf0-9d88-75a5463745ba,['Michael Jacobson'],2022-04-15 07:50:53+00:00,"While the Russian military is on the back foot in Ukraine, its shifting operations reveal severe shortcoming in Ukraine’s arsenal and capabilities — one that NATO member states could fix. Washington has recognized this and President Joe Biden has approved a new arms package for Ukraine that includes artillery and more sophisticated anti-air systems, including more sophisticated and heavier weapons and platforms than have been provided thus far. As a defense professional who has focused on artillery for most of his career, I am encouraged by this decision. These systems will allow Ukrainian forces to continue to press the fight against Russia’s military.

After failing in the first phase of the war, Russian forces seem intent on using artillery and air-delivered munitions to create a zone of destruction in the Donbas. While Ukraine has extensive Soviet-era field and air defense artillery, augmented by shoulder-launched capabilities from NATO member states, it lacks the logistical resilience and range necessary to stand toe-to-toe with Russia in this next phase of the war. The integration of air-defense artillery with surface-to-surface artillery would enable Ukrainian forces to take out the most effective remaining weaponry in Russia’s arsenal: artillery.

Destroying Russian artillery is the key to Ukrainian success in the next phase of the war. There are readily available artillery systems in NATO member and partner arsenals that would allow Ukraine to thwart Russian objectives. Some might be concerned that Ukraine will be unable to field and maintain such weapon systems, but these concerns should not be overstated. While supplying these weapons would require a short period of time for training and equipping, upgraded Ukrainian batteries and battalions could begin taking the field as early as May — if Western policymakers act with urgency, which they seem to be interested in doing.

A Shifting Campaign

Russian forces have all but withdrawn from areas in northern Ukraine. Russian ground offensives are concentrated in the south and east of Ukraine. The next phase of the war will likely be a war of attrition focused on the Donbas, with the possibility of Russia re-opening its front north of Kyiv. Withdrawing Russian forces have left a path of destruction in their wake. As Russia shifts its posture, it has conducted a relentless bombardment of built-up areas, most notably in Mariupol. Artillery is the weapon of choice in Russia’s campaign of destruction, which seems intended to denude areas of the basic infrastructure necessary to sustain a viable population. Artillery, precision aircraft strikes, and long-range missiles continue to target Ukrainian infrastructure.

Ukrainian forces have done an outstanding job denying air superiority to the Russian air force using man-portable air-defense systems provided by NATO. They have also succeeded in using Javelins to stop tanks in their tracks. However, Ukraine has no effective options to counter a prolonged Russian artillery offensive. This should trouble those who want to see Ukraine prevail as Russia can rely upon an extensive supply of artillery platforms and munitions that it will likely use to lay waste to large swaths of eastern Ukraine and thwart a Ukrainian counter-offensive to retake the country.

The State of Ukrainian Artillery and Air Defense

The Ukrainian army has made good use of its legacy equipment over the past eight years of combat in the Donbas and during the first seven weeks of the Russian invasion, but that equipment is largely destroyed, run-down, ineffective, or outdated. As the campaign goes on, this legacy equipment will continue to breakdown and be destroyed in combat. Logistics and maintenance for this equipment will become ever more difficult as Ukraine’s supply of lethal munitions for equipment on hand dries up. The Ukrainian army lacks sufficient counter rocket, artillery, and mortar capabilities, which is particularly critical in defending its own counter-fire radar systems. Perhaps the most effective capabilities the Ukrainians do have in their inventory are Russian air-defense systems. The S-300, gifted to Ukraine by Slovakia, is an effective long-range system, but even with outside help provided thus far, Ukraine does not have the right systems and missile magazine depth for this to be a viable long-term option.

Ukrainian artillery such as BM-21, 2S1, and D-30, as well as air-defense capabilities such as the SA-6 and the SA-13, stem primarily from lower-tech Soviet, domestic, or regional production. Ukraine does not have the latest technology in self-propelled howitzers. While older systems are useful for imprecise area fires, the latest NATO systems and their munitions are faster, more lethal, and more survivable. They would allow Ukraine to do things it cannot currently do well: quickly determine locations of enemy artillery and target them with counter-battery fire, and destroy tanks and other armored vehicles with artillery, rather than only with anti-tank guided missiles and other tanks.

Further, these newer artillery systems are fully digitized and integrated with precision equipment based on internal, gyroscopic, self-locating devices supplemented by GPS updating. They also have modular components that can be swapped out, thus simplifying repairs. This is important because Ukraine currently lacks the ability to produce munitions and repair parts, especially as Russian forces bombard Ukrainian industrial facilities. Most newer systems require a relatively brief period of training on individual weapon systems and munitions. They are easy to use and employ for artillerymen already trained in basic field craft.

More Western Kit for Ukraine

As Russia reconstitutes its combat-ineffective maneuver units, most of its artillery units remain operational and in the fight. Russian artillery is engaging hundreds of targets a day in the Donbas and more than a thousand long-range missiles have been fired over the course of the campaign.

What specific systems should be considered for provision to Ukraine?

Sweden produces the Archer, a wheeled self-propelled howitzer with a range of 30 kilometers. The system is in production and a battalion’s worth of guns (12 to 18) could probably be provided immediately. It has on-board fire control computation, auto-loading and resupply, and requires only a three-man crew. France produces a similar howitzer, the CAESAR II. This is an extremely capable, wheeled, self-propelled, 155-milimeter howitzer that can integrate with NATO command and control systems.

These two howitzer systems are arguably the best in the world today. They are fully digitized and boast fully automated unmanned cannon turrets, power-assisted resupply systems, and onboard fire-solution computation systems. That means they can quickly receive and integrate all the data needed for counter-battery fire. These individual howitzers can fire a platoon’s worth of projectiles in a single fire mission and then drive to another location less than five minutes later to avoid Russian counter-battery fire. Both of these systems can fire the latest sensor-fuzed munitions, meaning each projectile can kill a vehicle that might be a tank, a self-propelled howitzer, and enemy radar system, or a logistics vehicle. In artillery, the ability to shoot, move, and shoot again is key to survivability. Both systems are highly mobile wheeled systems built on common truck chassis from Volvo and Tatra that can move quickly across road systems and have sufficient range to reach equivalent Russian cannon artillery systems from relative safety behind the forward line of troops. They are equipped with auto-loader systems and emplacement/displacement times measured in a handful of minutes. That gives them high rates of fires that enable them to do something called “multiple rounds, simultaneous impact” — one howitzer can have three to six rounds it fires land on a target area at the same time.

The U.S.-produced High Mobility Artillery Rocket System is also one of the best in the world. In addition to being highly mobile and digitized like the Archer and CAESAR, it can fire the full suite of sophisticated Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System rockets and eventually the long-range Precision Strike Missile, when it comes online. This system and the associated rockets and missiles require minimal train-up for basic artillerymen to employ. To complete the Ukrainian artillery kill-chain, the United States currently produces a long-range, highly accurate, counter-fire radar, the Q-53, which the Ukrainian army is already somewhat familiar with.

Outfitting with NATO howitzers and rocket launchers provides Ukrainian forces with the ability to employ NATO projectiles, rockets, and missiles, which include the best in sensor-fused weapons (such as the German SMArt155mm and the Swedish BONUS), GPS-guided precision rockets, and high-yield precision missiles. Integrating multi-mission radars and the counter-battery Q-53 radar would allow Ukrainian forces to identify Russian artillery systems, defeat incoming rounds by blasting them out of the sky using NATO or Russian counter-rocket systems, and provide counter-battery fire using sensor-fused munitions and area effects rockets to decimate Russian artillery forces. Finally, the United States should consider providing Ukraine with the Patriot Air Defense system to complete an integrated air-defense complex.

How to Set Ukraine Up for Cannon-Fed Success

The United States and its allies should also support Ukraine’s artillery arsenal with the necessary doctrine, materiel, and training, as well as logistical support in terms of maintenance and supply. Those NATO countries that produce many of the artillery systems have the industrial base to continue to supply repair parts and munitions for the foreseeable future. The United States and its NATO allies often use contracted logistics support as a stop-gap measure. This essentially involves personnel from Western defense firms going into theater, including forward positions in a conflict zone, in order to perform important maintenance and logistics activities for newly fielded weapons systems. Due to recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there are many professionals and technicians from Western defense companies who have experience working in war zones. While this happens, Ukrainian military personnel can train and become familiar with the new equipment both at forward locations and in the rear. For major repairs and overhauls, the systems would be transported back to neighboring NATO countries.

Adapting and integrating NATO techniques and systems will enable the Ukrainian army to benefit from speed and data already enjoyed by its NATO partners. Training on many of the tactical systems can be completed in as little as a month since many of the fire-control complexities are accomplished by onboard computers. Training on sustaining and repairing these complex systems will take longer but can be supplemented by contracted logistics support while sustainers are in training. Fielding NATO-developed and integrated equipment will enable NATO member states to aid with targeting and battle-damage assessments from outside the combat zone. The secure nature of much of the NATO equipment will also stymie Russian efforts to gather intelligence on Ukrainian tactical activity.

As time goes on, individual NATO countries have begun considerations to supply various advanced western weapon systems on their own. Rumors have been circulating that Slovakia is considering sending Zuzana II howitzers, while the German arms consortium Krauss-Maffei Wegmann has flown trial balloons regarding the Panzerhaubitze 2000. Both systems represent advances over current Ukrainian systems, but the initiatives are disjointed and don’t take into account the important aspect of counter-battery radar, digital input to firing data, and the lethal munitions associated with the platforms.

The Artillery Fight is Here

Much has been written and said in recent weeks about the need to field weapons to the Ukrainians that can be immediately employed to stop the Russian offensive. That was wise counsel and has achieved its ends. Those weapons should continue to flow. The argument that more sophisticated weapons aren’t viable because of the associated training and follow-on logistics support simply isn’t correct given where Ukraine now finds itself in the fight. As the war settles in for a longer-term artillery duel, more appropriate and sustainable weapons systems should be brought to bear. The training to use those systems is not overly complex and can be accomplished in neighboring NATO countries in relatively brief periods of time. The maintenance and other tasks above the operator level can be performed by contracted logistics support in the operational environment as well as in neighboring countries for depot-level maintenance. Most importantly, the precision, lethality, and efficiency to be successful against Russian artillery systems is best provided by the more sophisticated capabilities available from NATO. Just as NATO has provided sophisticated systems — such as the Javelin, the Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon, Stinger, Starstreak, and Panzerfaust 3 — NATO should provide similar levels of sophistication for Ukraine to succeed in this next phase and mitigate the human suffering there as much as possible.

Now is the time to transition to NATO artillery and air-defense systems before Ukraine loses the momentum it has gained.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The burnt-up wreckage of a Russian tank lies in the dirt, while in an accompanying photo next to it, a Ukrainian soldier carries the armaments said to have caused the destruction.

The images posted to Twitter by the Ukrainian Armed Forces are labelled with a triumphant caption, declaring that this was the result of ""hits from Javelins on [Russian] military equipment"".

The Javelin, a shoulder-held anti-tank weapon that shoots heat-seeking rockets hurtling towards targets up to 4km (2.5 miles) away, can be controlled by a portable unit that doesn't look much different from a video game console - but can send a metre-long projectile straight through the side or top of an armoured tank.

The very presence of the American-made weapons ""causes panic"" among Russian troops, the Ukrainian military claims - and it is about to get 2,000 more of them.

Javelin missiles are among the items promised to Ukraine by the US in a new $800m (£608.3m) military assistance package announced by President Joe Biden on Wednesday.

Other armaments include drones that can be turned into flying bombs and anti-aircraft weapons that can shoot helicopters from the sky.

But will these shipments help Ukraine overcome Russia's more numerous - and better equipped - invasion force?

What will the US send to Ukraine?

The new US aid for Ukraine includes a wide range of military equipment, ranging from 25,000 sets each of body armour and helmets to rifles and grenade launchers, thousands of other anti-tank weapons and more than 20m rounds of ammunition.

Besides Javelin missiles, the most powerful weapons include 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, once famously used to shoot down Soviet planes in Afghanistan.

The US also plans to ship 100 ""tactical unmanned aerial systems"" - small drones - which are often hand-launched and small enough to fit into rucksacks.

Soldiers can use them to scope out the battlefield or, in some cases, to attack, essentially creating flying bombs that can be flown into targets from a distance.

Mr Biden's announcement on Wednesday brings the total amount of US military aid pledged for Ukraine to $1bn in the past week alone - a huge acceleration when compared to the $2.7bn provided between 2014 and the start of 2022.

It is a ""significant development"" and addresses previous shortfalls, according to John Herbst, a former US ambassador in Kyiv.

""There's no question that [Biden] and his team have been too timid in providing support for Ukraine,"" Mr Herbst said. ""And they have responded to that pressure.""

What will this mean against Russian ground and air offensives?

Military experts say that the US-supplied anti-tank weapons are likely to have the most impact in Ukraine.

The invading Russian forces ""are primarily mechanised forces"" - meaning armoured convoys - so ""the best thing you can do is take them [vehicles] out"", said former US Army Colonel Christopher Mayer.

Ukraine has received a variety of anti-tank systems from several countries, which helps increase the ""lethality"" of Ukraine's forces against Russian vehicles, Mr Mayer said.

""If you give them a variety of anti-tank systems, it provides them with multiple opportunities to punch through whatever particular defensive armour protection systems that tank has,"" he said.

And while their claims can't be independently verified, Ukrainian officials say they are putting the weapons to good effect. As of 16 March, they claim to have destroyed more than 400 tanks and over 2,000 other Russian vehicles.

Anti-tank weapons, however, do nothing to help Ukraine combat Russia's air force, which for three weeks has been striking targets across the country.

The man-portable, shoulder-fired Stinger system is the only anti-aircraft weapon included in the US aid package.

The system has been seen in conflicts around the world since 1981. It was most famously used in Afghanistan, where US-supplied Stingers helped bring down hundreds of Russian aircraft and helicopters during the Soviet occupation.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Ukrainian Ministry of Defence image of a Russian helicopter being shot down by its forces early in March.

It is effective against low-flying helicopters or aircraft at up to about 3,800m (12,400ft), making it relatively useless against higher-flying Russian bombers.

Mr Herbst said that the administration's mention of Stingers as part of the aid package to Ukraine is a ""sign of weakness"".

""They do need more Stingers, there's no doubt about that,"" he said. ""But they need higher altitude anti-aircraft weapons as well…that's a serious omission.""

What has the US not sent?

While the White House has hinted that higher-altitude weapons - such as the Soviet-era S-300 anti-aircraft missile - might be headed to Ukraine via third countries, no formal announcement has been made.

Officials in Slovakia have expressed a willingness to send the systems to Ukraine, provided they receive replacements. Two other Nato allies - Greece and Bulgaria - also reportedly have the systems.

The US has also dismissed proposals to have Poland transfer its Mig-29 fighter jets to Ukraine to allow them to do more to contest the skies.

US officials have described the plan as not ""tenable"" due to the increased risk of open conflict between Nato and Russia.

Mr Mayer, however, said that the transfer of Mig-29 or similar jets by US allies - with the administration's blessing - would be an effective way of helping Ukraine fight for control of its skies.

He noted that the Soviet Union provided both aircraft and pilots to North Vietnam to operate against US aircraft without starting a wider confrontation.

What have other countries done?

The US isn't alone in providing military aid to Ukraine. At least 30 other countries have provided help, including €500m ($551m) from the European Union, a historic first.

After the US announced the new assistance package, however, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that ""more support"" was urgently needed.

""Even more than we get now,"" he said, calling for ""air defence systems, aircraft [and] enough lethal weapons and ammunition to stop the Russian occupiers"".

Mr Mayer said he believes that the US weapon supplies pledged to date are perhaps only enough to allow the Ukrainians to ""die heroically"".

""We must be more aggressive about giving them what we have,"" he said. ""We should at least give them the same quality, and quantity, of stuff as the Soviet Union gave to North Vietnam during our war with them.""

Mr Herbst said that additional assistance packages will ""probably"" be needed in the future - and that they'll only be effective if they allow Ukraine to challenge Russia's air force.

""The key to me is whether or not we're sending something that hits Russian air assets at 30,000 feet or above,"" he said.

President Biden approved another massive weapons package for Ukraine on Wednesday. That brings the total amount of U.S. assistance to Ukraine's military to more than a billion dollars since Russia invaded three weeks ago.

This latest round of aid will consist of direct transfers of equipment from the U.S. Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military, in an effort to help it ramp up security measures.

The Biden administration says the $800 million package includes 800 anti-aircraft systems, 9,000 shoulder-mounted anti-armor missile systems to destroy tanks, 7,000 small arms, including guns and grenade launchers, 20 million rounds of ammunition and drones.

Even more notable than the cost of the package is the kind of weapons it provides. Here's what they reveal about the state of the conflict and where it might be headed.

What's in the package?

Three key items are all considered very urgent.

The package provides for more Javelin missiles, which have been very effective against Russian tanks so far — perhaps the single most potent weapon that Ukraine has had.

It also includes Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which Ukraine is already using against low-flying Russian planes and helicopters.

And it introduces 100 drones, which will reportedly be so small that soldiers can carry them in their backpacks before taking them out to deploy. They're formally known as Switchblades, but are often called ""Kamikaze drones"" because they explode upon hitting their target.

How do these weapons compare with Russia's?

The drones wouldn't completely close the gap between the Russians' manned aircraft. They have a small explosive charge — nothing on the scale of a fighter jet with huge, powerful bombs.

But they should enable Ukrainians to carry out additional attacks on Russian forces from the sky. As a senior U.S. defense official put it, they are intended to ""deliver a punch.""

And while Ukraine can't match Russia tank for tank, small units or even individuals are well-equipped to ambush Russian forces.

The common thread here is Ukrainians are relying on very agile, nimble, portable systems whereas Russian forces are using larger, more powerful and somewhat lumbering weapons systems.

Has there been movement towards the no-fly zone Ukraine has been calling for?

Ukrainian officials are still calling on Western leaders to implement a no-fly zone over its skies and provide them with MiG fighter jets, though neither is likely to happen.

World Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine says no-fly zone has to be on the table Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine says no-fly zone has to be on the table Listen · 7:13 7:13

The jets are a small number of older planes that belong to Poland, and U.S. officials have said they don't think they will make a big difference when it comes to air power.

And the U.S. remains very much opposed to a no-fly zone. The first step in creating one would be to attack the Russian air defense system on the ground or take out Russian planes in the sky. That would entail almost-certain combat with Russia, which Biden says is not going to happen.

Where could the conflict be headed next?

More battles are expected for Kyiv and other big Ukrainian cities, with each side likely to fight in very different ways.

U.S. military officials say the Russians have been flying an average of about 200 sorties — or aircraft missions — a day, compared to just five or 10 by the Ukrainians. This reflects both the larger and more advanced Russian air force, as well as the Russian air defense systems that can take down Ukrainian planes and pilots.

Russian forces are basically stalled outside the cities, unleashing intense shelling in an effort to encircle them and pound Ukrainians into submission.

Ukrainians can't stop these artillery attacks, but can prevent large Russian armored columns from entering their cities — and the weapons the U.S. is providing are designed to help them do exactly that.

By Paul LeBlanc, CNN

(CNN) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has implored Western allies to providehis country with military aid as Russia continues its unprovoked invasion.

""We need you right now,"" Zelensky told US members of Congress in one of his latest pleas for assistance before a friendly government.

The US and other NATO member nations have fulfilled a number of Zelensky's requests, while stopping short of certain measures they say could risk an escalation in the war.





Weapons assistance





The military aid provided to Ukraine so far includes weapons that range from portable drones to complex, long-range missile systems.

Switchblade drones. Small, portable, so-called kamikaze drones that carry warheads and detonate on impact. The smallest model can hit a target up to six miles away, according to the company that produces the drones, AeroVironment. It's unclear which size model the US will send to Ukraine.

Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. These heat-seeking, anti-aircraft missiles have a range of about five miles and 11,000 feet. Critically, Stinger missiles can distinguish between enemy and friendly aircraft.

Javelin anti-tank weapons. This guided missile system can be shoulder-fired by a single solider and has a range of up to 8,200 feet.

AT-4 anti-armor systems. These Swedish anti-armor weapons are ""lightweight, single-shot and fully disposable,"" according to the company that produces them, Saab Bofors Dynamics.

Patriot air defense missile system. The US also delivered two missile defense systems to Poland this month intended to deter Russia and boost Poland's security amid Western concerns that the Ukraine conflict could spill into NATO-aligned nations.

The Patriot air defense missile system -- Patriot stands for ""Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept of Target"" -- is designed to counter and destroy incoming short-range ballistic missiles, advanced aircraft and cruise missiles.

The battery includes missiles and launching stations, a radar set that detects and tracks targets, and an engagement control station, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance.





Other actions





Beyond military aid to Ukraine, the US and its NATO allies have issued a slew of sanctions against Russia.

Putin. The United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada have announced they would introduce sanctions targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

SWIFT. The US, EU, UK and Canada have banned certain Russian banks from SWIFT, the high-security network that facilitates payments among 11,000 financial institutions in 200 countries.

'Most favored nation' status. The House of Representatives has passed a bill to suspend normal trade relations with Russia. The final vote was 424-8 with strong bipartisan support for the legislation, which next heads to the Senate.

Energy and oil. EU officials said the bloc would slash imports of Russian natural gas by two-thirds this year, and the EU announced a plan to achieve energy independence from Moscow ""well before 2030."" That would separate Europe from its single biggest energy supplier.

Separately, President Joe Biden announced a ban on Russian oil, natural gas and coal imports to the United States. And the UK government said Tuesday it would phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 and explore ways of ending natural gas imports as well.

Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Germany has halted certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline following Moscow's actions.





Unfulfilled Ukrainian requests





As Russia's deadly invasion has continued, Zelensky has requested some actions that Western allies fear would put them in direct conflict with the Kremlin and escalate the war.

No-fly zone. Zelensky has repeatedly called on Ukraine's allies to establish a no-fly zone over the country. A no-fly zone is an area where certain aircraft cannot fly for any number of reasons. In the context of a conflict such as the one in Ukraine, it would probably mean a zone in which Russian planes were not allowed to fly, to prevent them from carrying out airstrikes against Ukraine.

The problem with military no-fly zones is that they have to be enforced by a military power. If a Russian aircraft flew into a NATO no-fly zone, then NATO forces would have to take action against that aircraft. Those measures could include shooting the plane from the sky. That would, in Russia's eyes, be an act of war by NATO and would likely escalate the conflict.

S-300 missile defense systems. This surface-to-air missile system can strike targets that are both higher in altitude and farther away than Stinger missiles are designed for.

Slovakia has preliminarily agreed to provide Ukraine with a key Soviet-era air defense system to help defend against Russian airstrikes, according to three sources familiar with the matter. But the US and NATO are still grappling with how to backfill that country's own defensive capabilities, and the transfer is not yet assured.

MiG fighter jets. Earlier this month, the US dismissed a proposal from Poland to transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to the United States for delivery to Ukraine.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the US did not believe Poland's proposal was ""tenable"" and that it was too risky.

""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby said.

The west’s military assistance to Ukraine began cautiously with helmets and flak jackets but now includes drones that can destroy Russian tanks and artillery from 50 miles away.

The west has repeatedly refused to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine but is now supplying a range of powerful weapons. They include:

Bayraktar TB2 drones

These Turkish-made drones featured prominently in videos at the start of the invasion. They showed a number of successful attacks against Russian tanks and armoured vehicles. They have since became less effective after Russia set up air defences in the battlefield. Turkey began selling the TB2 drones to Ukraine in 2019. Turkish officials have refused to disclose how many, but independent estimates reckon Ukraine has up to 50 TB2s.

Aaron Stein, director of research at the US Foreign Policy Research Institute, described them as the “Toyota Corolla of drones”. He said: “It doesn’t do everything that your high-end sports car does, but it does 80% of that. So even for a high-end military, like the US the basic concept of using in an attritable, cheap platform to strike a superior force has inherent value.”

Switchblade drones

Biden’s “unprecedented assistance” includes 100 drones, which officials have said are the Switchblade or “kamikaze drone” that explode on impact. Each drone is folded into a lightweight mortar launcher. Once it is fired the drone’s wings open out as the weapon is guided to its target. The most powerful version travels at 115mph and has a range of 50 miles. A lighter version has a range of six miles.

Stinger missiles

The latest US package includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems in addition to more than 600 already promised. The FIM-92 Stinger is a “man-portable air-defence system” – or Manpads – that is typically used by ground troops but can also be used from helicopters. This type of weapon was seen as crucial to the mujahideen’s successful guerrilla conflict in the Soviet-Afghan war in the 1980s. Germany has also pledged to send 500 Stinger missiles.

Javelin missiles

The Javelin is an anti-tank missile system that uses thermal imaging to find its target. The latest US package includes 2,000 of these missiles. They can be fired from a shoulder launcher or from the ground.

Portable anti-tank weapons

The White House says it is sending 6,000 AT4 portable anti-tank weapons as part of the package outlined by Biden. The Swedish-made 84mm-calibre weapon has a range of 500 metres. It requires little training to use, but is single-shot so it has be discarded after it is fired. Thousands more anti-tank weapons are being supplied by European countries. These include Germany, which has pledged 1,000 anti-tank weapons from its inventory; Norway with 2,000; and Sweden, which has delivered 5,000.

The UK has sent 3,615 of these British-Swedish-made short-range next generation light anti-tank weapons – or NLAW missiles. Hundreds more are also expected to be sent at a cost of £120m. The missiles weigh only 12.5kg and are just over 1 metre long, making them easy for infantry to use. They have a maximum range of just 800 metres. The US has also pledged 1,000 light anti-armour weapons.

The UK’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, has also promised to supply an unspecified number of high-velocity Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine. The Belfast-made weapons are known to be the fastest short-range surface-to-air missile. They accelerate after launch and include three laser-guided submunitions to increase the chance of hitting their targets.

US President Joe Biden has earmarked an additional $800m in military equipment that will be directly transferred to Ukraine.

The announcement on Wednesday came the same day Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed to the US Congress for more security aid to repel the Russian invasion, which has killed at least 1,834 civilians since it began on February 24.

The package includes a surge in US-provided anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons, as well as drones. The aid demonstrates Washington’s “commitment to sending our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defence”, Biden said.

He later told a reporter he thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin is a “war criminal”, although White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki later said Biden was “speaking from his heart”, and the State Department was still in the process of determining if Putin has indeed committed war crimes.

The latest pledge does not include any reference to fighter jets that Zelenskyy has called for during the ongoing Russian attacks. The United States and other NATO allies have so far resisted Zelenskyy’s appeal to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine over fears it would lead to a larger confrontation between the bloc and Russia.

The White House also said Washington is “helping the Ukrainians acquire additional, longer-range” air-defence systems, but did not provide further details.

The most recent package brings the total US security aid to Ukraine announced since the Russian invasion began to $1bn. The Biden administration previously approved another $1bn in aid before the invasion began.

What’s in the latest package?

The Pentagon will send 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems in the latest round of security aid. The systems can be used to defend against helicopters and low-flying aircraft using infrared sensors to find a target.

The package will also include thousands of anti-tank weapons, including 2,000 Javelin systems, a shoulder-mounted weapon that is guided by a computer for deadly accuracy.

The US will also transfer 100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems, or drones, as well as an array of lighter weapons – 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 shotguns – and additional body armour, helmets and ammunition.

What has the US previously given Ukraine?

Washington previously provided Ukraine with more than 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems and about 2,600 Javelin weapons.

In addition, the Pentagon gave Ukraine five Mi-17 helicopters, three patrol boats, an array of smaller arms, and several radar systems to track artillery, mortar, and drone attacks.

At least 30 countries have upped military assistance to Ukraine since the Russian attack, including Germany, which reversed a longstanding policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/17/whats-in-the-new-us-military-aid-package-to-ukraine
10,5223c4f8-8c2c-4bf0-9d88-75a5463745ba,[],,"WASHINGTON — The US will send an additional $800 million in military aid to Ukraine after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded for Washington’s further help in staving off the Russian invasion in an address to a joint session of Congress.

The latest installment came days after US President Joe Biden transferred another $200 million in weapons to Kyiv. He has sent a total of $2 billion in arms since taking office.

The newest batch includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, thousands of anti-tank weapons including 2,000 of the now-famously deadly Javelins, 100 “tactical” drones, 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition, and 25,000 sets of helmets and body armor.

Ukraine has already been given hundreds of Stingers, which can shoot down relatively low flying aircraft.

But Biden said that “at the request of President Zelensky, we have identified and are helping Ukraine acquire additional longer-range anti-aircraft systems.”

A US military source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the weapons system under discussion was the S-300, a sophisticated missile that is of Russian design, but owned by some European NATO members and seen as easy to integrate into Ukraine’s military.

The drones mentioned by Biden are a US weapon called Switchblade, which has the ability to loiter over a target, before plunging down like a bomb, the military source said.

On Thursday, Zelensky’s senior adviser Andriy Yermak offered his gratitude, tweeting that Biden has done more for Ukraine “than any of his predecessors.”

The announcement by Biden came after Zelensky’s Wednesday virtual address to Congress. Lawmakers gave him a standing ovation, before and after his short remarks, which the president began in Ukrainian through an interpreter, but then switched to English in a heartfelt appeal to help end the bloodshed.

“I see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths,” he told them.

The president opened his speech by invoking painful moments in US history to reflect his country’s current struggle against Russia.

“Remember Pearl Harbor, the terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” he said, recalling the Japanese air raid that brought the US into World War II.

“Remember September the 11th, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities, independent territories, into battlefields. Our country experienced the same every day,” he said.

After quoting Martin Luther King’s famous “I have a dream” speech, he said: “I have a need, the need to protect our sky. I need your decision, your help.”

“Is this too much to ask, to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine?” he asked, answering his own question. “If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative,” calling for weapons systems that would help fight Russian aircraft.

Among the weapons the Biden administration has already sent Ukraine are more than 600 Stinger missiles, 2,600 Javelin anti-armor systems, unmanned aerial system tracking radars, grenade launchers, 200 shotguns, 200 machine guns, and nearly 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition, along with helicopters, patrol boats, satellite imagery and body armor, helmets, and other tactical gear.

However, the US has stopped short of Zelensky’s plea for a no-fly zone to be imposed over Ukraine — a measure that analysts say could lead to a full-out war between Russia and the countries initiating such a move. The EU and NATO have also rejected Zelensky’s demand.

Congress has already approved $13.6 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, and the newly announced security aid will come from that allotment, which is part of a broader bill that Biden signed into law Tuesday.

While a number of lawmakers have spoken out in favor of a no-fly zone, they currently make up a very small minority in Washington.

Biden has insisted there will be no US troops on the ground in Ukraine and has resisted Zelensky’s relentless pleas for warplanes as too risky, potentially escalating into a direct confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-adds-800m-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-including-drones-anti-tank-weapons/
