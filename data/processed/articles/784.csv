It has had a successful campaign thus far, destroying Russian convoys comprised of armored vehicles, towered artillery, and of course, Russian troops.

It seems that these drones have exposed a large gap in Russian air defenses in Ukraine, leaving their ground troops and convoys vulnerable to airstrikes by the Ukrainian Air Force and the Bayraktar. The Bayraktar has had a notable following as several videos of it absolutely obliterating Russian vehicles have popped up.

So far, Ukraine has found an answer to almost everything Russia throws at it. Russian tanks and their makeshift anti-missile cages were not a match for Ukraine‚Äôs St. Javelin (and NLAWs) and soon Panzerfaust IIIs from Germany. Now, these Turkish armed drones are proving highly effective against Russian armored vehicles, making it a superb morale-booster for Ukrainian forces with its tactical success.

According to Oryx and its head Stijn Mitzer who specializes in tracking destroyed weapons in the Russo-Ukrainian war, the Bayraktar TB2 has destroyed the following vehicles and systems:

1 unknown Armored Fighting Vehicle

1 unknown communication station

5 152mm 2A65 Msta-B howitzers, with one damaged then subsequently captured by Ukrainian forces.

1 9A310M1 TELAR for Buk-M1-2 Surface-To-Air Missile System, two more damaged

1 9A39M1 TEL for Buk-M1-2 Surface-To-Air Missile System

2 9A310M2 TELAR for Buk-M2 Surface-To-Air Missile Systems

1 9A39M2 TEL for Buk-M2 Surface-To-Air Missile System

1 9A331M TLAR for 9K332 Tor-M2 Surface-To-Air Missile System

2 fuel logistic trains

2 Unknown trucks

2 Ural-4320 trucks

5 KamAZ 6√ó6

4 KamAZ-6350 8√ó8 artillery tractor

8 Unknown supply trucks

These drones are changing the way modern conflicts are being fought, with some capability to evade or avoid detection by modern surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and destroy them without retaliation. Take, for example, the Russian Buk-M1-2 Air Defense Missile System, a fairly effective and reliable mobile, radar-guided SAM system that has been deployed to Ukraine and has a reported cost of $120 million per battalion. Now, compare that with the Turkish Bayraktar TB2, which has a unit cost between $1 million to $2 million. We‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a fairly cost-effective way of eliminating your enemies without endangering your own soldiers. Talk about a cheap counter to one of Russia‚Äôs best SAM systems!

Although these drones have been highly effective, they are also highly vulnerable to more advanced SAMs, fighter jets, and helicopters. However, Russia‚Äôs failure to secure the Ukrainian air space has severely hampered their hunt for the drones, which has done considerable damage to its ground forces. Military observers and veterans alike would know that an invasion would typically involve paralyzing the opposing country‚Äôs air and missile defenses so that its air forces can come in and dominate the skies, providing ground troops with close air support to operate safely and limit casualties. Russia has indeed weakened Ukraine‚Äôs air defense systems to some extent, but this has been offset by the Russians dropping unguided bombs at low altitudes which has lost them aircraft to Stinger missiles, AAA guns and other air defense systems. Ukraine is claiming that it has downed some 49 Russian aircraft, 81 helicopters, and 7 UAVs.

However, this isn‚Äôt the first time that the drone has shined through times of war. It‚Äôs seen action in Turkey, Libya, and Syria, most notably for the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which helped lift Azerbaijan to victory where the Bayraktar showed its versatility. It was able to fight off and destroy old and obsolete Soviet air defense systems such as the 2K11 Krug, 9K33 Osa, 2K12 Kub, and 9K35 Strela-10 ‚Äî all of which could not destroy the drone as the TB2 flew too high. According to Oryx, the Azerbaijani Bayraktar TB2 UCAVs destroyed over 90 T-72 tanks, 22 surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, 60 multiple rocket launchers, and 186 vehicles. No doubt that the TB2 heavily played a vital role in the Azerbaijani win. Perhaps more impressive, the drone did not have to cross into Nagorno-Karabakh air space to successfully eliminate targets and was reportedly in friendly territory when it was in service.

Currently, Ukraine has reportedly received a new shipment of these Bayraktar TB2 armed drones, as revealed by Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov last week. Before the invasion, Ukraine reportedly received 6 TB2s from Turkey, with the total number of units amounting to some 20 drones.

‚ÄúThe amount of aid we receive is increasing. The number of countries providing this aid is increasing,‚Äù he reported. ‚ÄúNew Bayraktars have already arrived in Ukraine and are on combat duty. There will be more Stingers and Javelins. Europe is becoming our rear and supplying everything we need for defense. We are on the front line of the free world,‚Äù he stated. Defense intelligence firm Janes recently found that Turkey had delivered additional Baykar Bayraktar TB2 to Ukraine after rumors of a Turkish Air Force Airbus A400M transport aircraft was tracked, seemingly flying from Ankara to Poland last March 1.

The Biden administration, under pressure to expand the arsenal of weapons that Ukraine has in its conflict with Russia, is working with European allies to expedite more sophisticated air-defense systems and other armaments into the war zone, U.S. officials said Friday. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Discussions were ongoing ahead of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin‚Äôs planned trip next week to meet with NATO allies in Brussels and Slovakia, which along with Poland and Romania has indicated a willingness to transfer military aid to its embattled neighbor. Slovakia also possesses the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, which is used to shoot down enemy aircraft and is familiar to the Ukrainians.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the United States is committed to arming the government in Kyiv with ‚Äúthe kinds of capabilities that we know the Ukrainians need and are using very well.‚Äù He declined to specify what types of weapons could be included in the next wave of shipments.

Advertisement

‚ÄúSome of that material we have and are providing. Some of that material we don‚Äôt have but we know others have, and we‚Äôre helping coordinate that as well,‚Äù Kirby said.

The administration is facing backlash over its decision earlier this week to scuttle Poland‚Äôs proposal that would have sent a number of its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via a transfer ‚Äúfree of charge‚Äù to the United States. Washington, citing concerns that Russia would view the move as a provocation, said the offer from Warsaw was not ‚Äútenable.‚Äù

Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded for the MiG-29 transfer. And while they have support from a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, the Biden administration, citing assessments from senior American military commanders in Europe, has said the additional aircraft would offer only minimal value to Ukraine given the contested nature of its airspace.

‚ÄúWe believe the most effective way to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia is to provide increased amounts of antitank weapons and air defense systems, which is ongoing with the international community,‚Äù said Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters the chief of U.S. European Command. ‚ÄúThe Ukrainians are making excellent use of these weapons now.‚Äù

After more than two weeks of war, Russia has failed to establish military dominance over Ukraine. Here's why. (Video: Drea Cornejo/The Washington Post, Photo: Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)

NATO countries have been limited in what they can send to Ukraine due in part to the Ukrainian military‚Äôs training, which centers heavily on Soviet- or Russian-made weapons that exist in dwindling stock.

Ukraine has sought the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, said a senior European official familiar with the situation. There are ongoing talks about that possibility, the official said, but questions remain about whether there are any that can be spared.

‚ÄúNobody wants to mishandle expectations,‚Äù said the official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Ukrainian troops also are trained on the Buk surface-to-air missile system ‚Äî the same type of weapon that shot down a Malaysia Airlines civilian jet over a part of eastern Ukraine held by Russian-backed separatists in 2014. Some eastern European countries possess both systems, but in small numbers, the European official said.

Austin‚Äôs upcoming visit to Slovakia could be used to secure additional agreements to use its railways to facilitate faster transfers of humanitarian aid and fuel into Ukraine, the European official said. Unlike some other countries nearby, Slovakia has a shipping hub that operates on both European standard-gauge rail and the wider-gauge rail used in Ukraine, making it an appealing option.

Assessments of how long the Ukrainians can continue to hold out against the Russian onslaught are intertwined with what weapons they already have.

On Friday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the United States sent a letter to President Biden asking him to transfer manned and unmanned aircraft to Ukraine, saying that ‚Äúdespite heroic and skilled resistance,‚Äù the Russians had achieved air superiority over the Ukrainians. That went farther than U.S. defense officials, who have noted the Russians have a significantly larger air force but had been unable to control the skies over Ukraine.

‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs advantage in this domain could soon develop into air dominance if the Ukrainians do not receive necessary military aid,‚Äù the lawmakers said.

The lawmakers called for the continued delivery of Stinger missiles, man-portable antiaircraft weapons, but also called for the United States to facilitate the transfer of S-300 systems.

‚ÄúProviding Soviet-era platforms that Ukrainian servicemembers have previously operated and maintained will be essential to their success on the battlefield and will also protect U.S. defense technology from falling into the hands of the Russians,‚Äù lawmakers said in the letter, which was first reported by Politico.

They also urged the president to reconsider the Polish MiG decision and said the Biden administration should look for ways to send more armed drones and Su-25 aircraft to Ukraine. The jet is used by a handful of U.S. allies and partners, including Bulgaria, a NATO nation.

The lawmakers signing the letter Friday included numerous U.S. veterans.

Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a former Army Ranger who is among the signatories, said the administration was drawing a nonsensical distinction between acceptable weapons and those it considers potentially too escalatory.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe there is a distinction between providing a MiG and providing a Javelin and a Stinger,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese are defensive systems; we are not providing offensive capabilities because Ukraine is not on the offense, all they‚Äôre doing is fighting for their survival and trying to maintain their democracy against a Vladimir Putin invasion.‚Äù

Crow also said that while the provision of Javelins and Stingers has been useful thus far, the West must step up its contributions to give Ukraine a chance to sustain its resistance ‚Äî particularly in the skies, where Zelensky‚Äôs forces are trying to prevent Russia from achieving superiority.

Advertisement

‚ÄúShort of MiGs, they need more advanced ground-to-air missile systems,‚Äù Crow said, noting that the Stingers provided to Ukraine work well against helicopters and planes conducting low-altitude bombing runs, but aren‚Äôt enough to ground the Russian air force. ‚ÄúThey need something that can reach out and conduct regional air defense, higher altitude air defense.‚Äù

Rep. Michael Waltz (R.-Fla.), who has served in Special Forces units and also signed the letter, said that transferring S-300 systems and components of them, such as radar, could be helpful.

Among Western weapons, the Ukrainians also could benefit from the Avenger system, which allows Stinger missiles to be mounted to vehicles, he said. Other American air-defense systems, including Patriot missiles, require too much training to make them practical in the near term.

Advertisement

The Ukrainians could benefit, too, from counter-battery radar systems, which scan for the originating locations of incoming artillery fire, and its equipment they‚Äôve asked for before, Waltz said.

‚ÄúAt a minimum, once the Russians know you have that, they won‚Äôt be able to just sit there and lob round after round after round,‚Äù Waltz said. ‚ÄúIt degrades their ability to just sit there and pummel you. They have to move, obviously, because now you have the ability to counter-battery.‚Äù

The Ukrainian military has 56 fighter jets left and is using them just five to 10 hours per day, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Pentagon, cited that as one reason the administration had decided against transferring the MiGs to Ukraine, noting that Russian surface-to-air missile systems can reach just about anywhere over the war zone.

U.S. officials continue to speak to the Ukrainians regularly, the defense official said, and the ‚Äúthings they need the most‚Äù are antiaircraft and antiarmor weapons, such as Javelin missiles. For items the Ukrainians need that the United States does not have, the administration is working with allies and partners ‚Äúwho might have inventory.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to help them further that defense in ways and with systems that they know how to use already,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre good at it, and it‚Äôs having effect on the Russians.‚Äù

Like the rest of the world I‚Äôve been watching the terrible situation in Ukraine. Every day I‚Äôm incensed by the violence perpetrated by the Russians, and inspired by the courage of the Ukrainians defending their country. It is surreal to watch, almost in real time, as a modern war unfolds. Today we‚Äôre going to look at the use of civilian grade drones in CMO.

Drone footage, especially from the Bayraktar TB-2, has been all over the news. Not only are they operating with near impunity over hostile convoys but they are knocking out BUK‚Äôs and TOR SAM systems. To even see a drone survive at all is fairly well amazing, not to think it would even be tactically viable.

https://theaviationgeekclub.com/the-bayraktar-tb2-drone-is-so-effective-against-russian-vehicles-that-the-ukrainians-made-a-pop-song-about-it-and-the-official-video-has-already-reached-nearly-200k-views-on-youtube/

What really caught my eye was the mass donations of civilian drones. Now this isn‚Äôt new, civilian drones have been ‚Äúmodified‚Äù in Syria to carry mortar munitions that would be dropped from altitude. As loud as a civilian drone is, it would be completely muffled by a diesel engine or armored vehicle.

Molotov drone: innovative Ukrainian military uses DJI Inspire to drop Molotov cocktails Or maybe Molotov‚Äôs and not mortar rounds?

So are these strictly reconnaissance uses? War drives innovation and I think we‚Äôll see a huge jump in drone usage to maximize the effectiveness of Ukrainian (and Russian) forces.

https://twitter.com/Sweet_Jason_HZ

So what can a DJI pocket drone do? It is too small to carry any munitions. The range is limited. The camera is decent, but we‚Äôre not talking Gorgon Stare here. If you are stalking infantry or tanks it would be useful, but may give your position away.

Then I saw that video. It is of a Russian HIND being hit, head on, at very short range by a MANPAD. It‚Äôs difficult to judge the overall terrain, but low flying aircraft or helicopters would make a very brief appearance before being suddenly gone. A Coast Guard helicopter flew over my house yesterday and I had a good view of it for maybe 5 seconds before it was through the tree line.

So in that 5 seconds you need to grab your Igla or Stinger, prep it, find a target, and fire. There‚Äôs the OODA loop in CMO, if a target moves in-and-out of your view inside of the OODA loop your unit will not fire. For those not familiar with the term it is :

Observe ‚Äì You need to see the target Orient ‚Äì You need to maneuver into position to engage Decide ‚Äì You need to decide if the target is a threat or even if it‚Äôs engageable Act ‚Äì You fire, or don‚Äôt fire upon it

The above shot makes our Ukrainian operator need to be in a perfect position, observing for a target, and prepared to act on a moments notice. Of further note is a potential for a delay while waiting for the coolant to flood the IR seeker. Without knowing which MANPAD this is, or what variant, this one is hard to quantify.

Commercial Drone as Recon

I‚Äôve got a basic scenario with one Ukrainian Army unit with some IGLA-1. Someone will stumble in and point out I‚Äôm using the wrong variant or some such, but so be it. We‚Äôll start here.

First thing, if it wasn‚Äôt for the drone footage I‚Äôd think someone stalked out a flight path and assumed that a hostile rotary unit would take the same path back. It doesn‚Äôt take rocket science to watch as HIND‚Äôs transit into target areas and back again. In a perfect world they‚Äôd take a different flight path back, but human nature and laziness and fuel efficiency (or lack thereof) combine for stupid decisions.

Next up is the issue of LOS. In CMO air units have a detection chance depending what type of terrain the ground unit is in. Which is great, a unit in an urban environment or heavy forest will be harder to detect than one in a farm field. Unfortunately this doesn‚Äôt go the other way and ground units have LOS only broken by terrain and not by buildings or trees.

A ground unit has LOS, regardless of the terrain it is, out to about 8 nautical miles for a target 20 ft above ground level. Technically I think this is a tough calculation for the game to make, though a modifier of some sort would be interesting, the denser the cover the more difficult it is to detect targets outside of it.

Which brings us back to our drone. If your MANPAD only has a limited range next to terrain or urban environments, how do you shorten your OODA loop time? Easy, put up a drone that can remain aloft for a bit and only looks for something moving against a bright sky. The contrast of the target would be stark as it flew over the treetops. It‚Äôs the perfect match for a camera with low(er) resolution.

I‚Äôve moved our IGLA to Ukraine and stuck it in terrain that gives it a more reasonable LOS. Our target HIND will transit from the north to south. First test will be no drone, second test will be with a civilian grade drone.

At 1.4nm our target rotary is detected by the ground unit‚Äôs naked eye followed by classification a few seconds later by the IGLA‚Äôs IR suite.

Now if we put up a commercial grade drone, at a hover, and point it towards the likely direction of travel we get an average detection range of 3.5 nm. Our IGLA gets confirmation at 2.6nm out.

Now our IGLA is firing at a closing target and not one that is directly overhead or moving away.

Our Russian HIND evades a few of the IGLA‚Äôs but succumbs to them eventually.

That cheap commercial drone doubled the detection range of a ground unit.

Igor‚Äôs Tor

This is Igor.



Every morning Igor goes for a stroll through the nearby forest.



Today, Igor found a Russian Army 9K330 Tor SAM system abandoned in the forest.



Now Igor owns a $20 million SAM system.



Congratulations Igor. pic.twitter.com/5pyyFTKqCP ‚Äî Oryx (@oryxspioenkop) March 10, 2022

Beyond just the incredible dysfunction that is finding a $20 mil air defense system in the woods‚Ä¶ how can Igor put this to use?

First off is the basics. We‚Äôve got a 70‚Äôs era search radar with a slightly more modern fire control radar. Max range is 12nm on the fire control radar. Our OODA loop (remember above) is 15 seconds, followed by targeting time depending on unit proficiency. These aren‚Äôt great, and struggle to detect drones.

The missile itself can engage targets from 30 ft above ground all the way to 20,000 ft above ground. Engagement range is out to 9 nm for a probability of hit of 80%.

One interesting point, the above is from the Bayraktar UAV, note the maximum altitude, 22,500 ft, above the engagement profile of the Tor.

Back to the Tor, it has to paint the target with a radar beam to guide in the missile. That‚Äôs the ‚ÄúIlluminate at Launch‚Äù bit. All aspect means it‚Äôs going to hit anything in the air at any angle, approaching or not. Finally, it can hit sea-skimming missile.

The warhead is 15 kilograms of fragmentation explosive. It may not vaporize a target, but it will likely mission kill. For targets it can engage anything in the air it can see short of ballistic missiles.

But back to Igor. Ukraine had 6 Tor systems, now they have 7. Whether they can procure spare parts for what looks like a broken fire control radar remains to be seen. Whether Russia can procure spare parts also remains to be seen. After suffering 30 years of brain drain and outsourcing of manufacturing I would be very surprised if the supply chain for sophisticated systems will last very long.

If Igor tows it to Kyiv it can cover a relatively small area and will be within range of Russian artillery and ballistic missiles. But if Igor has enough fuel for his tractor and can get it to Western Ukraine then it could protect critical infrastructure from Russian cruise missile attacks.

If all else it denies the Russians the ability to act with impunity. They do not have air supremacy and seem incapable or unable to SEAD targets. Every time a Russian pilot launches he‚Äôs going to have Igors‚Äô Tor in the back of his mind. Given the lack of PGM‚Äôs the Russians need to fly low in order to hit the targets they want, but now they have Igor and his Tor to worry about.

More of these, or other SAM systems, are far more dangerous than Polish MIG‚Äôs which have to operate at low altitude to avoid the dense long range Russian SAM systems. A Tor battery can be a threat much longer than a short sortied MIG-29. A great read on this subject can be found here :

https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/rusi-defence-systems/russian-air-force-actually-incapable-complex-air-operations

Conclusion

I‚Äôm not going to comment on the situation on the ground and in the air as others are far more qualified. It‚Äôs also really early in this war and we see a great deal of OSINT on one side and propaganda from the other. At this point it‚Äôs really difficult to see where it‚Äôll end up in a week. If 3 weeks ago I said Russia would be incapable of hosting offensive operations 40km from the border you‚Äôd call me nuts. If I said they‚Äôd abandon equipment, flee, and suffer terrible losses, you‚Äôd call me nuts. If I said the RuAF was incapable of locking down a minor country‚Äôs airspace and unable to SEAD, you‚Äôd call me nuts.

So I‚Äôm not going down that road. For now I‚Äôll cheer on the Ukrainians.
