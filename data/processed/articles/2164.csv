Recounting the intelligence his administration has been declassifying and sharing with US allies over the past few weeks, as Russia geared up for war, Biden says, “We’ve been transparent with the world… so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.”

He accuses the Russian leader of planning the invasion for a long time and of lying to create pretexts for his actions in Ukraine.

“Putin is the aggressor, Putin chose this war,” Biden says, predicting that the Russian leader “will be a pariah on the international stage.”

“He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to reestablish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is all about,” he charges.

The US president, whose address comes after a meeting earlier today with leaders of the G7 group of nations, warns that powerful sanctions will exact a “severe cost” from Russia’s economy, “both immediately and over time.”

“We’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well over half of the global economy,” he says. “We’re in full and total agreement. We will limit… Russia’s ability to participate in the global economy.”

He says the steps imposed in coordination with Europe will block top Russian banks from the US financial system and “cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.”

The penalties fall in line with the White House’s insistence that it will look to hit Russia’s financial system and Putin’s inner circle, while also imposing export controls that aim to starve Russia’s industries and military of US semiconductors and other high-tech products.

But Biden, for now, holds off on imposing some of the most severe sanctions, including cutting Russia out of the SWIFT payment system, which allows for the transfers of money from bank to bank around the globe, or Russia’s energy sector.

On the military front, he vows to defend “every inch” of NATO territory, but reaffirms that no American troops will be deployed to Washington’s ally.

“As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with a full force of American power,” Biden says.

The president adds, however: “Our forces will not be engaged in a conflict with Russia in Ukraine.”

The attack on Ukraine is taking place both on the ground and by air, with reports that Russian forces have breached the Kyiv region. Explosions have also been heard in the cities of Odessa, Kharkiv and Mariupol, and there are reports of fighting and fatalities in other parts of the country. Officials said the offensive had already killed dozens of soldiers and several civilians as of Thursday afternoon. Follow our live updates here: Explosions and sirens in Kyiv as Russia invades Ukraine Stocks fell sharply on the news of the invasion with investors fleeing for safe-haven assets, while global energy prices jumped to multi-year highs. Russia began attacking various positions across the country early Thursday local time after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would carry out a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine. Its goal, Putin said, was what he called ""the demilitarization"" of Ukraine. He said Russia's plans do not include the occupation of Ukrainian territories, saying ""we are not going to impose anything on anyone by force.""

There's little evidence of military aggression from Ukraine, and Russia's claims to the contrary are seen by many as a pretext for justifying an invasion. On Thursday on Twitter, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for ""an immediate end to Putin's war against the world"" and said ""we are building an anti-Putin coalition"" without elaborating further. He also called for immediate sanctions on Russia as well as ""defense and financial support"" saying ""the world must force Russia into peace."" The Kremlin issued more statements later Thursday, saying Putin would decide how long the military operation would last ""based on its progress and aims."" Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, also told reporters Ukraine needs to ""ideally"" be ""liberated"" but that ""nobody is talking about the occupation of Ukraine,"" saying that word was ""unacceptable,"" according to Reuters. Speaking Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that ""in the coming days and weeks, there will come even more [soldiers], so we will further increase and we are increasing our presence in the eastern part of the alliance,"" although he also repeated that, as it stands, NATO had no plans to send its troops into Ukraine. The comments came as Ukraine's military said Russia had attacked it with more than 30 strikes on civilian and military infrastructure, including the use of Kalibr cruise missiles.

Close followers of Russian politics believe Putin wants to destabilize Ukraine's pro-Western government and to instead install a pro-Russia regime there. U.S., Europe and Ukrainian officials have condemned the attack with Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, calling for ""heavy sanctions"" on Moscow. President Joe Biden on Thursday morning convened a meeting of the National Security Council — the third this week — to discuss the U.S. response to the attacks. He will also meet virtually with G-7 members on Thursday ahead of an address to the nation. It's unclear, as yet, whether Western powers will deploy military means to stop Putin. Several countries, including the U.S. and U.K., have already sent weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself. Ukraine's foreign minister has called for more weapons and financial and humanitarian assistance.

Putin issued a chilling warning to the West when he announced the military operation against Ukraine, saying any country that tried to ""interfere"" would face immediate consequences.

What's going on?

The situation in Ukraine is rapidly deteriorating and developments are difficult to confirm, but there are already reports of casualties. Oleksiy Arestovych, an advisor to Ukraine's Presidential Office, told NBC News that the government had received confirmation that ""a couple of dozen"" Ukrainian soldiers had died, mostly from the airstrikes and rocket strikes in the morning. Ukraine's armed forces have also claimed they have destroyed some Russian aircraft and that a number of Russian soldiers have died during fighting Thursday.

Operational information released by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Facebook stated that four Russian tanks were ""burned"" in the Kharkiv area, in northeast Ukraine near the Russian border, but also that ""heavy battles"" were taking place in the area. Ukraine's Joint Forces Command reported that about 50 Russian ""occupiers"" were killed in the Shchastya area in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine, earlier on Facebook. Ukrainian forces had ""stopped the opponent"" in Chernihiv, a city in northern Ukraine, according to a later Facebook post. Ukraine's State Emergency Service has also reported a fire at a residential building in Chuguiv in the Kharkiv region, that it said was due to shelling. A minor had died during the incident and other people were injured, the service said. Earlier, Ukrainian police said that six people had been killed during bombing of Podilsk in the Odessa region, with a further seven people wounded and 19 people missing, which was confirmed by NBC News.

A video has also been released by the Ukrainian Interior Ministry which appeared to show military vehicles crossing the border into Ukraine. The ministry said the video was filmed early Thursday morning at the border with Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Some of the vehicles were seen to have a ""Z"" mark, which has been a feature of Russian military vehicles that had been massing along the border with Ukraine in recent months although it cannot be definitively said that the vehicles are Russian.

NBC News has also been able to verify a video showing explosions over the skyline of Kharkiv. There are reports of the center of Kyiv being largely deserted on Thursday and of large traffic jams forming on roads out of the city as people try to leave for safety. Western officials have warned there could be a wave of migration into Eastern Europe as Ukrainians flee the conflict.

Ukraine's defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, posted a message on Facebook in which he called upon able Ukrainians to take up arms against Russian forces. ""Anyone who is ready and able to hold weapons"" can now join the Territorial Defense Forces, he said, adding that to get weapons, Ukrainians needed to contact ""brigades and battalions directly in your region.

The Russian aircraft were allegedly brought down over the eastern Luhansk region, Kiev said.

Russia’s defence ministry has denied the claim, saying it had taken Ukrainian bases “out of action” and incapacitated the country’s air defences within hours.

Early this morning Russian troops launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine after Mr Putin authorised military action.

He warned other countries any attempt to interfere would lead to “consequences you have never seen”.

The first explosions were heard across the country shortly after 5 am, in cities including Kiev, Kharkiv and Odesa.

At least seven people have died in the bombing by Russian forces, according to Ukrainian police.

An attack at a military site in Podilsk outside Odessa killed six people and wounded seven others, officials say. Nineteen people are also missing.

One person died in the southeastern city of Mariupol, police said.

World leaders have condemned the invasion – saying it could leave many dead, topple Ukraine’s democratic government, and threaten post-Cold War relations.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a direct appeal to Russia, urging it to avoid a major war in Europe. He said he had tried to call Putin this morning, but there was no answer. He has now declared martial law.

Ukrainians were urged to stay home and avoid panic, even as the country’s border guard agency reported an artillery barrage by Russian troops from neighbouring Belarus.

Putin attempted to justify the invasion in a televised address. He said Russia could not feel safe with constant threats from Ukrainian soldiers, and claimed the attack was needed to protect civilians and end eight years of conflict involving pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

He further described the invasion as demilitarisation and “denazification” of the country.

Ukraine's President Zelensky confirmed reports of missile strikes in the country at around 5am yesterday, according to a Reuters report, including on Ukraine's infrastructure and border guards. There have been explosions in major cities and people in Kyiv fleeing the city or rushing to take shelter in underground metro stations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the operation is aimed at the ""demilitarisation and de-Nazification"" of Ukraine in a televised address to the Russian people, while Ukraine's Foreign Minister has accused Russia of starting a major war and begged the UN to ""do everything possible"" to stop the assault.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky described this invasion as potentially ""the beginning of a big war on the European continent"", while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said, ""These are among the darkest hours for Europe since World War Two.""

The military assault has led to international condemnation and vows of taking action. US President Joe Biden warned that the world will hold Russia accountable, while predicting a huge loss of life in the ensuing conflict. Leaders from the UK, European Union, UN and NATO have similarly strongly condemned the Russian attack.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to keep fighting. He reported that 137 people have become victims of war, including civilians and soldiers.

US president Biden has levied several sanctions on Russia to curtail the country’s “ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds, and yen,” and prevent Moscow’s high-tech imports and its ability to upgrade the military. However, President Zelensky has said that the sanctions imposed on Moscow are insufficient to curtail Russian military operations against Ukraine.

The US president also informed that 70000 additional troops have been sent to Europe, to “reassure Nato allies”.

Over 700 anti-war protestors have been arrested in Russia, while demonstrations have been held across European cities in support of Ukraine.

Ukrainians who have the clearance to carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland.
