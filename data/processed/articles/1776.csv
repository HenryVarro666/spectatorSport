2,5cec9fa9-0058-4426-b7b6-c484edc7d52e,"['Deutsche Welle', 'Www.Dw.Com']",,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Kyiv on Friday presented Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with paperwork for his country to join the European Union.

Handing over a document at a joint press conference, she said: ""This is where your path towards the European Union begins.""

""We stand ready to support you in filling out this questionnaire,"" von der Leyen said, adding: ""It will not be, as usual, a matter of years, but rather a matter of weeks"" to complete this step.

The questionnaire, she explained, forms the basis of an opinion that gets passed on to the European Council.

Von der Leyen said she intended to, ""present Ukraine's application to the [European] Council this summer.""

During the joint press conference von der Leyen said: ""Russia will descend in economic, financial and technological decay while Ukraine is marching towards a European future.""

Von der Leyen in Bucha: 'Humanity was shattered'

Von der Leyen traveled to Ukraine with her deputy Josep Borrell, who is also the bloc's commissioner for foreign and security affairs. During the trip, the first by high-ranking EU officials since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, von der Leyen traveled to the city of Bucha.

On Twitter, she wrote, ""It was important to start my visit in Bucha. Because in Bucha our humanity was shattered.""

Among the delegation visiting Kyiv is Slovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger, who announced that his country was donating its Soviet-era S-300 air defense system to Ukraine.

EU's envoy to Ukraine returns

Borrell announced in Kyiv that the European Union was returning its delegation to the Ukrainian capital. The head of the EU delegation to Ukraine, Matti Maasikas, was accompanying Borrell and von der Leyen.

The EU representation was completely evacuated one day after the start of the war.

The envoy's return will help ensure that the European Union and the Ukrainian government can work together closely and directly, Borrell said.

""Ukraine is not a country invaded, dominated. There is still a government [which] receives people from outside, and you can travel to Kyiv,"" Borrell said.

EU to outline its measures to 'isolate Russia'

Borrell said one topic on the agenda of talks with Zelenskyy was possible further sanctions to ""isolate Russia.""

It comes as a new sanctions package, including an EU embargo on Russian coal imports, is set to be formally implemented on Friday after the bloc approved the measures.

Borrell also said the EU would supply €7.5 million ($8.2 million) to train Ukrainian prosecutors to investigate war crimes, which Russia is accused of committing in the country.

The EU's foreign policy chief added that he hoped the bloc would offer Kyiv another €500 million in the coming days.

The European Union members have announced a new, fifth round of sanctions against Russia and its businesses due to the war in Ukraine, including a ban on Russian vessels from accessing EU ports. However, the EU is still weighing additional sanctions related to the banning of Russian oil imports.

The European Commission (EC) on Tuesday revealed its fifth package of sanctions against Russia. According to the EC, the previous four packages of sanctions have hit hard and limited the Kremlin’s political and economic options. However, President of the EC, Ursula von der Leyen, said that, in view of events, a further increase of pressure against Russia is needed.

President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen

“Today, we are proposing to take our sanctions a step further. We will make them broader and sharper, so that they cut even deeper in the Russian economy,” she said.

This fifth package has six pillars. First, the EC will impose an import ban on coal from Russia, worth EUR 4 billion per year. This will cut another important revenue source for Russia, the EU believes.

Second, a full transaction ban on four key Russian banks, among them Russia’s second-largest, VTB. These four banks represent 23 per cent of the market share in the Russian banking sector, which will further weaken Russia’s financial system.

Third, a ban on Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing EU ports has been announced with certain exemptions covering essentials, such as agricultural and food products, humanitarian aid as well as energy.

As a reminder, the UK has already banned Russian ships from its ports. The ban included any vessels owned or operated by anyone connected to Russia and authorities also gained new powers to detain Russian vessels.

When it comes to oil, the EC is working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports. Ursula von der Leyen said the EU is reflecting on some of the ideas presented by the Member States, such as taxes or specific payment channels such as an escrow account.

The package of sanctions also includes further targeted export bans, worth EUR 10 billion, in areas in which Russia is vulnerable; specific new import bans, worth EUR 5.5 billion, to cut the money stream of Russia and its oligarchs, on products from wood to cement, from seafood to liquor; a number of very targeted measures, such as a general EU ban on participation of Russian companies in public procurement in the Member States; and further listings of individuals.

Today, more than 40 countries apply sanctions like these.

Russia is waging a cruel, ruthless war, also against Ukraine’s civilian population.



We need to sustain utmost pressure at this critical point.

Furthermore, in a speech at the EP Plenary on Wednesday, von der Leyen said: “We have to look into oil and we will have to look into the revenues that Russia gets from the fossil fuels. And we really have to make an effort, for example, to take a share to an escrow account, so that we will really limit the source of revenues of Russia from fossil fuels. This has to end, and this is the next step we will have to take together.”

While the EU is still trying to work out how to end its dependence on Russian oil and gas, the U.S. has already implemented an import ban on Russia’s crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products. However the ban has come with a cost as Russian oil comes off the global market, the supply of oil drops and prices are rising.

In an effort to lower the prices, U.S. President Joe Biden last Thursday revealed a two-point plan, which includes immediate action through the release of reserves and a call to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels altogether and speed up the transition to clean energy. The release of 1 million barrels per day for the next six months from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is the biggest release from the reserves since its creation in 1975, in the midst of the Cold War, and the second release since the war in Ukraine started.

Following Biden’s announcement about the release from the reserves, the IEA also announced a new release of oil from emergency reserves in response to the market turmoil caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The agreement followed the previous action taken by IEA Member Countries, announced last month, to which they pledged a total of 62.7 million barrels. Out of this total amount, the U.S. alone committed to releasing 30 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

SPR release only temporary relief, Rystad says

In a report on Wednesday, Rystad Energy, Norway’s energy intelligence firm, said that the SPR release delivered an expected change in the Brent futures curve, by shifting prices down in the short term while pushing them upwards again by comparable amounts for contracts expiring later in the year. A pivot around September 2022 can be expected, when the SPR release is likely to end, Rystad Energy research shows.

It is worth reminding that OPEC has recently announced the replacement of the IEA with Wood Mackenzie and Rystad Energy as secondary sources used to assess OPEC Member Countries’ crude oil production.

Claudio Galimberti, Senior Vice President, Analysis at Rystad, said that the release will likely result in 1 million barrels per day (bpd) on average, against a potential drop in Russian crude exports of over 2 million bpd. “This historically large SPR release is the right decision in the current crisis and consumers should feel the benefit soon, but it only solves half the problem,” Galimberti added.

According to Rystad, the release will lower the SPR level significantly, thus sowing the seed for a future price rally when demand for crude will increase from the need to replenish the stockpile. The crude quality of the release is likely going to be split evenly between sweet and sour grades.

Depending on the speed and the duration of the release, it is expected that global S&D balances will be temporarily altered. Assuming an average SPR release of 1 million bpd for the next 180 days – and keeping everything else constant, including OPEC+ production and no swings in demand – supply and demand balances should be less tight over the next six months.

In particular, stock draws in the third quarter will be less pronounced and result in only a 0.3 million bpd average draw for the quarter vs. the 1.3 million bpd average draw before the SPR release. However, assuming the SPR will need to be replenished over the course of the fourth quarter and most likely 2023, an increase in crude demand should be expected.

Meanwhile, the OPEC+ group of oil-producing nations said last week it would aim to raise production by 432,000 bpd in May, continuing with a monthly plan agreed last year to gradually replace output cut at the start of the pandemic.

There have been no pledges by the UAE or Saudi Arabia to tap into their spare capacity and fill the yawning gap between the pledges by OPEC+ and actual aggregate production, which in February – before the sanctions on Russia – stood at almost 1 million bpd.

At this pace, and assuming a Russian crude production loss of 2 million bpd going forward, OPEC+’s gap between pledges and production in May could widen to 3.2 million bpd.

While OPEC has stayed the course on volumes, Saudi Arabia continues to take advantage of the tightening market by raising its official selling prices (OSPs), Rystad said.

Rystad also stated that the EU edged closer to banning Russia’s oil imports. Should the EU ban Russia’s oil imports, Rystad believes it would result in a major structural shift in crude flows from Europe to Asia, as Europe has been a major destination of Russian oil so far. The intelligence firm estimated that up to 2 million bpd of Russian crude production may be lost if the EU bans Russian oil.",https://www.offshore-energy.biz/eu-bans-russian-vessels-from-ports-edges-closer-to-banning-russian-oil-imports/

Travelling by train from Brussels to Kyiv, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters the most important message she was bringing to Zelensky was that there “will be the EU path” for Ukraine.

“Usually it takes years before the EU council accepts application for membership but Ukraine did that in a week or two and I ask to move forward as soon as possible,” she said. “Our goal is present Ukraine application to council this summer.”

Six weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she pledged her support for Kyiv to “emerge from the war as a democratic country”, something, she said, the European Union and other donors would help with.

It was a message echoed by Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief diplomat, who also told reporters the visit was a signal that “Ukraine is in control of its territory” and the government was still in charge.

“Ukraine is not a country invaded, dominated. There is still a government (which) receives people from outside and you can travel to Kyiv,” Borrell said, adding he hoped the EU would offer another 500 million euros (S$740 million) to Kyiv in the coming days.

He also said the trip would allow the bloc to outline the measures the EU has taken to “isolate Russia” over its invasion of Ukraine, a war Moscow describes as a “special operation” to “denazify” its neighbour.

Zelensky rejects Moscow’s assertion, and says the war raging in parts of his country for the last six weeks is a direct attack on not only Ukraine’s existence, but also on the security of Europe as a whole.

Moscow’s incursion has seen more than 4 million people flee abroad, killed or wounded thousands and reduced cities to rubble though Russian forces have failed to take any major cities.

Zelensky has urged Brussels to do more to punish Russia, including banning purchases of oil and gas from the country, and has called on the EU to accept Ukraine as a full member.

Borrell said oil sanctions were “a big elephant in the room”, with some concerns that a move to cut out Russian crude could cause a spike in prices painful to European economies. He said a decision on exports would be raised on Monday in Brussels.

Borrell and von der Leyen are the latest Western leaders to visit Kyiv after the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic travelled to meet Zelenskiy last month.",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/eus-von-der-leyen-borrell-say-they-are-en-route-to-kyiv

While the EU promised more sanctions are pending, the prospect of an outright ban on Russian oil imports is unlikely given how heavily a number of member states rely on Russian supply of crude. Banning imports of natural gas is even more distant a prospect, as Russia supplies roughly 40% of the EU's total consumption. Natural gas prices in Europe have already hit record highs as a result and are up over 400% in the last year.

""We are very much dependent on Russian gas, and I think all sanctions that hit us more than the Russians wouldn't be good for us, and that's why we're against the sanctions on oil and gas,"" Austria's Finance Minister, Magnus Brunner said on Monday.

Elsewhere, in China COVID restrictions continue to affect the demand for fuel as the country experienced lower than normal travel during the recent Qingming Festival. The festival took place between Sunday and Tuesday, and even before it began tourism agencies had reported reduced demand for long-haul trips due to uncertainty brought on by renewed COVID restrictions, according to local reports.

The US dollar has hit two-year highs this week, driven by a growing expectation among investors that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates more quickly than expected to temper surging inflation. Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said on Tuesday inflation was ""much too high"" and there was a risk it could rise even further.

The ban on coal imports will be the first EU sanctions targeting Russia’s lucrative energy industry over its war in Ukraine and is estimated to be worth 4 billion euros (£3.3 billion) per year, the EU presidency, held by France, announced.

In the meantime, the EU has already started working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports.

“The package is very substantial and extends sanctions against Russia to new sectors” and more oligarchs, the presidency said, mentioning officials linked to propaganda, military security and high-technology linked to the Ukraine war.

The deal was given the final political go-ahead in a meeting of EU ambassadors and will be enacted once published in the EU’s official journal, likely on Friday.

So far, banning natural gas has remained out of reach, but not because of lack of support from the European parliament.

The legislature approved a resolution by a 513—22 margin — with 19 abstentions — demanding “an immediate full embargo on Russian imports of oil, coal, nuclear fuel and gas”.

Even if the move underscores the EU’s determination to act against the Kremlin, it carried little more than moral weight, since it is up to the member states themselves to unanimously impose such bans.

And energy is key in Europe’s trade relations with Russia. EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell has said that the 27-nation bloc is paying a billion euros a day for energy provisions, accounting for over 35 billion euros since the war started.

Late Thursday, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that, if not gas, oil would be on the list soon.

“The next step we are looking intensively at the moment (is) oil, so to prepare to be able to phase out oil,” she told reporters.
