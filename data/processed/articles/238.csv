British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there were few things more depraved than the targeting of vulnerable and defenseless people.

One of the most prized works at the Kharkiv museum is a version of the imposing work by renowned Russian painter Ilya Repin called ""Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks"", which has been taken down from the wall ready to be stored away.



""Basically, it should not be moved,"" said Filatova of the painting. ""Any movement should be avoided. We treat it with great care."" She spoke among the empty, cold galleries where some pictures still hung and others were propped against walls, waiting to be stowed away.



Filatova and her colleagues were relieved that the collection, which includes works by German painter and printmaker Albrecht Duerer and Dutch masters, remained intact. But with the windows shattered, it was impossible to control the temperature and humidity inside the gallery.

The ministry said that some of them, serving in supply units, had been taken prisoner by the Ukrainian army since the fighting began on Feb. 24.

Citing Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the RIA news agency said Putin had ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts from the operation.



“Unfortunately, we have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine. Practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to Russia,” the defense ministry said, promising to prevent such situations in the future.



Some associations of soldiers’ mothers in Russia had raised concerns about a number of conscripts going incommunicado at the start of what the Kremlin calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine, suggesting they could have been sent to fight despite a lack of adequate training. The Kremlin and military authorities had denied it until now.

The Kyiv-Classic Symphony Orchestra also performed an excerpt from Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy”, on which the European Union’s anthem is based - a nod to the Ukraine government’s desire to move closer to Europe and away from Russia’s orbit.



Conductor Herman Makarenko told reporters that the concert was a call for peace. He said he managed to gather around 20 musicians for the performance, instead of 65-70 who normally make up the ensemble.

He expressed concern that radiation leaks could occur. Kuleba called on the international community to demand Russia agree to a cease-fire to allow repair teams to restore power at the Chernobyl facility.

The IAEA responded on Twitter Wednesday saying, “Ukraine has informed IAEA of power loss at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant” and that “in this case IAEA sees no critical impact on safety.” It added that the volume of cooling water at Chernobyl’s nuclear facility was sufficient for effective heat removal without the need for the electrical supply, and referenced an earlier report from March 3.

Civilians from besieged towns northwest of Kyiv worked their way toward the capital Wednesday, crossing over a small river via a damaged bridge, The Associated Press reports. One resident of the town of Irpin described four days without heat, electricity, water or cell phone connections. Others came from neighboring Bucha. The route from Irpin and Bucha to Kyiv is part of a humanitarian corridor announced by Ukrainian authorities Wednesday. Thousands have been entering Kyiv via this route in recent days, with many then taken to the railway station for onward evacuation by train to Ukraine’s west.

“We have a short window of time at the moment (for evacuations). Even if there is a ceasefire right now, there is a high risk of shells falling at any moment,” said Yeyhen Nyshchuk, actor and former culture minister, now a member of Ukraine’s territorial defense forces.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says efforts are underway to evacuate some 18,000 people from the capital Kyiv and embattled towns near it.
