Ministry of Defence of Ukraine

Address by Minister of Defence of Ukraine Oleksii Reznikov

9 days 4 hours 2 minutes. Ukraine protects the world. The tenth day of resistance to Russian terrorists. The tenth day of courage of the Armed Forces, guardsmen, border guards, rescuers, fighters of other security forces, all Ukrainians who heroically defend. Thanks to all our people, the Kremlin's plans to subdue Ukrainians in two days, seize large cities, overthrow the state, and annex Ukraine to Russia have failed. Yes, the enemy has advanced in some directions, but controls only a small area.

Given the slow pace of the offensive and resistance of Ukrainians, Russia is changing tactics. The Ukrainian sky is the most vulnerable place. The aggressor comprehensively and actively uses its air and missile potential. All types of aircraft bombard cities, towns and civilian infrastructure, including critical and dangerous nuclear and hydropower plants.

The ""great"" army has shown its true nature - a cowardly terrorist who is able to attack only the civilian population - children, women, unarmed civilians. Targeted shelling, bombing and rocket-propelled grenades on residential neighborhoods, schools, kindergartens and hospitals, the enemy destroying temples and churches.

We are working on the introduction of a regime of silence and the opening of humanitarian corridors. We hope that the humanitarian corridor will work and we will be able to evacuate civilians.

The main efforts of the occupiers were focused on the encirclement of Kyiv and the weakening of resistance in the settlements they blocked.

In the Volyn direction, the position of our troops has not changed significantly. In the northern direction Chernihiv carries out heroic defense. In the area of the settlement of Mykhailo-Kotsyubynske, Chernihiv region, a column of up to 200 units of equipment and manpower is standing in front of the water barrier. The bridge across the river was destroyed. In the Slobozhansky direction, the Ukrainian military continue to conduct defensive battles, successfully defeating the enemy. In the Prymorsky direction our defenders cover the sea coast and carry out tasks on prevention of encirclement of the city of Mykolaiv. The Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine repulses enemy air strikes. Systematic hostilities continue, with the Russian invaders losing 39 aircraft and 40 helicopters.

""Green corridors"" under fire: Russia has violated the agreement even with the mediation of the Red Cross and does not allow the evacuation of people – DPM Iryna Vereshchuk

“The Russian occupiers began shelling with heavy weapons. As you know, from 9 am on March 5, we had a preliminary agreement that we would create two humanitarian corridors: Volnovakha and Mariupol. I note the fact that Russia has violated the agreements even with the mediation of the International Committee of the Red Cross and is shelling the city of Volnovakha. Also in the direction of Mariupol - Zaporizhzhia, fighting is taking place in the area of Polohy-Orikhov, which makes it impossible for the column to move from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, ""she said.

Iryna Vereshchuk appealed to the Russian side to stop the shelling and provide an opportunity to form columns of the humanitarian corridor so that children, women and the elderly could leave the settlements.

""We also appeal to the Russian Federation to give the opportunity to send humanitarian goods from the Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia with medicines and food,"" the Deputy Prime Minister added.

Ministry of Health of Ukraine

Many logistics structures in Ukraine have suffered due to Russian aggression. The stable operation of pharmacies and pharmaceutical establishments for the population is no exception. However, today the e-resources continue to work and provide as accurate information as possible about the availability of medicines.

Ukraine appeals to the International Committee of the Red Cross and its President Peter Maurer and the Presiden of the Red Cross in Europe Robert Mardini to help organize a safe humanitarian corridor for the earliest possible evacuation and assistance to civilians. To save hundreds of thousands of civilians, all opportunities, resources and humanism must be mobilized.

POLICY

Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine

Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine on Russia's impeding the opening of humanitarian corridors in Ukraine.

Violating the agreements reached, the armed forces of the Russian Federation continue to launch missile and bomb strikes on Mariupol, Volnovakha and other Ukrainian cities.

The ongoing shelling makes it impossible to open humanitarian corridors for the safe evacuation of civilians and the delivery of medicines and food.

The allegations of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation that it is the Ukrainian authorities who are ehindering the departure of residents of the cities under siege are not true and constitute disinformation to justify the criminal actions of the Russian armed forces.

The Russian side ignores the appeals of international humanitarian organizations, in particular the International Committee of the Red Cross, to cease fire in order to create safe conditions for the departure of civilians and wounded.

Russia's actions are a gross violation of the Geneva Conventions and are classified as a war crime under the Rome Statute.

We call on the international community - states and international organisations - to immediately condemn Russia's gross violation of the agreements on the opening of humanitarian corridors, and call on Moscow to order Russian troops to cease fire.

Ukraine, together with the humanitarian organisations involved, is ready to evacuate the civilian population as soon as safe conditions are in place.

Key messages of the address of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy

It is the 10th day of war, which feels like one long day and one long night without any rest; there is no difference what time and date or day it is. Ukrainians protect their state and save their people, no matter what.

The President of Ukraine holds daily phone conversations with the Presidents of France and Poland, and his gratitude to them is immense. With the invaluable help of the President of Poland, the humanitarian crisis at the border was averted. More than that, thousands of Ukrainian women and children received a decent attitude, without any discrimination by nationality, race, religion or so. In fact, the actual border with Poland has disappeared, as there is no time for separation when both states are on the good side.

President Zelenskyy stated: “I am convinced that soon we will be able to say to our people to return to Ukraine from Poland, Romania, Slovakia and all other friendly states, since there will be no threat”. He assured that already now the Government is thinking about the return of its people, revitalization of cities, and recovery of the economy. After conversations with the leaders of the World Bank and IMF, there is a consent on provision of immediate support to Ukraine’s reconstruction after the war.

Moreover, the President held conversations with leaders of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The main topic of conversation with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission was the membership of Ukraine in the EU.

The President sent special thanks to all those hundreds of thousands people around the globe who went on support actions for Ukraine and were calling their governments to introduce additional sanctions and a no—fly zone over Ukraine to protect people.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine bravely hold the positions; counter-attack the occupants in Kharkiv, hold Mykolaiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, Donbas. The occupants suffer colossal losses. The Russian army did not manage to occupy the planned spots; at the same time, it has reached the amount of at least 10000 soldiers dead from its side.

Ukrainian people fights back and protests even in those places where, unfortunately, Russia managed to squeeze through. The President is convinced that Russia’s stay is temporary, as the Ukrainian people are full of dignity, courage and are determined.

During the second round of negotiations in Belarus, the sides agreed to bring back at least a small percent of humanity to most war-torn areas by establishing the humanitarian corridors. These cities today are Mariupol and Volnovakha. Women and children, who decided to stay, must be provided with food and medicines. Ukrainian aid is on the way and all those who need that help must have a possibility to receive it, and all those who can must continue the fighting. Ukraine does everything required from its side for the agreement to start working, and it remains one of key tasks for today. That would be an indicator whether Ukraine will continue the negotiations process.

“We pray for our military, help our civilians and work for peace,” – the President finished.

Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources

Ukraine calls on the contracting parties to the environmental conventions to suspend 14 international environmental agreements with regard to the occupier, which include the termination of the Russia Federation – aggressor state's membership in the governing and advisory bodies of international environmental organizations:

- Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants;

- UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes;

- Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora;

- Convention on Biological Diversity;

- Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer;

- UN Convention to Combat Desertification;

- Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal;

- Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management;

- Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitats;

- Convention for the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution;

- Convention on the Prohibition of Military or any other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques;

- UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage;

- UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and suspension of Membership in the International Coordinating Council of the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Program.

By carrying out a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the occupier violated international law, human rights, nuclear security and global peace in general. This radically changes the position of each party to these conventions and the obligations arising from such agreements.

ENERGY

Gas TSO of Ukraine

Status of operation of Ukrainian GTS

Due to hostilities, the company stopped the operation of 16 gas distribution stations in Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia, Kyiv, Donetsk, Luhansk regions. Hundreds of thousands of household consumers are left without gas. Due to significant damage to the networks of regional gas distribution network operators (regional gas companies) and active hostilities, it is currently impossible to restore gas supply to some GDS units.

GTS operator of Ukraine and GTS operator of Poland Gaz System S.A. agreed on the introduction of firm capacity for gas imports. Now firm capacity, regardless transit, is more than 50 million cubic meters of gas per day, which is almost equal to the average daily consumption in Ukraine. Ukrainian gas market participants were able to import gas from three countries - Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, including LNG terminals in Poland and Croatia. Thanks to the efforts of OGTSU and the support of international partners - operators of related systems, Ukraine is strengthening energy security and diversifying sources and routes of gas supply.

Despite the extraordinary working conditions, Ukrainian gas companies continue to meet Ukraine's needs. For the previous day, on March 4, OGTSU transported 76.5 million cubic meters of gas for domestic consumers.

https://www.facebook.com/tsoua2020/posts/4866764016750063

GTSO has created another guaranteed route for gas imports to Ukraine

Gas TSO of Ukraine (GTSO UA) and Polish TSO Gaz System S.A. agreed to introduce firm capacity for gas imports from March 6, 2022. It allows the physical gas imports from Poland, including from the LNG terminal, on a guaranteed basis and thus contributes to the security of gas supplies for Ukraine.

Over the past three months, GTSOU international partners have taken essential steps in cooperation to enhance the security of supply. Now Ukrainian market participants will receive gas from three directions – Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia. At the auctions for capacity distribution in the Polish-Ukrainian direction, short-term products “during the day” and “for the day ahead” will be offered, which were not contracted by previously available longer products (annual, quarterly, monthly capacity).

“In recent months, Gas TSO of Ukraine has worked hard to create routes for gas imports to guarantee the necessary gas resources for Ukraine in any scenario. Today, this is a critical issue for the country’s survival. I am grateful to our colleagues – European TSOs for their important contribution to strengthening Ukraine’s energy security. On the energy front, we continue taking every effort to ensure uninterrupted gas supply to Ukrainian consumers”, said Sergiy Makogon, CEO of GTSOU.

For comparison, on average, Ukraine consumes 100-120 mcm of gas per day. Over the past three months, GTSOU has concluded agreements with the related TSOs, which have increased capacity for gas imports to more than 50 mcm per day, which is about half of the country’s natural gas needs.

UKRENERGO

On the tenth day of the war, the Ukrainian power system remains stable. Despite all the enemy’s efforts to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, the Dispatch Centre of NPC Ukrenergo controls standard frequency of 50 Hz.

Zaporizhia NPP continues to operate with two power units. All thermal and hydroelectric power plants are operating. The electricity consumption schedule is within the norm.

Do not believe the provocations about power outages. At present, our power system provides electricity for the household, military, and other consumers. In order for it to continue to operate, it is necessary to keep the level of consumption around the clock.

Today, many Ukrainians have been without electricity for several days in a row. Bombing and fierce fights prevent repair crews from approaching power lines and substations to repair them. However, specialists of Ukrenergo and distribution system operators are on full alert around the clock and coordinate their work so as to start repairs as soon as possible. Yesterday, some residents of Sumy and Kharkiv regions have got electricity thanks to a break in the battles between the heroic Armed Forces of Ukraine and the invaders.

A delusional Vladimir Putin has again insisted that Russia is not bombing Ukrainian cities, despite fears that 100 people are buried under rubble after an apartment block near Kyiv was struck and after a cluster bomb attack on the city of Chernihiv which killed 49.

Putin, speaking on a call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz this evening, dismissed all reports of Russian attacks on apartment buildings, schools and hospitals as 'fake' - a day after going on TV to accuse Ukrainians of using civilians as 'human shields' while vowing not to back down from his attack.

As he spoke, emergency services in Ukraine warned that around 100 people could be buried in rubble after a rocket strike cleaved an apartment in the city of Boradyanka - 30 miles from Kyiv - in two, with rescue workers unable to get to them. Officials in Chernihiv also raised the number killed in a cluster bomb attack to 49.

Increasingly desperate warnings are also coming from the surrounded city of Mariupol, in the south, where the mayor has warned the city is being 'simply destroyed' by Russian artillery - with water, electricity, and heating cut off while food is also running low. He has begged for a ceasefire to allow civilians to evacuate.

A shell fragment also landed in the grounds of President Zelensky's country house, though he is not thought to be there and no damage was caused.

Meanwhile Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister, claimed that Russian troops have raped women in cities they have already captured. He did not give evidence to back his claim, but Ukrainian media reported that eleven cases of rape had been reported in Kherson - the only major city captured by Russia after more than a week of fighting.

Russia has been increasingly waging a war of terror against Ukrainian civilians after attempts to rapidly capture the country failed. Indiscriminate shelling of major Ukrainian cities has been taking place, leaving hundreds of innocents dead.

And the attack showed no sign of letting up today, as Mykolaiv, in the south of Ukraine, came under attack with Russian forces moved within striking distance of the city centre. The city is located just a few miles from Kherson, which fell to Putin's men earlier in the week, along the road to Odessa - Ukraine's third-largest city and main port.

However, reports emerged on Friday evening that an attack on an airport on the outskirts of the city had been repulsed, with Ukrainian forces digging in for fresh fighting overnight.

But Ukraine's military did managed to pull off some successes. Two Russian jets were downed near Volnovakha, in the east near Donetsk, while Ukrainian special forces also ambushed two of the Kremlin's tank columns at Hostomel and Brovary, leaving large numbers of troops dead and destroying vehicles.

Kyiv says Russia has now lost around 9,200 men in the fighting, along with hundreds of tanks, almost a thousand armoured vehicles, and dozens of helicopters and jets.

It came after Russia launched an attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant overnight, killing three guards and sparking a fire that raged in the facility for four hours before emergency crews were eventually allowed to extinguish it once Putin's men had taken control.

The attack sparked international condemnation, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson branding it 'reckless' and saying it had 'threatened the security of the whole of Europe'.

The fighting raged on as NATO diplomats met in Brussels today, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that NATO is 'ready' for war and will defend 'every inch' of member states' territory - though resisted calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying that would violate the defensive alliances' principles.

Jens Stoltenberg, head of the alliance who spoke alongside Blinken, said after a meeting of foreign ministers that NATO's responsibility is to protect its 30 member states - two of which, Poland and Romania, directly border Ukraine - and to stop the conflict from spilling over into a Europe-wide war.

The duo spoke amid concerns in Washington that a 'cornered' Vladimir Putin - who faces near-total condemnation of his invasion abroad, growing dissent at home, and stiffer Ukrainian resistance than he bargained for - may 'lash out' by invading another country or threatening the West with nukes, according to the New York Times.

'NATO will defend all its allies and territory against a Russian attack,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on arriving in Brussels, which hosts the alliance's headquarters.

'Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us, we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of NATO territory.'

NATO's head echoed Blinken's condemnation of Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic and Moscow satellite that wants to join the European Union as well as the Western military alliance.

Ukrainian authorities said on Friday Russian forces seized the largest nuclear power plant in Europe after a building at the Zaporizhzhia complex was set ablaze during intense fighting.

'This just demonstrates the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it and the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops,' Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said.

While some countries indicated a willingness to discuss a no-fly zone, they made clear they did not consider it a viable option.

Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said that NATO's red line was to avoid triggering a wider conflict. France's presidential office described a no-fly zone as 'a very legitimate request and very difficult to satisfy.'

Russia is continuing to advance in southern Ukraine, with Mariupol under bombardment and Odessa and Mykolaiv under threat. Chernihiv, in the north, and Kharkiv, in the east, continue to come under heavy bombardment. The capital Kyiv is also under threat, though Ukrainian counter-attacks took out some Russian forces early on Friday

Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said calls to get NATO involved into military conflict now were 'irresponsible.'

Putin launched his 'special military operation' to get rid of what he said was Ukraine's fascist government and demilitarize the country. Zelenskiy says Moscow is trying to prevent a liberal democracy flourishing on Russia's border.

'We are now witnessing a fully-fledged war at our borders, a war unleashed by president Putin against Ukraine,' the EU's top diplomat said ahead of the bloc's separate talks on Friday.

'We will consider everything. Everything remains on the table,' Josep Borrell said of more sanctions on Russia.

On Thursday, Zelenskiy said that if allies wouldn't meet his request to protect Ukrainian air space, they should instead provide Kyiv with more war planes.

'We have 15 nuclear units so these units, two in the east are close to the front line of war. It's not just a Ukrainian question,' Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko told Reuters on Thursday. 'We are fighting. We will fight to the end.'

Russia's land assault on the capital Kyiv has moved slowly but Russian forces have shelled residential blocks and key civilian infrastructure, including in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv in the northeast.

The Azov Sea port of Mariupol has been encircled and left without electricity or running water by heavy Russian bombing.

Spooked by the invasion, eastern members of the 30-nation NATO are ramping up defence spending and seeking more protection.

'Russian troops are in Ukraine and in Belarus, so we need to rethink everything,' said Romania's Foreign Minister Bogdan, adding his country would increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP next year.

Poland announced plans to go up to 3%. Last week Germany also responded to the war with a commitment to increase military spending. In a departure from its long-declared policy, Berlin also authorised arms supplies to Ukraine.

Meanwhile Russian lawmakers approved legislation Friday to impose fines and harsh jail terms for publishing 'fake news' about the army - the latest move to silence dissent one week after Moscow launched the invasion of Ukraine.

The bill sets out jail terms of varying lengths and fines against people who publish 'knowingly false information' about the military.

'If the fakes led to serious consequences, (the legislation) threatens imprisonment of up to 15 years,' Russia's lower house of parliament said.

Amendments were also passed to fine or jail anybody calling for sanctions against Russia.

Opening the parliament's session, chairman Vyacheslav Volodin railed against foreign social media, after Facebook was briefly inaccessible in Russia on Friday.

'All these IT companies beginning with Instagram, and ending with the others, are based in the United States of America. It is clear they are used as weapons. They carry hatred and lies. We need to oppose this,' he said.

The past year has seen an unprecedented crackdown on independent and critical voices in Russia that has intensified since the invasion.

Russia's media watchdog said Friday it had restricted access to the BBC and other independent media websites, further tightening controls over the internet.

Access to the BBC, the independent news website Meduza, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, and the Russian-language website of the US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Svoboda, were 'limited' by Roskomnadzor following a request from prosecutors.

Roskomnadzor said in each case, the request was filed on February 24, the day Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his attack on Ukraine.

Valery Fadeyev, the head of the Kremlin's human rights council accused Western media of being behind 'a huge flow of false information that comes from Ukraine' and said the council had set up a project to stop it.

In another attack on critical voices, Russian police on Friday were carrying out searches at the office of the country's most prominent rights group, Memorial, which was ordered to close late last year, sparking international outcry.

Russia's invasion has already claimed hundreds of lives, displaced more than a million people and spurred allegations of war crimes.

Western-led sanctions levelled against Russia in retaliation have sent the ruble into free-fall forcing the central bank to impose a 30-percent tax on sales of hard currency after a run on lenders.

Moscow has few economic tools with which to respond but the duma on Friday adopted a bill that would freeze any assets inside Russia of foreigners 'violating rights of Russians'.

Russian media have been instructed to publish only information provided by official sources, which describe the invasion as a military operation.

State-controlled broadcasters have meanwhile reinforced government narratives about nationalism in Ukraine and Moscow's claim that Ukrainian soldiers are using civilians as human shields.

For the moment, it appears the invasion has marked the beginning of the end for what remains of Russia's independent media.

Ekho Mosvky - a liberal-leaning radio station majority-owned by Russia's energy giant Gazprom - said Thursday it would shut down after being taken off air over its Ukraine war coverage.

Authorities had on Monday blocked the Ekho website and took the station off air as punishment for spreading 'deliberately false information' about the conflict.

Another independent outlet, Znak, said Friday it was ceasing work 'due to the large number of restrictions that have recently appeared for the work of the media in Russia'.

The BBC said this week that the audience of its Russian language news website had 'more than tripled...with a record reach of 10.7 million people in the last week'.

In a Friday response to the blocking, a BBC spokesperson said the company will 'continue our efforts to make BBC News available in Russia, and across the rest of the world' despite the restrictions.

Devastating photos have laid bare the horror of Vladimir Putin’s lawless invasion of Ukraine, as one image showed a baby being rescued from the scene of a brutal attack near Kyiv as the Russian tyrant continues denying bombing Ukrainian cities.

Heartbreaking images from Irpin, located on the outskirts of the besieged capital city, confirmed massive damage to heavily populated civilian areas, with piles of rubble, twisted metal and burned out cars stretching into the distance.

A Ukrainian soldier was pictured rescuing a tiny baby from a scene of total devastation, while other photos showed a terrified woman walking past a burning house after Irpin was pounded by Kremlin forces. Elsewhere, chaos and destruction were seen in the northwestern city of Zhytomyr on Friday, after it was hit by shelling that tore a school building apart.

But an increasingly delusional Putin is insisting that Russia is not bombing Ukrainian cities, despite mounting fears that 100 people are buried under rubble after an apartment block near Kyiv was struck and after a cluster bomb attack on the city of Chernihiv killed 49.

Volodymyr Zelensky has urged Ukrainians to continue fighting Vladimir Putin’s forces following allegations that Russian troops are shelling Mariupol despite promising a ceasefire to allow hundreds of thousands of civilians to escape the strategic port city.

In a defiant address on Saturday, the comic-turned-war leader ordered ‘those who can’ to keep attacking Kremlin troops as more than 200,000 civilians in Mariupol and the town of Volnovakha in the country’s east are given five hours to evacuate west to Zaporizhzhia.

Addressing the US directly, Ukraine’s president then thundered ‘what more is needed’ to convince President Joe Biden to enforce a no-fly zone, an action which could widen the war, after he accused the West of cowardice in the face of Russian aggression.

Officials in Mariupol have alleged that Russian forces are flouting an agreed ceasefire and pounding the city. Deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov told the BBC: ‘The Russians are continuing to bomb us and use artillery. It is crazy. There is no ceasefire in Mariupol and there is no ceasefire all along the route. Our civilians are ready to escape but they cannot escape under shelling.’

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Kyiv is ‘verifying’ claims that Kremlin forces are shelling Mariupol, warning: ‘The whole world is watching.’

The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday that its units had opened humanitarian corridors near the two cities encircled by its troops for five hours between 12pm and 5pm Moscow time, Russia’s RIA news agency reported.

In Mariupol, citizens would be allowed to leave during a five-hour window, it quoted the city’s officials as saying. The Russian defence ministry said a broad offensive would then continue in Ukraine, RIA said.

The Ukrainian government said the plan was to evacuate around 200,000 people from Mariupol and 15,000 from Volnovakha, and the Red Cross is the ceasefire’s guarantor. There was no immediate confirmation that firing had stopped and it was not clear if the ceasefire would be extended to other areas, as Putin’s war with Ukraine entered its 10th day.

The evacuation will be seen as a prelude to a final assault that, if successful, would see the Russian army push north from occupied Crimea and link up with their forces from the east and take control of Ukraine’s coast on the Sea of Azov.

Since Russia invaded on February 24, Moscow has pummelled Ukrainian cities, with officials reporting hundreds of civilians killed. Europe’s largest atomic power plant has even come under attack sparking fears of a catastrophic nuclear accident. But Russia has so far only seized two key cities, Berdiansk and Kherson on Ukraine’s southern Black Sea coast.

Capturing Mariupol represents a bigger prize for Russian forces as it would deal a severe blow to Ukraine’s maritime access and connect with troops coming from annexed Crimea and the Donbas.

Zelensky said on Saturday: ‘We managed to get an agreement to provide assistance to those cities in Ukraine that are in the dire and worst situation, Mariupol and Volnovakha, to save children and women and older people. To provide medication and food to those who stay there in those places.

‘Those people willing to leave these places should be able to do so now using the humanitarian corridor, but those who can should continue fighting.

‘We do everything we can on our side to make sure this agreement works, regarding the humanitarian corridors and we will see if we can move even further about our negotiations with Russia.’

Aid agencies have warned of an unfolding humanitarian disaster as food, water and medical supplies run short and refugees stream into western Ukraine and neighbouring European countries.

In the southeastern port city of Mariupol – whose capture would be a key prize for Russia – there is no water, heat or electricity and food is running out, according to Mayor Vadym Boychenko. ‘We are simply being destroyed,’ he said.

The siege of Mariupol came as more Russian forces inched closer to the capital Kyiv, encountering stiff resistance and shelling the western suburbs and the northern town of Chernihiv, where there have been heavy civilian casualties in recent days.

In a bitter and emotional speech late on Friday, Zelensky lashed out at NATO powers for refusing to impose a no-fly zone over his country, warning that ‘all the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you’. He claimed the West’s hesitancy will fully untie Russia’s hands as it escalates its air attack.

NATO says a no-fly zone could provoke widespread war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia. But as the United States and other NATO members send weapons for Kyiv and more than 1million refugees spill through the continent, the conflict is already drawing in countries far beyond Ukraine’s borders.

‘The alliance has given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages,’ he said, warning that ‘the history of Europe will remember this forever’. In a separate video message to anti-war protesters in several European cities, Zelensky continued to appeal for help. ‘If we fall, you will fall,’ he said.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had earlier ruled out the possibility of a no-fly zone, saying Western planes would have to shoot down Russian aircraft.

In a warning of a hunger crisis yet to come, the UN World Food Programme says millions of people inside Ukraine, a major global wheat supplier, will need food aid ‘immediately’. The UN Security Council will hold an open meeting Monday on the worsening humanitarian situation. The UN estimates that 12million people in Ukraine and 4million fleeing to neighbouring countries in the coming months will need humanitarian aid.

Ukraine’s leader is set to brief US senators on Saturday on a video conference call as US congress considers a request for $10billion in emergency funding for humanitarian aid and security needs.

While the vast Russian armoured column threatening Ukraine’s capital remained stalled outside Kyiv, Putin’s military has launched hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites across the country.

BORIS JOHNSON: THE WORLD IS TURNING ITS BACK ON PUTIN Boris Johnson believes Vladimir Putin intends to 'double down' on his invasion of Ukraine, as the Russian president envisages 'no way out' but to 'continue with the destruction'. In an interview with La Repubblica, Die Welt and El Pais, the Prime Minister described the moment he was woken in the middle of the night to the news of Russian shelling of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine, saying European security is 'equally jeopardised' by such an attack. 'I was woken because poor Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was extremely concerned about what was happening at the nuclear power plant Zaporizhzhia,' he said. 'He rang me to say something that I agreed with profoundly, which is: an attack on a nuclear power plant or an explosion at a nuclear power plant are clearly a matter of our common European health and safety. 'Our security is equally involved, equally jeopardised by such an attack. We remember what happened with Chernobyl, the radioactive clouds spread over the whole continent, and indeed, also to North America, as far as I can remember. 'There is clearly a risk. Although the incident has been contained and the IAEA says there's no excessive radioactivity, I am concerned about how we stop a disaster: there are other Ukrainian plants and there are certainly other Ukrainian radioactive nuclear waste sites. 'One of the things we need to consider is how we're going to work together to prevent such a disaster. I don't think the answers are easy, but we need to work on it.' He added: 'We need to work on it urgently. One of the reasons why Putin has, I think, miscalculated so badly in this appalling war is because he underestimated badly the willingness of the Ukrainians to fight and to defend their territory, their belief in their country, their love of their country. 'He misunderstood the character of the Ukrainians and of their resolve, and he underestimated President Zelensky as well, he's been extraordinary. 'Putin also underestimated Western unity, and the governments of all the countries represented around this table have really worked together, very effectively, to produce a package of economic sanctions that has had a very considerable effect on Russia.' Asked how nuclear plants can be protected, he said: 'We have to make clear to the Kremlin that a civilian nuclear disaster in Ukraine, another Chernobyl, is a disaster for Russia as well as for everybody. 'Therefore, I think that some system of protecting those plants, some system of ensuring that radioactivity levels are monitored by international authorities, such as the UN and the IAEA on the ground, is going to be extremely important.' Mr Johnson said it appears Russian President Vladimir Putin is set on continuing with the 'destruction' in Ukraine. 'It feels to me as though Vladimir Putin has decided to - and it's clear from what's happening - that he's decided to double down,' he said. 'He sees no way out of the cul-de-sac that he's in, except to continue with the destruction, the pulverising of innocent populations, in innocent European cities. 'So we will have to respond together with an intensified package. I also want to thank and to congratulate other European governments, all of whom have now really stepped up to the plate in delivering support for the Ukrainians and support for the Ukrainian right to self-defence. 'We must not accept the narrative of Vladimir Putin that this is about him versus Nato, or him versus the West.' The Prime Minister also suggested the crisis in Ukraine may have improved relations between the UK and EU. Asked if the situation had 'in some sense... mended a lot of wounds and a lot of broken relations between the UK and the European Union', Mr Johnson said 'all crises reveal the true relationships'. 'Sometimes, if a family goes through some big trauma, then the real strength of the affection between the members of the family and the way they work together can sometimes suddenly be revealed again,' he said. 'I think that's probably what's happening now.' He added: 'The last few weeks have shown that Nato is stronger than ever, more relevant than ever. When we went to Estonia or Poland, just this week, you feel it there. They want Nato.' Mr Johnson said Mr Putin was wrong if he thought he was going to 'get less Nato' by invading Ukraine. 'He's actually getting more Nato. Nato is going to be closer, they're going to be bigger,' he said. 'Defence spending is going up. So he's ending up with the exact opposite of what he wanted.'

Russian forces did not make significant progress on Friday in their offensive to sever Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which would deal a severe blow to its economy. There were also no changes in the north and the east, where the Russian offensive has stalled, meeting fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said battles involving airstrikes and artillery continued north-west of Kyiv, and the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Okhtyrka came under heavy fire. He said Ukrainian forces were still holding the northern city of Chernihiv and the southern city of Mykolaiv.

Ukrainian artillery also defended Ukraine’s biggest port city, Odesa, from repeated attempts by Russian ships, he said.

More than 840 children have been wounded in the war, and 28 have been killed, according to Ukraine's government. A total of 331 civilians had been confirmed killed but the true number is probably much higher, the UN human rights office said.

Joe Biden has dismissed the notion of no-fly zones because of the risk of open conflict between NATO and Russian forces, despite opinion polling showing that a growing number of Americans want the US to take more aggressive action against the Kremlin.

The White House on Friday said it was weighing cuts to US imports of Russian oil, though it is proceeding cautiously, concerned about a spike in gasoline prices that would add to already high inflation.

On Friday, the United States flew B-52 Stratofortress bombers over NATO’s eastern flank above Romania, exercising with the German and Romanian militaries.

The largest strategic bombers in the US Air Force took off from RAF Fairford, a Royal Air Force station in England, and conducted ‘close air support and integration mission training’, according to a statement from US Air Forces in Europe. The B-52s then flew to Romania, where they conducted more close air support training as part of the Bomber Task Force (BTF) missions.

The White House announced that US Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Poland and Romania next week to meet with officials to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine and impact the war is having on the region.

Harris’ agenda for the March 9-11 visit to Warsaw and Bucharest is expected to centre on economic, security and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.

‘The Vice President’s meetings will also focus on how the United States can further support Ukraine's neighbours as they welcome and care for refugees fleeing violence,’ Harris’ deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said.

Biden spoke on Friday with Poland’s President Andrzej Duda. Poland is assisting about 700,000 Ukrainians and others who have fled the war so far. The United States has also more than doubled its military presence in Poland, which is a member of NATO, to 9,000 troops in recent weeks.

While the vast Russian armoured column threatening Kyiv remained stalled outside the capital, Putin’s military has launched hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites across the country.

Russian forces did not make significant progress Friday in their offensive to sever Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which would deal a severe blow to its economy. There were also no changes in the north and the east, where the Russian offensive has stalled, meeting fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Invading Russian troops have blockaded the strategic Ukrainian port city Mariupol, its mayor announced Saturday, as Moscow and Kyiv aimed to hold new talks over the weekend.

While laying siege to Mariupol for days, Russian forces also cut its electricity, food, water, heating and transportation in the depths of winter, prompting comparisons to the Nazi blockade of Leningrad in World War II.

Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba claimed that Russian troops have raped women in cities they have already captured. He did not give evidence to back his claim, but Ukrainian media reported that 11 cases of rape had been reported in Kherson, the only major city captured by Russia after more than a week of fighting.

Earlier, it was revealed that no radiation was released from a Russian attack at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant in Ukraine.

The International Atomic Energy Agency’s director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said on Friday the building hit by a Russian ‘projectile’ at the Zaporizhzhia plant was ‘not part of the reactor’ but instead a training centre at the plant.

Nuclear officials from Sweden to China said no radiation spikes had been reported, as did Grossi.

Ukrainian officials have said Russian troops took control of the overall site, but the plant’s staff were continuing to ensure its operations. Grossi said the Ukrainians were in control of the reactor.

In the frenzied initial aftermath when the risk of a radiation release was not clear, the attack caused worldwide concern – and evoked memories of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, at Ukraine’s Chernobyl.

Facing worldwide indignation over the attack, Russia sought to deflect blame. Without producing evidence, defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov blamed arson rather than artillery fire.

He claimed a Ukrainian ‘sabotage group’ had occupied the training building at the plant, fired on a Russian patrol and set fire to the building as they left.

There had been conflicting reports earlier over which part of the Zaporizhzhia facility had been affected in the attack, with an official saying at one point that shells fell directly on the facility and set fire to a reactor not in operation as well as a training building. Grossi later said that the fire was in the training centre.

MILITARY ANALYSTS SAY NATO WILL NOT IMPOSE A NO-FLY ZONE Military analysts say there is no chance that the US, Britain and their European allies will impose a no-fly zone because it could easily escalate the war in Ukraine into a nuclear confrontation between NATO and Russia. WHAT IS A NO-FLY ZONE? A no-fly zone would bar all unauthorized aircraft from flying over Ukraine. Western nations imposed such restrictions over parts of Iraq for more than a decade following the 1991 Gulf War, during the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1993-95, and during the Libyan civil war in 2011. WHY WON'T NATO TAKE THIS STEP IN UKRAINE? In simple terms, because it would risk a direct military conflict with Russia that could escalate into a wider European war with a nuclear-armed superpower. While the idea may have captured the public imagination, declaring a no-fly zone could force NATO pilots to shoot down Russian aircraft. But it goes beyond that. In addition to fighter planes, NATO would have to deploy refueling tankers and electronic-surveillance aircraft to support the mission. To protect these relatively slow, high-flying planes, NATO would have to destroy surface-to-air missile batteries in Russia and Belarus, again risking a broader conflict. 'The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO fighter planes into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,' NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said Friday. 'We understand the desperation, but we also believe that if we did that, we would end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe.' 'We have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine,' he said. WHAT WOULD A NO-FLY ZONE ACHIEVE? Ukrainian authorities and people cowering night after night in bomb shelters say a no-fly zone would protect civilians - and now nuclear power stations - from Russian air strikes. But analysts say it's Russia's ground forces, not aircraft, that are causing most of the damage in Ukraine. What Ukrainians actually want is a broader intervention like the one that occurred in Libya in 2011, when NATO forces launched attacks on government positions, said Justin Bronk, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. That's not likely to happen when the opponent is Russia. 'They want to see the West kind of sweeping in and taking out the rocket artillery that's pummeling Ukrainian cities,' Bronk said. 'We're not going to go to war against the Russian army. They are a massive nuclear-armed power. There is no way that we could possibly model, let alone control, the escalation chain that would come from such an action.' WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SKIES OVER UKRAINE? Predictions that Russia would quickly control the skies over Ukraine have not come to fruition. Military experts are wondering why Russia has chosen to leave most of its fixed-wing combat aircraft on the ground during this massive land offensive. One explanation may be that Russian pilots aren't well trained in supporting large-scale land operations, engagements that require coordination with artillery, helicopters and other assets in a fast-moving environment. 'I think that maybe they're a little bit worried that that is a very constrained area. It's not like the Middle East, where there's all kinds of space to roam around in the air,' said Robert Latif, a retired U.S. Air Force major general who now teaches at the University of Notre Dame. 'They could very easily stray over borders,' he explained. 'With both Ukrainian and Russian air defense systems and Ukrainian, what little they have, and Russian airplanes all flying around - that could be a very confusing. I think maybe they're a little bit worried about actually being able to pull it off.' Advertisement

The confusion itself underscored the dangers of active fighting near a nuclear power plant. It was the second time since the invasion began just over a week ago that concerns about a nuclear accident or a release of radiation materialized, following a battle at Chernobyl.

Grossi said only one reactor of six at Zaporizhzhia is currently operating, at about 60 per cent capacity, and that two people at the site were injured in the fire.

Ukraine’s state nuclear plant operator Enerhoatom said three Ukrainian soldiers were killed and two wounded.

The plant fire came as the Russian military advanced on a strategic city on the Dnieper River near where the facility is located, and gained ground in their bid to cut the country off from the sea.

That move would deal a severe blow to Ukraine’s economy and could worsen an already dire humanitarian situation.

With the invasion in its second week, another round of talks between Russia and Ukraine yielded a tentative agreement to set up safe corridors to evacuate citizens and deliver humanitarian aid to the country, overturned by a war that has sent more than 1million fleeing over the border and countless others sheltering underground.

A handful of cities are without heat and at least one is struggling to get food and water.

In the centre of the capital, Kyiv, frequent shelling could still be heard Friday, although more distant than in recent days, with loud thudding every 10 minutes resonating over the rooftops.

The West has heaped sanctions on Russia, and most of the world lined up to demand Russia withdraw its troops in a vote in the UN General Assembly this week.

In the latest show of international opposition to the invasion, the UN’s top human rights body voted 32-2 on a resolution that would among other things set up a panel of experts to monitor human rights in Ukraine. Only Russia and Eritrea opposed; there were 13 abstentions.

The attack on the nuclear facility led to phone calls between the Ukrainian president and Biden and other world leaders. The US Department of Energy activated its nuclear incident response team as a precaution.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to raise the issue of Russia’s attack on the plant.

In an emotional speech in the middle of the night, Zelensky said he feared an explosion that would be ‘the end for everyone. The end for Europe. The evacuation of Europe’. But most experts saw nothing to indicate an impending disaster.

‘The real threat to Ukrainian lives continues to be the violent invasion and bombing of their country,’ the American Nuclear Society said in a statement.

Putin’s forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites around the country and making significant gains in the south.

The Russians announced the capture of the southern city of Kherson, a vital Black Sea port of 280,000, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed the takeover of the government headquarters there, making it the first major city to fall since the invasion began just over a week ago.

A Russian airstrike destroyed a power plant in Okhtyrka, leaving the northeastern city without heat or electricity, the head of the region said on Telegram.

‘We are trying to figure out how to get people out of the city urgently because in a day the apartment buildings will turn into a cold stone trap without water, light or electricity,’ Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said.

Another strategic port, Mariupol on the Azov Sea, was ‘partially under siege,’ and Ukrainian forces are pushing back efforts to surround the city, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said.

‘The humanitarian situation is tense,’ he told reporters, adding that Ukrainian authorities are in talks with Russian representatives and international organisations to set up humanitarian corridor to evacuate residents and supply food.

Battles in the area have knocked out the city’s electricity, heat and water systems, as well as most phone service, officials said. Food deliveries to the city were also cut.

Video from the port city showed the assault lighting up the darkening sky above deserted streets and medical teams treating civilians, including a 16-year-old boy who could not be saved.

The child was playing football when he was wounded in the shelling, according to his father, who cradled the boy’s head on the trolley and cried.

Ukraine’s defence minister said Friday that the flagship of its navy has been scuttled at the shipyard where it was undergoing repairs in order to keep it from being seized by Russian forces.

Oleksii Reznikov said on Facebook that the commander of the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny decided to flood the ship.

Ukraine’s state emergency agency issued mass text messages on Friday with advice on what to do in case of an explosion: Lie on the ground and cover your head with your hands; use available shelter; do not rush to leave the shelter; help the wounded; do not enter damaged buildings.

Overall, the outnumbered, outgunned Ukrainians have put up stiff resistance, staving off the swift victory that Russia appeared to have expected.

But Russia’s seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 gives it a logistical advantage now in the country’s south, with shorter supply lines that smoothed the offensive there, said a senior US defence official.

Ukrainian leaders called on the people to defend their homeland by cutting down trees, erecting barricades in the cities and attacking enemy columns from the rear.

In recent days, authorities have issued weapons to civilians and taught them how to make Molotov cocktails.

As the Russian and Ukrainian negotiators met in Belarus on Thursday, Putin warned in a call with Macron that Ukraine must quickly accept the Kremlin’s demand for its ‘demilitarisation’ and declare itself neutral, renouncing its bid to join NATO.

The two sides said they tentatively agreed to allow cease-fires in areas designated safe corridors, and that they would seek to work out the necessary details quickly.

A Zelensky adviser also said a third round of talks will be held early next week.

The Pentagon set up a direct communication link to Russia’s ministry of defence earlier this week to avoid the possibility of a miscalculation sparking conflict between Moscow and Washington.

While the vast Russian armoured column threatening Ukraine’s capital remained stalled outside Kyiv, Putin’s military has launched hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites across the country.

Russian forces did not make significant progress on Friday in their offensive to sever Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which would deal a severe blow to its economy. There were also no changes in the north and the east, where the Russian offensive has stalled, meeting fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said battles involving airstrikes and artillery continued north-west of Kyiv, and the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Okhtyrka came under heavy fire. He said Ukrainian forces were still holding the northern city of Chernihiv and the southern city of Mykolaiv.

Ukrainian artillery also defended Ukraine’s biggest port city, Odesa, from repeated attempts by Russian ships, he said.

More than 840 children have been wounded in the war, and 28 have been killed, according to Ukraine's government. A total of 331 civilians had been confirmed killed but the true number is probably much higher, the UN human rights office said.

Joe Biden has dismissed the notion of no-fly zones because of the risk of open conflict between NATO and Russian forces, despite opinion polling showing that a growing number of Americans want the US to take more aggressive action against the Kremlin.

The White House on Friday said it was weighing cuts to US imports of Russian oil, though it is proceeding cautiously, concerned about a spike in gasoline prices that would add to already high inflation.

On Friday, the United States flew B-52 Stratofortress bombers over NATO’s eastern flank above Romania, exercising with the German and Romanian militaries.

The largest strategic bombers in the US Air Force took off from RAF Fairford, a Royal Air Force station in England, and conducted ‘close air support and integration mission training’, according to a statement from US Air Forces in Europe. The B-52s then flew to Romania, where they conducted more close air support training as part of the Bomber Task Force (BTF) missions.

The White House announced that US Vice President Kamala Harris will travel to Poland and Romania next week to meet with officials to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine and impact the war is having on the region.

Harris’ agenda for the March 9-11 visit to Warsaw and Bucharest is expected to centre on economic, security and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.

‘The Vice President’s meetings will also focus on how the United States can further support Ukraine's neighbours as they welcome and care for refugees fleeing violence,’ Harris’ deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said.

Biden spoke on Friday with Poland’s President Andrzej Duda. Poland is assisting about 700,000 Ukrainians and others who have fled the war so far. The United States has also more than doubled its military presence in Poland, which is a member of NATO, to 9,000 troops in recent weeks.

While the vast Russian armoured column threatening Kyiv remained stalled outside the capital, Putin’s military has launched hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites across the country.

Russian forces did not make significant progress Friday in their offensive to sever Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which would deal a severe blow to its economy. There were also no changes in the north and the east, where the Russian offensive has stalled, meeting fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Invading Russian troops have blockaded the strategic Ukrainian port city Mariupol, its mayor announced Saturday, as Moscow and Kyiv aimed to hold new talks over the weekend.

While laying siege to Mariupol for days, Russian forces also cut its electricity, food, water, heating and transportation in the depths of winter, prompting comparisons to the Nazi blockade of Leningrad in World War II.

Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba claimed that Russian troops have raped women in cities they have already captured. He did not give evidence to back his claim, but Ukrainian media reported that 11 cases of rape had been reported in Kherson, the only major city captured by Russia after more than a week of fighting.

Earlier, it was revealed that no radiation was released from a Russian attack at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant in Ukraine.

The International Atomic Energy Agency’s director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said on Friday the building hit by a Russian ‘projectile’ at the Zaporizhzhia plant was ‘not part of the reactor’ but instead a training centre at the plant.

Nuclear officials from Sweden to China said no radiation spikes had been reported, as did Grossi.

Ukrainian officials have said Russian troops took control of the overall site, but the plant’s staff were continuing to ensure its operations. Grossi said the Ukrainians were in control of the reactor.

In the frenzied initial aftermath when the risk of a radiation release was not clear, the attack caused worldwide concern – and evoked memories of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, at Ukraine’s Chernobyl.

Facing worldwide indignation over the attack, Russia sought to deflect blame. Without producing evidence, defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov blamed arson rather than artillery fire.

He claimed a Ukrainian ‘sabotage group’ had occupied the training building at the plant, fired on a Russian patrol and set fire to the building as they left.

There had been conflicting reports earlier over which part of the Zaporizhzhia facility had been affected in the attack, with an official saying at one point that shells fell directly on the facility and set fire to a reactor not in operation as well as a training building. Grossi later said that the fire was in the training centre.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10579619/Baby-rescued-scene-atrocity-Russian-forces-step-attacks-civilian-areas.html
