""From the onset of warfare in Ukraine through today, along the entire border with Ukraine, 100,000 people have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland,"" Szefernaker told reporters in the border village of Medyka, southeastern Poland.

Those arriving were mostly women, children, and the elderly after Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday banned men of military age from leaving the country.

More than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in less than 48 hours, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said Friday, as many more continued to move towards the borders. He said a majority went to Poland and Moldova.

Cars were backed up for several kilometers (miles) at some border crossings as authorities in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova mobilised to receive them, providing shelter, food and legal help. These countries also eased their usual border procedures, among them COVID-19 testing requirements.

At border crossings in Poland, Ukrainians arrived on foot and by car and train — some with their pets — and were greeted by Polish authorities and volunteers offering them food and hot drinks.

Some sought to join relatives who have already settled in Poland and other EU nations, whose strong economies have for many years attracted Ukrainian workers.

For many the first stop was the train station in Przemysl, a city in southeastern Poland that is a transit point for many. Ukrainians slept on cots and in chairs as they awaited their next moves, relieved to escape the shelling of Kyiv and other places.

European Union member Poland, which has the region's largest Ukrainian community of about 1 million people, has seen a throng of refugees at its borders since the Russian invasion began.

Poland’s Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker Saturday said 115,000 people had crossed the border into Poland from Ukraine since Russia’s invasion started this week.

Just four hours earlier he had put the number at 100,000 arrivals, showing just how quickly the refugees are flowing into their EU neighbour.

“At this moment, there are 115,000 people who have crossed the Ukrainian-Polish border since the war erupted” on Thursday, Szefernaker told reporters in the border village of Dorohusk, eastern Poland.

The head of the Polish border guard, Tomasz Praga, said nearly 50,000 people had crossed into Poland from Ukraine on Friday alone.

Poland, which was already home to an estimated 1.5 million Ukrainians before Russia’s invasion and which has expressed steadfast support for Ukraine, has so far seen the bulk of those fleeing Ukraine cross into its territory.

“More than 150,000 Ukrainian refugees have now crossed into neighbouring countries, half of them to Poland, and many to Hungary, Moldova, Romania and beyond,” UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi tweeted on Saturday.

“Displacement in Ukraine is also growing but the military situation makes it difficult to estimate numbers and provide aid,” he added.

Szefernaker said 90 percent of the refugees entering Poland have places to go, such as the homes of friends or family, but the remainder are seeking help at nine reception centres set up along the border.

The centres offer meals and medical care, a place to rest as well as any necessary information.

Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi said the mid-sized Polish town of Przemysl has become a major hub of activity as Ukrainian refugees continue to stream across the border.

“All border crossings are open to foot traffic,” he said, reporting from the town in eastern Poland. “The government here knows there are people stuck at the border on the Ukrainian side, [and that] processing times are taking a long time. People are having to abandon cars, rail lines are overwhelmed, so a lot of people are ditching everything and walking.”

The head of the Polish border guard, Tomasz Praga, added at the press conference that on Friday alone nearly 50,000 people had crossed into Poland from Ukraine.

Szefernaker said his country can process up to 50,000 refugees from Ukraine at the border every day.

Poland, which was already home to an estimated 1.5 million Ukrainians before Russia’s invasion and which has expressed steadfast support for Ukraine, has so far seen the bulk of those fleeing Ukraine cross into its territory.

“Latest update is that almost 116,000 have fled to neighbouring countries since February 24 – mainly Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia and Romania,” the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR tweeted on Saturday.

“Numbers are rising,” it added.

TISZABEC, Hungary/WARSAW, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Poland sought to ease passage into the European Union on Monday for around quarter of a million Ukrainians waiting at European border crossings in freezing conditions after fleeing the Russian invasion of their country.

With men of conscription age prevented from leaving Ukraine, groups of mainly women and children arrived at borders in eastern Poland, Slovakia and Hungary and in northern and northeastern Romania.

Wait times to cross borders ranged from a few hours at small crossings to several days at busier ones such as Medyka in Poland, where lines on the Ukraine side stretched back dozens of kilometres (miles).

""The queues are huge,"" said Polish prime minister's chief of staff Michal Dworczyk, who added border police were allowing in people without documents and that the government was talking with Ukrainian counterparts about simplifying procedures.

""If we count the functioning border points there are certainly over a quarter of a million people at the borders,"" he said.

Another Polish official said Ukrainian border guards were slowing the flow of people as they sought to separate the men of fighting age.

""The system often freezes,"" Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker told the wp.pl website.

The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv tweeted that Ukrainian border guards were waiving exit screening procedures for women and children to reduce wait times as snow began falling.

Romanian Interior Minister Lucian Bode said that with people queuing 20 to 30 hours on the Ukrainian side to get into Romania, it was crucial to agree on how to process their paperwork to shorten waiting times on the EU side as well.

The head of a U.N. agency said on Monday that more than 500,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries since the start of Russia's invasion last week. EU officials have said the war could displace 7 million people.

The European Union is also preparing to grant Ukrainians who flee the war the right to stay and work in the 27-nation bloc for up to three years. read more

BORDER TOWNS

Crowds of people and cars have started to clog border towns such as Medyka, as refugees wait to be picked up.

The mayor of Przemysl, Wojciech Bakun, appealed to Polish volunteers to stop showing up with cars to offer transport for newly arrived groups, saying traffic was becoming unmanageable.

As officials searched for ways to unclog bottlenecks, Ukrainians living in the European Union anxiously waited at border crossings to greet family members.

""We were waiting here three days and they were on the road for over four days,"" said Veronika Sahlikova Kufelt, who travelled from Germany to meet her nieces and grandmother at the Ubla crossing in Slovakia.

In Hungary, in the Tiszabecs village nestled in a bend of the river Tisza, one Ukrainian refugee - Tanya - arrived at 4 a.m. with two children aged one and eight.

As she waited for a friend to drive them to her husband in Lublin in southeastern Poland, cars with licence plates from Hungary, Italy and the Czech Republic came and went, ferrying refugees.

Her town of Kalush in western Ukraine had been relatively calm before she set off.

""Only sirens were wailing,"" Tanya said.

Poland, whose Ukrainian community of around 1 million is the region's largest, has welcomed many people escaping Ukraine.

Polish border authorities said almost 327,000 have entered Poland since Feb. 24, with around 73,300 arriving on Monday.

At Medyka, Poland's busiest border crossing, officials loaded new arrivals into tour buses before ferrying them to a reception centre in the nearby town of Przemysl where friends, relatives and volunteers waited.

New arrivals huddled in blankets around fires as they waited in the snowy, cold weather to leave the reception centre.

""I took a train from Kyiv to Lviv to a point where the taxi put us,"" one Ukrainian woman said. ""I walked the last 50 kilometres.""

Across central Europe, authorities set up makeshift reception centres in tents where people could get medical aid and process asylum papers, while thousands of volunteers have driven to the borders with donations of food, blankets and clothes.

In the capital Warsaw, local authorities said local residents had listed some 2,500 apartments where refugees could stay.

In Romania where volunteers were trying to provide raincoats in snowy conditions, more than 74,000 Ukrainians have arrived since Feb. 24, with more than half departing for destinations in other countries, officials said.

The UN has said more than 500,000 refugees have fled Ukraine for neighbouring countries after Russia's incursion, with the Polish government saying 280,000 people had arrived there.

They have endured days-long journeys into Poland in often freezing temperatures, with most entering the EU with little more than backpacks, if that.

The migrants are almost entirely Ukrainian women and children, and those who were in Ukraine but are not from the country.

Ukrainian men aged between 18 and 60 have been blocked from the leaving the country as the government launches a conscription drive to bolster its forces against Russia.

While each migrant is fleeing the conflict, all have their own stories.

Mohamed Cherdoud

Mr Cherdoud, 31, a chef from Algeria, studied in Ukraine but eventually married a Ukrainian woman and lived in Kharkiv, a city less than 50 kilometres from Russia.

He said that over the weekend, an Algerian friend, Abdul Moneim, was killed in Kharkiv after he was hit by a Russian sniper.

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, has been devastated by attacks after Russia's incursion on February 24.

Mr Cherdoud, who works at a Japanese and Italian restaurant, left two days later and initially planned to build up supplies and hunker down in Kharkiv.

“I wanted to stay there but it was getting worse and worse,” he said at the train station in Przemysl, Poland, less than 10km from the Ukrainian border.

His plan to flee Kharkiv by car ran into problems when his vehicle was damaged by a Russian strike.

“I decided to leave, but the car was hit by an attack so we went to the train station,"" Mr Cherdoud said. ""My home is near an army training school. The Russians were shooting at it and my car got hit.”

Recalling the initial day of the Russian assault, he said: “I was very scared. They were shooting and there was a lot of noise in the sky. Everybody was looking at the sky and checking where the bombs were falling.”

Mr Cherdoud will now go to Warsaw. His wife was on holiday in Egypt when the attack happened. But he wants to return to Kharkiv as soon as he can.

“I have there my friends, my work. I want to live there, I love Kharkiv and in the future, if the war ends, I will go back there.”

He left Kharkiv by train and ended up in Lviv, a city in western Ukraine not far from the Polish border.

“Everybody has a different story,” Mr Cherdoud said.

He and a group of friends took a taxi from Lviv, aiming for the Polish border, but then hit the long queues that have built up as hundreds of thousands try to leave Ukraine.

Mr Cherdoud then walked 20km after the driver said he would go no further, boarding a train at the final station in Ukraine.

“We got on a train for 14 hours,"" he said. ""It was overcrowded. There were little children, everybody was standing.

""Around midnight the train left the station and in eight minutes, it arrived in Przemysl.""

Oksana Potelchak

A translator from Kiev, Ms Potelchak left the capital with her two children and sister last Monday, three days before Russian President Vladimir Putin officially announced the ""military operation"" in Ukraine.

“My husband, he is military. He is in Kiev now,"" she said. ""Every day they have very difficult situations, attacks — but they stand and they are sure that we will win.”

Ms Potelchak said her husband told her Ukrainian forces would not just beat back the Russian offensive on Kiev, but would win across the country.

She did not expect Russia to attack the capital. “We thought maybe the south, the east, but not Kiev. We didn’t expect that.

“We were just lucky"" to leave Kiev before the invasion, Ms Potelchak said.

“My sons go to school and everything that we’ve heard from classmates, from their parents — it was horrible.”

While initially some had been able to stay in Kiev, “now many people are still there but they have no chance to leave the city because of the danger"".

Ms Potelchak said she has been able to speak to her husband every day.

“My husband told me that I won’t recognise Kiev,"" she said. ""I can’t imagine what’s there.

""I think that our army is very strong and they will do everything so that we get all our cities and our countries back.”

Ms Potelchak describes her overriding emotions as “horrible.”

“Because when we left Kiev, my grandmother stayed there,"" she said. ""She didn’t want to leave.

""But the parents of my husband have taken her to their town near the Kiev region. It is very difficult to describe the emotions. I think it’s even impossible. I wish that no one in the world has such an experience.”

Now she will go to Germany, to support other arriving Ukrainians.

“I’m an interpreter and I speak German,"" Ms Potelchak said. ""I think it will be easier for the first time when people come [from Ukraine].

""The volunteers in Germany, they try to develop different initiatives for people who come from Ukraine.

“My sister is also in Germany. We are trying to help Ukrainians who expect to spent maybe one, two, three months in this not very pleasant situation. But we have to do it for our children.”

Tatiana and Fatih Yarkup

Tatiana and her partner Fatih Yarkup, 26, lived in Odessa, a port city on the Black Sea.

After the Russian assault, they woke to the reports of the conflict. They left last Friday.

“The bombs were falling and we thought the shooting and the war would come to Odessa soon, so we decided to leave before it does,” Tatiana said.

“The days were OK but the nights were terrible. Odessa is a port city and they were shooting from the sea.

""There was nowhere to go, it was scary to stay at home. There was nowhere to hide, not like in Kiev because Odessa doesn’t have subway system.”

They managed to drive most of the way, about 7km from the border, but the car broke down.

“We were waiting in line and had to start the car and stop the engine over and over again, so the battery stopped working and we had to walk,” Mr Yarkup said.

The couple said it had been hard to get fuel because of attacks on petrol stations.

“We slept in our car,"" Mr Yarkup said. ""It was very scary because we were sleeping in the fields and the roads were being bombed and also the petrol stations.

""We managed to almost get to the border crossing but we stopped 7km from the crossing.”

Mr Yarkup is in the third year of his medicine degree.

“On Wednesday I was studying at the university and on Thursday the war started,” he said.

They have been told they can get a train ticket to anywhere in Poland, but only have a limited network to rely on.

“We just arrived here. We don’t know what we are doing or what we should do,” Tatiana said.

“We’d go five metres and then have to wait half an hour,” Lyudmila said.

They relied on lifts for the rest in way, because her 70-year-old mother could not walk far.

PRZEMYSL, Poland—Beds, meals, medical supplies, psychologists, interpreters, teachers.

These were just a few of the items the Polish government asked local and national migrant-focused NGOs in the country to plan for from mid-February onward as the possibility of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Poland’s neighbor, loomed.

Possibility became reality on Thursday morning, when Ukrainians across the country woke up to the sound of explosions, air raid sirens, and the news that the country was under attack. As missiles hit cities and Russian forces approach the capital, hundreds of thousands of civilians have left the country, with the United Nations estimating that up to 5 million could flee in the coming days.

But according to multiple heads of local and national NGOs, current and past officials tasked with monitoring Poland’s immigration policy and implementation, and U.S. government officials helping to coordinate the effort, the Polish government has struggled to rapidly put together an actionable response plan. The country must find the resources needed to respond to what could become the biggest humanitarian crisis facing Europe since the end of the Cold War.

Civil society’s concerns over Poland’s preparedness for Ukrainian refugees persist despite multiple meetings in the last week with local, national, and international humanitarian organizations, along with government officials from both Poland and Ukraine, to discuss potential responses to a wide-scale refugee crisis. On Tuesday, representatives from several NGOs based in the European Union met for two hours to discuss how European civil society could help, though no definitive actions were decided.

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said on Sunday that 368,000 people so far had crossed the Ukrainian border into neighboring countries. The day before, Polish Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker said that since the invasion began, at least 100,000 asylum-seekers from Ukraine had come into Poland, where a Ukrainian diaspora of an estimated 1 to 2 million already exists, largely thanks to the previous bouts of Russian aggression in Crimea and the Donbass region.

There have been many first-person accounts that Poland has unofficially opened its borders even to those who arrive without a passport. However, some migrants have said this treatment has not held true for non-Ukrainian refugees fleeing the invaded country.

With Russia’s further invasion past the disputed territories into Ukrainian sovereign lands, including brutal attacks throughout the Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odessa regions, such preparations in Poland and other nearby countries are more important than ever. And although Polish Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Saturday that the country would now deploy its own Territorial Defense Force (WOT) to set up Refugee Relocation Support Groups along its Ukrainian border, along with the reception points announced last week, experts working on the ground in Poland are still skeptical.

“The groups will be made up of WOT soldiers with a knowledge of the Ukrainian and Russian languages, having been trained in first aid, competent to care for children and senior citizens,” Blaszczak tweeted.

This is not the first wave of refugees to arrive en masse at the Polish border in recent months. Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko began weaponizing refugees primarily from the Middle East last year, inviting them into the country and immediately busing them to the EU’s easternmost borders with Poland, Latvia, and other neighboring countries in what experts believe is retaliation for EU sanctions imposed on the country in response to Lukashenko’s brutal treatment of demonstrators protesting his disputed reelection in August 2020.

Overwhelmed with these refugees, Poland created a no man’s land on its northern border with Belarus that is off limits to activists, journalists, and other watchdogs. Accounts of extreme abuse and neglect by border agents from both countries have been reported from the region for months, as hundreds of refugees have trickled out of the frozen forest separating the two countries and are sent to closed refugee camps across Poland for processing.

Since the start of the Donbass war in 2014 and the invasion of the Crimean Peninsula, Poland has also granted asylum to some refugees from the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in eastern Ukraine along with others from Crimea in the south. Activists complain that the Polish policy toward these refugees was too exclusive, allowing only a very small number of those affected to cross into EU territory via Poland.

Experts and activists who have been working with the refugees from Belarus as well as those from the disputed lands in Ukraine say they fear that Poland will treat a new wave of Ukrainian refugees fleeing a Russian invasion in much the same way: either with a disregard for international laws on human rights, as seen in the Belarusian case, or with a very selective entrance criteria that could severely limit the number of people allowed across the border.

But Ukrainian refugees will most likely face a different reception than their nonwhite, mostly non-Christian predecessors, thanks to their similar language, appearance, and historical struggles.

Poland changed its immigration law in response to the crisis on the Belarusian border, eschewing some tenets of international law protecting refugees, creating a “racist” law according to Anna Dabrowska, the president of Homo Faber, an NGO focused on migrant integration in the western Polish city of Lublin. So the question remains as to how the government will view these white, mostly Christian refugees and which laws will be applied to their situation.

Polish officials within the current government headed by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who have declined to provide further comments after multiple requests, have said in several public statements that they are prepared in a worst-case scenario. Regional mayors have been asked to provide estimates of how many refugees they could accept and what kinds of resources they might need to care for them.

An important difference between this situation and the previous waves of asylum-seekers is that the entire world is watching, said Anna Trylinska, an immigration attorney in Poland who has worked with refugees for more than a decade.

“But Poland doesn’t have a comprehensive immigration policy,” she said before the war began. “Everything is done ad hoc here—we have a crisis, so we find empty buildings for them, but we don’t care what happens to them later.”

And now that the humanitarian crisis has begun, the situation of what to actually do with the refugees is as murky as ever. There are not enough beds for people, she said, and neither Polish people nor the refugees themselves know what to do or where to go. The only bright side, she said, is that many Polish people are volunteering to help in whatever way they can—but without the organization or leadership structure in place to collect donations or distribute them, the situation is still dire at best.

Civil society groups say local and national government representatives are leaving the bulk of the preparation for potentially millions of refugees to them.

“I don’t think the national government is prepared at all,” said Dabrowska earlier this week. “I am very worried.”

In what more than one local organizer has said is a first in their careers, the national government representatives reportedly told NGO representatives that funding would not be an issue. But activists are doubtful.

Artem Zozulia, the president of the Ukraine Foundation, possibly the biggest NGO working for migrants in Poland, shares Dabrowska’s concerns. “We have all the plans to respond [to a refugee crisis] but none of the money,” he said last week. “I don’t see any money right now. And if there’s no money, they’re not 100 percent prepared.”

Three days into the crisis, his opinion had not changed. “The national government announced some projects for people fleeing Ukraine, but the majority of refugees are still only covered by volunteers and fundraising organizations that do not have the capacity to handle hundreds of thousands of people,” he said. And there’s still no money.

Some officials say they can only hope that funding will come when it is needed. Hannah Machinska, the Polish deputy commissioner for human rights, who is tasked with monitoring the treatment of asylum-seekers, echoed others’ doubts and said she was afraid that the national government was not organized enough to handle the situation, especially at the border checkpoints.

“If Russia invades Ukraine, I will just drive my car to the border and try to help people.” Trylinska said last weekend. “What else can we do?”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/27/poland-ukraine-refugees/

Poland has the region's largest Ukrainian community of about one million people and has seen a throng of refugees at its borders since the war with Russia began.

So far nearly 120,000 people have travelled into Poland from Ukraine.

The number is going up fast as Ukrainians grab their belongings and rush to escape from a deadly Russian onslaught on their nation, including an attempt to take the capital Kyiv.

Poland has declared its border open to fleeing Ukrainians, even for those without official documents.

The train departed from the border town of Przemysl and had five carriages adapted to transport the wounded and four stocked with humanitarian aid for Ukraine's Lviv district.

Shabia Mantoo, a spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said Ukrainian refugees were already fleeing their war-torn homeland in large numbers.

'They are sporadic and unpredictable but we do know that there are significant numbers moving,' she told GS News.

'If the situation escalates, further, there could be many more who have to flee the country to neighbouring countries and that can be up to four million, for instance.'

She added: 'Almost 116,000 have crossed international borders as of right now.

'This may go up, it's changing every minute. It's very fluid and changing by the hour.'

Ms Mantoo said most were heading to neighbouring Poland, Moldova, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, and even some into Belarus - from where some Russian forces entered Ukraine.

Poland's Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker said: 'Since 7am the Ukrainian side has closed part of the lanes for cars and allowed pedestrian traffic.'

With men of conscription age prevented from leaving Ukraine, groups of mainly women and children arrived at borders in eastern Poland, Slovakia and Hungary and in northern and northeastern Romania.

Wait times to cross borders ranged from a few hours at small crossings to several days at busier ones such as Medyka in Poland, where lines on the Ukraine side stretched back dozens of kilometres.

""The queues are huge,"" said Polish prime minister's chief of staff Michal Dworczyk, who added border police were allowing in people without documents and that the government was talking with Ukrainian counterparts about simplifying procedures.

""If we count the functioning border points there are certainly over a quarter of a million people at the borders,"" he said.

Another Polish official said Ukrainian border guards were slowing the flow of people as they sought to separate the men of fighting age.

""The system often freezes,"" Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker was reported as saying.

The US Embassy in Kyiv tweeted that Ukrainian border guards were waiving exit screening procedures for women and children to reduce wait times as snow began falling.

Romanian Interior Minister Lucian Bode said that with people queuing 20 to 30 hours on the Ukrainian side to get into Romania, it was crucial to agree on how to process their paperwork to shorten waiting times on the EU side as well.

The head of a UN agency said that more than 500,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries since the start of Russia's invasion last week.

EU officials have said the war could displace 7 million people.

The European Union is also preparing to grant Ukrainians who flee the war the right to stay and work in the 27-nation bloc for up to three years.

Crowds of people and cars have started to clog border towns such as Medyka, as refugees wait to be picked up.

The mayor of Przemysl, Wojciech Bakun, appealed to Polish volunteers to stop showing up with cars to offer transport for newly arrived groups, saying traffic was becoming unmanageable.

As officials searched for ways to unclog bottlenecks, Ukrainians living in the European Union anxiously waited at border crossings to greet family members.

""We were waiting here three days and they were on the road for over four days,"" said Veronika Sahlikova Kufelt, who travelled from Germany to meet her nieces and grandmother at the Ubla crossing in Slovakia.

In Hungary, in the Tiszabecs village nestled in a bend of the river Tisza, one Ukrainian refugee - Tanya - arrived at 4am with two children aged one and eight.

As she waited for a friend to drive them to her husband in Lublin in southeastern Poland, cars with licence plates from Hungary, Italy and the Czech Republic came and went, ferrying refugees.

Her town of Kalush in western Ukraine had been relatively calm before she set off.

""Only sirens were wailing,"" Tanya said.

Poland, whose Ukrainian community of around 1 million is the region's largest, has welcomed many people escaping Ukraine.

Polish border authorities said almost 327,000 have entered Poland since 24 February, with around 73,300 arriving on Monday.

At Medyka, Poland's busiest border crossing, officials loaded new arrivals into tour buses before ferrying them to a reception centre in the nearby town of Przemysl where friends, relatives and volunteers waited.

New arrivals huddled in blankets around fires as they waited in the snowy, cold weather to leave the reception centre.

""I took a train from Kyiv to Lviv to a point where the taxi put us,"" one Ukrainian woman said. ""I walked the last 50 kilometres.""

Across central Europe, authorities set up makeshift reception centres in tents where people could get medical aid and process asylum papers, while thousands of volunteers have driven to the borders with donations of food, blankets and clothes.

In the capital Warsaw, local authorities said local residents had listed some 2,500 apartments where refugees could stay.

In Romania where volunteers were trying to provide raincoats in snowy conditions, more than 74,000 Ukrainians have arrived since 24 February, with more than half departing for destinations in other countries, officials said.

EU plans to give Ukrainians right to stay up to 3 years

The European Union is preparing to grant Ukrainians who flee the war the right to stay and work in the 27-nation bloc for up to three years, senior EU and French officials have said.

At least 300,000 Ukrainian refugees have entered the EU so far, and the bloc needs to prepare for millions more, they said. EU members Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary have land borders with Ukraine.

""It is our duty to take in those who flee war,"" French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told France 2 TV, saying EU interior ministers had yesterday tasked the European Commission with preparing draft proposals to grant them protection.

Ministers will meet again on Thursday to agree on the details.

The EU temporary protection directive - drawn up after the 1990s war in the Balkans, but never used so far - provides for the same level of protection, for one to three years, in all EU states, including a residence permit, access to employment, social welfare and medical treatment.

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said most ministers had brought their support to the move on Sunday, with just some questioning if now was the time to do it or if it was best to wait a bit.

The issue, she said, concerns all of the EU.

""We already see a lot of Ukrainians leaving the countries of first entry and go to other member states, especially those that have a big Ukrainian population already,"" she told a news conference.

""Poland is one of them but also Italy, Portugal, Spain, Germany, the Czech Republic.""

Ukrainians are now allowed to travel for free on long-distance trains from Poland.

After the attack from Russia*, war is raging in Ukraine*. Up to 300,000 people are on the run.

The United Nations estimate that the Ukraine conflict* could force up to four million people to flee.

It is unclear whether the refugees from Ukraine will ever be able to return to their home country.

+++ 7.30 p.m .:

As of Sunday (February 27th, 2022), people fleeing Ukraine have the opportunity to use long-distance trains from Poland to Germany free of charge, as Deutsche Bahn announced on Sunday.

In the event of a ticket inspection, they would only have to present their Ukrainian passport or ID card.

This should make it easier for Ukrainians to continue their journey from the border and within Germany.

""DB is in close contact with the authorities and our partner railways in the neighboring countries of Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria,"" said a press release from Deutsche Bahn.

Together with the Polish railways, DB is also preparing to put additional special trains or wagons on the rails at short notice.

According to the group, up to six Eurocity long-distance trains travel from Poland to Germany every day.

The long-distance trains have their starting points in Warsaw, Gdansk, Przemysl (border to Ukraine), Kraków, Vienna/Wroclaw.

Refugees from Ukraine arrive at Przemysl train station in Poland.

+++ 19.10 p.m .:

According to the government, 115,000 people have fled from Ukraine in Poland since the beginning of the Russian invasion.

Those seeking protection have to expect long waiting times at the border on the Ukrainian side, Poland's Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker reported on Saturday at the border crossing in Dorohusk.

""We have already had the first attempts at illegal border crossings,"" the politician is quoted as saying by the dpa.

People who tried to cross the border into Poland illegally have already been arrested.

Szefernaker had previously commented on the public broadcaster TVP about the slowly progressing passport controls at the border.

The war situation between Russia and Ukraine would lead to failures in the computer systems of the Ukrainian border guard.

The Polish politician explained that up to 50,000 refugees from Ukraine can be processed at the border every day.

In the meantime, in addition to private individuals, companies and local governments in Poland have also registered to take in refugees.

The Polish railway company PKP recently announced that Ukrainian citizens can travel free of charge on almost all trains in the country upon presentation of their passport.

War in Ukraine: Chancellor and Prime Minister discuss escape movements

+++ 6.10 p.m .:

Chancellor Olaf Scholz * (SPD *) and the Prime Ministers had discussed on Friday about a possibly large flight movement from Ukraine.

How does the Federal Republic intend to deal with this in concrete terms?

The federal states are preparing for the refugees from Ukraine, in particular initial reception facilities should be available for those seeking protection.

Federal Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser* (SPD) announced that refugees would be admitted without bureaucracy.

In Brandenburg alone, space is to be created for at least 10,000 people.

This was announced by Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke (SPD) according to dpa information.

According to official information, Brandenburg will already have 800 places available from this weekend.

Putin's war: Federal states announce humanitarian aid

According to Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow (Left*) and Migration Minister Dirk Adams (Greens*), around 3,000 people could be admitted to Thuringia immediately.

Meanwhile, Lower Saxony is planning to expand its capacities.

So far it is completely unclear how many people could seek protection, said Interior Minister Boris Pistorius (SPD) on NDR.

According to Pistorius, it could be a few hundred thousand, but it could also be a million or two million people.

Hesse also announced humanitarian aid.

""The Hessian state government would also like to make its contribution to support and help quickly and unbureaucratically for those who have suffered from the war of aggression,"" said Interior Minister Peter Beuth (CDU).

Thousands of people protested against the Russian invasion on Saturday and expressed their solidarity with Ukraine.

The police speak of 6000 to 7000 participants in Frankfurt alone.

War in Ukraine: Refugees arrive in Germany

+++ 17.15:

Tens of thousands of people are fleeing the war in Ukraine.

Some have already made it across the borders of neighboring countries like Poland.

""We assume that the largest movement of refugees is taking place in the country,"" said Chris Melzer, spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

According to estimates, around 860,000 internally displaced persons were already on the move in Ukraine before the Russian invasion began, mainly from the eastern Ukrainian separatist areas and from the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea.

According to Melzer, the numbers have now increased due to the Russian invasion.

So far, however, precise estimates are hardly possible.

As the dpa reported, the aid organization on the Ukrainian side increased its supplies days ago.

In addition to tents, blankets and canisters, this also included hygiene items, diapers and soap.

What is missing, however, are financial resources.

""This makes our help, which is urgently needed, more difficult,"" says Melzer.

In any case, the Polish government's emergency plan is working well.

The UNHCR spokesman was impressed by the solidarity of the people.

According to the dpa, the first people seeking protection have also arrived in Germany.

As a spokesman for the federal police in Pirna announced on Saturday, a single-digit number of people from Ukraine arrived at the Saxon-Polish border near Görlitz on Friday.

In Brandenburg, six refugees were admitted to the reception center in Eisenhüttenstadt by noon.

In Hamburg, three to four refugees were ruled on Friday.

Ukraine conflict: More than 120,000 people have fled

+++ 11.25 a.m .:

According to the United Nations, more than 120,000 people have fled the country since the Russian attack on Ukraine began.

The UN Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees assumes that the situation will in all likelihood continue to deteriorate.

""It's a dynamic situation,"" Kelly Clements said in an interview with CNN.

The UNHCR is very concerned about what is to come, said the Deputy High Commissioner.

Most of the refugees seek refuge in Poland and Moldova, while others travel to Romania, Slovakia or Hungary.

Update from Saturday, February 26th, 2022, 9.45 a.m .:

After Russia invaded Ukraine, tens of thousands of people from Ukraine have already arrived in Poland.

""In the past 24 hours, 35,000 people have crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border towards Poland,"" Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker told the public broadcaster TVP.

According to him, it is mainly women with children and men of non-military age.

Long traffic jams have formed on the Ukrainian side of the border.

Clearance there is also slowing down because the war situation is causing failures in the computer system of the Ukrainian border guard, Szefernaker said.

Poland is able to handle up to 50,000 refugees from Ukraine at the border every day.

According to a reporter from the German Press Agency, the people at the Medyka-Schehyni border crossing reported hours of waiting on the Ukrainian side, including for people who wanted to cross the border on foot.

Ukraine conflict: More and more people are fleeing Putin

First report from Saturday, February 26th, 2022:

Kiev/Frankfurt – Before the war began, Western politicians spoke of maybe a million refugees should a Russian invasion come.

But nobody wanted to believe that.

And certainly no one wanted to believe the Western secret services, which estimated the number at five million.

On the second day of the war, Friday, February 25, 2022, the United Nations said there were probably four million people fleeing the Russian “peacekeeping mission”.

The first at least 100,000 women and children are now leaving their homes.

women and children.

No men.

They don't go, or they go in the opposite direction, towards the front.

Or they are turned away at the border post and have to go back.

Ukraine conflict: One million people are expected in Poland

The people who make it arrive in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova or Romania.

As soon as the invasion began, 4,000 fled to Europe's poorhouse, the Republic of Moldova.

One million are expected in Poland - the Poland that in the first nine months of 2021 only allowed in 5,200 refugees coming from Belarus.

Eastern Europe has not prepared for the people who do not want to be oppressed in a destroyed, exploited and Russified Ukraine.

Aid organizations are already warning that the rich western nations must follow up their declarations of solidarity with deeds.

Ukraine conflict: Reprisals are to be feared

Nobody wants to say that out loud, but the refugees from Ukraine will hardly ever be able to return to their lost homeland without having to fear reprisals.

If they're even allowed in there.

With Russia constantly breaking international agreements it has initiated or signed, bodies such as the UN can no longer trust its government.

But then there are a few other Ukrainians.

Those who now come from all parts of the world and want to take up the fight in their threatened homeland.
