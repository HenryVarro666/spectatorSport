Kramer', 'Mike Ives', 'Alexandra Stevenson', 'John Yoon', 'Azi Paybarah', 'David Moll']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"A fire broke out early Friday at a complex in southern Ukraine housing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after Russian troops fired on the area, and the Russian military later took control of the site, Ukrainian officials said.

Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles. The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant. Ukraine’s state emergency service later said the blaze went out after 6 a.m.

The fire did not affect essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.

About an hour after dawn, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate said in a statement that Russian military forces were now occupying the complex. It said that all of the site’s power units remained intact and that no changes in radiation levels had been observed.

The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service. A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

Mr. Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, said on Twitter that the United States had not detected elevated radiation readings in the area, echoing an earlier assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said he would seek an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council about the blaze at the complex, according to his office.

Before the fire was reported by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, the director general for the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that “a large number of Russian tanks and infantry” had entered Enerhodar, a town next to the plant. The director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that troops were “moving directly” toward the reactor site.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, on the Dnieper River roughly a hundred miles north of Crimea, is the largest in Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, its six reactors produce a total of 6,000 megawatts of electric power.

In comparison, the Chernobyl plant in northern Ukraine produced 3,800 megawatts — about a third less. (A megawatt, one million watts, is enough power to light 10,000 hundred-watt bulbs.) The four reactors of the Chernobyl complex were shut down after one suffered a catastrophic fire and meltdown in 1986.

The reactors’ cores are full of highly radioactive fuel. But an additional danger at the Zaporizhzhia site is the many acres of open pools of water behind the complex where spent fuel rods have been cooled for years. Experts fear that errant shells or missiles that hit such sites could set off radiological disasters.

For days, social media reports have detailed how the residents of Enerhodar set up a giant barrier of tires, vehicles and metal barricades to try to block a Russian advance into the city and the reactor site. Christoph Koettl, a visual investigator for The New York Times, noted on Twitter that the barricades were so large that they could be seen from outer space by orbiting satellites.

Starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. On Tuesday, the Zaporizhzhia facility was the site with the most reactors offline.

Reports: Russia requests Chinese military support

US officials was quoted by media outlets, including the Financial Times, the Washington Post and the New York Times, as saying that Moscow had asked Beijing for military equipment since it invaded Ukraine on February 24.

The spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, responded to the reports by saying, ""I've never heard of that.""

Pengyu told reporters that the situation in Ukraine was ""disconcerting"" and that China's priority was to prevent it from ""escalating or even getting out of control.""

The reports came hours after the White House warned Beijing would face severe ""consequences"" if it helps Moscow evade sanctions.

US and Chinese diplomats are due to meet on Monday in Rome.

Instagram now blocked in Russia

Social network app Instagram is now blocked in Russia following similar bans on Facebook and Twitter.

This was confirmed by the NetBlocks cybersecurity watchdog and Russian Instagram users early on Monday.

Russian media regulator Roskomnadzor announced the step on Friday, saying it would come into effect on Sunday at midnight. The regulator justified the measure saying that calls for violence against Russian citizens were being made from the network.

The step follows a decision by Meta, the company that owns Instagram, to allow for calls for violence against Russian troops.

In a Sunday statement published by Russian news agency TASS, Roskomnadzor pointed out that Russia has its own social network platforms such as Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki, and encouraged users to find ""new ways of communicating"" after losing access to Instagram.

US President Biden spoke with France's Macron on Ukraine

US President Joe Biden spoke with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron to discuss Russia's war against Ukraine, the White House said on Sunday.

According to the White House, the two leaders ""reviewed recent diplomatic engagements and underscored their commitment to hold Russia accountable for its actions.""

The White House statement said that Macron and Biden would also ""support the government and people of Ukraine.""

Zelenskyy urges no-fly zone, says 'Russian rockets will fall' on NATO territory

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated his demand that NATO impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine and warned that Russia could strike NATO territory.

""If you don't close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian rockets fall on your territory, on NATO territory,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address.

Zelenskyy spoke after Russian forces launched air strikes on a military training center in Yavoriv, near Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland.

US condemns Russian missile attack near Polish border

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that the US condemned a Russian missile attack near Ukraine's border with Poland.

The missile hit the military training facility in Yavoriv, some 25 kilometers from the Polish border.

""The brutality must stop,"" Blinken said.

Chechen leader Kadyrov says he traveled to Ukraine

Ramzan Kadyrov, leader of Russia's Chechnya region, said on Sunday that he had traveled to Ukraine to meet with Chechen troops.

Chechen television channel Grozny posted a video on its Telegram channel that showed Kadyrov discussing military operations with Chechen troops, which they said took place 7 km from Kyiv.

Chechen fighters have been in Ukraine since 2014, when they entered in support of the pro-Russian secessionist regions in eastern Ukraine. They have also been involved in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine since February 24.

UK: Ukraine isolated from international maritime trade

The British Defence Ministry said Russian naval forces had established a ""distant blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea Coast"" in a Sunday intelligence update. It added that this effectively isolates Ukraine from international maritime trade.

The ministry said that Russian naval forces are continuing to conduct missile strikes throughout Ukraine.

Russia has already conducted one amphibious landing in the Sea of Azov, according to the ministry, and ""could look to conduct further such operations in the coming weeks.""

Ukraine, Russia negotiators to talk again on Monday

Cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine are ongoing via video-link and would continue on Monday, said Ukrainian delegate Mykhailo Podolyak.

Previously, Podolyak and Russian negotiator Leonid Slutsky both confirmed there was progress and that results could materialize in the coming days.

Report: Ukraine using facial recognition software Clearview AI

Ukraine has begun using Clearview AI, a facial recognition developed by a US startup, as a tool to identify Russian assailants and victims of the ongoing Russian invasion.

Clearview AI [Artificial Intelligence] told the Reuters new agency it has provided the tool to Ukraine's Defense Ministry.

Ukraine gets free access to the platform's search engine for faces, which can let authorities vet people of interest at checkpoints, among other uses. However, the details on how Ukraine is utilizing the technology were not immediately known.

Clearview's founder and CEO Hoan Ton-That said his platform has more than 2 billion images from the Russian social media service VKontakte at its disposal, out of a database of over 10 billion photos.

However, critics have warned that facial recognition is not yet 100% accurate, which could lead to people being wrongly identified. Clearview has been facing lawsuits in the US for allegedly violating people's privacy by using their images from the web.

Zelenskyy calls on software giants to step up Russia boycott

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Microsoft, SAP and Oracle to stop offering support for their products in Russia.

In a tweet, Zelenskyy called out the tech giants, saying there can be ""no 'half' decisions or 'halftones'! [grey areas] There is only black and white, good or evil!""

Last week, Microsoft and SAP said they would stop sales of their products and services in Russia, while Oracle suspended its operations in the country.

However, Zelenskyy was referring to the support for products delivered remotely, via software updates and international help desks. It is unclear whether these services have been suspended.

Kremlin: Too early to confirm Putin-Zelenskyy meeting

At the talks between Moscow and Kyiv, negotiators were also discussing the possibility a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Kremlin said.

Moscow is not ruling out the idea, according to Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

However, ""we need to understand what should be the result and what will be discussed at this meeting,"" the spokesman was quoted as saying but the Interfax news agency.

Peskov told the agency it was too early to discuss the outcome of the efforts to set up a meeting.

Earlier on Sunday, both sides signaled cease-fire talks were making headway.

Moscow also said talks would continue on Monday by video link.

IMF: Russia could default on foreign debt

The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva said Russia is at risk of a deep recession that might make it unable to pay its debts.

""We no longer think of Russian default as improbable,"" Georgieva said in an interview with US broadcaster CBS.

As well as targeting key Kremlin figures and Russian oligarchs, many of the punitive measures will likely cripple Russia's financial system.

The measures helped send the rouble crashing against other currencies, which has already ""significantly diminished"" the purchasing power of the Russian people, Georgieva added.

The Russian central bank's foreign exchange reserves are largely blocked and servicing government debt has become increasingly complicated.

Last week, Morgan Stanley said a Russian default could come as early as next month.

Hundreds arrested at anti-war protests across Russia

More than 800 people were detained during peace rallies across Russia.

OVD-Info, which monitors arrests during protests, said police had held 817 people during demonstrations in 37 cities.

There was a heavy police presence at central Moscow locations including Manezhnaya Square near the Kremlin, with officers carrying demonstrators away to waiting police vans, in footage posted by Russian media.

Protesters risk fines and possible prison sentences by taking to the streets against what Moscow calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

The number of people protesting appeared to be far fewer than a week ago. Over 14,000 people have been detained across Russia since the invasion started on February 24, according to OVD-Info.

Kyiv: Broken power line at Chernobyl repaired

Ukraine says it has fixed a broken power line to the Chernobyl power plant, which has been seized by Russian troops.

Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that ''heroes'' from the national power grid company managed to restore the connection.

In 1986, the now-decommissioned facility in northern Ukraine was the scene of the worst nuclear meltdown in history that killed hundreds and spread a radioactive cloud west across Europe.

Nowadays, outside power is directed into the facility to run pumps which keep spent nuclear fuel cool and prevent radiation leaks.

The UN's atomic watchdog said the broken line had ""no critical impact on safety.""

But there were concerns when Russia seized control of Chernobyl that Moscow may attempt to sabotage the facility.

Mariupol evacuation delayed once again

A humanitarian convoy carrying aid, along with evacuation buses, once again failed to reach the besieged port city of Mariupol due to Russian shelling, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on national TV.

""The column has stayed in (the Russian-occupied city of) Berdiansk, and will tomorrow again attempt to reach Mariupol,” she said.

Vereshchuk said more than 140,000 civilians were evacuated from other conflict zones, including several thousand from towns close to the capital Kyiv.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that Mariupol faces ""a worst-case scenario"" if the warring parties don't urgently reach a ""concrete humanitarian agreement.""

The port city of around half a million has been under siege since early this month.

Pro-Russian protest held in Belgrade

A far-right group has staged a protest in Serbia's capital in support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Several dozen vehicles flying Serbian and Russian flags took part in the ""ride in support of Russia"" convoy through the central streets of Belgrade. The letters Z and V used by Russian forces on their vehicles in the conflicts in Ukraine were visible on the vehicles.

Despite formally seeking EU membership, Serbia has refused to join international sanctions against its traditional ally Russia. However, it did vote in favor of the UN resolution condemning Moscow's aggression.

Meanwhile, Serbia's president said AirSerbia will reduce its flights to Moscow, two weeks after it doubled its service to the Russian capital and introduced larger aircraft to cater to the increased demand.

Beside some Turkish carriers, AirSerbia is the only European airline that has kept on flying to Russia since the international flight ban was announced.

Russia confirms attack on Ukrainian military facility

Russia said its forces hit a military training facility in western Ukraine, near the Polish border.

Defense ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said the strike at the Yavoriv base had killed ""up to 180 foreign mercenaries"" and a ""large amount of foreign weapons were destroyed.""

The statement could not be independently verified.

A Ukrainian regional governor said 35 people were killed and 134 wounded in the attack, which involved more than 30 Russian cruise missiles.

Konashenkov said Russia had used high precision long range weapons to strike Yavoriv and a separate facility in the village of Starichi.

The attack, so close to the border with Poland, appeared to mark a significant escalation in the conflict.

Mariupol officials say death toll has almost doubled in the besieged city

More than 2,100 residents of Ukraine's city of Mariupol have been killed since hostilities began, the local authorities have said.

""As of today, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia,"" the city council posted on Telegram, raising the toll by almost 1,000 since Wednesday, when they said 1,207 civilians had died in the first nine days of the siege.

These numbers could not be independently verified.

""People have been in a difficult situation for 12 days. There is no electricity, water or heating in the city. There is almost no mobile communication. The last reserves of food and water are running out,"" the council said.

Russian forces have continued to shell non-military targets in the southern port city and several attempts at civilian evacuations have failed due to the fighting.

Taking Mariupol and other ports on the Azov Sea could allow Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.

The EU fears that the total number of Ukrainian refugees might reach 5 million if the war continues

Russia, Ukraine both speak of progress in cease-fire talks

Russian and Ukrainian officials gave their most optimistic assessments yet of progress on cease-fire talks, suggesting there could be positive results within days.

""We will not concede in principle on any positions,"" Ukrainian negotiator and presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in a video posted online. He added that the Kremlin now understands this and ""is already beginning to talk constructively.""

""I think that we will achieve some results literally in a matter of days,"" he said.

Russia's Interfax news agency cited a Russian delegate, Leonid Slutsky, as saying the talks had made substantial progress.

""According to my personal expectations, in the coming days this progress may grow into a joint position of both delegations, into documents for signing,"" Slutsky said.

Neither side indicated what the scope of any agreement might be.

Missile attack near Lviv

An area outside the major western Ukrainian city of Lviv was targeted by a missile attack early Sunday.

Eight missiles are believed to have been fired at Ukraine's Center for International Peacekeeping and Security, according to Lviv's Regional Military Administration on Telegram. The center is located in Yavoriv, not far from the Polish border and some 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Lviv.

Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskyy said on Telegram that 35 people have died in the strike and a further 134 were injured.

The strike on the military base could possibly be a Russian message intended for NATO. The US and other NATO countries previously conducted training exercises with the Ukrainian military at the center called Rapid Trident 21, according to the US Army website.

A Ukrainian general cited by the US army website said the Rapid Trident 21 exercises held at the Yavoriv center were ""not just another stage of military skills improvement, but also an important step towards Ukraine's European integration.""

Ukraine's defense minister said in a tweet that ""foreign instructors"" work at the training center. A NATO official told Reuters news agency that there was no alliance personnel at the base.

The mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk, Ruslan Martsinkiv, said on Facebook that the western Ukrainian city's airport was also targeted in an attack early Sunday.

Zelenskyy warns of new pro-Russia 'pseudo republics' in Ukraine

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed fellow Ukrainians in an online speech and reiterated their right to live in their land on their own terms.

Zelenskyy also said Russian forces would create new people's republics in captured territories, similar to those operating in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014. Moscow recognized the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk ""people's republics"" immediately before its invasion of Ukraine.

""The occupiers on the territory of the Kherson region are trying to repeat the sad experience of the formation of pseudo republics,"" Zelenskyy said.

""They are blackmailing local leaders, putting pressure on deputies, looking for someone to bribe,"" he added.

Zelenskyy said such ""pseudo republics"" would end up being isolated from the rest of the world and face poverty, crime and exodus.

Zelenskyy said the withdrawal of IT professionals, businesses and artists from Russia was the fate that awaited Donetsk and Luhansk as well.

Towns and villages in the Kherson region have been under occupation by Russian troops since the first days of the war.

Urging Ukrainians to continue their fight, he said they would regain what is theirs. ""Ukraine will not forget. Ukraine will find and prosecute,"" he said.

Zelenskyy said the agreed-upon humanitarian corridors worked and that aid would be arriving in Mariupol on Sunday.

Intense bombardments and fighting continue in multiple cities across the frontline, particularly in Mariupol where sustained Russian attacks and dwindling supplies undermine the defence. This morning, 14 March, an apartment block in the Obolon district of northern Kyiv was shelled, leaving at least two dead, while air strikes in Sumy, Chernihiv and Mykolaiv have left numerous further civilians dead. Notably, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov today accused the US and EU of “provoking” Russia into storming Ukrainian cities. According to Peskov, President Vladimir Putin has given orders to hold back on an immediate assault on large cities “because the civilian losses would be large”, though he did state that the Kremlin hasn’t ruled out taking Ukrainian cities under its “full control”.

This morning, 14 March, an apartment block in the Obolon district of northern Kyiv was shelled, leaving at least two dead, while air strikes in Sumy, Chernihiv and Mykolaiv have left numerous further civilians dead.

According to Peskov, President Vladimir Putin has given orders to hold back on an immediate assault on large cities “because the civilian losses would be large”, though he did state that the Kremlin hasn’t ruled out taking Ukrainian cities under its “full control”. This comes as Russian forces continue to tighten their perimeter and concentrate a significant amount of combat power around Kyiv. While it remains to be seen whether a frontal assault on Kyiv will occur in the coming days, the Kremlin’s statements reinforce our assessment that Russian forces will want to avoid protracted urban fighting if possible. In a direct assault, the Russians would face extremely high casualties, particularly after the defenders have had almost three weeks to prepare the city’s defences. Instead, other reports continue to indicate that Russian forces are purposefully targeting critical food and water sources in key cities, with an air raid destroying a water pump at the Chernihivvodokanal pumping station, which provides water to the city of Chernihiv. As such, it remains highly likely that Russian forces will continue to cut off supplies to Kyiv and other cities to avoid unnecessary military casualties on their part, while tightening the perimeter to the north, west, east and increasingly south. The siege of Mariupol will likely prove the most important precedent in this respect, though Russian forces will likely be more reticent to bombard Kyiv to the same intensity given the city’s symbolic status and potential seat of a puppet pro-Russian regime.

As such, it remains highly likely that Russian forces will continue to cut off supplies to Kyiv and other cities to avoid unnecessary military casualties on their part, while tightening the perimeter to the north, west, east and increasingly south. The siege of Mariupol will likely prove the most important precedent in this respect, though Russian forces will likely be more reticent to bombard Kyiv to the same intensity given the city’s symbolic status and potential seat of a puppet pro-Russian regime. Ukraine’s national energy company, Ukrenergo, stated on 14 March that the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant had once again lost power. Russian forces have reportedly damaged a high-voltage power line for the second time, coming only days after power was restored after the first incident. There is currently around 20 tons of nuclear waste which must be constantly cooled to prevent the release of radiation from the plant, which sustained disruptions to power supplies will put at risk. The plant is reportedly relying on back-up diesel generators. Ukrainian officials last week alleged that Russian forces could stage a false-flag incident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant.

According to sources cited in a Wall Street Journal article published on 13 March, Russian prosecutors have issued warnings to numerous prominent Western multinationals in Russia, threatening asset seizures and arrests of officials of firms looking to withdraw from the country. While the Russian Embassy in the US has denied these claims, Russian authorities have reportedly issued the warnings via letters, calls and in-person visits to companies including Coca-Cola Co., McDonald’s Corp., Procter & Gamble Co., International Business Machines Corp. and Yum Brands Inc. Specifically, they reportedly threatened to arrest officials who have criticised the government as well as threatened to seize company assets, including intellectual property. These reports reinforce earlier assessments that the business environment for Western firms will continue to deteriorate, with de facto nationalisations increasingly likely for firms that have taken a stand opposing the war in Ukraine and moved to cease their Russian operations. The warnings of arrest underline in particular the mounting threats of arbitrary detention and legal action against executives, with the FSB likely conducting investigations into these firms, with corresponding attempts to intercept corporate communications and those between staff members.

However, indirect pressure is also mounting on multinationals operating in Russia from the Ukrainian government. Today, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called for a global boycott of international companies that have kept their operations in Russia. This is the latest development in a materialising “name and shame” campaign we first identified as a key indicator last week (see our attached Tripwires and Triggers report), and while Kuleba has not yet named any specific company, it is likely Kyiv will do so in the coming days as it clearly intends to orchestrate a global boycott campaign. This underscores the mounting reputational risk for firms retaining operations inside Russia, with the Ukrainian government likely to utilise its considerable media and social media influence to encourage pro-Ukrainian activist groups to organise boycott campaigns in key international markets. Looking ahead, this will also increase the risk of physical activism targeting headquarters and sites of boycotted firms in Europe and North America in particular.

In line with Russia’s growing offensive against social media platforms and efforts to establish control over the information landscape, Instagram was blocked on 14 March. The move to restrict Instagram follows its parent company, Meta’s, decision last week to allow users to post messages calling for violence against Russians and the death of President Vladimir Putin. Instagram is one of the most popular platforms amongst young Russians and its designation as a “restricted” resource – along with the blocking of Facebook and Twitter – will further limit the available information regarding the war in Ukraine. More broadly, as Putin has failed to achieve a quick victory in Ukraine and the number of casualties continues to grow, the clampdown on social media will only intensify, with information sharing platforms in general having become somewhat of a battleground between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian accounts. The Kremlin will also continue deploying Russian speaking social media influencers to spread its narrative and justify the invasion. Additionally, as the war evolves, so will the Kremlin’s methods to spread false information and spin the narrative in its favour for the domestic audience.

On 14 March, Reuters cited numerous unnamed officials in the Indian government that New Delhi is considering taking up a Russian offer for discounted oil and other key export commodities. According to the officials, such an arrangement would be paid for through a proposed ruble-rupee trade mechanism. India currently imports over 80% of its oil and derived products, but only 2-3% is sourced from Russia. However, cheap Russian oil exports will likely prove an attractive alternative for New Delhi amid rising oil and related commodity prices and an inflation rate now over 13%. New Delhi was notably already considering increasing Russian oil imports prior to the invasion in order to diversify its supply and reduce dependency upon Middle Eastern exporters. Furthermore, Indian state-owned firms retain stakes in numerous Russian oilfields and joint ventures in the sector. As such, the signing of new import contracts may also serve to protect these joint ventures in the face of mounting international sanctions and reduce costs, as India faces an increase of USD 50 billion in its import bill for the 2022-23 financial year. Nevertheless, such contracts would take time to implement if New Delhi agrees, providing limited scope for the Indian market to make up significant shortfalls in Russian revenues in the short term, as Russia continues to struggle to find buyers for its commodities.

In related developments, US officials claimed on 13 March that Russia has asked China for weapons and financial aid. Both Chinese and Russian authorities have denied the claims, and while the US has provided no details as to the exact form of the request, it is likely aimed at mitigating shortages of key munitions, components and spare parts. The abrupt withdrawal of Western firms from Russia has severely disrupted Russian supply chains, including military ones, and as the war extends into its third week the Russian armed forces will likely be running low on some equipment and munitions. Washington has indicated its growing concern over China’s potential role in the current conflict, with financial or military aid likely to undermine Western sanction efforts. Nevertheless, overt financial or military assistance would risk international economic penalties on Chinese firms and significantly worsen Beijing’s already tense trading relations with the US. As such, it remains unclear whether Beijing will agree to Russia’s request considering it is unlikely to want to prolong a conflict which is having such a negative impact on international energy and commodity stability.

whilst Syria and other Middle East countries are supplying 16000 soldiers. Russia has already used 4000 conscripts although mass mobilisation is not expected. Russia has stalled its advances whilst it reorganises its Command And Control systems to lessen losses. Vehicle losses have fallen with helicopters escorting convoys. No country has deployed 200,000 troops since 1945 so there are lessons being learnt as the Russians advance; 45,000 body bags were prepared prior to the invasion so heavy casualties were expected. Mobile crematoria have also been seen. Reports sugest that Russian troops in the Donbas region are using their cmmms systems according to tactics, thus they don’t need to keep the 4G airwaves open for open comms using mobile phones.

Russia’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) claims to have destroyed a military airfield in Vasylkiv, southwest of Kyiv, using high-precision weapons on 12 March. The location is Ukraine’s main centre for signals intelligence in the city of Brovary, east of the capital. Claims have not yet been independently verified, though videos released on social media platforms purportedly show a plume of smoke over the military airfield. It must be noted that despite Russian sources reporting their use of precision weaponry, the British MoD reports that Russian tactical aircraft supporting the advance of ground troops are primarily relying on unguided “dumb” munitions. These weapons are relatively indiscriminate, thereby increasing the likelihood of civilian casualties, particularly in densely populated urban areas.

On 12 March, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov stated that Moscow has warned the US that it could target Western arms shipments to Ukraine. During the press conference, Ryabkov said “that pumping weapons from a number of countries it orchestrates isn’t just a dangerous move, it’s an action that makes those convoys legitimate targets”. This aligns with previous assessments that Russia is unlikely to continue tolerating the shipments of critical military equipment, including MANPADS and anti-tank weaponry, without some sort of response, particularly as Ukrainian resistance continues to stall Russia’s offensives. Preventing these shipments will be a key medium-term goal of the Kremlin in order to prevent, or mitigate the potential for, the current war descending into a protracted insurgency supported by Western arms supplies. Ryabkov did not clarify whether the “legitimate targets” would apply to convoys that had crossed the border into Ukraine or also those convoys that had yet to cross the border. At this stage it remains most likely that Russian forces would target known convoys only once they are inside Ukraine, given the escalatory nature of any attack in a NATO country, even if perceived as a legitimate military target. Nevertheless, that remains a potential point of escalation in the coming weeks and months if Western countries do not cease supplying arms to Ukraine, but further warnings would likely pre-empt such an attack given Russia’s desire to avoid an unnecessary escalation.

On 12 March the head of the Russian space agency Dmitry Rogozin warned that sanctions against Russia could lead to the International Space Station (ISS) to crash. He called for sanctions to be lifted because they could disrupt the operations of Russian spacecraft servicing the ISS. Given that the Russian section of the station helps correct its ISS’s orbit, Rogozin has warned that this could cause the structure to fall into the sea or land. NASA have previously stated that they are working on a solution to maintain the ISS’s orbit without Russian assistance, but Rogozin’s comments are likely designed to remind the international community of the further escalatory levers available to Moscow that could disrupt the space sector.

Following strikes on Belarusian villages across the border with Ukraine by Russian forces on 11 March, Ukrainian officials claim that an attack by Belarusian forces is imminent. On 12 March, the Belarusian government announced that it is sending five battalion tactical groups to replace the ones deployed at the Ukrainian borders. However, the Lukashenka government continues to state that it does not plan to join the Russian invasion of Ukraine, though Russian pressure is likely mounting on Minsk to more openly support offensive operations.

However, the Lukashenka government continues to state that it does not plan to join the Russian invasion of Ukraine, though Russian pressure is likely mounting on Minsk to more openly support offensive operations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that Russian forces have kidnapped the mayor of the south-eastern city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov. On 11 March, officials released video footage of what appears to be armed soldiers escorting Fedorov out of a building in the city centre, though the identity of the individual cannot be verified from the video. The alleged abduction comes days after Fedorov publicly refused to cooperate with occupying Russian forces, claiming they had ransacked government offices and exiled his team. In response, hundreds of residents have gathered outside district administrative buildings demanding that Russian forces release the mayor. The protests themselves do not represent a novel development, as Melitopol residents have conducted demonstrations every day since Russian forces captured the city on 26 February. However, Zelensky claims that the abduction marks a “new stage of terror” in the invasion, with Russian forces looking to “physically eliminate representatives of legitimate local Ukrainian authorities” in a bid to suppress organised resistance to occupation. However, strong opposition among residents will elevate the risk of violent clashes between Ukrainian civilians and Russian forces, who are likely to seek to quell dissent and crush popular opposition among residents.

Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, announced that regular humanitarian corridors will open today, 12 March, from 0900 (local time), 0700 GMT, to facilitate civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid shipments. In particular, an aid and bus convoy will depart from Zaporizhzhia to the city of Mariupol via Vasylivka, Melitopol, Berdyansk and Manhush. There is also a corridor between the town of Pology, Zaporizhzhia region, in the direction of Zaporizhzhia, passing Tokmak, Vasylivka and Kamianske. A number of routes will also be operating in the Kyiv and Sumy regions. However, Russian shelling and possible clashes with Ukrainian forces are likely to generate disruptions to routes throughout the day, delaying civilians evacuations and aid deliveries, as indicated by reports over the past week.

On 12 March the Deputy of Kherson Regional Council Serhiy Khlan alleged that Russian occupying forces are preparing to stage a referendum in Kherson oblast with the aim of proclaiming the region the KhNR. Russia has utilised similar referenda in the past, most notably in occupied-Crimea, but this latest development aligns with similar unconfirmed reports last week that pro-Russian citizens in Ivano-Frankivsk oblast had been planning to declare a separatist republic in Western Ukraine. This may indicate Russian plans to effectively dismember a unitary Ukraine into a federation made up of separate oblasts. InformNapalm yesterday, 11 March, published unverified reports allegedly outlining plans for how Russia intends to control Ukraine during and after the war that had allegedly been circulated among high-ranking officials and military personnel. The report included the option of holding referenda (organised by local self-government bodies) on the secession of respective regions from Ukraine as a means of controlling the country. It should be stated that this report remains unconfirmed, but the statement of the Kherson official today would align with this. If such a referendum is held, which remains very plausible given precedents in Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, this would strongly suggest this is what the Russians plan in other oblasts across the country, with the likely ultimate aim of disempowering the unitary government in Kyiv.

FORECAST

A new round of talks between Ukraine and Russia commenced today, 14 March. Despite the Ukrainian side continuing to demand an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops, this latest round of discussions is taking place following a deadly air strike on a residential building in Kyiv and Russia’s allegations that a shot-down Ukrainian missile killed over a dozen civilians in Donetsk. As such, the prospects of today’s negotiations achieving a breakthrough are minimal. Nevertheless, the economic impact of the sanctions is already being felt across Russian society and Putin’s inability to secure a quick victory in Ukraine may be one of the reasons for Moscow’s reported appeal to China for military aid – though the Kremlin has denied this. Meanwhile, the investment climate in Russia will continue to deteriorate, with reports of Russian authorities threatening to arrest officials who have criticised the government and threatening to seize assets from companies that have taken an anti-Russia stance set to only increase in the weeks ahead.

Regarding evacuation and safe passage out of Kyiv and into western Ukraine, as of 14 March, the southbound H01 remains a comparatively safer route for access to/exit from Kyiv, then connecting with westbound roads such as the P32 through Bila Tserkva. Russian forces bombarded the Vasylkiv airport on 12 March, highlighting the elevated security risks posed by airstrikes on routes southwest and south of Kyiv as Russian ground troops continue to face challenges encircling the capital. For evacuation from Kyiv, therefore, the window for safe departure is increasingly limited. Russian armour and infantry units continue to be dispersed around the forests north and south of the E40, and as such, this route remains unsafe. It is likely that Russian mechanised forces will continue pushing south towards Fastiv to establish full control over the P04 route as well. As such, Byshev Airport on the westbound P04 remains a likely target for the Russian push to encircle Kyiv. No fighting in the airport’s premises has been observed as of this Alert’s publication, but we consider this to be a likely target for Russian forces. In comparative terms, therefore, the H01/P01 remains the safest route out of the city, although any travel is undertaken at one’s own risk as all approaches to Kyiv are vulnerable to shelling or missile strikes.

SOCMINT indicates ad-hoc checkpoints and stop-and-search checks by Ukrainian rear echelon units continue to take place on the P02, P69, M07 circular and H01/P01 in Kyiv. These are likely conducted in order to identify potential Russian fifth columnists/saboteurs, and Ukrainian units conducting these checks are believed to be operating on capture/kill orders. As such those seeking to leave/enter Kyiv should treat such checks with due caution.

Russia: Corporate flight likely to persist despite threats of arrests and seizures to foreign entities

On 13 March, local sources cited by international media claimed that Russian prosecutors have issued warnings to several foreign entities which have suspended in-country operations, such as Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Procter & Gamble. Allegedly Russian authorities have made threats to arrest officials who have criticised the government or to seize company assets, including intellectual property. The warnings have reportedly driven at least one of the targeted companies to limit communications between its Russian business and the rest of the firm, amid concerns that the Russian government could intercept colleagues’ text messages and emails. Such intimidation tactics and threats underscore the continuous decline of the country’s business environment, likely to persist in the coming weeks despite Moscow’s efforts to dissuade further corporate and capital flight to mitigate the economic impact of broad international sanctions.

Flares in regional tensions and Russian invasion of Ukraine threaten the revival of the nuclear deal

EU officials have confirmed the suspension of nuclear deal talks with Iran and the other signatories, citing unresolved “external factors”. Russian requests have certainly complicated the process, however, other key sticking points also remain unresolved including Iran’s demand for guarantees that no US president can leave a future deal and disagreements over access to undeclared sites for the International Atomic Energy Agency. Amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, US-Russian tensions are almost certainly at the forefront of Moscow and Washington’s foreign policy concerns, overtaking nuclear deal developments. As such, despite its commitment to preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear-armed state, Russia could increasingly exploit nuclear talks and warming relations with Iran as leverage against Western powers if military advances in Ukraine stall. As such, the Kremlin may be somewhat willing to overlook certain Iranian actions, bolstering hardline Iranian forces and their targeting of US-linked targets across the Middle East and Gulf. At the same time, Iranian frustration is growing as talks stall once again. Despite hardline rhetoric from Tehran, the government’s urgency for sanctions relief is deepening as domestic unrest grows following the winter period. Notably, protests in Iran are increasingly triggered by more diverse issues, though water insecurity and mismanagement are common drivers. As anti-government sentiment spreads, including in typically conservative strongholds, Iranian security forces including the IRGC are likely to engage in more hostile activities abroad.

Iran-Iraq: Missile strike elevates renewed Israel-Iran tit-for-tat hostilities; heightening threats to military targets and regional travel

On 13 March, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards announced they had carried out a missile attack overnight on Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan, claiming responsibility for the targeting of Israeli “strategic centres”. While this is not the first incident of this kind, with Iran targeting the same location in April 2021, the attack comes amid deteriorating relations with Moscow and Washington on the Iranian nuclear talks in Vienna, with Russia’s latest demands stalling an agreement. With the attack likely conducted in response to Israeli strikes which killed Iranian military personnel in Syria last week, the incident may prompt a broader return to tit-for-tat hostilities with Israel at a critical time for nuclear negotiations. This may drive further Iran-linked strikes on targets in the Kurdistan region, though with less frequency than those in Iraq in the coming months, elevating threats to overland travel and the targeting of military bases in the near term.

On 13 March, Iran struck US-linked targets in Erbil in the northern Kurdistan region of Iraq with a dozen ballistic missiles. Iranian state news sources published reports claiming that Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) missiles had struck Israeli ‘strategic centres’, though local authorities report that the attacks landed near the US consulate but did not cause any casualties or severe structural damage. The timing, location and purported target of the strikes is slightly unusual, and could instead be linked to Iraqi government formation negotiations as Iran-backed Shia groups struggle to maintain political influence following losses in October 2021 elections. Notably, Kurdish parties can play an important role in forming a governing majority, and Iran seeks to maintain its political influence via its proxy networks. Regardless of motive, Iranian insecurities regarding Iraq and the nuclear deal, the attack on US-linked targets and the subsequent claim of responsibility all raise the risk of further regional hostilities. Missile strikes elevate the risk of a return to tit-for-tat hostilities between Israel and Iran. The targeting of US-linked forces in Iraqi Kurdistan, by either by Iranian forces or Iran-linked militia in Iraq, is not unprecedented, however, there had been no major strikes in recent months before the 13 March attack. Iranian state media released a statement by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) claiming responsibility for the attacks in retaliation to Israeli airstrikes in Syria which killed two IRGC members on 7 March. Such tit-for-tat hostilities have occurred sporadically in recent years during bouts of elevated tensions; for instance, Israeli forces launched airstrikes on Iran-linked targets in northeast Damascus in April 2021, after Iranian missiles exploded near Israel’s Dimona nuclear reactor. The latest strikes moderately elevate the risk of a return to tit-for-tat attacks, though Israel is unlikely to engage in overtly escalatory responses to an attack beyond its borders. That said, the strikes come at a pivotal time in negotiations to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. Russian demands that its trade with Iran be shielded from Western sanctions following the invasion on Ukraine, and Washington’s rejection of such a request, will likely disrupt progress towards an agreement. This could prompt Iran to harden its stance in talks as it desperately seeks sanctions relief. Notably, if Iran undertakes further nuclear advancements to pressure the signatories of the deal to ease sanctions, Israel would be more inclined to act. Israel’s very public rejection of the nuclear agreement and concerns over Iranian nuclear developments has previously taken the form of attacks on Iran’s critical infrastructure, cyber warfare and attacks in the maritime sphere.

Forecast

The latest strikes on Erbil suggest that Iran will continue to target US-linked locations in Iraq in particular, especially if Iran fears a loss of influence in Iraq or in the event of further Israeli strikes in Syria, with the IRGC’s overt claim of responsibility a further indication of more brazen military action in countries such as Iraq and across the Gulf. Should this lead to a resurgence in tit-for-tat incidents, commercial shipping lanes in the region will remain vulnerable to low-level attacks and cyber attacks could target critical or government infrastructure. Any spill over of hostilities could also drive aerial threats to Saudi Arabia and the UAE from Iran-backed Houthi. Notably, negotiations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have significantly deteriorated in recent days despite the two states being scheduled to meet for the fifth round of diplomatic talks this week. Moreover, Iran’s hardline government will likely consider the UAE an acceptable target due to its deepening economic ties with Israel.

Mali: Wagner group presence threatens effectiveness of France’s aerial support

On 11 March, the commander of Operation Barkhane, General Laurent Michon, announced that France will provide aerial support to Malian troops following the withdrawal of its counter-insurgency mission. However, the country will only be offering support to areas where Russian fighters of the private military contract group Wagner are not operating. France announced its decision to withdraw from Mali last month, following elevated tensions after the junta postponed elections by five years and the Wagner group contactors arrived in the country. France’s refusal to operate in the areas where Wagner contractors are present, which is currently Timbuktu and areas in the Mopti region, will undermine the capacity of aerial support to maintain raid response capabilities. Furthermore, deteriorated relations between Malian and French forces will likely impede co-operation efforts, threatening the effectiveness of air strikes as France will rely on Malian forces to identify accurate targets and call in strikes.

Mozambique: Cyclone Gombe will prolong disruptions to business operations

On 11 March, Cyclone Gombe struck north-eastern Mozambique, killing at least 11 people and impacting an estimated 15,000 people in Nampula and Zambezia provinces. Strong winds of up to 200 kilometres per hour destroyed infrastructure and landfall blocked roads across both provinces. Although the winds have weakened, heavy rainfall is expected to last for several days, heightening threats of flooding in Mozambique’s low-lying areas. Flooding has already devastated crops across the provinces, with food insecurity and poverty elevating threats of domestic unrest. Furthermore, 37 energy stations have reportedly been impacted, elevating threats of further power outages hindering businesses operations and communications. Cyclone Gombe is likely to exacerbate damage and impede the repair of roads following Storm Ana in January, sustaining disruption to overland movement between both southern and northern Mozambique and Malawian supply chains reliant on the Quelimane port corridor.

Ethiopia: Summary execution underlines threats to ethnic Tigrayans and will undermine efforts to remove sanctions

On 13 March, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission confirmed that Ethiopian military forces summarily executed 11 people, including burning one alive, on 3 March. The incident followed an ambush, likely by the Benishangul People’s Liberation Movement (BPLM) rebel group, on a convoy of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam workers in Metekel, Benishangul-Gumuz region in which 20 soldiers, three civilians and 30 rebels were killed. Despite the likely involvement of the BPLM, authorities often accuse the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) of having coordinated rebel activity, sporadically elevating threats to ethnic Tigrayans following rebel activity across Ethiopia. As such, the following day soldiers targeted ethnic Tigrayans, eight of whom were pulled off a civilian bus to be executed. Despite government pledges to punish the perpetrators the incident is likely to undermine efforts to improve relations with western governments and remove sanctions, as rights abuses undermine government pledges to pursue peace.

14 Mar 22. The US has told allies that China signalled its willingness to provide military assistance to Russia to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to officials familiar with American diplomatic cables on the exchange. The cables, which were sent by the US state department to allies in Europe and Asia, did not say whether China had signalled that it would help Russia in the future or if it had already started providing military support. Nor did they say at which point in the conflict Beijing appeared open to offering the help. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Russia had made the request for assistance at some point after the start of the now three-week invasion. The Russian offer and Chinese response have sounded alarm bells in the White House. US officials believe China is trying to help Russia while its top officials publicly call for a diplomatic solution to the war. The Chinese embassy in the US on Sunday said it had no knowledge of any Russian request or positive Chinese response to Moscow. Russia on Monday also denied making any request to China. A senior US defence official declined to say if China had provided military support after the Russian request, but said the Pentagon was watching the situation “very, very closely”. “If China does choose to materially support Russia in this war, there will likely be consequences for China,” the defence official said.

BATTLESPACE Comment: Sources suggest that Russia has asked for a variety of UAVs including sUAVs and the Chinese Phantom UAV, tactical radios and precision missiles. It is likely that China may baulk at supplying lethal weapons for fear of US reprisals.

14 Mar 22. The head of Russia’s National Guard has said that Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine is not going as quickly as the Kremlin had wanted, in the strongest public acknowledgement yet that the invasion is not going to plan. Viktor Zolotov blamed the slower-than-expected progress on what he said were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians, an accusation repeatedly made by officials in Russia. If Vladimir Putin has the choice of a humiliating defeat, which could bring his regime’s survival into question, or further escalation he may well double down on his bloody war.

14 Mar 22. U.S. Strategy and the Real Lessons of the War in Ukraine: From Cooperation with Russia and China to Lasting Confrontation.

By Anthony H. Cordesman

Read Online: cs.is/3tOouA4

No one can yet predict just how much of a human tragedy the Russian invasion of Ukraine will create. What the U.S. and its strategic partners can predict, however, is that Russia will be a lasting threat as long as Putin or anyone like him remains in power. What is also equally clear is that while China may be less openly provocative and threatening, its competition with the United States presents a steadily growing threat, and China is moving from cooperation and civil competition to the possibility of a major military confrontation as well. If anything, President Xi has already proved that China can create a far more effective threat than Russia over the coming decade, and President Xi already controls a far a larger economy than President Putin.

China already sharply outspends Russia in building up its military forces. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) estimates that Russia officially spent only $62.2 bn in FY 2021, although this is a high estimate based on comparative purchasing power – and it could be as high as $178bn. Russia’s military spending is sharply limited by its weak economy, and it cannot credibly do anything in the face of continued sanctions that will allow it to compete with the IISS estimate of $754bn for the United States and over $300bn for NATO European countries.

The World Bank does estimate that Russia did partly recover from the breakup of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) from a gross national product (GNP) of only $667bn in 1998 to $1,416bn in 2020 (measured in constant 2015 dollars), but this compares to $19,435 bn for the U.S. in 2020 (14 times larger) and $13,886 for the European Union (9.8 times larger).

In contrast, the World Bank estimates that China has seen its GDP rise from $1,123bn in 1991 to $14,632bn in 2020 (measured in constant 2015 dollars) – a figure 13 times larger than in 1991. China has steadily increased its official figures for military spending for over two decades, alongside its expanding economy. It officially spent $207.3bn on its military in 2021 according to the IISS, and its purchasing power could already be as high as $332bn. Some estimates indicate that China could equal the U.S. by 2035-2040.

For all the talk of resuming the Cold War, the reality is radically different. The United States and its strategic partners now confront two superpowers – not just one – and powers that pose both a global as well as a regional challenge. A rising China is also becoming the most serious threat. It is becoming a serious nuclear power, it is modernizing its conventional forces far more quickly than Russia, and it is a growing technological rival to the U.S. and its partners. Its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as well as its global trade and investment efforts are also a far more effective method to use its civil-economic power to win strategic influence.

Accordingly, the U.S. needs to do far more than simply react to the war in Ukraine and help to rebuild NATO. The challenge is global, and it will increase every year. The real lesson of the war in Ukraine is that the U.S. must now plan to work with its strategic partners indefinitely into the future and in ways that meet both authoritarian threats.

14 Mar 22. Chinese diplomats and prominent state media have repeated Russian disinformation reports about US-run biological laboratories in Ukraine, deepening tensions between Washington and Beijing ahead of a critical security meeting in Europe. Yang Jiechi, China’s top foreign policy official, and Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, will meet in Rome on Monday, the first face-to-face meeting between senior China and US officials since Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine. The talks come against a backdrop of rising frustration in the west over China’s relationship with Russia and Beijing’s refusal to condemn the invasion. The Financial Times reported on Monday that Russia has asked China for military ​equipment to ​support its invasion of Ukraine, sparking concern in ​the White House that Beijing ​could undermine western efforts to help Ukrainian forces defend their country. However, China’s official rhetoric on the Ukraine conflict over the weekend concentrated on allegations that the US was using Ukraine to research dangerous pathogens and biological weapons.

11 Mar 22. Sensing a feeding frenzy, German arms makers jockey for position. German companies are jockeying for position as the government tees up massive investments meant to drastically improve the state of the armed forces. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Feb. 27 proposal to ramp up defense expenditures by tens of billions of euros, spurred by Russia’s war on Ukraine, has defense officials in Berlin scrambling to identify spending opportunities that promise fast results, according to several company officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. So hasty is the process that a key official in the Defence Ministry’s acquisition office, Vice Adm. Carsten Stawitzki, signaled to company executives that certain acquisition rules could be outright circumvented in service of quick deliveries. Companies also were put on notice that they should drop outstanding procurement disputes on the docket with the ministry in order to partake in upcoming work.

“It’s all completely ad hoc at the moment,” said an industry official.

The nascent spending strategy appears to coalesce around three objectives, according to industry sources:

Clearing the maintenance backlog across the services to get hardware back to the force, even if it means cutting corners.

Increasing by 50% the volume of main weapon systems, which could mean more Puma infantry fighting vehicles, more K-130 corvettes and more Pegasus spy planes.

Finalizing only longer-term investments for which plans are already on the books. This category includes the Future Combat Air System, a next-generation aerial weapon led by Germany, France and Spain; the Main Ground Combat System, a pan-European tank project; and the Tornado replacement program, which could bring the F-35 jet to Germany in a dual-capable role under NATO’s nuclear sharing doctrine.

A spokesperson for the Defence Ministry did not return a request for comment on acquisition guidelines accompanying the proposed spending uptick. The prospect of more defense funding also puts the spotlight on Germany’s air and missile defense capabilities, moving companies to position themselves in a market where defense officials have unsuccessfully tried to move past the venerable Patriot system. Rheinmetall and MBDA Italy signed a memorandum of understanding this week aimed at finding “disruptive technologies and in the national and European defence funds domain” in air defense, per a joint statement. In that partnership, Rheinmetall bills itself as the air-defense and radar specialist, while MBDA would provide future interceptors. In the lower-tier segment, German officials are expected to fall back on a setup featuring the IRIS-T interceptor, as proposed by manufacturer Diehl in conjunction with Hensoldt and Rheinmetall in March 2021. The companies’ package of missiles, radars and launch vehicles is meant to intercept aircraft, combat helicopters and cruise missiles, a weapon mix similar to the Russian arsenal used in the invasion of Ukraine. The former government of Chancellor Angela Merkel quietly approved the export of IRIS-T firing units to Egypt, a controversial deal that became public only after Scholz assumed office. Now, one consideration for a speedier acquisition of an air defense shield is to route some elements not yet delivered to Cairo into Berlin’s stocks instead.

14 Mar 22. Russia Attacks Kiev with Kalashnikov Kamikaze Drones. Russian troops have used small kamikaze drones known as KUB in attacks on the Ukrainian capital this week. One of Russian drones was shot down in the Podil neighborhood in Kyiv on Saturday. The light Unmanned Aerial System shot down was a kind of kamikaze drone known as KUB. The small UAS is developed by Russia’s most famous gun manufacturer Kalashnikov subsidiary ZALA Aero. It is designed to have a maximum speed of about 80 miles per hour, an endurance of 30 minutes, and an explosive payload of 7 pounds against “remote ground targets.” Kalashnikov says the drone — which can have a dwell time up to six hours — is an extremely precise and very effective weapon, incredibly hard to fight by traditional air defense systems. After the launch, the drone can loiter in the air to detect a target and then attack it from the upper hemisphere, being able to perform a diving pass along the vertical trajectory. The drone, which was shot down over Kyiv, contained explosives (plastids) with metal balls to inflict maximum human damage. (Source: UAS VISION/Defence Blog)

14 Mar 22. Ukraine’s leader expressed tentative hope for ceasefire talks on Monday even as Russian forces continued to shell his country’s cities, leaving hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in siege conditions. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said his representatives were discussing a possible meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, as negotiators noted some positive movement on issues of substance in recent days. A fourth round of talks began on Monday morning, covering “peace, ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops [and] security guarantees”, according to Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky. “Hard discussion,” he added in a tweet before the meeting via video link, warning that Russia still appeared to be under the “delusion that 19 days of violence against peaceful cities is the right strategy”.

14 Mar 22. Runaway Soviet-Era Drone Crashes in Croatia. A Soviet-era reconnaissance drone flying across Hungary from Ukraine has crashed near the Croatian capital of Zagreb, leaving a big hole in the ground, the Croatian government says. An explosion was heard near Lake Jarun in Zagreb at around 11pm on Thursday. Police said several vehicles had been damaged and two parachutes found.

The incident raises two questions:

Where did it come from ?

It seems that this was actually a Tupolev Tu-141 “Strizh” reconnaissance drone that must have severely malfunctioned and crossed over the entirety of Hungary or parts of neighboring countries and into Croatia from Ukraine. Flying direct from Ukraine’s border to Zagreb is nearly a 350-mile journey. It has been reported that Ukraine has been putting the high-speed, Soviet-era drones to work in recent days following Russia’s invasion of the country. Ukraine is the only known current operator of the Tu-141.

The Tu-141 is a fascinating piece of Soviet-era hardware that Ukraine has upgraded and made useful following the invasion of Crimea in 2014. More of a cruise missile than a traditional drone, the aircraft is rocket-launched from its trailer and flies a predetermined course at transonic speed, collecting various forms of intelligence, before recovering via parachute. It can then be reset and used again.

It’s also possible that Russia has pulled some of these out of storage to act as crude decoys in a ploy to stimulate Ukraine’s air defenses, but we have no proof of this at this time. This crashed example would have been beyond its stated range from the Russian border, although it could have reached Zagreb if it was launched from Belarus.

Markiyan Lubkivsky, the chief adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister, told Croatian newspaper Jutarnji List that the crashed device did not belong to Ukraine and that the Ukrainian foreign ministry would later issue a statement on the incident.

“This drone did not have Ukrainian markings,” he was quoted as saying. “There were red stars on it” — a symbol of the Russian military.

Why was it not intercepted by NATO ?

“NATO’s integrated air and missile defence tracked the flight path of an object which subsequently crashed in Zagreb,” a NATO official confirmed in a statement. Hungarian authorities are also investigating the incident as “the airspace of several NATO member states, including Hungary, was involved in the drone flight,” foreign minister Péter Szijjártó said on Facebook.

Zagreb mayor Tomislav Tomašević said it was crucial

“to determine who piloted the aircraft and where it came from and to ensure that it never happens again”.

He said parts of the flying object are scattered in several locations and that it is incredible that no one was hurt.

A statement issued by Croatia’s government said the “pilotless military aircraft” crashed seven minutes after entering Croatia’s airspace from neighbouring Hungary at a speed of 700 kilometres per hour and an altitude of 1,300 metres.

According to a Press Release by the Romanian Ministry of National Defence Information and Public Relations Directorate

The Romanian air surveillance system picked up the signal of a low surface aircraft, Thursday March 10, most probably an UAV, that crossed the national air space for a very short time, under three minutes.

The Romanian air surveillance system picked up the signal of a low surface aircraft, Thursday March 10, most probably an UAV, that crossed the national air space for a very short time, under three minutes.

The aircraft entered the Romanian air space at approximately 2323 HRS, coming from Ukraine, and left the national air space at approximately 2326 HRS, heading towards Hungary.

The very short time for which this aircraft had flown through national air space, the high speed and low altitude, as well as the terrain and weather conditions at the time, did not allow engaging of other procedural means in order to further identity the aircraft.

Croatian President Zoran Milanovic said that they were investigating how it was possible for an aircraft to spend more than an hour in the airspace of NATO member countries without being noticed.

Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković has reportedly already spoken to Viktor Orbán and NATO Ambassador Mario Nobilo. Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said on Facebook that he had talked with his Croatian counterpart, Gordan Grlic Radman, about the case by phone. According to data currently available, the airspace of several NATO member states, including Hungary’s, have been affected in the flight path of the drone, he said. “During the assessment, we will closely cooperate with the Croatian authorities and other NATO allies,” Szijjártó noted.

11 Mar 22. Why has Russia’s emerging tech had so little impact on its invasion of Ukraine? What role is Russia’s emerging technology playing in their invasion of Ukraine?

The short answer: Not much right now, and that could be a problem as the conflict advances.

So far, the ongoing conflict has been a conventional war of iron and money. At least from public sources, Russia has not displayed the type of technologies that its military has been speculated to be developing or seen to be fielding in Syria and Crimea – advanced intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, unmanned aerial vehicle swarms, and sensor fusion, to name a few.

What we have seen out of Russia is the type of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns that have come to be expected from the Kremlin in times of crisis – none of these have proven to be game changers or displays of new capabilities thus far. It is not a stretch to say Putin may have lost the information war both abroad and domestically, ultimately failing to keep abreast of technological advancements.

Indeed, some of the most impressive displays of advanced tech seem to be coming from U.S. companies aiding Ukrainian efforts.

From Microsoft warning the Ukrainian government when it detected Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine’s digital infrastructure hours before any missile was fired to Elon Musk’s lightning response to a tweet from Ukraine’s Vice President asking for Starlink satellite internet (not to mention Spacex’s ability to rapidly update Starlink software to bypass Russian short lived attempts to jam them), U.S. companies are easily thwarting Russian efforts to leverage technology for their offense.

It begs the question – what should the world make of this absence of more advanced military technology from Russia’s armed forces?

The tempting interpretation is simply that Russia’s military is not as capable as the West previously thought. It’s also feasible that Ukrainian forces were better prepared to resist than expected, not only on the physical battlefield but in the digital space as well. Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation, for example, reorganized and stood up an “IT Army” comprised of hundreds of thousands of IT professionals all aimed at countering Russian cyber maneuvers within days of fighting.

Whatever the reasons, Russia’s political and military leaders made a strategic choice, or error, thinking they could accomplish their near-term goals with limited conventional forces. Now, we see the effects of their recalibration as they turn to increasingly destructive strategies.

While this renewed offense has yet to incorporate more innovative technologies, there is still a possibility that the Kremlin will begin to leverage more advanced technologies in the future. Russia’s military already possess these capabilities, ranging from unmanned ground vehicles previously used in Syria to tactical and loitering UAVs which will arm Russian commanders with clearer battlefield situational awareness and hypersonic missiles. Of course, President Putin may also decide to launch more sophisticated cyberattacks with far-reaching implications.

With recent developments and these possibilities, the U.S. and its allies should prepare by expanding the kind of aid provided to Ukrainian defense forces.

In addition to counter UAV weapons, efforts should be made to help harden Ukraine’s command and control capabilities as well as civilian support infrastructure to ensure military and political leaders can continue to effectively coordinate defenses against Russian advances, even in the most austere environments.

The U.S. has an incredible defense innovation base of small tech companies able to provide dual-use commercial off-the shelf products quickly to those who need them. These non-traditional defense vendors possess market-proven, cutting edge technologies in everything from advanced cyber defenses and advanced materials manufacturing, to supportive supply-chain analysis, predictive maintenance and geospatial tech which could prove critical for food and ammunition distribution, aircraft and vehicle readiness, and battlefield intelligence and operations – all of which would be a force multiplier in backing the Ukraine’s forces.

While we haven’t seen Russia demonstrate particularly advanced technological capability in this conflict yet, it would be prudent for Ukraine, the U.S. and our allies to prepare as though more sophisticated attacks were possible and imminent. Innovation thrives in our defense industrial base and the U.S. private sector has been quick to respond to Ukraine’s call for assistance so far – the scale and sophistication of our own response could (and arguably should) increase as well to counter and get ahead of the effects of the increasingly brutal Russian aggression.

14 Mar 22. Ukrainians hold advantage in defending Kyiv, but they remain vulnerable to Russian air strikes. Urban fighting will put the Russians on the back foot, prompting fears Vladimir Putin will pulverise Ukraine’s capital. Ukraine’s tactical nous has so far seen its forces, by and large, refuse to engage the sharpest of the Russian bear’s claws. Instead, they have bypassed the strongest elements, targeting logistic units towards the rear; the oil that keeps the whole machine working. We’ve seen it in the 40-mile convoy that sat for a week north of Kyiv, unable to advance for want of resupplies. That situation seems to have changed and the Russian assault on the capital looks set to begin. Park for one moment the idea that Russian troops advancing on the city will probably have to do so along obvious routes (as the logistics vehicles have proved useless off road) – a boon to Ukrainian artillery and drone units. Russia’s tactics historically – in Syria and Chechnya, and witnessed to a degree in Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol – are to pulverise urban areas with artillery and missiles before any ground assault moves in. Most of the world hopes that is not going to happen in Kyiv. And so does Russia, assuming they want to capture the symbolic city largely intact. But a concentrated ground attack could put Putin’s army at a significant disadvantage. This type of battle, with radio communications severely limited, routes channelled by streets and the Ukrainian defenders knowing the terrain much better that the attackers, would require much higher standards of training and leadership, especially among junior Russian soldiers. In urban combat it is imperative to halt armoured vehicles moving at will. Street blockades built of metal and concrete must be erected. Tank traps – ditches too deep and wide for tracked vehicles to negotiate – must be dug. If the defences are too flimsy or shallow, tanks and other armoured vehicles will just climb over them or shove them aside. Knowing the exact size and capabilities of the approaching enemy vehicles is therefore critical information for any defenders. Any defences must be covered by firing points, to destroy tanks snarled up by lengths of barbed wire around the tracks, or the engineering vehicles brought forward to clear obstacles. In this, Ukraine will have an advantage both in the numbers of troops defending every street and the sheer quantity of anti-tank weapons that have flowed into the country over the past weeks.

Some anti-tank weapons, such as the Anglo-Swedish NLAW – 3,615 of which Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said last week had been sent to Ukraine – have minimal back-blasts on launch, to protect the soldier firing the weapon. It means every room in every building on every street could potentially harbour a defender. That will fix Russian minds, but may also mean they rely even more on destroying as much infrastructure as possible. Anti-tank weapons without “soft-launch” mechanisms are still extremely valuable in urban areas. Big open spaces in cities – perfect for “shoot-and-scoot” anti-tank missions – can still be found across parks and rivers or down long, wide streets. NLAW has a minimum range of 20 meters, making it very employable in built-up areas. A mix of ground troops hunting Russians with anti-tank weapons and Ukrainian tanks and other armoured vehicles will be required.

“The best anti-tank weapon in the world is another tank,” Ben Barry, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies says.

Ukrainian defenders will seek to hide their own tanks up side streets, firing into the flanks of passing Russian columns whilst being protected by soldiers swarming over nearby buildings. Urban fighting is gritty, exhausting and confusing, but historically has favoured the defender.

Mr Barry reckons the required ratio of attackers to defenders in urban terrain could be as high as 9:1. Many observers have questioned if Russia has enough soldiers.

In a social media post on Telegram, Igor Vsevolodovich Girkin, 51, also known by the alias Igor Ivanovich Strelkov, a Russian army veteran and former FSB officer, said “the ratio of manpower has already become in favor [sic] of Kyiv [and] this advantage will only increase”.

Mr Girkin played a key role in the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and later the war in the Donbas region of Ukraine. He was appointed Defence Minister to the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic.

In his Telegram post he said Russia’s early plans now seem “overly optimistic” and that without “partial mobilizations…the war cannot be won even in a few years”.

A Russian strategy of encirclement and bombardment means ground troops won’t need to be particularly competent, Mr Barry says. “They just have to be sufficiently competent to protect the artillery and rocket launchers.” Reports overnight of heavy fire on the outskirts of Kyiv could indicate Ukrainian efforts to repel Russian forces pushing west and south, to encircle the city. If Russia decides to stay outside the built-up areas and blast Kyiv with artillery, “the excellence of the Ukrainian army’s defence of urban areas would be a touch irrelevant,” Mr Barry says. Not being able to engage directly but having to suffer siege and aerial bombardment would be the “worst-case scenario” for Ukraine, he suggests. (Source: Daily Telegraph)

Russia has asked China for military assistance in its invasion of Ukraine, including the provision of drones, according to US officials.

Despite Beijing seeking to portray itself as an honest broker, Washington has been alarmed by the reports of Russia’s plea to China.

US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that Washington was watching closely to see to what extent Beijing provided economic or material support to Russia, and would impose consequences if that occurred.

“We are communicating directly, privately to Beijing, that there will absolutely be consequences for large-scale sanctions evasion efforts or support to Russia to back fill them,” he said.

CNN reported that US officials believed Russia had sought drones as well as economic assistance.

Ukraine’s leader expressed tentative hope on Monday about a diplomatic push for a ceasefire even as Russian forces continued to shell his country’s cities overnight, leaving hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in siege conditions. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said his representatives were discussing a possible meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in online talks with Moscow, as negotiators noted some positive movement in recent days. Diplomats remain sceptical about a breakthrough to end a war that has laid waste to Ukrainian cities, brought down devastating sanctions on Russia, and shaken world markets. But officials close to the talks reported tentative progress over the weekend, including on limited political issues relating to a potential settlement. (Source: FT.com)

12 Mar 22. Ukraine says Russian forces kill seven civilians in evacuation convoy.

EU to impose new sanctions on Russia

Ukraine accused Russian forces on Saturday of killing seven civilians in an attack on women and children trying to flee fighting near Kyiv, and France said Russian President Vladimir Putin had shown he was not ready to make peace.

The Ukrainian intelligence service said the seven, including one child, were killed as they fled the village of Peremoha and that “the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back.”

Reuters was unable immediately to verify the report and Russia offered no immediate comment. Moscow denies targeting civilians since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24 and blames Ukraine for failed attempts to evacuate civilians from encircled cities.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said earlier that Moscow was sending in new troops after Ukrainian forces put 31 of Russia’s battalion tactical groups out of action in what he called Russia’s largest army losses in decades. It was not possible to verify his statements.

He also said about 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed so far and urged the West to get more involved in peace negotiations. The president suggested Russian forces would face a fight to the death if they sought to enter the capital.

“If they decide to carpet bomb (Kyiv), and simply erase the history of this region … and destroy all of us, then they will enter Kyiv. If that’s their goal, let them come in, but they will have to live on this land by themselves,” he said.

Zelenskiy discussed the war with Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Emmanuel Macron, and the German and French leaders then spoke to Putin by phone and urged the Russian leader to order an immediate ceasefire.

A Kremlin statement on the 75-minute call made no mention of a ceasefire and a French presidency official said: “We did not detect a willingness on Putin’s part to end the war”.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused the United States of escalating tensions and said the situation had been complicated by convoys of Western arms shipments to Ukraine that Russian forces considered “legitimate targets”.

In comments reported by the Tass news agency, Ryabkov made no specific threat, but any attack on such convoys before they reached Ukraine would risk widening the war.

Responding to Zelenskiy’s call for the West to be more involved in peace negotiations, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said: “If there are diplomatic steps that we can take that the Ukrainian government believes would be helpful, we’re prepared to take them.”

Crisis talks between Moscow and Kyiv have been continuing via a video link, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russia’s RIA news agency. He gave no details but Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv would not surrender or accept any ultimatums. read more

HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS

Air raid sirens blared across most Ukrainian cities on Saturday morning, local media reported.

Russian rocket attacks destroyed a Ukrainian airbase and hit an ammunition depot near the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, Interfax Ukraine quoted its mayor as saying.

The exhausted-looking governor of Chernihiv, around 150 km (100 miles) northeast of Kyiv, gave a video update in front of the ruins of the city’s Ukraine Hotel, which he said had been hit.

“There is no such hotel any more,” Viacheslav Chaus said, wiping tears from his eyes. “But Ukraine itself still exists, and it will prevail.”

Britain’s defence ministry said fighting northwest of the capital continued, with the bulk of Russian ground forces 25 km (16 miles) from the centre of Kyiv, which it has said Russia could attack within days.

Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remained encircled under heavy Russian shelling, it said.

Russia’s invasion has been almost universally condemned around the world and that has drawn tough Western sanctions on Russia.

The Russian bombardment has trapped thousands of people in besieged cities and sent 2.5 million Ukrainians fleeing to neighbouring countries. Zelenskiy said the conflict meant some small Ukrainian towns no longer existed.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its neighbour’s military capabilities and “de-Nazify” the country.

Ukrainian officials had planned to use humanitarian corridors from Mariupol as well as towns and villages in the regions of Kyiv, Sumy and some other areas on Saturday.

The governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were continuing on Saturday morning though some evacuations were proceeding.

The Donetsk region’s governor said constant shelling was complicating bringing aid into the southern city of Mariupol.

“There are reports of looting and violent confrontations among civilians over what little basic supplies remain in the city,” the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

“Medicines for life-threatening illnesses are quickly running out, hospitals are only partially functioning, and the food and water are in short supply.”

MAKESHIFT BURIALS

People were boiling ground water for drinking, using wood to cook food and burying dead bodies near where they lay, a staff member for Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) in Mariupol said.

“We saw people who died because of lack of medication,” he said, adding that many people had also been wounded or killed. “Neighbours just dig a hole in the ground and put the dead bodies inside.”

At least 1,582 civilians in Mariupol have been killed as a result of Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade, the city council said on Friday. It was not possible to verify casualty figures. Efforts to isolate Russia economically have stepped up, with the United States imposing new sanctions on senior Kremlin officials and Russian oligarchs on Friday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would on Saturday suspend Moscow’s privileged trade and economic treatment, crack down on its use of crypto-assets, and ban the import of iron and steel goods from Russia, as well as the export of luxury goods in the other direction.

12 Mar 22. Russia has warned that it will fire on western armaments shipments to Kyiv, raising the risk of a direct military confrontation between Moscow and Nato during the war in Ukraine. Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Saturday that “pumping up [Ukraine] with weapons from a whole range of countries” was “not just a dangerous move — it’s something that turns these convoys into legitimate military targets”, according to the Interfax news agency. US president Joe Biden has rejected calls from Kyiv to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine and said Nato will not be drawn into an all-out conflict with Russia or send troops to defend the country. However, Ukraine’s western backers have pledged significant military aid to the country. The US has promised $6.5bn in defence spending, the UK has sent 3,615 NLAW anti-tank missiles and Javelin anti-tank weapons while Nordic states have sent more than 10,000 anti-tank weapons.

11 Mar 22. Pentagon revives team to speed arms to Ukraine and allies, sources say. The Pentagon is turning to a special team to respond to increased demand for new weapons sales and requests to transfer existing weapons among U.S. allies as countries including Ukraine scramble to obtain arms following Russia’s invasion, three people familiar with the effort said.

The Pentagon’s office of Acquisition and Sustainment, the weapons buyer for the U.S. Department of Defense, has been fielding increased demand from European allies hoping to ship weapons to Ukraine through third party transfers or to buy arms to bolster their own defenses, the sources said.

The rapid response team was revived in recent days to coordinate and cut through the bureaucracy around sales and transfers while prioritizing requests from allies, the sources said.

The previously unreported effort comes as the Pentagon works to respond to a rapidly changing landscape for arms deals and transfers. The Pentagon made use of the rapid response team during the Trump administration.

“As part of Department of Defense’s ongoing supply chain resilience efforts, the Department is evaluating industrial base capacity to produce items critical to our national security and that of our allies and partners. This effort is focused on identifying key supply chain constraints and mitigation actions to improve capacity,” a defense official said.

The operation is being run in cooperation with the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees weapons sales and transfers to other countries for the Department of Defense.

According to an email seen by Reuters, DSCA recently asked the defense industry for devices that can be used to disable or shoot down drones that were either in stock or could be ready for delivery in 120 days.

“In light of the ongoing crisis in Europe, the USG (U.S. government) continues its efforts to identify effective solutions which would assist Ukraine in the ongoing situation. One of our focus areas is C-sUAS,” the message said. Counter small unmanned aerial systems (C-sUAS) technology is used to defeat drones.

Counter-drone devices come in a variety of sizes, prices and formats including the portable radar gun-like Dronekiller made by IXI Electronic Warfare and the Dronebuster from Radio Hill Technologies that can cost in the tens of thousands of dollars each. There are also larger versions of the technology including one that could shield an area the size of a stadium made by SRC Inc. The larger systems can cost in the $3 million to $6 million range, industry executives have said.

The Pentagon has stressed that smaller systems such as Javelin anti-tank systems and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which allies are shipping to Ukraine via truck near-daily, are most useful.

“We believe the best way to support Ukrainian defense is by providing them the weapons and the systems they need most to defeat Russian aggression, in particular anti-armor and air defense,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby has said.

In some cases allies are trying to leverage the Ukraine situation to “press for things they wanted even before the conflict,” one U.S. official said on condition of anonymity, adding that supply chains are still stressed from the pandemic so there was uncertainty about how this demand could be immediately met. Countries in Europe – and across the globe – are looking at expanding defense budgets to meet an increasingly uncertain security outlook, with Germany among those promising a sharp increase in spending.

12 Mar 22. Ukraine at ‘turning point’, Zelenskiy says as Russians regroup near Kyiv.

Summary

U.S. sanctions hit top Kremlin staff, oligarchs

EU imposes new sanctions on Russia

Satellite images show Russians redeploying north of Kyiv

Civilians huddle underground as Russia bombards cities

Ukraine was at a turning point in the war with Russian forces appearing to be regroup for a possible assault on Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, as the United States imposed new sanctions on senior Kremlin officials and Russian oligarchs.

With the Russian assault in its third week, Zelenskiy, who has rallied his people with a series of addresses from the capital Kyiv, said Ukraine had “already reached a strategic turning point”.

“It is impossible to say how many days we still have (ahead of us) to free Ukrainian land. But we can say we will do it,” he said. “We are already moving towards our goal, our victory.”

The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, three family members of President Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson and lawmakers in the latest punishment for Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion. read more

“Treasury continues to hold Russian officials to account for enabling Putin’s unjustified and unprovoked war,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.

Russian forces kept up their bombardment of cities across the country on Friday in the biggest assault on a European country since World War Two. Satellite images showed them firing artillery as they advanced on Kyiv.

The fighting has created more than 2 million refugees, and thousands of Ukrainians are trapped in besieged cities.

As hundreds sheltered in Kharkiv metro stations, Nastya, a young girl lying on a makeshift bed on the floor of a train carriage, said she had been there for over a week, unable to move around much and ill with a virus.

“I’m scared for my home, for the homes of my friends, very scared for the whole country, and scared for myself of course,” she said. read more

Putin calls the invasion a “special operation” to disarm Ukraine and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice that has raised fears of wider conflict in Europe.

PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

The governor of the Kharkiv region on the Russian border, said a psychiatric hospital had been hit, and the mayor of the city of Kharkiv said about 50 schools there had been destroyed.

In the besieged southern city of Mariupol, the city council said at least 1,582 civilians had been killed by Russian shelling and a 12-day blockade that has left hundreds of thousands trapped with no food, water, heat or power.

Moscow denies targeting civilians.

Russia’s defence ministry said the Black Sea port was surrounded, while Ukrainian officials accused Russia of deliberately preventing civilians getting out and humanitarian convoys getting in.

A new effort to evacuate civilians along a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol appeared to have failed, as Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Russian shelling prevented them from leaving.

“The situation is critical,” Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko said.

Western countries meanwhile took more economic steps to try to force Putin to end his assault.

President Joe Biden, who this week banned U.S. imports of Russian oil, said the G7 industrial powers would revoke Russia’s “most favoured nation” trade status.

Biden banned U.S. imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds. Washington sanctioned more oligarchs and elites, including board members of Russian banks, and a dozen lawmakers.

European Union leaders said they were ready to impose harsher sanctions on Russia and might give Ukraine more funds for arms. But they rejected Ukraine’s request to join the bloc.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU would on Saturday suspend Moscow’s privileged trade and economic treatment, crack down on its use of crypto-assets, and ban the import of iron and steel goods from Russia, as well as the export of luxury goods in the other direction. read more

GEARING UP

Russia’s main force has been stalled north of Kyiv, having failed in what Western analysts say was an initial plan for a lightning assault.

But Britain’s defence ministry said Russia appeared to be gearing up for a new offensive in coming days that would probably include Kyiv.

Images taken on Friday and released by private U.S. satellite firm Maxar showed Russian forces were continuing to deploy closer to Kyiv and firing artillery toward residential areas, according to the company’s analysis.

Multiple homes and buildings were on fire and widespread damage was seen throughout the town of Moschun, northwest of Kyiv, Maxar said. Reuters could not independently verify the images.

But Britain’s intelligence update said Russian ground forces were still making only limited progress, hampered by logistical problems and Ukrainian resistance.

The Ukrainian general staff said Russian forces were regrouping after taking heavy losses. Ukrainian troops had pushed some back to “unfavourable positions” near the Belarus border, it said.

Kyiv’s mayor, former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, said the capital had enough essential supplies to last a couple of weeks. Supply lines remained open.

BELARUS

At a meeting with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said there were “certain positive shifts” in talks with Kyiv, but did not elaborate.

Ukraine has raised the prospect of Moscow’s ally Belarus entering the war, accusing Russia of staging “false flag” air attacks on Belarus from Ukraine to provide an excuse.

However, this war also represents the much wider reality of a geopolitical confrontation between the West and Russia. As such, it must be dealt with vigorously, by means of immediate measures to dramatically strengthen NATO capabilities in Eastern Europe, unflinching steps to counter Putin’s nuclear blackmail, unwavering support to the Ukrainians and, assertive diplomacy to instill some type of reality principle to the Kremlin. Yet, things must be done in such a way as won’t intractably antagonize Russia and the West, since Such a scenario would easily give rise to a European war and, then, to a thermonuclear war. An article by Miguel Garrido, in Portugal.

A terrorized population. A whole country, vandalized. Entire cities, encircled and besieged—huge sections of those systematically shelled and bombed, occasionally by means of such criminal implements of inhumanity as cluster munitions and thermobaric vacuum bombs. Mass migrations of millions of refugees fleeing to neighboring countries, while thousands of those who remain behind are senselessly killed under siege, or even brutally murdered under occupation. And then, critical infrastructures just blown up, alongside residential areas, schools, churches, hospitals, and clinics—the arbitrary destruction of billions of dollars worth of essential, human life sustaining infrastructure. And, of course, explosive projectiles shot into the close vicinities of nuclear installations, in Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv.

Such are the impacts of the Kremlin’s brutality in Ukraine. In their strategically befuddling attempt to reassert imperial power and retrieve the old Russo-Soviet Empire’s proximal sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, Moscow has already managed to destroy large sections of Ukraine, to precipitate a potentially intractable, no-win war, and, to gear the world towards a geopolitical faceoff between powers.

It must be clearly understood that Putin’s Russia will never leave Ukraine alone and, indeed, that it will not restrain itself to Ukraine. As soon as the Russians have been able to achieve a significant hold over Ukraine—particularly over the Black Sea coast and the eastern third of the country—they will, in all probability, venture into Moldova, by way of their Transnistria military enclave in the Moldovan east. Then, later, they’ll most likely turn to Georgia, at the other side of the Black Sea-Caucasus energy system.

The West must therefore engage in all possible efforts to counter Russian aggression, and effectively dissuade the Kremlin from launching any further offensives on other countries. Essential here will be sustained, consequential support for the Ukrainians, geared towards inflicting massive losses to Russian forces and, essentially, bogging them down in Ukraine—in fact, you may have noticed that the war in Ukraine has a clear potential to be turned into a new and improved version of the Afghan-Soviet War of the 1980s.

However, it’s also true that Russia is a thermonuclear power, and that we now find ourselves back to the nuclear crossroads. This being so, while it’s necessary to demonstrate unrelenting assertiveness towards Russian aggression, the fact is that countering Moscow must be done in such a way as will not insurmountably antagonize Russia and the West, since that would tend to drive the situation out of control. It would mean risking the unthinkable: a rapidly escalating war in Europe, ultimately turning into a thermonuclear war.

The present situation finds its most relevant precedent in nothing less than the nuclear contest between superpowers of the Cold War.

Back in the Cold War era, when you had the two superpowers engaging each other across the world, there was a tacit, mutually accepted set of ground rules. Force would be responded with force, and provocations would be responded with frontal assertiveness. However, force would be measured so it would never lead to open confrontation. Also, none of the sides would ever do anything to irreversibly aggravate the other, or to definitely collapse the diplomatic and commercial bonds between sides. There would invariably be leeway for diplomatic negotiations, and there would always be backchannels for essential negotiations. Those principles worked then, and they would certainly work now. So, let’s see how they apply to the present crisis.

The here-to approved sanctions are generally adequate. They already inflict a heavy blow on Russian finance and industry, severely punish the political elite and the oligarchs, and set the stage for mass popular disaffection towards the regime. Also, those sanctions are easily removable as soon as there’s an appropriate regime change taking place in Moscow—while, in the meantime, they don’t force Russia into complete international isolation. And, in such a way, they make it clear that the West is still available for dialogue.

There’s still a wide range of sanctions available for application to the Russian state and, to relevant Russian persons and interests. Application of those should be gradual and clearly conditional to the Kremlin’s behavior. Yet, as sanctions are being established, it’ll be essential to keep in mind that it’s necessary to preserve an essential minimum of bonds of interdependence with Russia that will allow for a successful continuity of the diplomatic process. For instance, if Europe was to fully boycott Russian natural gas, that would in itself be the end of the last great bond of interdependence between Europe and Russia, and, as such, also an end to any viable sort of diplomatic process. So, and while Europe must find other natural gas suppliers to quickly and effectively make up for its dependence on Russian gas, the fact is that, absent a state of war, it should all the same keep a bare minimum of Russian gas imports going, so as to preserve a measure of interdependence.

Sanctions must, of course, be accompanied by clear demonstrations of strength in Eastern Europe: by means of unwavering assistance to the Ukrainians, assertive support to Moldova and Georgia, and, the massive reinforcement of NATO conventional capabilities in the East.

Absolutely no policies that would put Western forces face to face with Russian forces. This of course includes the establishment of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, by which NATO forces would be in charge of protecting Ukrainian skies from Russian MiGs, helicopters and missiles. But it also includes the open conduction of Ukrainian military operations from NATO territories. For instance, having the Ukrainian air force flying out of Poland or Romania—instead, supply the Ukrainians with the state of the art in anti-aerial and anti-missile systems, so they can independently reinforce and protect any surviving airstrips in western Ukraine. Then, in the same spirit, it would be very much unreasonable to allow identifiable NATO forces to enter Ukrainian territory. Equally unthinkable is any preemptive strike against Russian or Belarusian forces. And, I really don’t need to talk about first strike options and scenarios here, or do I?

By the way, if Western governments choose to covertly send in, let’s say, special forces batallions, to assist the Ukrainians all across the territory, they should be careful to ensure that, if captured, those special forces operatives can not be legally associated to the governments who sent them in—i.e. “they got there by their own foot”.

Massively check the Russians in the East, and assist the Ukrainians by every means possible. It’s absolutely clear there needs to be a massive strengthening of NATO’s conventional capabilities in Eastern Europe. This won’t just require deeper engagement by the U.S., but also, quite clearly, significantly increased defense contributions by European countries.

Also, at another level. The Ukrainian and Moldovan and Georgian applications to the EU should be clearly and unreservedly accepted as soon as possible—or, at the very least, the EU must establish intensely deeper formal institutional bonds with those countries. Yet, it should be made explicit that accepting Finland and Sweden into NATO will come as a reciprocal response to the transformation of Belarus into a military instrument of the Russian Federation.

What’s more, Moldova and Georgia, even if they’re not going to become members of NATO anytime soon, need to be militarily reinforced by Western governments—anti-aerial and anti-tank equipments, especially those of the lightweight variety, seem to be the most appropriate option. There certainly are ways of supplying such equipments in a politically acceptable way. For one, at the formal level, it must always be those countries themselves who are seen taking the initiative to procure such equipments. And then, the deals should be preferably announced and carried out during times when the Russians are taking particularly heavy institutional and media flak for their brutal tactics in Ukraine.

Yet, considerations on diplomatic savoir faire must not prevent the West from assisting Ukraine in all possible and feasible ways. Ukraine can’t go down with the West standing by. That’s an entire people that’s being assaulted and brutalized right now, and that’s only happening for that people’s desire to belong to Europe and the West. As such, we’d better explore all possible avenues by which to help the Ukrainians.

The West needs to carry on with its mass logistical support to Ukraine. In particular, the West needs to supply them with more and more light weight anti-aerial and anti-tank weapons. The Russians have thousands of MiGs, helicopters, tanks and armored vehicles to unleash on Ukraine, and that’s the only way Russian forces get an edge in the battlefield. So, give the Ukrainians the means to fight those. And, if possible, also give them stationary anti-missile systems, for the protection of any Ukrainian cities where it’s still feasible to move such systems into.

Some have even proposed supplying weaponry, equipment and goods to the Ukrainians under a Lend-Lease program. Why not? In a deep sense, it would be very much appropriate to assist Ukraine under a program dating back to the fight against Nazi imperial aggression. It would add even more international and cultural legitimacy to the Ukrainian cause, it would presumably bolster international assistance for their national defense effort, and, it would further help represent the Russian invasion for what it actually is: a brutal, Nazi-like war of aggression.

Also, humanitarian assistance. Dramatically expanding aid to fleeing populations, particularly at the Polish, Moldovan and Romanian sides of the border, is indeed essential, but it’s not enough. Several Ukrainian cities are either already under siege, or about to become so. If it’s feasible at all, then why not organize humanitarian air bridges to those cities, whereby tons of supplies would be dropped by parachute? Also, placing humanitarian staff on the ground—in a strictly voluntary fashion—could be a good idea as well: even during an illegal invasion, it’s objectively harder, for a modern army, to arbitrarily assault communities where there are humanitarian and religious missions on the ground, assisting civilians and the wounded.

A diversified, closely coordinated approach. Effectively engaging with the Russians will require assertive diplomacy, conclusively backed by the massive reinforcement of NATO forces and means in Eastern Europe, and also by unwavering support to the Ukrainians. A consequential diplomatic approach to this situation will require establishing a diversified, closely coordinated approach, by which the U.S., the EU, the UK, NATO, Poland and the Baltic states, among others, carry on with a posture of intransigent force towards Russia, while other actors are used to open mutually acceptable doors for dialogue. In this latter respect, you clearly have to preserve France’s role as a privileged interlocutor of the Kremlin, while simultaneously reestablishing the mediating diplomatic roles of Germany, Austria and Hungary, Italy, and Turkey. (In other words, the countries which have been Russia’s essential trading partners in the west up to this day and, indeed, from the times immemorial of the Italian city states, and also of the German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires.)

Any potential definite dissociation between those states and Russia would, in the context of the present crisis, represent a dangerous juncture in its own right. Instead, it would make perfect sense to have, in a spirit of Realpolitik, a minimum of two or three of those countries adopting active mediation postures with the Russians, towards some kind of productive resolutions.

What’s happening in Asia? In the meantime, and while all of this is going on, the West needs to pay proper attention to what’s going on in Asia. In other words, how are the Chinese, the Arabs, the Indians and the Central-Asians reacting to this? It doesn’t matter what they’re saying in public. What matters is what’s going on in the backstage. It’s a really simple question here: Russia is a weakened power that can only hope to resort to any consequential form of imperial adventurism if it feels it can count on massive Asian acquiescence—preferably, Chinese and Iranian backing, Central Asian solidarity, Indian and Southeast Asian acquiescence, and Arab passivity. Are those things there? If so, then the fact is the West does have its means, and it’s probably a good time to make use of them.

Instilling something like a reality principle to the Kremlin. It’s thoroughly necessary, throughout the diplomatic process, to remind the Russians that, such as Putin’s Russia will never leave Ukraine alone, so will the West never cease backing the Ukrainians—and, after that, the Moldovans and the Georgians.

Then, it’ll be necessary to tell them, yes, it’s well understood that Putin’s regime intends to carry on vandalizing Ukraine, tearing its infrastructure to shreds, collapsing Ukrainian society, destroying the Ukrainians’ military capabilities and, looting their industrial and nuclear capabilities. And, likewise, it’s fully understood that the Kremlin intends to break up Ukraine into partitions, enclaves, and provinces of the Russian Federation, and, at best, turn it into a land-locked state, with no access whatsoever to the Black Sea. However (remind them of this), the fact is that, even now, it’s not being easy. Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine is being slow, it’s hampered by serious supply and logistical issues, demoralization is rampant among Russian troops, and those same Russian troops are having a hard time battling the Ukrainians and subjugating civilian populations. The result of this is that, even though the Russians enjoy clear force superiority, the Kremlin’s offensive is bogging down, and it’s suffering casualties and losses that, despite still being hard to quantify, seem nonetheless to be considerable. To the point where the Kremlin is now having to bring Syrian mercenaries and others into Ukraine.

So, what next? With all likelihood, a protracted, intractable war. And, as the Kremlin well knows, there will never be a lack of fighters, nor of weaponry, in Ukrainian territory. Therefore, such a war will tend to be fought by means of conventional combat, but also of exotic attacks, sabotage, explosives, anti-tank mines, IEDs, anti-personnel attacks, surface-to-air missiles, etc. Such an adventure will inflict constant casualties and—in and of itself—grave economic damage to Russia. It could actually turn out to be even worse than the Soviet-Afghan War of the 1980s. It will seriously hurt Russia and the Russians, and, it will tend to lead to widescale discontent within Russia itself. That of course is something Russia, a weakened power that it is, can’t afford.

This being so, (remind Moscow of this) it would make perfect sense for Russia not to attempt, in any type of near future, to put itself in even direr straits by means of similar assaults on countries like Moldova, Georgia, or even others.

Next, it’ll be useful to remind them that the Russo-Soviet Empire no longer exists, and that it’s really not coming back, and that the catastrophic policies that Putin’s Kremlin is now adopting to bring it back may very well be leading Russia itself towards the same end.

After all, as the Kremlin well knows, Russia is an especially debilitated power, with its decrepit industry, its dependence on foreign technology imports, its economy absolutely relying on oil and natural gas exports, the weak average standard of living, and an ageing population of merely 145 million people—almost all of those concentrated west of the Urals. What’s more, this is a population that tends not to trust the regime, and only gives electoral majorities to Putin for Putin’s image as a ‘keeper of economic stability.’ Well, what will the Russian population think of this same Putin when the economy starts collapsing all over, and when they start seeing their boys returning home in body bags? Here, you should remind the Russians that their population has no interest whatsoever in the Kremlin’s imperial ambitions, nor in any “new great patriotic war” that Putin might conjure up.

And then you also have the oligarchs, the intelligentsia, the apparatchiks, and the generals, who (even though they’re controlled and intimidated) are growing disillusioned, and perhaps it is that they don’t even understand for sure why is it that Russia is trying to create a “new great patriotic war.”

When diplomatically interacting with the Russians, you also have to make them notice that it would be much more preferable—for Russia and the Russian people—to, rather than persisting in a failed imperial agenda, having the Kremlin instead choose to take the chance that’s represented by an attenuation of conflict: while the sanctions would not be removed, the fact is that they would not be worsened anyway, and, in the medium to long terms, it would even be possible to think of some way to soften their macroeconomic impacts.

Also, it would make very good sense to make them understand that any stabilization of this situation with a Russia that’s ruled by Putin will always result in the creation of a new Iron Curtain stretching out from the Baltic Sea to the Caucasus—but that the negative economic impacts of such an Iron Curtain could be attenuated somewhat by a Cold War like continuity of relations with the West, in particular through Germany and Italy.

Challenging Putin’s nuclear blackmail. It must also be very clearly recognized that Putin is now resorting to nuclear blackmail. That’s precisely what is expressed by Putin’s constant threats to the West, by the Kremlin ordering Russian strategic forces into a state of nuclear readiness, and also, in all likelihood, by the terroristic nihilism underlying the Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv incidents—namely, the reckless attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, and the shelling of the Physics and Technology Institute of Kharkiv, where there’s a nuclear reactor.

These things must not be underestimated. Putin is an arrogant ideologue who explicitly believes in resorting to brute force and subversion to humiliate the West and restore the Russo-Soviet Empire. What’s more, Putin is surrounded by people who think just like him, and this is the clique now concentrating, in their own hands, the most relevant share of political and military power in Russia. It’s self-evident you can’t trust Putin and his people to have sufficient sense not to get a very serious nuclear provocation going in the near future. By the way, and according to David Martin, CBS News correspondent in the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department, such a provocation could come by means of the Russians detonating a tactical nuclear weapon, a low intensity nuke, so as to threaten the U.S. and NATO with nuclear war and, in such a way, terrorize and paralyze everybody. Beware of something like that being perpetrated in the near future—for instance, against a Ukrainian city, or even a massing of Ukrainian troops in a rural area. The Kremlin’s already made it clear the name of the game is lawlessness.

Putin’s nuclear blackmail needs to be responded with unequivocal assertiveness. In the short term, you need to remind the Russians that, indeed, it’s a fact that Russia has nuclear weapons, but the truth is that the West has those too, and they’ll have less work than the Russians, since Russia has less large cities in its territory than the U.S. and Europe—so, it would make good sense to chill down, relax, and come to practical resolutions that will actually make some sense.

However, even that’s not enough. You need to start massively strengthening U.S. and NATO nuclear capabilities right now. The priority here isn’t so much in increasing offensive capacity as much as it is in creating a potentially inviolable defensive nuclear shield. Annihilating the adversary is quite irrelevant when you yourself are being annihilated as well, and when the world as a whole is being turned into a nuclear wasteland. What you actually need is something that will prevent you from being annihilated and having to annihilate millions, perhaps billions, in return. This of course inevitably means a full comeback to the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) of the 1980s, i.e., the idea of a highly technological nuclear shield, based around an integrated network of space, air and ground-based sensors (e.g. satellites) and directed energy interceptors (e.g. laser and particle beam systems), to detect, intercept and destroy incoming ICBMs. Once built and operating, an SDI nuclear shield will of course tend to render strategic nuclear weapons obsolete.

Also, at a later stage, you’ll need to rebuild the—in the meanwhile devastated, and reduced to a very precarious START Treaty—global nuclear treaty framework, in such a way as to establish dramatic limitations to strategic nuclear weapons and, in essence, to outlaw tactical nuclear weapons.

The Gordian Knot. Also, and throughout the diplomatic process as a whole, you have to place the following key question: is there any politically viable way to carry out successful regime change in Russia, and take Putin and his key apparatchiks out of the equation? This would, of course, tend to be the easiest and most expeditious way to settle this whole situation.

However, and in the (unlikely) case of that not being possible, the only sensible and realistic option is actually a gradual scaling down of tensions with the advance towards some uncomfortable type of a détente—despite with the Ukraine war going on in the background. That, of course, would signify a new Iron Curtain: a new geopolitical East-West divide that could preferably be attenuated by a Cold War like continuity of relations with Europe, by means of countries such as Germany, Italy, and Turkey.

And also the following. The fact that the present crisis is providing context for some groups and organizations to act on certain people’s instincts towards xenophobic repression and violence, here towards Russian diasporas, is something that’s simply ugly, not to say just vulgar. We’re in this to confront a totalitarian tyranny, not to turn into one. And, we’re in this in the name of human values, not to lose our souls.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/3/12/2085587/-Back-to-the-nuclear-crossroads
4,ac6a17ec-a36a-4dc8-946f-c55e7098f571,"[""Rfe Rl'S Ukrainian Service""]",,"KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has threatened to break off talks with Moscow should Russian forces wipe out the remaining Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Mariupol as Moscow claimed it had taken control of the besieged and battered port city after a weeks-long battle.

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.

Around 1,300 Ukrainian troops killed since Russian invasion

Speaking at a news briefing, the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said around 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed since the start of the Russian invasion.

He also claimed that around 500-600 Russian troops surrendered to Ukrainian forces on Friday.

Zelensky stated Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams had started discussing concrete topics rather than exchanging ultimatums, adding the west should be more involved in negotiations to end the war. The president noted he was open to discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The Ukrainian president told reporters that Russia can only take Kyiv if it “razes the city to the ground”.

Zelensky has suggested Russian forces would face a fight to the death if they sought to enter the capital.

“If they decide to carpet bomb (Kyiv), and simply erase the history of this region, the history of the Kyivan Rus, the history of Europe, and destroy all of us, then they will enter Kyiv. If that’s their goal, let them come in, but they will have to live on this land by themselves,” he stressed.

Zelensky stated his country is more united than ever as it faces the Russian invasion.

“This war, a difficult war, has truly united our nation. You are asking me how’s the situation on the front line … there’s a front line everywhere,” Zelensky said.

“A few small towns just don’t exist anymore. And this is a tragedy. They are just gone. And people are also gone. They are gone forever. So we are all on the front line. The people who died there, they died among us,” he added.

Macron & Scholz call for immediate ceasefire in Ukraine during call with Putin

French President Emmanuel Macron has called on Russia to declare an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine during a phone call with President President Putin. The phone call lasted 75-minutes and also involved German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Putin did not show a willingness to end a war with Ukraine during the call with Macron and Scholz, French presidency official said, Reuters reports.

The French and German leaders reiterated their call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine as a condition for full negotiations, the official added.

The Kremlin announced Putin used the call to brief the two leaders on negotiations between Russia and Ukraine and responded to their concerns about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.

Putin slammed what he said was the “flagrant violation” of international humanitarian law by Ukraine’s forces during a phone call with Macron and Scholz, the Kremlin said, adding, “Vladimir Putin urged Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz to influence the Kyiv authorities so that such criminal actions would be stopped.”

A German government spokesperson stated, “The conversation is part of ongoing international efforts to end the war in Ukraine.”

The president noted he does not see bravery from NATO on Ukraine and doesn’t see common consensus to accept the country to join the alliance.

Russia: US platforms ‘directly responsible for encouraging Ukrainian nationalism’

US online platforms are “directly responsible for encouraging nationalism in Ukraine”, the Russian Foreign Ministry has said.

Maria Zakharova, the press secretary for the Foreign Affairs Ministry, responded to Nick Clegg’s statement that Meta’s new policy of allowing threats of violence against Russian military and leadership figures will only apply in Ukraine itself.

She stated, “For many years, nationalism has been cultivated on the territory of Ukraine and encouraged by the West. We are all witnessing the result of such a policy today.

“It’s time to draw conclusions and use all resources, primarily informational ones, to stop incitement to hatred. The US digital platforms are directly responsible for encouraging nationalism in Ukraine,” she added.

Russian forces capture outskirts of Mariupol

Ukraine’s military says Russian forces have captured the eastern outskirts of the besieged city of Mariupol.

The military said the capture of Mariupol and Severodonetsk in the east were a priority for Russian forces.

England’s Premier League disqualifies Abramovich as a director of Chelsea

England’s Premier League on Saturday disqualified the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich as a director of Chelsea Football Club, a decision that is largely symbolic but may help restart the process of selling the soccer team.

Ukraine accuses Russia of targeting city mayors

Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko has accused Russia of “terrorism” for targeting elected officials in Ukraine, and insisted Moscow’s forces would be “kicked out of every inch of our land”.

The comments come after a senior Ukrainian official shared a video that he said shows armed men carrying Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of the city of Melitopol, across a square.

“Occupiers left the city without its elected leader to paralyze Melitopol’s life support and thus demoralize and conquer local residents,” Klitschko stated, adding, “This is an act of terrorism.”

Ukraine claims another Russian general killed

A Ukrainian official says that another Russian general has been killed in fighting.

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the interior ministry, claimed Russian Major-General Andrei Kolesnikov was killed in action during fighting over Mariupol. He would be the third Russian general to die in the war, according to Ukrainian officials.

Kolesnikov’s death was not confirmed by the Russian military, which has kept a tight lid on information about its losses.

Zelensky: Russian army has suffered largest losses in decades

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated Russian forces have suffered their largest losses in decades, and claimed that 31 Russian battalion tactical groups have been left incapable of combat.

Russia is sending new forces to Ukraine after suffering what Zelensky described as Moscow’s biggest losses in decades.

Zelensky urged Russia to uphold an agreed ceasefire to allow evacuations to proceed from the besieged port city of Mariupol, after blaming Moscow for the failure of previous attempts.

Russian attacks continue in areas where Ukraine is trying to evacuate people and bring aid through “humanitarian corridors”, an official has claimed.

He also demanded the release of the mayor of Melitopol who was reportedly kidnapped by Russian forces Friday.

Belarus denies plans to join Russian invasion but is ‘rotating’ troops at border

Belarus’s chief of general staff Viktor Gulevich said that the country has no plans to join the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but is sending five battalion tactical groups (BTGs) to its border on rotation to replenish forces already stationed there.

A top Ukrainian security official earlier warned Belarus not to send troops to Ukraine, saying Ukraine was showing restraint towards Belarus despite the country being used as a launchpad for Russian planes.

“I want to underline that the transfer of troops is in no way connected with (any) preparation, and especially not with the participation of Belarusian soldiers in the special military operation on the territory of Ukraine,” Gulevich added.

Chernihiv governor says city under heavy attack

Zelensky appeals to Russian mothers: ‘Do not give your son to death or captivity’

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued a direct appeal to Russian mothers, asking them to “check where your son is” and not to “give your son to death or captivity” after Russia revealed that there were conscripts amongst the forces conducting the Ukraine invasion.

Speaking from the presidential office in Kyiv, Zelensky broke into Russian as he asked mothers of young Russian men: “do not send your children to war in a foreign land. Do not believe that they will be sent just somewhere for combat areas, or just somewhere in non-combat conditions.”

He further pleaded in his most recent video address: “Check where your son is, and if you have even the slightest suspicion, any doubt that your son may be sent to war against Ukraine, act immediately. Do not give your son to death or captivity”.

Zelensky said that he was creating a new department to oversee what he said were thousands of Russian prisoners of war who had either surrendered or been captured since the invasion.

He added that they were receiving treatment “required by international conventions.”

More evacuation corridors from Ukrainian cities to open Saturday

At least 13 evacuation corridors from different Ukrainian cities, including the besieged eastern city of Mariupol, will be open on Saturday for civilians, according to Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Israel, Ukraine deny report Bennett recommended yielding to Russian demands

A top Ukrainian adviser and an Israeli official on Saturday pushed back against a media report suggesting Israel tried to nudge Ukraine into caving to Russian demands during talks.

Israel has been engaged in diplomatic efforts to try to end the war in Ukraine. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

A report carried by Israel’s Walla news, the Jerusalem Post and US news site Axios had suggested, citing an unidentified Ukrainian official, that Bennett had urged Ukraine to give in to Russia.

Israel, “just as other conditional intermediary countries, does NOT offer Ukraine to agree to any demands of the Russian Federation,” Ukrainian adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter.

“This is impossible for military & political reasons. On the contrary, Israel urges Russia to assess the events more adequately,” he added.

Moscow: West fosters Kiev’s sabotage of nuclear facilities

The Western states are posing a threat to the citizens of Russia, Ukraine and all of Europe by supporting Ukrainian sabotage of nuclear facilities, Spokeswoman for Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova told TASS.

“Carrying out attacks against their own nuclear facilities is already becoming a hallmark of the Ukrainian leadership. Kiev, as well as the American masters of Vladimir Zelensky and the US vassals in NATO are the ones to blame for this. Without such support, these provocations would be pointless,” the diplomat said.

“The Western political adventurers, who encourage Zelensky’s actions, endanger the lives of not only the citizens of Ukraine and Russia but of all of Europe,” she added.

France criticises UK for Ukrainian refugee response

The French President Emmanuel Macron criticised the British government for failing to live up to its “grand statements” on helping Ukrainian refugees.

Speaking at an EU summit in Versailles, Macron criticised Britain’s visa policy and said it makes the process harder for Ukrainian citizens fleeing the war.

He added, “Despite all the grand statements… the British government continued to apply current rules that meant they did not welcome Ukrainian refugees who wanted to reach British soil saying they have to travel hundreds of kilometres in order to apply for a visa.”

“I would hope that the Ukrainian men and women who have lived through horror and crossed Europe to reach their families on UK territory will be better treated,” Macron continued.

In response to Macron’s reported remarks, the Home Office pointed to previous comments from Home Secretary Priti Patel, which stated: “We are now making the process quicker and simpler by removing the need to physically visit visa application centres for many of those who are making the perilous journey across Europe.”

Russian Foreign Ministry: If necessary, Moscow ready for harsh confrontation with EU in energy sector

Russia is ready for a harsh confrontation with the European Union in the energy sector, if the need arises, Director of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s European Cooperation Department Nikolai Kobrinets said.

“Russia remains a reliable supplier, a world-class guarantor of energy security. We value this reputation, but are ready for a harsh confrontation in the energy sector, if the need arises. I believe, the European Union would not definitely profit from it, because we have a greater safety margin and stronger nerves,” Kobrinets told Interfax in an interview.

According to the European Commission, Russia’s share makes up about 45% of gas exported to the EU, 25% oil and 45% of coal, “therefore Brussels is bound to understand the vulnerable position it is in,” the high-ranking Russian diplomat added.

Judging by statements of EU representatives, Europe intends to become independent from Russia’s energy sources “at any cost,” and “ordinary European taxpayers, not senior European bureaucrats, will have to pay this cost,” he said.

The EU’s plans to forgo Russian energy sources include creating projects in hydrogen generation and developing alternative energy sources, which will take time and investments, Kobrinets stated.

“Those plans are not very rational from a strictly economic point of view. Global energy markets are experiencing turbulence, if not panicking. It is unknown how high the prices would get. But it is already clear that the EU member states will have to pay thrice as much, or even more, for gas, oil and electricity. That’s their choice,” he added.

Moscow: Negotiations with NATO impossible after it provided Ukraine with weapons

The Russian Foreign Ministry said it will not negotiate with NATO, after the military alliance provided Ukraine with weapons, Interfax reports.

The ministry added, “Currently the countries of the alliance (and more broadly – the European Union), not giving a damn about international law and their own codes of conduct, are supplying airborne weapons for the Ukrainian armed forces. Weapons destined to kill Russian servicemen.”

“There can be no kind of dialogue with NATO in these conditions. In the past few years the relationship between NATO and Russia through the fault of the alliance has fallen to zero,” it continued.

Russian diplomat: Moscow response to west’s sanctions ready

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ryabkov stated that right now the US is waging economic war against Russia.

He stressed that the West would have eventually found a pretext for new anti-Russian sanctions even without Moscow launching a special operation in Ukraine.

Ryabkov added that Moscow has already prepared lists of personal counter sanctions against western countries and that they will be revealed soon.

He separately lambasted a decision by western countries to close their airspace to Russian aircraft as “illegal”.

The diplomat further cautioned the West against “mindlessly pumping weapons” into Ukraine. He stressed that it is a dangerous move and that convoys carrying these weapons will be legitimate targets for the Russian military.

United States President Joe Biden talking about the danger of a Third World War is an attempt to play on the nerves, Russia is not escalating the situation, Ryabkov noted.

The current relations between Russia and the United States can hardly be described as trustful, Ryabkov said, adding, “What trust are we talking about if we see our relations move from bad to worse, courtesy of the successive U.S. administrations.”

The US sanctions on Russia were unprecedented and constituted “an unparalleled attempt at dealing a major blow to various sectors of the Russian economy,” he said.

“What can we talk about now, what trust? We are thrown back in our relations far behind, the blame for this lies entirely with the American side and its successive administrations,” Ryabkov added.

Mosque sheltering 80 civilians shelled in Mariupol

A mosque in the southeastern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, where 80 civilians were taking shelter, has been shelled by Russian forces, Ukraine’s foreign ministry said.

“The mosque of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and his wife Roxolana (Hurrem Sultan) in Mariupol was shelled by Russian invaders. More than 80 adults and children are hiding there from the shelling, including citizens of Turkey,” the ministry added.

Russian rockets destroy Ukrainian airbase in Kyiv region

Russian rocket attacks have destroyed a Ukrainian airbase near the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region. The rocket attacks also hit an ammunition depot, Vasylkiv Mayor Natalia Balasynovych announced.

In Chernihiv, some 100 kilometers north of Kyiv, the hotel Ukraine — a landmark in the city — was hit overnight.

“I am here now. There is no hotel anymore,” Vyacheslav Chaus, head of Chernihiv region administration, said Saturday, adding, The enemy continues to launch air and missile strikes on the city of Chernihiv. Civilians are dying, many people are being injured. The enemy shells civilian infrastructure, where there is no military.”

Conflict raged northwest of Kyiv on Saturday and other cities were encircled and under heavy shelling, while Ukrainian officials stated fighting and threats of Russian air attacks were endangering attempted evacuations.

Russia-Ukraine conflict could trigger global food shortage

Following a dramatic global food shortage due to the Covid pandemic, disruption to agricultural production in Russia and Ukraine due to the ongoing military conflict could seriously exacerbate global food insecurity, said Qu Dongyu, director-general of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

In a statement on Friday, the FAO chief stated Russia and Ukraine play a substantial role in the global food production and supply.

“Russia is the world’s largest exporter of wheat, and Ukraine is the fifth-largest. Together, they provide 19% of the world’s barley supply, 14% of wheat, and 4% of maize, making up more than one-third of global cereal exports,” he continued.

Qu added that the two nations are also lead suppliers of rapeseed and account for 52% of the world’s sunflower oil export market. Global fertilizer supply is also highly concentrated, with Russia the lead producer.

US explores sending Ukraine more advanced weapons

The Joe Biden administration, under pressure to expand the arsenal of weapons that Ukraine has in its conflict with Russia, is working with European allies to expedite more sophisticated air-defense systems and other armaments into the war zone, US officials announced.

Discussions were ongoing ahead of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s planned trip next week to meet with NATO allies in Brussels and Slovakia, which along with Poland and Romania has indicated a willingness to transfer military aid to its embattled neighbor. Slovakia also possesses the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, which is used to shoot down enemy aircraft and is familiar to the Ukrainians.

The administration is facing backlash over its decision earlier this week to scuttle Poland’s proposal that would have sent a number of its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine via a transfer “free of charge” to the United States. Washington, citing concerns that Russia would view the move as a provocation from Washington, said the offer from Warsaw was not “tenable.”

Ukraine has sought the S-300 surface-to-air missile system, said a senior European official familiar with the situation. There are ongoing talks about that possibility, the official added, but questions remain about whether there are any that can be spared.

On Friday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the United States sent a letter to President Biden asking him to transfer manned and unmanned aircraft to Ukraine, saying that “despite heroic and skilled resistance,” the Russians had achieved air superiority over the Ukrainians. That went farther than US defense officials, who have noted the Russians have a significantly larger air force but had been unable to control the skies over Ukraine.

“Russia’s advantage in this domain could soon develop into air dominance if the Ukrainians do not receive necessary military aid,” the lawmakers added. The lawmakers called for the continued delivery of Stinger missiles, man-portable antiaircraft weapons, but also called for the United States to facilitate the transfer of S-300 systems.

Ukraine official hopes Russia will observe ceasefire to allow civilian evacuation

Air raid sirens sounded Saturday in several cities, including the capital Kyiv, Odessa, Dnipro and Kharkiv, according to Ukrainian media.

Survivors have been trying to flee Russian bombardment in a freezing city left without water or heating and running out of food. The situation is “desperate,” a Doctors Without Borders official said.

“Hundreds of thousands of people… are for all intents and purposes besieged,” Stephen Cornish, one of those heading the medical charity’s Ukraine operation, told AFP in an interview, adding, “Sieges are a medieval practice that have been outlawed by the modern rules of war for good reason.”

Blinken, Kuleba concerned about Russian ‘disinformation campaigns’

Russia lambasts US for claiming Moscow could use chemical weapons in Ukraine

Russian Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov has described the recent US remarks that Russia may use chemical weapons in Ukraine as another attempt to demonise Russia.

“Such claims are worth a penny. The US official, as always, did not bother to provide any evidence. This is another attempt to demonise our country,” the ambassador said. “Our country, unlike the United States, eliminated all available stocks of chemical warfare agents in 2017. This fact has been documented by the OPCW. It is pointless to argue with this fact”, Antonov added.

Russia accused of using cluster munitions, incendiary weapons

Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv, said the group has gathered evidence of Russian forces using unguided bombs, cluster munitions and incendiary weapons.

I also welcome the US troops in Poland and the Baltics, and we need the continued presence of US troops in the area.
