Good afternoon.

We have just finished an extraordinary meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers.

Russia is carrying out a brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which NATO, and the whole world, condemn.



This is the worst military aggression in Europe for decades.

With cities under siege.

Schools, hospitals and residential buildings shelled.

Reckless actions around a nuclear power plant last night.

And many civilians killed or wounded.

The days to come are likely to be worse.

With more death, more suffering, and more destruction,

as the Russian armed force bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across the country.

At our meeting today, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba addressed his NATO counterparts.

And Allies expressed their solidarity and deep respect for the courage of the Ukrainian people and armed forces.

We had warned for many months that President Putin was intent on invading Ukraine.

That is why NATO Allies made tireless efforts to find a diplomatic solution.

At the same time, we made clear that Russia would pay a very high price for renewed aggression against Ukraine.

Russia is paying that price now.

This is President Putin’s war.

One he has chosen.

Planned.

And is waging against a peaceful country.

We call on President Putin to stop this war immediately.

Withdraw all his forces from Ukraine without conditions.

And engage in genuine diplomacy, now.

NATO Allies have stepped up support for Ukraine.

Helping to uphold the country’s right of self-defence, as enshrined in the U.N. Charter.

Today, ministers addressed our immediate response to the crisis.

And the longer-term implications for Euro-Atlantic security.

We have already strengthened our deterrence and defence.

On land, in the air, and at sea.

Allies from North America and Europe have sent thousands more troops to the eastern part of the Alliance.

We are deploying the NATO Response Force for the first time.

And we have over 130 jets at high alert.

And over 200 ships from the High North to the Mediterranean.

We will continue to do what it takes to protect and defend every inch of NATO territory.

NATO is a defensive Alliance.

Our core task is to keep our thirty nations safe.

We are not part of this conflict.

And we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine.

Because that would be even more devastating and more dangerous.

With even more human suffering.

NATO is not seeking a war with Russia.

The Kremlin’s ambition is to recreate a sphere of influence.

And deny other countries the right to choose their own path.

So ministers discussed the need to support partners who may be at risk.

Including Georgia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Russia’s aggression has created a new normal for our security.

Where fundamental principles are contested through the use of force.

And we face the threat of conflict for years to come.

There is much at stake.

How we organise relations between states.

Whether democracy or authoritarianism prevails.

And ultimately, what sort of world we want to live in.

Ministers agreed that NATO’s relationship with Russia has fundamentally changed for the long term.

But we remain committed to keeping channels for diplomacy and de-confliction open.

To avoid any unintended escalation, misunderstanding, or miscalculation.

There is one lesson we can already draw from this crisis.

To keep our nations safe, we need North America and Europe standing together in NATO, in strategic solidarity.

At this dangerous moment, no country and no continent can go it alone.

President Putin has failed to divide us.

NATO is more united, more determined, and stronger than ever.

We are also working closer with like-minded partners.

Today, we were joined by the European Union.

As well as Finland and Sweden.

In response to Russia’s aggression, we have decided to strengthen our coordination and information sharing with Finland and Sweden.

Both countries are now taking part in all NATO consultations about the crisis.

And this afternoon, I will join a meeting of EU foreign ministers to address the crisis and our response.

And with that, I am ready to take your questions.

NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu: BBC.

James Landale (BBC): Can you tell us a little bit more about what sort of options were considered about helping countries like Georgia and Bosnia. Secondly, can you tell us a little bit more about whether NATO Allies discussed what more military support could be provided for Ukraine? And thirdly, was the issue of no fly zones even discussed at this morning’s meetings? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: NATO has provided support and NATO Allies have provided support to Georgia, to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and other partners for many years. We help them with capacity-building, reforms, strengthening their defence and security institutions. We also have a training centre in Georgia. We also have common exercises. And, of course, we have different kinds of activities with different countries, different partners. We didn't make any final decisions. But it's a broad agreement that we need to do more to support these countries. And this is partly about scaling up things we already do on strengthening their defence and security institutions, reforms, training, but also potentially adding more activities in support of these countries. Because what you have seen with Ukraine, is that they may be at risk, exposed for even more intervention, subversion, and potentially even attacks by the Russian armed forces of the Russian Federation.

Then, NATO Allies provide support to Ukraine. I think we have to remember that Allies have provided support to Ukraine for many years and now they're stepping up different types of support. And this is crucial in this critical time for Ukraine. On the no fly-zone, it was mentioned. At the same time, Allies agree that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace, or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory.

NATO Spokesperson: CNBC.

Steve Sedgwick (CNBC): Thank you, Secretary General. Is there any evidence that the support that NATO and its Allies have been pouring into Ukraine so far is going to change the tide of battle? Although the Russian advances slowed in some places, it is still advancing. Is there anything that NATO is doing that actually could possibly turn the tide in the battle in Ukraine? And secondly, if I may Sir, have events around the nuclear facility, the nuclear plant in Ukraine, and the ramifications from that changed the mind-set of NATO at all? I was wondering what the conclusion was in the meeting about that? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: The reckless actions around the nuclear power plant last night just highlight the danger of this war. War is dangerous, and to have military operations, conflict, fighting going around the nuclear power plant adds to the danger. And this just makes it even more important that President Putin ends this war, and withdraw all Russian troops from Ukraine, and engage in diplomatic efforts in good faith. So that was the message from Ministers today. And it's just underpinned by the potential danger of also a nuclear disaster related to this war, or as part of this war.

Steve Sedgwick (CNBC): The first point was about is anything about the military, ammunition, supplies that are going into Ukraine, is that changing the battle at all, or is it likely to?

NATO Secretary General: What we have seen is that President Putin totally underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. And they have been able to push back, to fight back, and to slow down the Russian advances. And this is, first and foremost, the result of the courage of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. And also the support and the courage of Ukrainian people, and the leadership of President Zelenskyy, which is really strengthening the morale of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian people. We have helped that. Because NATO Allies have trained and equipped the Ukrainian Armed Forces for many years. We started in 2014. And NATO Allies especially the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, but also, Turkey have provided equipment and military aid. And we have trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian forces. And they are now on the front line. So this support has proven to be crucial for the strength of the Ukrainian army. And we are now stepping up support with more supplies. And I think also we have to realise that compared to where the Ukrainian army was in 2014, the training NATO Allies have provided, the equipment NATO Allies have provided since 2014 has made the Ukrainian Army much better trained, much better equipped, much better commanded, and much stronger. And this is the reason why they are able to push back the way they are able to do.

NATO Spokesperson: We will go to Interfax Ukraine.

Iryna Somer (Interfax Ukraine): Thank you, Oana. I have a follow-up question on my colleague from the BBC. Secretary General, even General Breedlove, former SACEUR, expressed an opinion that NATO and US have to provide, as soon as possible, help to Ukraine and to close partially, this humanitarian purpose only sky in Ukraine. All Ukrainians are begging for this. Do you think at some point Allies can review this position, how long it will take them guilty enough of Ukraine to be destroyed by Putin?

NATO Secretary General: What is taking place in Ukraine now is horrific. It's painful. And we see human suffering, we see destruction at a scale we haven't seen in Europe since the Second World War. And I would like to commend the courage of the Ukrainian people standing up against the Russian invasion, standing up against Putin’s forces. And that's also the reason why we are stepping up our support. And also why NATO Allies have implemented the most severe sanctions ever. And also why we are mobilising support from the whole world in condemning and calling on Russia, and President Putin, to end this war. At the same time, we have a responsibility as NATO Allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine. Because that will be even more dangerous, more devastating, and will cause even more human suffering. So we have made it clear that we are not going to move into Ukraine, neither on the ground, or in Ukrainian airspace. And of course, the only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO planes, fighter planes into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes. And our assessment is that we understand the desperation. But we also believe that if we did that, we'll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries, and causing much more human suffering. So that's the reason why we make this painful decision to impose heavy sanctions, provide significant support, stepping up support. But at the same time not involving NATO forces directly in the conflict in Ukraine, neither on the ground, or in their airspace.

NATO Spokesperson: Der Spiegel.

Markus Becker (Der Spiegel): Mr. Secretary General, you said that the aim is to make Mr. Putin withdraw his troops unconditionally. What if it doesn't comply? Is there any other off-ramp you can think of, any opening for negotiations? And if the sanctions don't make him back down, is there a plan B or even an exit strategy?

NATO Secretary General: We are imposing severe costs on Russia, as we warned. We told him, President Putin, that if he invades Ukraine, once again, there will be significant costs for him to pay. And that's exactly what we're doing now with unprecedented sanctions. Of course, these will also have long-term effects and they are working also over time.

Then, Allies are providing support, humanitarian support, financial support, but also military support to Ukraine, helping them to withstand the Russian invasion.

And then, of course, together with a whole world, the UN General Assembly, we're also calling on Russia to engage in diplomatic efforts. To see if there are any political off-ramps, way out.

But then, Russia has to sit down in genuine diplomatic efforts to find the solution.

So far, they have not being willing to do so. A minimum should be to find agreements on a humanitarian corridor or humanitarian corridors to get civilians out and the humanitarian aid in.



I hope that at least that could be a first step. And I welcome all efforts to try to find some kind of agreement on humanitarian support.

NATO Spokesperson: Polish TV.

Dominika Cosic (TVP): Let me go back to rumours from few days ago about Poland and Bulgaria. There were rumours in media that Poland and Bulgaria allowed some..[inaudible] military fighter jets to Ukraine and allow Ukraine to use military airport. Could you comment on this? And could you also comment on the remarks of the Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs who told for the BBC that NATO should consider all options.

NATO Secretary General: We had a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers today. And we had the NATO Summit on Friday. And in both those meetings, I have clearly stated that we should support Ukraine, we should continue to provide, NATO Allies should continue to provide military support Ukraine, different types of support.



But we will not be part of the conflict. And that is the NATO position. And I conveyed that message because I strongly believe that if NATO becomes directly involved in the conflict will see more human suffering, more civilians killed.



And that's the reason why we need to step-up support, impose heavy sanctions, call on Russia to engage in a political solution, but not involve NATO.

Our main responsibility, our core task is to protect and defend 1 billion people living in 30 allied countries. We are doing that by increasing the presence of NATO forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, deploying for the first time the NATO Response Force, but we are not going to be part of the conflict with Russia in Ukraine.

[Follow-up question inaudible]

NATO Secretary General: Well, I met President Duda recently. We discussed many aspects and challenges related to the Russian invasion, brutal invasion of Ukraine. And you saw the statement from President Duda in the Łask airbase, that Poland is not planning to sending any airplanes to Ukraine.

NATO Spokesperson: Ok, we will go to Al Jazeera.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): Secretary General, on his way in the Latvian Foreign Minister said it's time to go from a deterrence mission to a full scale defence mission. So, was there any discussion of sending further troops in addition to the ones that you've deployed in recent weeks? And as you talk about a new normal, was there any discussion of making some of the recent deployments permanent?

NATO Secretary General: We need to distinguish between NATO’s immediate response and longer-term adaptation of our posture in the eastern part of the Alliance. When it comes to the immediate response, we have already significantly increased our presence. We now [have] over 200 ships from the High North to the Mediterranean, and 130 planes on high alert, and thousands of more troops.

I recently visited NATO troops, US troops, German troops and other troops in Romania. I met them in Estonia and also in Poland. So this is the immediate response, and we will do what it takes to defend and protect all Allies and if needed we will further increase our presence.

But at the same time we started at the meeting today the discussion about the more longer term changes to our presence, posture, deterrence and defence throughout the Alliance but especially in the eastern part. And today, we have some presence in the eastern Allied countries, we have the battlegroups in the Baltic countries and Poland, we have some presence also in Romania and in the southeast.

We are now seriously considering a significant increase of that presence, both in more troops, with more air defence, with deterrence by defence, through defence, not only by sending a message of NATO presence. So this is, as some ministers formulated it today, it is about the difference between deterrence by presence or deterrence by defence. We have started that discussion, we will have a Defence Ministerial meeting on the 16th of March. And there we expect more details, we also will of course base our decisions on advice from our military commanders, and then we will take the necessary decisions. But we have some time, not a lot of time but some time, to take that more long-term decision, because we have already implemented immediate responses by a significant increase in the eastern part of the Alliance.

NATO Spokesperson: Ukrainian National News Agency

Dmytro Shkurko (National News Agency of Ukraine): It is understandable that there will be no NATO planes and pilots in Ukraine. But it was recently sounded, the request from the President of Ukraine, about some kind of selling or maybe transferring the planes to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Maybe it could be done in a framework of general technical assistance [inaudible]. And the second question, if I may, as of right now we have absolutely indiscriminate shelling of Ukrainian cities, including the restricted weaponry like for example, [inaudible] bombs, it is deployed in living areas. So can we can count on NATO in collecting at least information concerning the Russian crimes in Ukraine going on right now? Thanks.

NATO Secretary General: The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law. And we have seen the use of cluster bombs, we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which will be in violation of international law. And of course, NATO Allies and partners are collecting information and monitoring very closely what is going on in Ukraine. I also welcome the decision by the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into this, because we have to make sure that President Putin and the President of Belarus are held accountable for what they do.



This is brutality, this is inhumane, and this is violating international law. And we also have to make sure the International Criminal Court really looks into this and that's the reason why I welcome the decision by the International Criminal Court.

[Follow-up question inaudible]



NATO Secretary General: NATO Allies provide different types of military support. I will not go into the details about that support, but Allies provide many types of support. It’s publicly known that Allies have provided anti-tank weapons, air defence missiles and other types of support but more details will not be given by me.

NATO Spokesperson: Bloomberg.

Natalia Drozdiak (Bloomberg): Thank you for the question. You mentioned the risk for Bosnia and Georgia. Are you seeing any concrete threat of invasion there? And what about Moldova, is there any increased risk in Moldova? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: All these are different countries, and of course they face different types of risks and challenges. But they have in common that we have seen Russia trying to exercise their power to intimidate them partly by subversion and interference in the domestic political processes or by military invasion. Georgia has been invaded by Russia and Russian troops still in reality control parts of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In Moldova and Transnistria, which is part of Moldova, there are Russian troops without the consent of the government in Moldova. And then, in Bosnia-Herzegovina we see a very fragile, unstable situation with inflammatory rhetoric and serious challenges to the unity of that state. So even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, these countries faced serious challenges partly inflicted by or caused by Russia, but the risk has increased. And therefore, we need to step up our support and we need a serious discussion, as NATO, on what we could do to strengthen them in the face of Russian threats.

NATO Spokesperson: We’ll take one question online from Lenta.ru.

Dmitriy Sotak (Lenta.ru): Previously a NATO representative stated that the Alliance is ready to discuss strategic stability issues with Russia. However, the issue of mutual arms control remains an important priority. The problem has not gone away. The level of global tensions has increased after the Russian military command has transferred Russian strategic missile forces to higher alert levels. The question is, is NATO planning any discussions in the foreseeable future on this issue? And why hasn't the Alliance provided Ukraine with modern weapons, which the Ukrainian authorities have been asking for?

NATO Secretary General: Well first, as I said, NATO Allies have provided Ukraine with weapons, especially since 2014. And NATO Allies have trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who are now on the front line, so we have helped them in standing up against [Russia]. And without that support, without the equipment, without the training, the Ukrainian Armed Forces would have been much less capable of standing up against the Russian invasion. The courage of Ukrainian forces is, of course, the most important factor here, but the training and equipment has been of vital importance. And these, of course, also includes modern systems.

Then, on strategic issues. Well, we reached out to Russia before the invasion because we had intelligence predicting what is happening now. I think we need to understand that actually for many months, NATO Allies and NATO has been warning about that Russia was building up gradually, more and more troops and planning an invasion of Ukraine. But as we saw that build up, we intensified our efforts to engage Russia in some kind of meaningful political, diplomatic dialogue to prevent this invasion. President Putin decided not to find a political solution, but to invade, to use military force. We are of course always in favour of a political solution. But now we face a Russia which is using military force to try to destroy an independent sovereign nation in Europe. The United States and Russia agreed recently to extend the New START Agreement limiting the number of nuclear warheads on long range systems. We believe in arms control. But to have any meaningful strengthening of the arms control architecture we need a Russia which is not killing, and fighting, and invading, but a regime in Moscow which is actually seriously engaging in political efforts to reduce tensions and further strengthen arms control.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay, we'll go with the Jane’s for the last question.

Brooks Tigner (Jane’s Defence Weekly): Yes, sorry to hit you with another weapons question but this really is the crucial issue right now. As you know, the EU is sending half a billion and Poland's the coordinator, which makes me wonder, considering that this new rogue state could attack any country now, my question to you is should NATO create a new permanent structure or at least designate the Allies on a permanent rotating basis to coordinate bilateral weapons transfers from the Allies to anticipate the next crisis. Thanks. I don't mean the trust funds, I don't mean ad hoc consultations during the ministerial but something permanent.

NATO Secretary General: We should always have an open mind to what kind of structures we should have to support partners and countries at risk.

At the same time, I think we need a pragmatic approach. And what we've seen over the last years, for instance in Ukraine, is that NATO provided some types of support. We had an office in Kyiv, we were focused on modernising the defence and security institutions, the command and control, logistics, cyber. And also, we helped them with some naval capabilities. So NATO as an institution, provided important help to Ukraine over many years. And we still do.

But then, on top of that, individual Allies provided more of the lethal aid, more of the military training. Again, I don't think actually, it is so important exactly how we organise this, as long as the country in need receives the support and help they need. And over the years since 2014, there are many, many thousands of Ukrainian troops, forces which are trained at the top level by NATO trainers, special operation forces, and they have advanced equipment, and they know how to use it.

We helped them with cyber defence, with command and control, with communications. So it is this combination of something we do as the Alliance, with the NATO structures, something we do consulting each other, but it's provided bilaterally from NATO Allied countries. And it has been especially the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada who has provided most of the equipment and most of the training.



And then Turkey has provided some key capabilities including drones. And also some of the Baltic states have provided military support before the invasion. Then, after the invasion we have seen many more Allies stepping up. So I don't know whether I really answered your question but we should be pragmatic regarding exactly how to organise this as long as NATO and NATO Allies are able to provide support to partners in need.

NATO Spokesperson: Thank you very much, this concludes this press conference.

NATO Secretary General: Thank you.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_192739.htm

BRUSSELS — The war in Ukraine will probably become even more punishing for civilians, as Russia employs brutal tactics it has used to deadly effect in other conflicts, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday, promising support for Ukrainians but ruling out the establishment of a no-fly zone. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight “The terrible expectation is that the suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better,” Blinken told reporters in Brussels. “When we say it is likely to get worse, it’s unfortunately based on everything we know about President Putin’s methods when it comes to seeking to subjugate another country to his will. We saw it in Chechnya. We’ve seen it in Syria.”

Blinken spoke following talks with foreign ministers from the European Union, NATO and the G-7 bloc on the first day of a European tour aimed at illustrating Western unity in opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. As the conflict enters its second week, Ukrainian cities are being shelled and an exodus of civilians continues.

Blinken, as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg did earlier in the day, pledged continued support for Kyiv but ruled out the possibility that NATO would establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a step that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged Western partners to take.

Both Blinken and Stoltenberg said enforcement would require sending NATO aircraft into Ukrainian airspace to shoot down Russian jets — something the alliance is unwilling to do.

“That could lead to a full fledged war in Europe,” Blinken said. “President Biden has been clear that we are not going to get into a war with Russia.”

Zelensky on Friday criticized NATO’s decision in a speech published by the presidency.

“Knowing that new strikes and casualties are inevitable, NATO deliberately decided not to close the sky over Ukraine,” he said in a video posted to his Telegram channel. “Today the leadership of the alliance gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages, refusing to make a no-fly zone.”

Throughout his rapid-fire meetings, Blinken praised nations in Europe and beyond for the unprecedented avalanche of sanctions and economic penalties unleashed on Russia in recent days, and for the new military support a host of countries have pledged to Ukraine’s pro-Western government, whose military is outmatched in size and weaponry by Moscow.

Without a united Western front, Blinken and his counterparts repeated, Russia’s action could not only yield a sustained human catastrophe, but shake the foundations of European security established over decades.

Speaking during a break in his talks, Blinken recounted that Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who joined one of the discussions by video link, had shown the group a photograph of a man in Ukraine grieving over his dead child, whose corpse was covered in a blood-spattered sheet.

The photo was “a reminder that even as we talk about these weighty issues of war and peace, what this is really about is the lives of men, women, children — hundreds, thousands of individual human tragedies inflicted by Vladimir Putin and his war of choice on Ukraine and its people,” Blinken said, appearing momentarily choked up. “We can’t lose sight of that fact.”

But the leaders drew a line at direct military involvement in the burgeoning conflict, wary of taking moves that Russia could describe as a provocation or pretext for widening the war.

“We understand the desperation,” Stoltenberg said earlier in the day when asked about a potential no-fly zone. “But we also believe that if we did that, we would end up with something that could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe, involving much more countries and much more suffering.”

Stoltenberg said NATO was taking steps to reinforce its eastern flank and would now work more closely with Finland and Sweden, which are not alliance members. He said members will offer additional support for non-NATO countries that may feel newly vulnerable to Russian aggression, such as Georgia, Moldova and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Stefano Stefanini, Italy’s former ambassador to NATO, said a no-fly zone proposal would probably meet political opposition in Western nations.

“NATO has been walking a thin line, because it has to be as supportive as possible of Ukraine, but the red lines have been drawn — by the United States, first — that there’s to be no military engagement in Ukraine,” he said.

To impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would require Biden and other leaders to “level with their own people, and to be aware that this might put us at war with Russia,” he continued.

After their meeting, the ministers from the G-7 bloc — which includes the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Britain and Japan — criticized Russia’s shelling of a nuclear power plant in Ukraine.

“Any armed attack on and threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of international law,” they said.

Josep Borrell, the E.U.’s foreign affairs chief, said Russian was conducting the war in a “barbarian” way. “This is Putin’s war,” he said. “And Putin has to stop this war.”

European diplomats continue to weigh further measures to increase economic pressure on Putin, officials said, including potential steps to reduce reliance on Russian energy supplies.

On Twitter on Friday, Kuleba thanked NATO members for their support but urged them to do more. His message to them, he said: “Act now before it’s too late. Don’t let Putin turn Ukraine into Syria.”

NATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, said during his speech on the situation in Ukraine that the alliance must also support Georgia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

NATO has provided support to Georgia, BiH and Moldova for many years, he said.

“We helped them with capacity building, reforms, strengthening their defence and security institutions, holding common exercises.

“We didn’t make any final decisions but it’s a broad agreement that we need to do more to support these countries. This is about scaling up the things we will do there like strengthening their defence and security institutions, reforms, training, but also potentially adding more activities in support of these countries. Because what you are seeing with Ukraine is that they too may be at risk, exposed for even more intervention, subversion and potentially even attacks by the Russian armed forces and the Russian Federation,” he said.

Asked if NATO sees any concrete threat of Russian invasion on the three countries, Stoltenberg said all three countries face different types of risks.

“What they have in common is that we have seen Russia try to exercise their power, to intimidate them partially by subversion, interference in domestic political processes or by a military invasion,” he said, recalling that there are Russian troops in both Georgia and Moldova without the consent of those two sovereign governments.

“In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we see a very fragile and unstable situation with inflammatory rhetoric and serious challenges to the unity of that state,” Stoltenberg said, adding that the three states faced serious challenges even before the war in Ukraine that were inflicted by Russia.

The risk has increased and therefore NATO needs to step up its support and have a serious discussion as NATO on what they can do to strengthen them in the face of Russian threats, he said.",https://ba.n1info.com/english/news/nato-secretary-general-says-alliance-must-provide-support-to-bosnia-as-well/

“Allies agree we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or NATO troops operating in Ukrainian territory,” Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general, said at a news conference after a meeting of foreign ministers.

Ukrainian officials have called for a no-fly zone over Ukraine’s airspace, but NATO is resisting for fear that it could draw member states into a war with Russia.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said foreign ministers took the “painful decision” to reject Ukraine’s pleas for air support, even as Russia seized two nuclear plants, because it would virtually guarantee a “full-fledged war involving many more European countries.”

The US-led Alliance will look again at the military picture when defence ministers from its 30 members gather on March 16, but Stoltenberg stressed that its “core task is to protect and defend 1 billion people” living in its territories from Canada to Turkey.

The sustainability of that stance is being openly questioned at a military level with former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, retired 4-star general Wesley Clark, telling CNN on Friday that the endgame in Ukraine will surely echo that in Bosnia after the atrocities ordered by Slobodan Milosevic.

“We have made it clear we are not going to move into Ukraine, neither on the ground nor in airspace,” Stoltenberg said after Kyiv begged for a no-fly zone like that imposed in the Balkans wars of the 1990s.

The Bosnian experience was proving something of a theme on Friday, with former British prime minister Gordon Brown also leading a call for a new tribunal to fill a gap in International Criminal Court competence.

While Stoltenberg welcomed The Hague-based tribunal’s announcement it had opened an investigation into Russia’s actions, the crime of “aggression” short of war crimes has become a new focal point.

Use of word ‘war’

That further chimed with the Russian legislature’s moves to criminalise reporting of the conflict and the closure of independent Echo of Moscow radio station, which ex-staff told TV news centred on the use of the word “war” to categorise what President Vladimir Putin maintains is a “special military operation” in Ukraine.

Stoltenberg’s concerns echoed the position of EU Council President Charles Michel, who has warned of the risk of a “third international war”. The former Norwegian premier insisted that NATO is “not part of this conflict and we have a responsibility to ensure it does not spread beyond Ukraine.”

‘Serious challenge’ Bosnia

However, with Moscow targeting nuclear facilities, reports of the use of cluster bombs, and Ukraine’s Foreign Minister accusing Russian soldiers of raping pregnant Ukrainian women, it is clear that Western relations with Russia have “fundamentally changed for the long term”.

Russian forces have taken de facto control of parts of Georgia and Moldova for years, and Stoltenberg said “inflammatory rhetoric” in Bosnia again posed a “serious challenge to the integrity of that state.”

NATO was formed in the aftermath of World War II to preserve peace in Europe and protect democratic nations from potential attacks by the Soviet Union (which exists today as the Russian Federation). NATO’s website states that NATO's founding treaty ""commits the Allies to democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law, as well as to peaceful resolution of disputes. Importantly, the treaty sets out the idea of collective defense, meaning that an attack against one Ally is considered an attack against all Allies."" As of February 2022, NATO has 30 members in total.

The 12 founding member countries of NATO are Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. NATO also has a list of aspiring members, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine, which may one day become full NATO members.

Is Ukraine part of NATO?

Not yet, but it is in the process of joining. Ukraine joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1994 and applied to join the NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) in 2008. The 2010 presidential election of Viktor Yanukovych, who wanted to keep the country non-aligned, delayed Ukraine's progress toward U.N. membership. However, after two important events in 2014—Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and a national election—Ukraine's new government renewed and prioritized efforts to join NATO. According to a 2017 poll, 69% of Ukrainians support joining NATO. Ukraine became a NATO aspiring member in 2018. On February 7, 2019, the Ukrainian parliament voted to change its constitution to affirm its intention to join NATO and the European Union.

Is Russia part of NATO?

No, Russia is not part of NATO. In fact, the Russian government's perceived aggressiveness is the main issue NATO was founded to counteract. Despite this, Russia has historically at least given the appearance of cooperation with NATO. Russia and NATO established the North Atlantic Cooperation Council in 1991, and Russia joined the Partnership for Peace program in 1994. The establishment of the Russia-NATO Council to address security issues and collaborate on joint projects followed in 2002. NATO suspended cooperation with Russia in 2014 following Russia's invasion of Crimea, not including the NATO-Russia Council. Russia and NATO have held several meetings since 2017, and NATO states that an improvement in their relationship with Russia is dependent on Russia's compliance with international law and their commitments. In October 2021, NATO expelled eight Russians from its Brussels, Belgium headquarters amid concerns that they were undeclared intelligence agents. Russia responded by suspending relations with NATO.

Future members and the Partnership for Peace program

Twenty countries are members of NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which is designed to build trust between the organization and states in Europe and the former Soviet Union. Perhaps ironically, Russia itself is a member of the Partnership for Peace program, though its invasions of Georgia (2008), Crimea (2014) and the Ukraine (2022) call the country's commitment to peace into question.

Members of NATO's Partnerships for Peace program:

Armenia - 1994 Ireland - 1999 Sweden - 1994 Austria - 1995 Kazakhstan - 1994 Switzerland - 1994 Azerbaijan - 1994 Kyrgyzstan - 1994 Tajikistan - 2002 Belarus - 1995 Malta - 2008 Turkmenistan - 1994 Bosnia and Herzegovnia - 2006 Moldova - 1994 Ukraine - 1994 Finland - 1994 Russia - 1994 Uzbekistan - 1994 Georgia - 1994 Serbia - 2006

Members of the Partnership for Peace program include former republics of the Soviet Union: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, as well as Yugoslavia's former republics Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. European Union members of the program include Austria, Finland, Ireland, Malta, and Sweden. Finally, the European Free Trade Association member Switzerland is also part of the Partnership for Peace program.",https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/nato-countries

NATO is also establishing four multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The eight battlegroups will extend all along NATO’s eastern flank, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.

NATO Allies are also increasing the resilience of their societies and infrastructure to counter Russia’s malign influence. This includes enhancing cyber capabilities and defences, and providing support to each other in the event of cyber attacks. Allies are ready to impose costs on those who harm them in cyberspace, and are increasing information exchange and situational awareness, enhancing civil preparedness, and strengthening their ability to respond to disinformation. NATO Allies will also enhance their preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

In addition to these immediate responses, NATO is also strengthening its deterrence and defence posture for the longer term, to face a more dangerous strategic reality. This will include significant developments in all domains – from major increases to forces on land, in the air and at sea, to stepping up cyber defences, to making the best use of space assets. These steps will be supported by enhanced exercises with an increased focus on collective defence and interoperability.

NATO is not seeking a war with Russia. NATO is a defensive Alliance. All measures are and will remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.

7,cb531a3c-5bd6-404c-97d1-47f97d44c1c3,['Vivienne Machi'],2022-03-04 00:00:00,"STUTTGART, Germany – From now on, NATO is sharing all information pertaining to the ongoing war in Ukraine with close partners Sweden and Finland, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced Friday.

“In response to Russia’s aggression, we have decided to strengthen our coordination and information-sharing with Finland and Sweden,” Stoltenberg said at a press conference in Brussels, adding, “Both countries are now taking part in all NATO consultations about the crisis.”

The briefing occurred just before foreign ministers from NATO’s 30 member-nations gathered to discuss Russia’s war on Ukraine, with leaders from Helsinki, Stockholm, and the European Union also in attendance.

Stoltenberg’s announcement comes as calls have mounted for the two Nordic countries to formally join the alliance. Finland and Sweden are two of six Enhanced Opportunity Partners with NATO, representing the closest partnership a nation can have with the alliance without being a member. The other four EOPs are Australia, Georgia, Jordan, and Ukraine – the latter being selected in 2020.

Helsinki and Stockholm have been considered to be in a tier of their own within the EOPs. That’s thanks to “the sophistication of their militaries, the stability of their democratic political systems, and their critical geography of the Baltic Sea bridging NATO’s Nordic and Baltic countries,” analysts Anna Wieslander and Christopher Skaluba wrote in a March 3 report for the Atlantic Council.

The two nations have traditionally walked a fine line between lauding their close relationship to NATO, while maintaining that their citizens want to keep out of the alliance. But the report cites recent polls showing that up to 53 percent of Finns now support joining NATO – compared to only 19 percent in support in 2017. Meanwhile, Swedes are now 41 percent in support of joining the alliance, compared to 35 percent since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.

“Events on the ground in Ukraine will likely dictate whether and how soon Sweden and Finland apply for NATO membership, and how readily the alliance might admit them,” Wieslander and Skaluba wrote. “But with the contours of European security irrevocably altered since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the direction of thinking in both countries – especially Finland – is getting clearer by the day.”

Stoltenberg also shared that the NATO member-nations are now contemplating a more long-term increase to their military presence along the Eastern flank.

The alliance has dedicated a considerable presence in countries including Poland, Romania, and Estonia in response to Russian aggression towards Ukraine, with over 130 fighter jets and over 200 ships positioned to protect the 1 billion citizens across its 30 member states from potential attack, he added.

“We are now seriously considering a significant increase of our presence, both in more troops, [and] with more air defense,” he said. That discussion began Friday during the foreign ministers meeting, and will continue when NATO defense ministers meet on March 16.

“We have some time – not a lot, but some time – to make that more long-term decision,” he said.

The alliance also wants to step up its support for Georgia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, after determining that these two nations are, like Ukraine, at risk of “even more intervention, subversion or even attack by the Russian Armed Forces,” Stoltenberg said. The “broad agreement” to increase support could include more joint activities and exercises, and scaling up support for national defense and security institutions.

Stoltenberg restated that NATO is not seeking a war with Russia, and said foreign ministers on Friday rejected the idea to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

“Our core task is to keep our 30 nations safe,” he said. “We are not part of this conflict, and we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine. Because that would be even more devastating and more dangerous.”

Nato said on Friday it has more than 100 fighter jets on high alert and 200 ships positioned from north to south to deter Russia from escalating the war in Eastern Europe beyond Ukraine.

The alliance’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said it would “do whatever it takes” to defend “every inch of Nato territory” from any Russian attack.

But Nato’s top diplomats confirmed on Friday what Mr Stoltenberg called the “painful decision” to keep their troops and planes out of non-member Ukraine despite the scenes of destruction unfolding there.

Although Ukraine is pleading for a no-fly zone in its airspace, senior western leaders say this would involve shooting down Russian jets and thereby risk a further escalation of the war.

Quote We call on Putin to stop this war immediately Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

“We understand the desperation,” Mr Stoltenberg said, “but we also believe that if we did that, we end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe.”

As the war entered its second week, there was a brief resumption of east-west talks as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told Russian President Vladimir Putin in an hour-long call to call of hostilities and allow access for humanitarian workers. Mr Putin said a third round of ceasefire talks with Ukraine would take place at the weekend.

Nato countries are supporting Ukraine’s resistance with weapons and trying to pressure Russia into backing down by hitting its economy and top leadership with sanctions.

But the attention of foreign ministers turned more broadly on Friday to preventing the war from spreading elsewhere in Europe and exacerbating an already acute humanitarian crisis. Britain on Friday formally launched a scheme for Ukrainians in the UK to bring their extended family to live with them.

Diplomats have spoken of a changed security environment in which countries must prepare themselves for hostility with Russia, with Germany notably turning a historic page by announcing a military ramp-up and exporting weapons to Ukraine.

Threats inside and outside Nato

Within the 30-member alliance, the US and European countries have sent thousands more troops to Nato’s eastern flank to defend countries neighbouring Russia such as Lithuania and Estonia.

Mr Stoltenberg said 130 jets were on high alert and 200 ships stationed “from the high north to the Mediterranean” to deter any Russian attack.

Units from a special Nato response force have been deployed for the first time, with 500 French troops flying to Romania to shore up part of the alliance’s eastern border.

Western allies’ response has been cheered by Nato as a show of transatlantic unity at a time when the alliance is facing questions over its future, with France leading calls for the EU to gain more autonomy in defence matters.

But security fears go beyond Nato’s borders, with the outbreak of war reviving a decades-old debate in Finland and Sweden over whether they should join the alliance.

Both countries took part in Friday’s meeting on what Britain has described as one of the biggest days of diplomacy on record, with the Nato talks followed by an EU summit at which the UK, US, Canada and Ukraine were invited as guests.

The two Nordic countries will take part in all Nato consultations over Ukraine crisis and more information will be shared between them and the alliance, the Secretary General said.

Nato is also looking to deter any Russian aggression against non-member Georgia, which fought a war with Russia in 2008, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Mr Stoltenberg said such countries could be at risk because the Kremlin had demonstrated a desire to “recreate a sphere of influence” in Eastern Europe and “deny other countries the right to choose their own path”.

Although there were no concrete decisions at Friday’s meeting, foreign ministers agreed that Georgia and Bosnia should receive more training and support in strengthening their defence and security institutions.

Similar support has been provided to Ukraine in recent years, which western leaders credit with helping to slow down the Russian invasion which stretched into an eighth day on Friday.

The Brussels meetings came in the shadow of Russian shelling near an operating nuclear power plant, adding to fears of a radioactive release after invading troops earlier took control of the Chernobyl disaster site.

Mr Stoltenberg said the incident was an example of Russia’s recklessness in waging war against Ukraine.

The days to come “are likely to be worse with more death more suffering and more destruction,” he said, as Russia brings in heavier weaponry and continues its attacks across the country.

“We call on President Putin to stop this war immediately,” said Mr Stoltenberg, and “withdraw his forces from Ukraine without conditions and engage in genuine diplomacy.”

Although western leaders believe their sanctions on Russia are starting to bite, Mr Putin has shown no signs of backing down in what he calls a special operation to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine.

Britain says it wants to see more western sanctions, which officials are preparing in the background but were not on the table for approval at Friday’s meeting.

At the EU meeting, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said failing to punish Russia would put the long-cherished principles of self-determination and territorial integrity in doubt beyond Ukraine.

""If we allow those principles to be challenged, as Putin is doing now with impunity,"" he said, ""that will open a Pandora’s box of trouble.""",https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/2022/03/04/nato-puts-fighter-jets-and-warships-on-alert-to-prevent-ukraine-war-spreading/

Linda Thomas-Greenfield, speaking at an emergency meeting of the UN security council in New York on Friday, the US envoy said Russia’s actions, which caused a major fire at the Zaporizhzhia compound, reflected a “dangerous new escalation” in its invasion of Ukraine. “Russia’s attack last night put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk,” she said. “It was incredibly reckless and dangerous. And it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe.”

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president issued a rebuke to Nato which earlier refused to impose a no-fly zone, over concerns that doing so could cause the war to escalate across Europe.

In a furious late night speech, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity.

“The alliance has given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages by refusing to create a no-fly zone.”

At a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Brussels, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance could not directly engage with Russian forces.

“The only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send Nato fighter planes into Ukraine’s airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes,” Stoltenberg said.

Western leaders expressed outrage at the incident at Zaporizhzhia, with the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, describing Putin’s actions as “now directly threatening the safety of all of Europe” and the US president, Joe Biden, condemning Moscow for the shelling, which Russia claimed was a “monstrous provocation” by Ukrainian saboteurs.

The US embassy in Kyiv called the attack a “war crime” in a post on Twitter but the US state department reportedly distanced itself from the allegation, instructing its other embassies not to retweet the claim.

The fire, at a training centre on the site’s perimeter, was extinguished on Friday and officials said radiation was normal. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said the reactors were undamaged but the situation “naturally continues to be extremely tense and challenging”. Russian forces seized the plant after heavy fighting.

Russian ground forces in the south of Ukraine made an assault on the shipbuilding centre of Mykolaiv as they began their long-expected push west towards the key port of Odesa. Kyiv came under fresh heavy attack and local authorities in the northern city of Chernihiv raised the death toll from a missile strike on residential buildings on Thursday to 47.

In Russia, reporting of the war by international and local independent media was put under increasing pressure as the lower house of parliament passed a law punishing the intentional spreading of “fake” news about the military with 15 years in jail. The BBC announced it was suspending all operations in the country and the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, edited by the Nobel peace prize winner Dmitry Muratov, said it would be removing content on Ukraine. Access to Facebook and Twitter was also completely blocked in retaliation for the social media platforms’ restrictions on state-backed media.

At the Nato foreign ministers’s meeting Stoltenberg, described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades … with cities under siege, schools, hospitals, and residential buildings shelled”.

In a sobering assessment of the military situation, he told reporters there was evidence of the use of cluster bombs and “other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law”, adding: “The days to come are likely to be worse.”

He warned that there was also a growing risk of the war spreading to Georgia, on whose territory Vladimir Putin’s troops are already present, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Bosnian Serbs have been threatening to break up the state with the Kremlin’s support.

The UN human rights office said it had confirmed 331 civilians, including 19 children, had been killed and 675 injured since the invasion began on 24 February, adding that the real toll would be much higher. Most were killed by explosive weapons such as shelling from heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems, missiles and airstrikes.

The UN refugee and children’s agencies said more than 1.2 million people had fled the country, including about half of a million children. The UNCHR spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams described the rate as “phenomenal”, adding that an equal number were probably displaced inside Ukraine.

Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said the EU was working with NGOs in Ukraine to establish “humanitarian corridors”, after agreement between Kyiv and representatives from the Kremlin on Thursday. “Humanitarian aid must be able to reach all parts of Ukraine and civilians must be allowed to escape cities under siege,” she said.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said in Brussels that the west was “faced with what is President Putin’s war of choice: unprovoked, unjustified, and a war that is having horrific, horrific consequences for real people. For mothers, fathers. For children. We see the images on TV, and it has to stop.”

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who had joined the meeting in Brussels by video link, showed Blinken and EU foreign ministers photographs of the carnage being wrought.

“One of which I think has also been in the media shows a father grieving over his dead child,” Blinken said. “Blood is still on the sheet, the drapes, it’s a reminder that even as we talk about these weighty issues of war and peace, what this is really about is the lives of men, women, children, hundreds, thousands of individual human tragedies inflicted by Vladimir Putin and his war of choice on Ukraine and its people and we can’t lose sight of that fact.”

Putin, however, dismissed reports of airstrikes on Kyiv and other large Ukrainian cities as “gross propaganda fakes” in a phone call with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, the Kremlin said. The Russian president “confirmed Russia is open to dialogue” with Ukraine but only “on condition all Russian demands are met”, it said.

Those demands included neutral and non-nuclear status for Ukraine and its “denazification”, the recognition of Crimea as part of Russia and of the “sovereignty” of separatist territories in eastern Ukraine, Moscow said.

Putin told Scholz he hoped “Kyiv will take a reasonable and constructive position” in a third round of talks planned for next week, the Kremlin statement added. Putin separately warned Russia’s neighbours on Friday “not to escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country.

As Russian forces stepped up their assault on cities particularly in the south and east of Ukraine, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country had “survived a night that could have stopped the story, the history of Ukraine, the history of Europe”.

A day after Moscow’s forces took control of the strategically important city of Kherson, the invading troops continued to besiege population centres, particularly in southern Ukraine, pounding them with artillery and airstrikes and causing devastating damage.

The governor of Mykolaiv said Russian troops had entered his city of about 500,000 people, although a presidential adviser later said the advance had been halted.

The south-eastern port city of Mariupol is also encircled by Russian forces and heavily bombarded, but remains under Ukrainian control.

The city’s deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said its humanitarian situation was “terrible” after 40 hours of continuous shelling including on schools and hospitals. “I believe that he wants to destroy Ukraine as a nation, and Mariupol is on this way.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/nato-chief-warns-of-worse-suffering-in-ukraine-and-russian-attacks-elsewhere

It’s great have you back here, and thank you for your tremendous leadership and for your tireless efforts in this critical time for our security. Later on today, NATO defense – NATO foreign ministers will meet and coordinate and consult on our response to the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine and also the longer-term implications.

We condemn the attacks on civilians, and over the night we have also seen reports about the attack against a nuclear power plant. This just demonstrates the recklessness of this war and the importance of ending it and the importance of Russia withdrawing all its troops and engage in good faith in diplomatic efforts.

NATO Allies have implemented unprecedented sanctions. We provide support to Ukraine. At the same time, NATO is not part to the conflict. NATO is a defensive alliance. We don’t seek war, conflict with Russia. At the same time, we need to make sure that there is no misunderstanding about our commitment to defend and protect our Allies, and therefore we have increased the presence of NATO forces in the eastern part of the Alliance. This is a defensive presence, and I welcome the strong commitment by – from the United States with more troops. I met many of them, and it’s always great to meet U.S. troops in Europe and to see their commitment and their professionalism being part of the transatlantic bond.

I also welcome that European allies and Canada are stepping up with more presence in the eastern part of the Alliance on land, at sea, and in the air. If anything, I think the crisis we are facing now demonstrates the importance of North America standing together in strategic solidarity in NATO. So once again, Tony, welcome. It’s great to see you here.

SECRETARY BLINKEN: Jens, thank you so much, and I really couldn’t say it any better. But simply put, in the wake of Russia’s unprovoked, premeditated aggression against Ukraine, this Alliance came together with speed, with unity, with determination, immediately launching the rapid response task force, putting in place the graduated plans to continue to bolster NATO’s security. Every Ally in one way or another is coming to Ukraine’s assistance. Every Ally in one way or another is helping to strengthen NATO itself. And as the secretary general said, ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us, we are ready for it, and we will defend every inch of NATO territory.

At the same time, as the secretary general said, we’re preparing for NATO’s future. And the events of the last few weeks as they continue will further inform that future, particularly going into the NATO summit in a few months, and the writing of a new strategic concept. All of these things are coming together at a critical time. But the single common denominator that we found, and that is the strength of everything that we do, is the unity of this Alliance. It’s been on full display in these weeks. It will remain on full display going forward. And I look forward to consulting with you, Jens, about the steps we’re going to take next. Thank you.
