Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and the principles of the UN Charter and undermines European and global security and stability. It is inflicting unspeakable suffering on the Ukrainian population. Russia, and its accomplice Belarus, bear full responsibility for this war of aggression and those responsible will be held to account for their crimes, including for indiscriminately targeting civilians and civilian objects. In this respect we welcome the decision of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to open an investigation. We call for the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities to be ensured immediately with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency. We demand that Russia ceases its military action and withdraws all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine immediately and unconditionally, and fully respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence within its internationally recognised borders.

2. We commend the people of Ukraine for their courage in defending their country and our shared values of freedom and democracy. We will not leave them alone. The EU and its Member States will continue to provide coordinated political, financial, material and humanitarian support. We are committed to provide support for the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine once the Russian onslaught has ceased. We are determined to increase even further our pressure on Russia and Belarus. We have adopted significant sanctions and remain ready to move quickly with further sanctions.

3. Countless people are fleeing the war in Ukraine. We offer temporary protection to all war refugees from Ukraine. We commend European countries, notably at the borders with Ukraine, for showing immense solidarity in hosting Ukrainian war refugees. The EU and its Member States will continue to show solidarity and provide humanitarian, medical and financial support to all refugees and the countries hosting them. We call for funds to be made available without delay through a swift adoption of the proposal on Cohesion’s Action for Refugees in Europe (CARE) and through ReactEU. We call on Russia to fully abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law. It must ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to the victims and internally displaced persons in Ukraine, and allow safe passage for those civilians who want to leave.

4. The European Council acknowledged the European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine, as stated in the Association Agreement. On 28 February 2022, exercising the right of Ukraine to choose its own destiny, the President of Ukraine submitted the application of Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. The Council has acted swiftly and invited the Commission to submit its opinion on this application in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties. Pending this and without delay, we will further strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership to support Ukraine in pursuing its European path. Ukraine belongs to our European family.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Leaders of EU member states, who gathered at a two-day unofficial summit in Versailles Palace near the French capital, Paris, on Thursday discussed the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

While EU member states have been fully united in backing Ukraine's resistance, leaders are divided on how fast the bloc could move to accept Ukraine as a member, and how swiftly the EU could cut energy ties with Moscow.

What did EU leaders say about Ukraine's possible membership?

During Thursday’s talks, EU leaders emphasized once again that a speedy path to block membership was impossible.

""There is no such thing as a fast track,"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said.

""I want to focus on what can we do for Volodymyr Zelenskyy tonight, tomorrow, and EU accession of Ukraine is something for the long-term — if at all,"" he stressed.

Former eastern bloc countries, led by Poland, called for a stronger signal towards EU membership.

There are those ""who think that .. Ukrainians are fighting for their lives and (deserve) a strong political message ... and those who are still debating the procedures,"" Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa said.

A joint statement from the EU leaders released early on Friday, said the European Council has ""acted swiftly"" and invited the European Commission to submit its opinion on Ukraine’s application for membership ""in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaties.""

""Pending this and without delay, we will further strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership to support Ukraine in pursuing its European path. Ukraine belongs to our European family,"" the statement said,

The summit comes as more than 2.2 million people have fled Ukraine into neighboring states to seek refuge from Russian attacks, which have often hit civilian infrastructure.

Russia's invasion is widely seen as having shattered the European security order that came into being following World War II and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Russia's invasion now the main focus

The Versailles summit was originally meant to discuss the EU's new economic model, as a highlight of France's six-month term holding the rolling EU presidency, however, that focus shifted to Russia's attack on Ukraine, which has been widely seen as a breach of international law.

""Two weeks ago Russia brought war back to Europe. Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and the principles of the UN Charter and undermines European and global security and stability,"" the statement from EU leaders said.

The statement said EU member states will enforce the implementation of sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion and that they are ready to institute more measures if needed to keep pressure on both Russia and Belarus.

""We are determined to increase even further our pressure on Russia and Belarus. We have adopted significant sanctions and remain ready to move quickly with further sanctions,"" it said.

Ahead of the summit, French and German leaders Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz jointly phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin to call for an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine.

""We call on Russia to fully abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law. It must ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to the victims and internally displaced persons in Ukraine, and allow safe passage for those civilians who want to leave,"" the joint statement from EU leaders said.

Energy dependence highlights divide in EU

The debate over Europe's energy dependence on Russian gas and oil has made the divide between EU member states glaringly clear. Countries like Germany, Austria and Hungary cover most of their energy needs with Russian fuel; Latvia and Poland, however, have called for an immediate halt to Russian imports.

Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karin, for instance, voiced strong support for an end to imports as a tool to force Putin's hand, saying, ""I am convinced that we should make a decision to stop energy imports from Russia to get Putin to the negotiating table and end this war.""

""At this moment of crisis,"" said European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, ""we must remember that energy is political — it always has been,"" imploring leaders to send a clear signal to Moscow by limiting fuel imports.

Poland and Lithuania have already called for such a step as a way to sap Russia of its main source cash financing the war in Ukraine.

According to the Brussels-based think tank Breugel, EU member states currently spend €380 million ($420 million) on Russian gas, and nearly €362 million on Russian oil every single day.

Despite putting the German-Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline on ice as war loomed, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been exceedingly reluctant to join the call for an immediate end to imports. Earlier this week, Scholz said there was currently no other way to cover Europe's energy needs than through Russia.

In Versailles, the German leader made the case for precisely targeted sanctions in order to pressure Russia. He also highlighted the need to minimize the economic impact of such measures on EU citizens.

The war in Ukraine has led to a dramatic spike in energy prices, leading European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to inform those present that she would lay out proposals for emergency measures, such as temporary price caps, for their consideration by the end of March.

­­­VERSAILLES, France — War has returned to Europe and the Continent will never be the same, EU heads of state and government said Friday. But as leaders gathered for a summit at the Palace of Versailles, they struggled to adapt to their frightening new reality.

On the one hand, they admitted that many old rules must now be rewritten — for example, to accommodate unprecedented new military spending.

“Two weeks ago, we woke up in a different Europe in a different world,” European Council President Charles Michel said.

At the same time, many leaders clung to old tribal instincts, with frugal countries reluctant to take on new joint debt, and Western countries hesitant about admitting new members in the east, including war-ravaged Ukraine.

Perhaps most contradictory was an insistence by some leaders, including the summit host, French President Emmanuel Macron, that Europe itself is not at war, even though they acknowledged that Russia invaded Ukraine precisely because of Kyiv’s westward trajectory toward the EU, insisted that they would ramp up military support, and agreed to impose further punishing sanctions on Moscow.

“The choice by Russia under President Putin was to bring war back to Europe,” Macron said at the summit’s closing news conference. “The unheard-of violence of Russia against Ukraine and its population is a tragic turning point for our history.”

But when pressed by a reporter about the EU’s inability to stop the conflict, Macron said: “There is a war on the ground, but we are not at war.” He added, “You’re quite right to say that we don’t have a response in the theater of war, which was triggered by Russian aggression, because we are not there in the theater of war.”

Though Macron and other leaders said that Putin’s invasion had redrawn permanently the security architecture in Europe, they also conceded that EU countries were not remotely prepared to adopt a new posture and assert hard power to stop incidents like the bombing of a maternity hospital in Mariupol, which may constitute war crimes.

“We have our way to answer to the atrocious aggression that Putin is showing,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, announcing a fourth round of international sanctions against Russia. “And we will be determined and forceful in the answer.”

Determined and forceful, perhaps, but also a bit chaotic and disorganized.

Michel, along with the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, announced a proposal to increase by another €500 million the EU contribution to military support for Ukraine through an off-budget fund called the European Peace Facility. Both men gave the impression that leaders had approved the plan.

That, however, was contradicted by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who said that no decision had been taken. An aide to Michel later conceded that the proposal was “on the table” but would still require formal approval by the Council of the EU, with a decision perhaps next week.

The two-day summit at the ornate palace on the outskirts of Paris was originally intended as the occasion to start rethinking the EU’s debt and deficit rules, with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, former chief of the European Central Bank, at the center of the effort along with Macron.

Instead, with the agenda rewritten by war, the summit repeatedly showcased EU leaders struggling to rise to the moment with Ukraine under bombardment and more than 2 million refugees having already streamed out of the country.

Leaders wrestled with spiking energy prices, and potential disruption in supplies of critical raw materials, including agricultural products that could lead to food shortages around the world.

But the heads of state and government also spent nearly five hours debating Ukraine’s request for fast-track approval of its application for EU membership, even though no such fast-track process technically exists. The leaders eventually settled on a robust, and symbolically important, statement of support.

They noted that Ukraine’s application had already been put before the Commission for consideration with unprecedented speed, beginning a years-long bureaucratic process, and pledged to do everything possible to bring Ukraine closer to the EU in the meantime.

“Pending this and without delay,” the leaders said, ”we will further strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership to support Ukraine in pursuing its European path. Ukraine belongs to our European family.” At Friday’s news conference, von der Leyen pointedly said: “We have opened the pathway toward us for Ukraine.”

During the summit, the leaders also agreed to try to end Europe’s reliance on energy from Russia, though there were substantial disagreements about how quickly that could be accomplished and if the goal could be achieved without driving up prices for citizens and businesses.

“We agreed to phase out our dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports as soon as possible,” the leaders declared in the final statement, in which they also tasked the European Commission to develop a plan on the energy goals by the end of May.

Some leaders of southern EU countries, including Draghi, used the summit to press for further joint borrowing, modeled after the landmark joint debt program in the EU’s coronavirus pandemic economic rescue and recovery plan. Draghi said the war had created “the need for a reconsideration of the whole regulatory apparatus which is justified by this emergency situation. We find this argument on the Stability Pact, we find it on the laws on state aid, we find it on the standards of agricultural products that may be imported, we find it on the electricity market.”

However, Rutte and leaders of other traditional frugal countries were quick to resist proposals on more joint debt.

“The Netherlands is not in favor of eurobonds, or joint debts issuance,” Rutte said after the summit, noting that it would be better to first redirect funds from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery plan that have not been spent yet.

Overall, EU officials and diplomats said that EU countries were quite united in the need to respond forcefully to Russia’s warmongering and that the disagreements on display at the summit were part of the regular give and take among national capitals with an array of different interests and sensibilities.

“There is a widespread and shared sense of urgency,” said a senior official from a northern EU country. “Issues are very complex and, therefore, a simple ‘we are united’ is not enough.”

Macron and other leaders noted the sea change in positions that had been adopted by some member countries in the weeks since Russia attacked Ukraine, including Germany’s decision to supply weapons and ramp up its own national military spending.

“Germany decided a little more than 10 days ago to carry out historic investments,” Macron said. “Denmark has also made a historical choice to submit to its people in several months the possibility of going back in the European project of security and defense.” He added, “You see it, everywhere on our Continent, historic choices are being undertaken, which mark a major turning point. We must organize that at a European level to build that common capacity when it comes to defense.”

Whether, in fact, the EU will manage to get its act together on a common security and defense strategy once and for all remains to be seen.

Von der Leyen, at the summit’s closing news conference, urged an investigation into possible war crimes by Russia, including in the bombing of a maternity hospital in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

“Indeed it is atrocious, it is atrocious,” she said “This bombardment of the maternity hospital, for example. And I think there needs to be investigations about the question of war crimes. Therefore, this has to be reflected and recorded, soberly.”

“We are at day 15 of this horrible war,” von der Leyen added, noting that the EU had done its part to inflict economic damage on Russia with severe sanctions. “You see that the ruble is in freefall. It has lost more than 50 percent compared to the euro. You see that there are skyrocketing interest rates in Russia. You see soaring inflation. The rating agencies do rate the Russian bonds as junk by now, and recession is hitting the country. This is within 15 days.”

Macron said he believed the summit had helped leaders grapple with the momentous choices they face in confronting Russia’s military aggression.

“Today, we are not, we Europeans on the ground, at war,” he said. “But we must also do our share and have the courage to take historic decisions, to bear responsibility for the fact that defending democracy and our values has a cost, that making these choices of independence has a cost and it implies that we sometimes question dogmas that we had had for many years … the ways we organized things and the habits we had.”

He continued, “And I believe that I can say that the discussions of yesterday and today have led to an awareness of the Europeans here in Versailles to make progress in that direction.”

This falls short of the promise to speed up the candidacy procedure that some had been calling for. But Croatia's prime minister told FRANCE 24 that the 27 member states have sent a ""strong political signal"". Andrej Plenkovic spoke to our Europe Editor Catherine Nicholson during this week's EU summit in Versailles.

""In Versailles, we sent a strong political signal saying that we want to intensify relations with Ukraine in every single possible way that we can in order to pursue its European path,"" Plenkovic told FRANCE 24.

The Croatian premier strongly condemned the ""brutal"" Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying that on February 24, Russia ""violated all the principles of international law and international order as we know it"" and that the EU was united in its condemnation of the war.

He added: ""We can only conclude after the statements of Russia's Foreign Minister [Sergei Lavrov] that we live in two different realities, and that's why we will continue sending strong messages and adopting packages of restrictive measures in order to tell Moscow that this is not appropriate; that they should immediately stop with so many innocent casualties and people fleeing their homes in Ukraine. This is unbelievable and unacceptable for the third decade of the 21st century in Europe.""

EU's energy dependence on Russian gas 'above 40 percent'

Asked about the EU's dependency on Russian gas, Plenkovic said: ""In Europe, the energy dependence on Russian gas is above 40 percent. It's a very real threat to countries and I think what we are currently doing is setting up the entire alternative concept of the gas supply in Europe, whether it's from increased production domestically, or whether it's imports from other countries who are gas producers such as Norway, Azerbaijan, Libya or Algeria, or ships coming with liquefied natural gas.""

The Croatian prime minister said that three crises co-exist. ""One is the tragedy of the Ukrainian people for which we are absolutely sorry and we are trying to help our Ukrainian friends; the second is the massive refugee flow; and the third one is the unprecedented spike of energy prices, whether it's gas, whether it's petrol, whether it's oil or the electricity in turn. The whole idea of the governments, and also at the level of the European Union, we ask the Commission to come up with proposals which should be a European solution, even a global one in capping the energy prices. We have all turned, domestically, into interventionist governments.""

Pouring fuel on the flames of the war, they adopted multiple anti-Russian measures: further arming Ukrainian army units and nationalist militias while pledging to cut off deliveries of Russian oil, gas and grain critical to the food and energy supply of Europe and Africa.

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU Council President Charles Michel were joined by President Emmanuel Macron of France, which now holds the EU’s rotating presidency, at a press conference yesterday afternoon. While COVID-19 infects over 4 million people and claims over 15,000 lives each week in Europe, they said nothing about the pandemic. Nor did they refer to the growing international wave of strikes against rising fuel costs.

They called instead for massive, unspecified increases in EU military spending to “conduct the full range of operations and missions,” including warfare in space and cyberspace.

They announced that the EU would continue pouring weapons into Ukraine, providing a further €1 billion in arms to Kiev. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell had said earlier that the EU would increase its weapons supplies to Ukraine by €500 million. “The decision was taken to add a further €500 million” to the previously agreed-upon increase in weapons spending mentioned by Borrell, Michel said, without specifying how the money would be spent.

Ukraine has previously called on the EU to supply it with anti-aircraft missiles, anti-drone weapons, mine-detection equipment, radio and radar equipment, night vision goggles and ambulances.

While refusing to admit Ukraine into the EU, EU officials agreed to admit Ukrainian refugees into the EU—but only temporarily. Macron said, “The path to our Europe is open to Ukrainians. Their struggle for democracy and the values that unite us has shown that Ukraine indeed belongs to our European family.” However, he added, “Can there be an exceptional and accelerated procedure for entry [into the EU] for a country that is at war? The answer is no.”

In the summit resolution, the EU pledged to “phase out our dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports as soon as possible,” referring to 2027 as a possible deadline. This disruption of world energy markets would massively increase oil and gas prices that are already surging. Moreover, the moves by Washington and the European powers to cut Russia and Belarus out of dollar-denominated transactions in international trade would accelerate the surge in food prices, as the region is a critical exporter of grain.

Macron made clear these policies will have a devastating impact on workers’ living standards, but that the EU will proceed anyway. Europe and Africa “will be very deeply destabilized in terms of food” over the next year, he said. “We must re-evaluate production strategies to defend our sovereignty in food… as Europeans, but also re-evaluate our Africa strategy. Otherwise African countries will be hit in the next 12 to 18 months … because of what cannot currently be planted.”

To justify its policies targeting the working class, the EU summit resolution issued a one-sided denunciation of Russia. It declared: “Two weeks ago Russia brought war back to Europe. Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and the principles of the UN Charter and undermines European and global security and stability. It is inflicting unspeakable suffering on the Ukrainian population. Russia, and its accomplice Belarus, bear full responsibility for this war of aggression…”

While the Kremlin’s decision to invade Ukraine is undoubtedly reckless and reactionary, the EU’s blaming of militarism, mass COVID-19 infections and social austerity on Russia is a pack of lies.

First of all, it was not the Kremlin that “brought war back to Europe,” but the NATO imperialist powers. The Stalinist dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 cleared the way for a wave of bloody NATO wars not only in the Middle East, starting with Iraq and Afghanistan, but in Europe itself. The Yugoslav wars of the 1990s were incited and backed by the NATO powers, who encouraged various Yugoslav republics to secede and then bombed Serbia and Kosovo in 1999.

Moreover, the EU’s posturing as a temporary haven for Ukrainian immigrants is of truly staggering hypocrisy. After NATO wars across the Middle East and Africa over the last 30 years, over 80 million people have become refugees worldwide. The EU has closed its borders to them, consigning millions to refugee camps and leaving tens of thousands to drown in the Mediterranean. Now, however, to denounce Russia and justify its right-wing policies, it is making an insincere and discriminatory show of concern, but only for specifically Ukrainian refugees.

Finally, the EU’s program of rearmament and war targeting Russia is to be waged overwhelmingly at the expense of the working class. As the EU floats plans to borrow €200 billion for rearmament, this will clearly be financed by massive social attacks on workers in Europe. Already Macron has pledged to increase the retirement age in France by three years.

The far-reaching, essentially fascistic implications of this rearmament offensive emerge in bellicose articles in the bourgeois media. On the eve of the summit, German news magazine Der Spiegel published an article titled “An angel with a sword is still an angel!” Its author, Belgian philosopher Luuk van Middelaar, a former advisor to European Commission President Hermann Van Rompuy, praises the return of German militarism.

He writes, “After years of hesitation, the Federal Republic now intends to arm seriously. It has also started to support Kiev militarily. Berlin is breaking with its economic policy towards Moscow, recognising its dependence on gas as a strategic mistake … What its eastern neighbours and several US presidents have failed to do over many years, Putin has achieved in one fell swoop: Germany has woken up geopolitically.”

Middelaar calls on the EU to become a major military power that can wage war on other major powers: “If Europe wants to emerge as a power among powers, capable at some point even of commanding destructive military forces, it will need a different political language to talk about itself and its place in the world. The European Union will have to change its ethos and its demeanor. It must understand that it will then no longer be the angel that liberates the continent and the world from evil and tyranny—but a mortal, strategic and realpolitik actor…”

Workers in Europe and internationally must be warned. After triggering two world wars in the 20th century, the European ruling classes will stop at nothing to impose their imperialist interests in the 21st. Having used Putin’s reactionary invasion to launch its biggest rearmament programme since Hitler, the German bourgeoisie is debating building nuclear weapons.

As Focus magazine wrote, “No fear of nuclear weapons: Why Germany must now talk about nuclear rearmament,” German EU parliamentarian Manfred Weber declared: “The basis of real European sovereignty is the ability for Europe to defend itself—at some point including nuclear weapons.”

The alternative to the EU’s reactionary policies is the growing international class struggle against them. In Italy, fishermen are on a nationwide strike against skyrocketing fuel costs. According to the fishing sector of the Italian farmers’ association Coldiretti Impresapesca, fuel prices for fishing boats have risen 90 percent compared to last year.

Spanish truckers are to go on indefinite strike on 14 March, demanding cuts in fuel taxes to compensate for rising fuel prices.

In Albania, mass protests have erupted against fuel prices. Albanian police arrested at least 16 people Wednesday evening for “illegal assembly.” Street protests have been taking place for days in the capital, Tirana, and in other cities, against a 30 percent increase in oil and gas prices in one week.

In Germany, too, strikes are underway. On Tuesday kindergarten teachers, particularly hard hit by the pandemic, went on strike. Pilots of the cargo airline Aerologic have also voted to strike.

The European sections of the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) are fighting to arm the growing opposition among workers and youth with a socialist programme. The threat of world war, the death of millions from the pandemic and mass social impoverishment can only be overcome by building an independent mass movement against capitalism and the struggle for workers’ power as part of the United Socialist States of Europe.",https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/03/12/vers-m12.html

Leaders of the 27 EU members states have said they would offer temporary protection to “all war refugees from Ukraine” and demanded a full and unconditional withdrawal of Russian forces from all Ukrainian territory.

In a declaration issued early this morning at an EU summit in Versailles, EU heads of state and government said the Russians and Belarusians responsible for the invasion would be “held to account for their crimes”, including attacks on civilians.

The EU leaders said they were determined to apply more pressure on Russia and its ally Belarus. “We have adopted significant sanctions and remain ready to move quickly with further sanctions,” they said.

“Two weeks ago, Russia brought war back to Europe,” the statement said. “Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and the principles of the UN Charter and undermines European and global security and stability.”

EU leaders welcomed the decision of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to open an investigation and called for the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities to be ensured immediately.

They said the EU was offering temporary protection to all war refugees from Ukraine, and commended European countries, notably at the borders with Ukraine, “for showing immense solidarity in hosting Ukrainian war refugees”.

“The EU and its Member States will continue to show solidarity and provide humanitarian, medical and financial support to all refugees and the countries hosting them,” the statement added.

Responding to Ukraine’s application to join the European Union, EU leaders acknowledged the “European aspirations and choice made by Ukraine”, adding that “Ukraine belongs to our European family.”

“The Council has acted swiftly and invited the European Commission to submit its opinion on Ukraine’s application to become an EU member in accordance with the relevant provisions of the treaties.”

In the meantime, EU leaders undertook, without delay, to further “strengthen the bonds” and “deepen the partnership” with Ukraine.

The European Council has also invited the Commission to submit its opinions on the applications of the Republic of Moldova and Georgia.

""I'm convinced that we should make a decision to stop energy imports from Russia to get (President Vladimir) Putin to the negotiating table to stop the war,"" Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said.

The EU's 27 heads of state came together at the informal summit after a frantic two weeks of supplying arms to Ukraine, sheltering nearly 2.2 million people and signing off on three rounds of massive sanctions on Russia for the invasion of its neighbor.

The aim of the embargo would be to deprive the Russian state of its main source of income for financing the war against Ukraine.

According to estimates by the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, EU states currently spend around $420 million a day on Russian gas and almost $400 million on oil from Russia.

Any moves toward an embargo, however, are likely to meet resistance from Germany, Austria and Hungary, who cover significant parts of their energy needs with Russian imports. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz came out strongly against the idea on Monday.

EU leaders were also considering how to create the conditions for a cease-fire in Ukraine.

Referring to an hourlong phone call with Putin and Scholz earlier in the day, French President Emmanuel Macron said the conditions for a cease-fire tabled by the Kremlin leader were ""not acceptable"" to any of those involved.

""So the question is, is Mr. Putin ready to reengage honestly and propose something?"" Macron said before entering the summit venue, adding that he would speak again with Putin within the next few hours.

European Council President Charles Michel reiterated that the EU leaders would consult on measures that could pave the way for a cease-fire.

""I think that we took Russia by surprise because we were firm, we were strong, we were united,"" he said. ""It's not enough – we need to identify together what could be the following steps ... in order to get a cease-fire as soon as possible.""

Ukraine's hopes for quick entry to the European Union were dealt a fresh blow at the start of the summit, with the leaders of Germany and the Netherlands among those to dismiss them as unrealistic.

""There is no such thing as a fast-tracking of accession – that doesn't exist,"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said, according to remarks carried by the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa).

Scholz referred to an association agreement the EU and Ukraine reached in 2017 to deepen political and economic ties.

""It is very important that we continue to pursue the things we have decided in the past – this is the course we must follow,"" the German chancellor said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged the EU to expedite Kyiv's membership bid in light of the Russian invasion of his country.

Membership of the bloc tends to be a lengthy, technical and politically fraught process, during which countries have to align with EU rules and values.

A statement of summit conclusions also poured cold water on Ukrainian hopes for quick accession. It says ""Ukraine belongs in the European family"" but does not make any mention of taking the application further, even after eight hours of deliberations at the summit.

A large majority of EU leaders support sending a strong message to Ukraine that it will be granted membership in the European Union eventually, Slovenia's Prime Minister Janez Jansa said on Friday.

""Not tomorrow, off course, tomorrow they (Ukraine) can just become a candidate,"" he said as he arrived for the second day of a meeting with his European counterparts.

Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said on Friday that Ukraine must respect all the necessary procedural steps before it can become a member of the European Union but closing the door on the country would be a mistake.

""A EU membership process requires a lot of reforms and it's logical that would go step by step, otherwise we'll have countries that will become members of the EU without being ready for it,"" he said as he arrived for the second day of a meeting with his European counterparts at Versailles.

""But on the other hand, it would be a big mistake to close the door to countries, like Ukraine, who feel threatened. We should consistently keep working with them,"" he said.

""We could invite them to summits without them having any decision power ... the commission is working in creative ways in that respect. But to become a member, you have to respect the process,"" De Croo added.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda asserted that EU leaders should have given Ukraine candidate status, voicing his disappointment that a joint declaration did not go that far.

""I wish Ukraine gets the candidate status now ... but it was not possible today, but we will come back to this issue,"" Nauseda told journalists, including from Reuters.

The first day of the two-day event in Versailles was to focus on bolstering the bloc against the economic impact of the war and how to wean the EU off Russian energy imports, which account for more than 40% of its overall consumption.

Plans published by the European Commission on Tuesday outlined the bloc's shift away from Russian gas before 2030. Moscow's recent threats to suspend gas supplies have injected urgency into the discussions.

Some EU member states are pushing for new rules to allow more borrowing to tackle high energy prices during this transition but are meeting resistance. Greece and Spain are also calling for an overhaul of the EU's energy market to address prices.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi threw his weight behind an EU plan to jointly issue bonds to finance energy and defense spending as the bloc copes with the fallout of the war.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed a cap on energy prices in the bloc, rising as a result of the war, to EU leaders at the summit.

Earlier on Thursday, the commission said subsidized loans and limited grants for businesses negatively impacted by the war and the sanctions subsequently imposed on Russia were on the table to help protect the bloc's economy.

Further measures to support EU member states near Ukraine hosting hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the war were also addressed.

""The EU and its Member States will continue to show solidarity and provide humanitarian, medical and financial support to all refugees and the countries hosting them,"" read the statement published in the early hours of Friday.

Leaders of EU countries also called on Russia ""to fully abide by its obligations under international humanitarian law.""

The Ukrainian armed forces could get more weapons and equipment from the EU.

According to Michel, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell proposed to the heads of state and government at the summit in Versailles early Friday that 500 million euros ($550 million) be mobilized for additional supplies.

""Everybody was completely aware that we have to increase our military support to Ukraine,"" Borrell told reporters Friday. ""I am sure the leaders will approve this money.""

The EU is also considering imposing more sanctions on Russian oligarchs and the Russian economy, Borrell added.

Meanwhile, Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel warned Friday that a push for more EU sanctions on Russia needs to be balanced against the economic costs,

""Those who come with new sanctions are those who return tomorrow and say: 'We need more money from you,"" Bettel said on Friday, adding that sanctions come at a price and that a middle way needs to be found to have the most impact on Russia.",https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/eus-embargo-on-russian-oil-gas-sparks-tension-at-versailles-summit
