Ukrainians were desperately trying to hold off the Russian invasion in the early hours of Saturday, at the end of a long night that saw Vladimir Putin's forces advance from the north, south and west.

Ukraine's armed forces tweeted as dawn broke on Saturday: 'During the night the Russian occupiers did not take any city!

'Kyiv is being cleared of the remains of saboteurs. Thank you to the courageous defenders of Ukraine!'

Ukrainians were emerging from their bunkers after a restless night to find a country still defiant, despite the barbarity unleashed by Moscow.

The night began with Ukrainians still in the cities seeking refuge in the subway for the third night in a row.

As dusk fell at 5:30pm local time on Friday, the streets were eerily empty and quiet.

MIDNIGHT

Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, appeared on social media shortly after midnight, warning his people that the coming hours would be decisive.

In a stirring speech from his bunker in a secret location in Kyiv, Zelensky, 44, said that 'the fate of Ukraine is now being decided.'

He told his people: 'This night, the enemy will use all the forces available to break our resistance — treacherously, viciously, inhumanly.

'This night, they will make an assault upon us. We all have to understand what we are going to face. This night, we have to withstand.'

It later emerged that the United States had once more offered Zelensky and his family - his wife Oleana and their daughter Aleksandra, 17, and nine-year-old son, Kiril - the opportunity to be evacuated from Ukraine.

Zelensky refused. On Thursday night, he insisted he was staying put, and indeed on Friday morning he went out into Kyiv to film a short video for the nation, urging resilience.

3am SATURDAY

The first sign that Putin was indeed launching his attack came from Vasylkiv, 20 miles south of the capital.

The city, home to a Cold War-era air base, was the scene of the first major incident when a Russian IL-76 military transporter plane was brought down - reportedly with 150 paratroopers on board.

Sources in the city then claimed that Russian soldiers, dressed as Ukrainian police, ambushed a checkpoint.

Heavy fighting ensued in Vasylkiv, as Putin's forces tried to gain a foothold in the south from which to launch their attack on Kyiv.

Kyiv was in flames in the early hours of Saturday

4am SATURDAY

A second Russian IL-76 was brought down south of Kyiv, in the city of Bila Tserkva, according to reports.

In the east of the country, Ukraine's air defenses brought down a Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jet and a helicopter, the Ukrainian military claimed.

And as the aggressors were trying to advance from the south, another attack was being attempted from the north - even closer to the center of Kiev.

5am SATURDAY

Russian troops were launching an attack on the northern Kyiv suburb of Troieshchyna - site of a thermal power station.

The suburb had been attacked earlier in the week, as Russia tried to wrest control of the strategic jewel on the banks of the Dnieper river.

Unconfirmed reports suggested dozens of Russians had been arrested.

Meanwhile, the Russians were also advancing from the west.

Dramatic footage showed explosions near the Beresteiska metro station, towards the edge of the city.

Locals living along Peremohy Avenue - a main artery into central Kyiv from the west - shared images on social media of vehicles ablaze.

Russian forces were said to be advancing towards Kyiv zoo, towards the Shuliavka district of the city.

The fighting was fierce, yet Ukraine's interior ministry said they repelled the attack - blowing up a bridge along Peremohy Avenue to stop the advancing Russian forces.

Significant explosions were seen from Beresteiska metro station in the west of Kyiv

7:30am SATURDAY

Ukraine's army claimed that the Russians had suffered heavy losses, with 3,500 killed and 200 taken prisoner.

They said Russia had lost 14 airplanes and eight helicopters, plus 102 tanks and 536 armored cars.

8am SATURDAY

Ukraine's interior ministry warned people to stay indoors, saying active battles were taking place in the streets of Kyiv.

Shortly after, Zelensky posted a video to social media of him walking through the streets of Kyiv, captioned: 'Do not believe the fakes.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10554069/Encircled-north-south-west-fighting-battle-Kyiv-unfolded.html

Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky fired a warning shot to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Saturday as the Kremlin's forces closed in around Kyiv, but struggled to make significant advances against fierce resistance.

In a video address, a confident Zelensky said Ukraine had fought off 'enemy attacks'. 'We are defending our country, our land,' he said, demonstrating Kyiv was still under Ukraine's control.

'The occupiers wanted to capture our capital and install their puppets like Donetsk. We broke their idea.'

He added: 'I want everyone in Russia to hear me. Everybody. Hundreds of captured soldiers who are here in Ukraine don't know why they were sent here to kill people or be killed. People need to tell the government why the war has to be stopped, more people from your country will stay alive.'

His message came after a high-rise apartment block in Kyiv was hit by a devastating missile this morning as fighting continued to rage in the capital, with Ukraine's civilian death toll now standing at 198.

Shocking footage recorded nearby shows the weapon flying into the building, located near Zhuliany airport, while CCTV recorded from inside also shows the extent of the damage after the site was hit.

Images show the tower block with a hole covering at least five floors blasted into the side and rubble strewn across the street below.

There have been no fatalities recorded from the attack, according to an adviser to the interior minister, although one rescue worker reported six civilians were injured.

Anton Herashchenko also said Russia was lying about not shelling civilian infrastructure, claiming at least 40 such sites had been hit.

Some 198 civilians, including three children, have been killed so far by Russian forces attacking the pro-Western country, Ukraine's health minister said today.

'Unfortunately, according to operative data, at the hands of the invaders we have 198 dead, including 3 children, 1,115 wounded, including 33 children,' Health Minister Viktor Lyashko wrote on Facebook.

It comes as a barrage of cruise missiles have also been launched by Russian forces against Ukrainian military facilities.

Defence Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said the military struck a range of installations with long-range Kalibr cruise missiles.

He said that since the start of Russia's attack on Thursday, the military has hit 821 Ukrainian military facilities, including 14 air bases and 19 command facilities, and destroyed 24 air defence missile systems, 48 radars, seven warplanes, seven helicopters, nine drones, 87 tanks and eight military vessels.

Claims that Russia has taken full control of the southern city of Melitopol, however, were dismissed this morning by the UK's armed forces minister James Heappey.

Meanwhile, the mayor of a city south of the capital said the country's military has fended off a Russian attempt to take control of a military air base.

Natalia Balansynovych, mayor of Vasylkiv, about 25 miles south of Kyiv, said Russian airborne forces landed near the city overnight and tried to seize the base. She added that fierce fighting also raged in Vasylkiv's central street.

She said Ukrainian forces repelled the Russian attacks, and the situation is now calm. Ms Balansynovych said there were heavy casualties, but did not give any numbers.

Central Kyiv appeared quiet around midday on Saturday, and skirmishes reported on the edge of the city suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces.

But an adviser to Ukraine's presidential office said it was categorically untrue that Russia suspended movement of its troops in Ukraine.

Ukrainians are putting up a fierce resistance against Putin's invading army as dramatic video showed a destroyed Russian convoy near Kherson in the south of the country on the third day of the Kremlin's illegal war.

Kyiv's defence ministry put Russia's losses at 2,800 troops, 80 tanks, 516 armoured vehicles, 10 airplanes and seven helicopters.

Britain's defence ministry said Saturday that the bulk of Russian forces were 19 miles (30 kilometers) from the middle of the city.

The MoD said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had so far made limited progress on Friday and that Ukraine retains control of key cities.

The information was published in an MoD intelligence update on Twitter.

Russia on Saturday announced it had closed its airspace to flights from Bulgaria, Poland and Czech Republic after the countries placed the same sanction on Russian flights.

It also followed Prague announcing it would donate machine guns, automatic and sniper rifles, pistols and ammunition valued at around £6.4 million to Ukraine.

The Baltic nations of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania have also agreed in principle to close their airspace to Russian aircraft, Lithuanian Transport Minister Marius Skuodis said on Saturday.

'Since this morning we've been preparing documents for our governments to vote on. Our plan is to take the step simultaneously,' Skuodis wrote on Facebook.

It comes after Ukraine's president emerged earlier today defiant and determined after an onslaught on his capital city, declaring that Kyiv would resist the Russian advance and vowing to fight Vladimir Putin's forces.

Zelensky posted a video on Twitter captioned 'Don't believe the fakes'.

He condemned the false claims that he had surrendered and told his compatriots to lay down arms, and insisted his country would not give in to Russian aggression.

'Recently, fake info was spread about me ordering our army to lay down arms and evacuate,' Zelensky said.

'It's untrue. I'm here, we are not laying down, we will protect our state. This is our land, our country, our kids, and we will defend them.'

Russian troops are now advancing on Kyiv from the north and east, with US intelligence saying the plan is to besiege the city, capture an airport, and fly in paratroopers who would then attack the capital. The aim would be to capture the government and force them to sign a peace treaty handing control of the country back to Russia or a Russian puppet

William and Kate tweet support for Kyiv in a rare political comment William and Kate today tweeted their support for Ukraine in a rare political comment. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge insisted they 'stand' with the people of the war-torn nation, as they 'bravely fight' for their future. The royal couple also recalled the 'privilege' of meeting President Zelensky and his wife, when they jetted into London in 2020. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have said they 'stand' with the people of Ukraine as they 'bravely fight' for their future In a personal tweet signed by the couple, they wrote: 'In October 2020 we had the privilege to meet President Zelenskyy and the First Lady to learn of their hope and optimism for Ukraine's future. 'Today we stand with the President and all of Ukraine's people as they bravely fight for that future.' William and Kate welcomed the Ukrainians to Buckingham Palace in October 2020 - their first audience since the start of the first Covid lockdown. The Duke and Duchess entertained President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his wife Olena in the opulent Throne Room. The couples did not wear masks but observed social distancing and appeared in good spirits during the meeting, the first royal event to take place at Buckingham Palace in nearly six months. William and Kate held the audience on behalf of the Queen, who stayed at Windsor Castle to carry out a limited number of engagements. Advertisement

The 44-year-old Zelensky, who has been widely praised for his courage in the face of Russia's aggression, said on Thursday that he knew he was 'target number one' for Putin's assassins.

'There's a lot of fake information online that I call on our army to lay down arms, and that there's been an evacuation ordered,' he said. 'I'm here. We won't lay down our arms. We will defend our state.'

It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: 'Yesterday I urged NATO and Nordic partners to do all they can to support Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

'I am pleased even more allies have come forward with defensive and humanitarian aid. We must stand with the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and democracies everywhere.'

Yet even as Zelensky spoke, the Ukrainian interior ministry was warning Kyiv's residents to shelter in place and not venture out onto the streets.

Ukraine's armed forces on Saturday morning claimed 3,500 Russians had been killed overnight, and 200 taken prisoner. They said 14 Russian aircraft, eight helicopters, and 102 tanks had been seized.

Internet connectivity has been badly affected by the Russian invasion, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the country where fighting has been heaviest, internet blockage observatory NetBlocks said on Saturday.

Fears are growing that communications in and out of Ukraine, and between people in the country, will be cut off.

Meanwhile, dozens of people were wounded in overnight fighting in Kyiv, city mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Saturday morning.

As of 6am local time, 35 people, including two children, had been wounded, he said. It is unclear whether he was referring only to civilians. Klitschko added there was currently no major Russian military presence in Kyiv, although he said saboteur groups were active.

Armed forces were engaged in a fierce battle for control of the city, with footage on social media showing explosions close to a metro station in the western centre of the capital by the zoo; a battle ongoing for control of a thermal power plant to the north; and multiple reports suggesting fierce fighting 20 miles south, near a vital airbase.

In Kyiv, footage shared on social media showed a bombardment close to Beresteiska metro station, in the west of the city, which is near the zoo.

More than 50 explosions and heavy machine gun fire were reported in the district of Shulyavka, near Beresteiska metro and the zoo, according to The Kyiv Independent.

A bridge near the metro was blown up, according to reports. It was unclear whether the explosion was caused by artillery or by Ukrainian forces intent on stopping the Russian advance.

The district is under the control of the 101st Independent Security Brigade of the General Staff.

China's support for Putin wavers as state banks limit finance for Russian oil and gas China has found itself walking a diplomatic tightrope after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine took many in Beijing by surprise. It was reported today that several Chinese public banks are limiting financing to purchase raw materials from Russia for fear of Western sanctions should they be seen to be supporting the Kremlin. About 30 percent of oil and gas produced in Russia now sold to China. Putin is relying on his ties to China's Xi Jinping to bail him out of the increasingly tough sanctions being put on Moscow by Western nations as the invasion escalates. Last night, China, India and the UAE abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution condemning Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. The vote was seen as another sign of the widening of the diplomatic split between the West and the East over Putin's aggression. However, China's decision not to fully veto the motion - as Russia did - will come as a blow to the Russian dictator, who is growing increasingly isolated. Late on Friday in New York, China abstained from voting on a draft UN Security Council resolution that would have deplored Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The abstention, seen as a win by Western countries, was secured after a two-hour delay for last minute negotiations by the United States and others to secure China's abstention, diplomats said. Only last month, President Xi marked 30 years of ties with Ukraine, hailing the 'deepening political mutual trust' between them. Ukraine is a hub in the Belt and Road Initiative, a sprawling infrastructure and diplomatic undertaking that binds China closer with Europe. Advertisement

Terrified residents posted videos filmed from their apartments, with flashes of light and the sound of gunfire. One video shared on social media showed an apartment building glowing with red lights, which some speculated was to guide bombers or snipers. Others said the lights were to warn the military not to bomb them.

The northern suburb of Troieshchyna was also coming under sustained attack for another night, as Russia tried to wrest control of the thermal power plant on the banks of the Dnieper river. Unconfirmed reports suggested dozens of Russians had been arrested.

Meanwhile, satellite images show a huge queue of trucks and cars waiting in a traffic jam leaving Ukraine, near the Romanian border in Siret.

In a worrying sign, video from Russia's Western border with Ukraine showed TOS-1 heavy flamethrower tanks moving towards its neighbour. The tanks are capable of firing high-power thermobaric weapons - dubbed the 'father of all bombs'.

In Sydney, several hundred people marched in heavy rain on Saturday chanting 'Ukraine will prevail' and demanding more action against Moscow, while protesters in Tokyo called for Russia to be expelled from the United Nations Security Council.

The fresh protests came as Russian and Ukrainian forces clashed in fighting for Ukraine's capital and after Russia vetoed a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would have deplored the Kremlin invasion of Ukraine.

From Tokyo through Warsaw and London to New York, thousands have protested in recent days against the invasion, Europe's biggest security crisis in decades.

Draped in Ukraine's blue and yellow flag and waving the country's national banner, Sydney protesters also carried also signs condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin's attempts to topple the Ukrainian government.

Some speakers demanded that the government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison expands sanctions against Moscow and bans Russian citizens from visiting Australia, while others called for the NATO to step into the conflict.

'I want more economic sanctions on Russia, I want military help for Ukraine,' said Katarina, a protester who gave only her first name. 'I want more action, more concrete action and less words. It's too late for diplomacy right now.'

Another protester, Mogdan, called on the Australian government to lead other countries in attempts to stop Putin.

'It's World War Three, it's a war not only on Ukraine, it's a war on everyone,' the protester said.

A smaller protest took place in front of the Russian embassy in Canberra, Australia's capital, with people carrying signs 'Putin off Ukraine' and 'Stop War'.

Several hundred Russian, Ukrainian and Japanese protesters gathered in the busy Shibuya shopping district in central Tokyo, many with their children and holding Ukrainian flags, chanting 'stop the war' and 'stop Putin' in Japanese and English.

'I just want to say, 'Putin stop this, regain your sanity',' said Hiroshi Sawada, a 58-year-old musician who attended the rally in Tokyo.

A 28-year-old Russian worker who asked not to be named said none of the people she knew from her home country supported the war. 'We hate what is just happening now in our country,' she said.

Australia and Japan joined the United States, the European Union, and many other countries in imposing a series of rounds of sanctions against Russian politicians, businesses, and elite citizens over the invasion.

Nearly 120,000 people have so far fled Ukraine into Poland and other neighbouring countries amid the Russian invasion, the UN refugee agency said on Saturday.

The number is going up fast as Ukrainians grab their belongings and rush to escape from a deadly Russian onslaught on their nation, including an attempt to take the capital Kyiv.

Poland has declared its border open to fleeing Ukrainians, even for those without official documents.

The country's prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said all sanctions against Russia should be on the table, including shutting the open Nord Stream pipelines and halting Russia's access to SWIFT, ahead of a meeting on Saturday with German Chancellor Olaf Sholz.

'I came to Berlin to shake the conscience of Germany so that they would finally decide on truly harsh sanctions that will influence the Kremlin's decisions,' Morawiecki said as fighting took place on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

'We need to shut down Nord Stream 1 and 2, we need to cut reliance on raw materials, cut off Russian financial institutions from capital markets, confiscate assets of oligarchs, close off SWIFT for Russia... All sanctions against Russia should be on the table.'

Putin reveals plan to dominate Europe beyond Ukraine, with Sweden and Finland warned Russia has threatened its close Arctic neighbours Sweden and Finland with 'military consequences' if they join NATO. It came as Russia's invasion of Ukraine intensified today after a night of fighting in the capital of Kyiv especially. Sweden and Finland are the two closest countries to Russia in the Arctic Circle. 'Finland and Sweden should not base their security on damaging the security of other countries and their accession to NATO can have detrimental consequences and face some military and political consequences,' foreign affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said during a news briefing. The foreign ministry later reiterated the threat on Twitter. 'We regard the Finnish government's commitment to a military non-alignment policy as an important factor in ensuring security and stability in northern Europe,' the department wrote. 'Finland's accession to NATO would have serious military and political repercussions.' Vladimir Putin is widely believed to have attacked Ukraine after western nations mooted the idea of the country joining NATO, over fears it could end up with a US military presence on its doorstep. A similar move by Sweden or Finland could potentially provoke similar ire. Advertisement

Elsewhere, RT head Margarita Simonyan - seen as a leading Putin cheerleader - accused the Armed Forces of Ukraine of deploying Grads missile launchers in residential areas.

'Only terrorists do this. This is a war crime. They are asking Putin: bomb our people,' she said.

Wagner - a private mercenary army seen as having Kremlin links - indicated they would join the war in Ukraine.

'We will do exactly the same to you, Ukraine, as what you've done to Donbas,' said the group in a website post. We are against those who kill children, women and elderly.'

An appeal has been signed by more Russian doctors to Putin to stop the war. So far 350 have backed the call - but the number is rising fast.

'The war will take so many lives, cripple so many destinies that we won't be able to help however hard we try,' they said.

'And everyone will be screaming in pain, calling for their mother, in one and the same language.'

By 5:30am in Kyiv (10:30pm Eastern), Ukraine's armed forces were claiming that the advance from the west had been repelled.

But a CNN crew in Kyiv reported the sounds of heavy gunfire and what appeared to be anti-aircraft fire.

Ukraine's government said earlier on Friday night that they had shot down two Russian military transport planes carrying paratroopers on the outskirts of Kyiv.

The first IL-76 came down near Vasylkiv, 20 miles south of Kyiv, the Ukrainian military said.

The second IL-76 was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles south of the capital, Nexta reported.

The fate of those onboard was unclear. The aircrafts - medium-range military transport aircraft, which first went into service in 1974 - can hold 150-225 fully-equipped soldiers, and is used to drop paratroopers into combat and resupply arms.

The town of Vasylkiv appeared, at 3am local time (8pm Eastern), to be a focus of heavy fighting to the south.

The SIMPSONS release specially commissioned cartoon to show solidarity with Ukraine The producers of US television programme The Simpsons have released a specially commissioned cartoon of the famous family holding Ukrainian flags as a 'show of solidarity' with the country. The show's executive producer Al Jean said the rapid creation of such a politically relevant image did not happen 'very often' but it was important to be 'vigilant about defending freedom'. The cartoon, drawn by long-time animator and director David Silverman, shows the famous Simpsons family holding five Ukrainian flags. It comes as violence in Ukraine continues following the commencement of military operations by Russian president Vladimir Putin. Mr Jean said the show's producer Jim Brooks had called on him, Matt Groening and David Silverman to commission the image as 'a show of solidarity'. Producers of The Simpson commissioned a cartoon of the famous family holding Ukrainian flags as a 'show of solidarity' 'It's meant to show we care about what's going on and have enormous sympathy for the people of Ukraine and want this to stop', he said. 'We don't do this very often, only very rarely when there's something... extremely important for a cause that could not be bigger. 'The future of democracy in the world is at stake.' Advertisement

Nexta, a local media network, reported that Russians 'dressed in uniform of the Ukrainian national police' attacked a checkpoint near Vasylkiv, shooting at Ukrainian soldiers.

'Immediately after that a group of Russian military in a truck came in. There is a heavy fight going on,' the site reported.

New satellite images showed the build up of troops to the north, in Belarus.

The photos showed approximately 150 transport helicopters and ground troops 20 miles from the Belarusian-Ukrainian border, in southern Belarus.

Not long after the first troop carrier was shot down, Ukraine's State Agency for Special Communications said that Ukraine's air defense had downed a Russian close-support aircraft and a helicopter in Donbas.

A S-300 surface-to-air missile system destroyed a Russian Sukhoi Su-25 jet and an unspecified helicopter at midnight, they said.

The Russian Air Force currently operates around 250 Su-25s of all variants, and they are considered a staple of Russian ground-attack regiments.

Opposition was growing in Russia to the carnage in Ukraine.

Communist MP Mikhail Matveev said: 'I think that the war should be stopped immediately.

'When I voted for the recognition of the DPR / LPR, I voted for peace, not for war.

'For Russia to become a shield, so that the Donbas was not bombed, but not for Kyiv to be bombed.'

The onslaught came shortly after Ukraine's president warned that the Russians intend to take Kyiv overnight, urging his countrymen to resist the expected onslaught as Western officials say the city appears surrounded.

Zelensky, addressing the nation from a secret location in the capital, had a dire warning for his embattled and defiant people on Friday night.

'Russia will try to break our resistance with all its might,' he said, in a video posted to social media.

'Tonight the enemy will begin storming us. We need to withstand them!'

The United States has offered to evacuate Zelensky and his family, but the president is refusing to leave.

On Thursday evening he told the country he was aware that he was 'target number one' for Russian assassins, but he and his family would not leave.

Smoke and flames are seen billowing over Kyiv's Peremohy Avenue in the west of the city, near the zoo, in the early hours of Saturday morning

The Ukrainian armed forces tweeted in the early hours of Saturday that the attack from the west, near the city's zoo, had been repressed, stating: 'Russian war criminals attacked one of the military units in Kyiv on Victory Avenue. The attack was repulsed'

Poland announce they will REFUSE to play Russia in next month's World Cup play-offs Poland have announced they do not intend to play their World Cup play-off match next month against Russia following the latter's invasion of Ukraine. UEFA took one match away from Russia following the invasion but stopped short of kicking them out of qualifying for the World Cup. That means Russia are still included alongside Sweden, Czech Republic and Poland in Path B of the European play-offs, with the latter scheduled to take on the former on 24 March in Moscow. Should Russia beat Poland, they would meet the winner of Sweden v Czech Republic in a one-off final five days later to reach the Qatar showpiece, but Polish FA president Cezary Kulesza has tweeted his side no longer plan on taking part in the first place. 'No more words, time to act!' Kulesza said. 'Due to the escalation of the aggression of the Russian Federation towards Ukraine, the Polish national team does not intend to play the play-off match against Russia. 'This is the only right decision. We are in talks with the Swedish and Czech Republic federations to present a common position to FIFA.' Responding to Kulesza's statement, the Polish striker at Germany's most famous club in Bayern Munich, Robert Lewandowski - who also captains his country - said: 'It is the right decision! 'I can't imagine playing a match with the Russian National Team in a situation when armed aggression in Ukraine continues. Advertisement

Zelensky said that Chernihiv, Symy, Kharkiv, Donbas, and the south could also come under attack.

'This night will be difficult, very difficult. But the morning will come,' he said, according to The Kyiv Independent.

The 44-year-old referenced the Russian shelling of a kindergarten in Ukraine that killed at least one child and injured more, saying: 'What kind of war is that? Were these children neo-Nazi? Or were they NATO soldiers?'

Vitali Klitschko, the former world champion heavyweight boxer who is now the mayor of Kyiv, said his city faces a 'difficult night'.

The British Ministry of Defence said they believe Kyiv, home to 1.4 million people, is close to being encircled as the Russians advance from all sides.

Kyiv's streets were empty on Friday night as people sought shelter in the city's subway system. Many had fled, with buses and trains out of the city packed with people desperate to escape, and long lines of traffic choking the roads.

In Cherkasy, home to 270,000 people 120 miles south of Kyiv, video on social media showed people in a basement on Friday night, resolutely singing the national anthem as they awaited the onslaught.

In New York, on Friday night, a United Nations resolution that called on Moscow to halt its attack on Ukraine and withdraw its troops was vetoed by Russia - a permanent member of the Security Council. China, India and the UAE abstained.

Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, urged Ukraine's troops on Friday to overthrow their own government and begin to negotiate with the Kremlin.

'It looks like it will be easier for us to come to terms with you than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,' he said.

There was little sign that Ukrainian generals were tempted, and Russia appears to have been somewhat taken aback at the scale of Ukrainian resistance and their ability to defend their country.

There was no doubt, however, that Russia's overwhelming military superiority would soon come into effect.

With 900,000 troops, Russia has the fourth largest military in the world, and more than a decade of reforms and procurement has made it a dangerous opponent.

Ukraine has just 361,000 troops, although Zelensky on Thursday ordered a full mobilization of troops and banned men aged 18-60 from leaving the country, in readiness for a whole-nation effort.

Ukraine's highly-motivated infantry have modern weapons and protective gear, including N-LAW and Javelin anti-tank missiles provided by Britain and the US.

With the Russian advance slower than expected, there were fears on Friday night that Putin could resort to high-power thermobaric weapons - dubbed the 'father of all bombs' - as brave Ukrainians resist his attempts to take control of Kyiv.

There are also concerns that units that are running behind schedule as they encounter stiff opposition could resort to indiscriminate shelling as a terror weapon.

Thermobaric weapons - also known as vacuum bombs - are high-powered explosive that use the atmosphere itself as part of the explosion. They are among the most powerful non-nuclear weapons ever developed.

A thermobaric bomb dropped by the U.S. on Taliban in Afghanistan in 2017 weighed 21,600 pounds and left a crater more than 1,000 feet wide after it exploded six feet above the ground.

Thermobaric weapons were developed by both the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the 1960s. In September 2007, Russia detonated the largest thermobaric weapon ever made, which created an explosion equivalent to 39.9 tons.

The U.S. version of the weapon reportedly costs over $16 million each.

'My fear would be that if they don't meet their timescale and objectives they would be indiscriminate in their use of violence,' a Western official said.

'They don't adhere to the same principles of necessity and proportionality and rule of law that Western forces do.'

The bomb works by using oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion, making it far deadlier than a conventional weapon.

While Russian special forces have reached the suburbs of Kyiv, the bulk of Russia's heavy armor is believed to be still more than 30 miles away from the capital.

Kyiv's streets were eerily empty on Friday evening as the city's residents braced themselves for the expected onslaught

A senior U.S. defense official said Friday that Russia appears to have lost some of its momentum due to the Ukrainian's fiery resistance.

'We do assess that there is greater resistance by the Ukrainians than the Russians expected,' the official said, adding Ukraine's command and control of its military 'remains intact.'

'They are not moving on Kyiv as fast as what we believe they anticipated they would be able to do. That said, they continue to try to move on Kyiv.'

Putin has only mobilized about one-third of the 190,000 troops he has stationed at the Ukraine border, the official said.

Zelensky and his aides, including the defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov - behind Zelensky, with glasses - posted a video from Kyiv early on Friday morning, reassuring the people that he remained with them and had not fled, despite his life being in danger

Astonishing footage from Kyiv yesterday showed a deadly machine-gun skirmish that broke out on the streets of a suburb between Ukrainian forces and alleged Russian saboteurs.

The clash saw at least two people gunned down in a stolen Ukrainian army truck in a car park in front of a large apartment block in Obolon, found north of Kyiv.

As the sound of gunshots echoed off the nearby buildings, a tank - said to have been stolen by Russians - also crashed and crushed a civilian car on the road running past the car park.

Miraculously the driver - an elderly person - survived the shocking smash, and rescuers were later able to free the from the wreckage.

The two incidents were initially reported separately, but a video clip later posted to social media revealed they were in fact linked, and part of the same skirmish.

Incredibly, the elderly driver was still alive and pulled free from the wreckage

Ukraine’s armed forces tweeted as dawn broke on Saturday: ‘During the night the Russian occupiers did not take any city!

‘Kyiv is being cleared of the remains of saboteurs. Thank you to the courageous defenders of Ukraine!’

Ukrainians were emerging from their bunkers after a restless night to find a country still defiant, despite the barbarity unleashed by Moscow.

The night began with Ukrainians still in the cities seeking refuge in the subway for the third night in a row.

As dusk fell at 5:30pm local time on Friday, the streets were eerily empty and quiet.

MIDNIGHT

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, appeared on social media shortly after midnight, warning his people that the coming hours would be decisive.

In a stirring speech from his bunker in a secret location in Kyiv, Zelensky, 44, said that ‘the fate of Ukraine is now being decided.’

He told his people: ‘This night, the enemy will use all the forces available to break our resistance — treacherously, viciously, inhumanly.

‘This night, they will make an assault upon us. We all have to understand what we are going to face. This night, we have to stand with.’

It later emerged that the United States had once more offered Zelensky and his family – his wife Oleana and their daughter Aleksandra, 17, and nine-year-old son, Kiril – the opportunity to be evacuated from Ukraine.

Zelensky refused. On Thursday night, he insisted he was staying put, and indeed on Friday morning he went out into Kyiv to film a short video for the nation, urging resilience.

3am SATURDAY

The first sign that Putin was indeed launching his attack came from Vasylkiv, 20 miles south of the capital.

The city, home to a Cold War-era air base, was the scene of the first major incident when a Russian IL-76 military transporter plane was brought down – reportedly with 150 paratroopers on board.

Sources in the city then claimed that Russian soldiers, dressed as Ukrainian police, ambushed a checkpoint.

Heavy fighting ensued in Vasylkiv, as Putin’s forces tried to gain a foothold in the south from which to launch their attack on Kyiv.

Kyiv was in flames in the early hours of Saturday

4am SATURDAY

A second Russian IL-76 was brought down south of Kyiv, in the city of Bila Tserkva, according to reports.

In the east of the country, Ukraine’s air defenses brought down a Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jet and a helicopter, the Ukrainian military claimed.

And as the aggressors were trying to advance from the south, another attack was being attempted from the north – even closer to the center of Kiev.

5am ​​SATURDAY

Russian troops were launching an attack on the northern Kyiv suburb of Troieshchyna – site of a thermal power station.

The suburb had been attacked earlier in the week, as Russia tried to wrest control of the strategic jewel on the banks of the Dnieper river.

Unconfirmed reports suggested dozens of Russians had been arrested.

Meanwhile, the Russians were also advancing from the west.

Dramatic footage showed explosions near the Beresteiska metro station, towards the edge of the city.

Locals living along Peremohy Avenue – a main artery into central Kyiv from the west – shared images on social media of vehicles ablaze.

Russian forces were said to be advancing towards Kyiv zoo, towards the Shuliavka district of the city.

The fighting was fierce, yet Ukraine’s interior ministry said they repelled the attack – blowing up a bridge along Peremohy Avenue to stop the advancing Russian forces.

Harrowing images from the Ukrainian capital show burning vehicles, buildings blasted by missiles and flames lighting up the night sky.

Meanwhile, air raid sirens tonight rang out over the capital, warning civilians to head to safety ahead of another night of Russian shelling.

At least 198 Ukrainians, including three children, have been killed and 1,115 people wounded so far, the Ukrainian government has said.

Speaking to Sky News before he went to the front, Mr Yurash said Russian forces were about 1.8 to 2.5 miles from where he was.

""Russians don't have a good time here, to say the least,"" he said.

""We have hundreds of POWs, we are issuing videos, showing Russians coming to Ukraine.""

He said Ukrainians ""don't have a choice"" when it comes to fighting Russia as Putin has ""time and again tried to denounce the very idea of Ukraine"".

""Everything is at stake, I'm no soldier, I don't have much experience with the gun.

""When you are fighting for your life you learn very quick. The reality is Ukraine doesn’t have a choice.

""Russia wants to destroy us and we will not let that happen. I was born in independent Ukraine and I will die in independent Ukraine.""

Latest in Ukraine...

Mr Yurash was echoing the defiance of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who refused a US offer of evacuation reportedly saying: ""I need ammo not a ride.""

""The fight is here,"" he told US officials amid as Russian forces stormed the capital, encountering fierce Ukrainian resistance.

In video messages, he also quashed rumours he has called for a surrender.

""We will not put down weapons, we will defend our state. Glory to our defenders, both male and female. Glory to Ukraine!""

Ahead of the fighting, Zelenskyy said he was top of tyrant Vladimir Putin's hitlist as he warned that Ukraine's outgunned warriors faced a long and hard night.

But he warned bully Putin that Friday night would prove to be ""very difficult"" as Russia looks to use all available forces to break Ukraine's resistance.

He told his nation in a stirring battle address: ""We have to persevere tonight.""

Ukrainian Interior Ministry said there was ""active fighting on the streets of our city"" as the conflict intensified and later air raid sirens were heard in Kyiv, sending soldiers and civilians scrambling for cover.

As Russia forces tried to fight their way through the streets of the capital, during the night, dramatic video showed a blazing vehicle on Kyiv's Peremohy (Victory) Avenue .

With dawn breaking over the city, the extent of the damage inflicted on Kyiv became clear with images showing smouldering blocks of flats.

Fighting appeared to be raging close to Igor Sikorsky Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany) in Kyiv with video residential tower blocks hit by missiles and residents pulled from the rubble.

Soldiers were seen next to the charred remains on vehicles in the city's roads.

Ukraine's government claim Russian troops fought against their forces near Beresteiska metro station, just five miles from Maidan (Independence) Square, the central point of Kyiv.

Russian troops also attacked an army base in the city but were successfully repelled, Ukraine's military claimed in a Facebook post early on Saturday.

Ukraine's Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov said: ""We are stopping the horde as best as we can, the situation in Kyiv is under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and our citizens.""

Separately, the Interfax Ukraine agency said Russian soldiers were trying to capture one of Kyiv's electricity generating stations.

Loud artillery blasts were heard coming from close to the city centre, while a reporter for the Kyiv Independent claimed ""extremely hard combat"" was underway near Kyiv Zoo.

Google Maps is showing a number of major roads in and out of the city have been closed, including around Maidan Square, and major thoroughfares leading to and from the city's airports.

Residents have been urged to stay inside shelters, including underground stations and hotel basements.

Outside of Kyiv, air raid sirens were heard in multiple Ukrainian cities, including Lviv, Lutsk, Rivne, Uman, and Vinnytsia.

It follows a similar warning from Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko that Friday night would be ""very difficult"" for the city of almost 3 million people.

""The situation now - without exaggeration - is threatening for Kyiv,"" he said. ""The night, close to the morning, will be very difficult.""

STREET FIGHTING

Ukraine's Defence Ministry has urged people in Kyiv to make their own petrol bombs to repel the Russian invaders.

More than 10,000 assault rifles have been handed out to ordinary citizens in the city as part of a last-ditch defence of the capital.

Ukrainians have pledged to fight to the death to defend their country, after President Zelenskyy urged his country's military to ""take power in your own hands"".

A number of Ukrainians have also reportedly made Molotov cocktails to fight off the onrushing Russian forces.

Kira Rudik, 36, a Ukrainian MP, shared a picture of herself holding a Kalashnikov, after vowing to stay and fight.

She tweeted: ""I learn to use Kalashnikov and prepare to bear arms. It sounds surreal as just a few days ago it would never come to my mind. Our women will protect our soil the same way as our men!""

If verified, the attack could be the biggest single loss of life yet suffered by Russian invaders.

Ukraine armed forces general staff made the claim as Putin’s fighters struggled to find a foothold in Kyiv on the second day of the campaign.

Illia Ponomarenko, defence reporter with The Kyiv Independent newspaper, reported just before 4am Ukrainian time (2am GMT) that a second Russian Ilyushin Il-76 had been downed.

Quoting Ukraine's State Agency for Special Communications, he said the fighter jet was shot down near Bila Tserkva, 48 miles southwest of Kyiv city centre.

On Thursday night, 13 Ukrainian soldiers told a Russian warship to ""go f*** themselves"" as they made a heroic last stand.

Tasked with defending Snake Island in the Black Sea, the defiant border guards were ordered to surrender by a Russian warship.

A brave Ukrainian woman was also filmed confronting two Russian soldiers in the port city of Henichesk, less than 18 miles from the annexed territory of Crimea.

Russia has ramped up its efforts to seize control of Ukraine after making slower-than-expected progress on Wednesday and Thursday, allegedly killing civilians in the process.

Ukraine claims it has killed or captured 2,800 troops, destroyed 80 tanks, and shot down seven warplanes as their troops launched a bloody resistance against the Russians.

Meanwhile, the PM has also promised to crack down on Russian oligarchs funneling dirty money through the UK.

And Russia’s central bank was frozen, and banned from the German SWIFT system.

Ursula von der Leyen said the measures would “cripple Putin’s ability to finance his war machine.

It follows a day of fighting which saw Russian forces reportedly fail to gain as much ground as expected.

Earlier on Friday, Russia was accused of bombing a nursery after pictures emerged showing the school in the eastern Ukrainian city of Okhtyrka ""surrounded by bodies"".

Bodies of at least two adults were seen lying outside the ""Sunshine"" nursery in pools of blood as people crouched alongside them.

The front of the building - which has a sandpit, play area, and slide - appears blown out with its shutters scattered on the ground.

Kyiv's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba accused Russia of war crimes and said his government was putting together a report which it would send to the Hague.

In another disturbing video, a Russian tank was filmed driving over a moving car in Kyiv, completely crushing it.

It reversed off the vehicle before ordinary people were able to prise the driver out of the flattened car using axes and other tools.

Miraculously, the elderly man behind the wheel survived the shocking incident.

Elsewhere, a soldier blew himself up on a bridge to stop Russians storming in from Crimea.

And a viral video clip showed a fearless man walking up to armoured cars.

Fierce exchanges erupted through the day five miles north of Kyiv city centre as fighters engaged Russians arriving in attack helicopters.

Putin’s elite Spetsnaz troops backed by undercover assassins and armoured vehicles were reported to be locked in gun battles in Kyiv’s suburbs while the main Russian force lay in wait 30 miles north.

The UK’s Chief of Defence Intelligence Lt Gen Sir Jim Hockenhull warned Russia would continue its bombardment and encirclement today.

He said: ""Russian forces continue to advance on two axes towards Kyiv. Their objective is to encircle the capital to secure control of the population and change the regime.""

A crazed Putin doubled-down on his verbal attacks on Friday, calling on the Ukrainians to turn on their ""drug-addicted neo-Nazi"" leaders or lay down their arms and go home.

Western intelligence sources confirmed that Russians were trying to encircle Kyiv but were being beaten back.

A security source said: ""The Ukrainians have done excellent work taking down bridges to slow them.

""Russia has largely not met its Day One objectives and its battleplan ­timings are slipping. The conflict is the choice of Putin, this is now not a war of choice, but one of necessity, so he has to win.

""He would resort to any means necessary. If we do end up with significant urban fighting I have a concern for the way Russia would use indiscriminate force.""

In Russia, there has been backlash to the invasion, both from ordinary Russians and public figures.

More than 1,500 have been detained in protests across the country, while the daughter of Chelsea's owner Roman Abramovich was among those who appeared to criticise Putin's actions.
