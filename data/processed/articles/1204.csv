The plant, also known as Zaporozhe, is Ukraine's largest, with six 950 MW reactors. Nuclear meets over 50% of Ukraine's power demand.

""The Zaporizhzhia NPP site has been seized by the military forces of the Russian Federation. The personnel continue working at their workplaces, operational personnel monitor the state of power units and ensure their operation in accordance with the requirements of the process procedures for safe operation,"" it said.

Shelling at the site caused a fire that was extinguished. No change in radiation level had been registered, nor was there any information yet on casualties, the inspectorate said.

Only Unit 4 was in operation, it said, noting output of 690 MW.

Unit 1 was in an outage, Units 2 and 3 disconnected from the grid and Units 5 and 6 were being cooled down.

""The loss of the possibility to cool down nuclear fuel will lead to significant radioactive releases into the environment. As a result, such an event may exceed all previous accidents at nuclear power plants, including the Chernobyl accident and the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant,"" the inspectorate said.

Along with its six reactors, the Zaporizhzhia site hosts a spent nuclear fuel storage facility, ""damage of which due to shelling will also lead to radioactive releases,"" it said.

Ukraine has 13.11 GW of nuclear capacity spread across 15 reactors at four sites.

Meanwhile independent generator and coal miner DTEK said it had activated nine of its thermal power units to compensate for the power lost at Zaporizhzhia, a loss it put at 1.3 GW.

""DTEK now has 23 thermal power units in operation instead of the planned 14,"" it said.

Russian shelling of Europe's largest nuclear power plant on Friday prompted widespread dismay, with world leaders swiftly condemning the assault and the U.N. nuclear chief warning ""we are in completely uncharted waters."" Russian military forces have seized control of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, according to Ukraine's nuclear agency, following a night of shelling that set a building ablaze at the complex. Authorities say the fire at the site has now been extinguished by emergency services and radiation levels are normal. Two security personnel were injured as a result of the attack. In response, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: ""Europe needs to wake up."" ""We are issuing a warning, no country has ever shot at nuclear blocks except for Russia,"" Zelenskyy said in a video statement, according to a translation. ""For the first time ever in our history, in the history of humankind, the terrorist country has reverted to nuclear terror.""

Situated in the southeast of Ukraine, the Zaporizhzhya complex houses six of the country's 15 operational nuclear power reactors. These reactors produce about half of the country's electricity.

Reactors not affected

The U.N. nuclear chief said on Friday that it was understood the projectile that hit Zaporizhzhya came from Russian forces. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned the situation at the complex is ""very fragile"" and ""continues to be extremely tense and challenging."" ""It is important to say that all the safety systems of the six reactors at the plant were not affected and that there has been no release of radioactive material,"" Grossi said.

Both Russia and Ukraine are considering an offer of meeting at Chornobyl, he added: ""It is time for action ... we need to do something about this."" The aim of the proposed meeting was for both sides to recommit to the principles of nuclear safety. The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine said personnel at the Zaporizhzhia facility were monitoring the condition of power units to ensure they could operate safely. It comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its ninth day and amid conflicting reports about which side controls the strategically important Black Sea port city of Kherson.

Global condemnation

World leaders condemned Russia's attack on the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the ""reckless actions"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin could ""directly threaten the safety of all of Europe."" U.S. President Joe Biden urged Moscow to stop its military activities around the site, while Canada's Justin Trudeau said the ""horrific attacks"" at the nuclear site were unacceptable and called on Russia to ""cease immediately."" All three heads of government spoke to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by telephone. The IAEA has put its Incident and Emergency Centre in ""full response mode"" due to the situation at the nuclear site and appealed for a halt of the use of force. The U.N. agency had previously warned Russia's war with Ukraine had raised the risk of nuclear accidents and called for restraint from all actions that could jeopardize the safe operations of Ukraine's nuclear facilities.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/04/ukraine-nuclear-russian-troops-seize-control-of-zaporizhzhya-plant.html

The overnight assault caused a blaze at the facility, prompting fears over the safety of the plant and evoking painful memories in a country still scarred by the world’s worst nuclear accident, at Chernobyl in 1986. The site of that disaster is also under Russian control as of Feb. 24, 2022.

On March 4, Ukrainian authorities reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency that the fire at Zaporizhzhia had been extinguished and that Ukrainian employees were reportedly operating the plant under Russian orders. But safety concerns remain.

The Conversation asked Najmedin Meshkati, a professor and nuclear safety expert at the University of Southern California, to explain the risks of warfare taking place in and around nuclear power plants.

How safe was the Zaporizhzhia power plant before the Russian attack?

The facility at Zaporizhzhia is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, and one of the largest in the world. It has six pressurized water reactors, which use water to both sustain the fission reaction and cool the reactor. These differ from the reaktor bolshoy moshchnosty kanalny reactors at Chernobyl, which used graphite instead of water to sustain the fission reaction. RBMK reactors are not seen as very safe, and there are only eight remaining in use in the world, all in Russia.

The reactors at Zaporizhzhia are of moderately good design. And the plant has a decent safety record, with a good operating background.

Ukraine authorities tried to keep the war away from the site by asking Russia to observe a 30-kilometer safety buffer. But Russian troops surrounded the facility and then seized it.

What are the risks to a nuclear plant in a conflict zone?

Nuclear power plants are built for peacetime operations, not wars.

The worst thing that could happen is if a site is deliberately or accidentally shelled and the containment building – which houses the nuclear reactor – is hit. These containment buildings are not designed or built for deliberate shelling. They are built to withstand a minor internal explosion of, say, a pressurized water pipe. But they are not designed to withstand a huge explosion.

It is not known whether the Russian forces deliberately shelled the Zaporizhzhia plant. It may have been inadvertent, caused by a stray missile. But we do know they wanted to capture the plant.

If a shell hit the plant’s spent fuel pool – which contains the still-radioactive spent fuel – or if fire spread to the spent fuel pool, it could release radiation. This spent fuel pool isn’t in the containment building, and as such is more vulnerable.

As to the reactors in the containment building, it depends on the weapons being used. The worst-case scenario is that a bunker-buster missile breaches the containment dome – consisting of a thick shell of reinforced concrete on top of the reactor – and explodes. That would badly damage the nuclear reactor and release radiation into the atmosphere. And because of any resulting fire, sending in firefighters would be difficult. It could be another Chernobyl.

What are the concerns going forward?

The biggest worry was not the fire at the facility. That did not affect the containment buildings and has been extinguished.

The safety problems I see now are twofold:

1) Human error

The workers at the facility are now working under incredible stress, reportedly at gunpoint. Stress increases the chance of error and poor performance.

One concern is that the workers will not be allowed to change shifts, meaning longer hours and tiredness. We know that a few days ago at Chernobyl, after the Russians took control of the site, they did not allow employees – who usually work in three shifts – to swap out. Instead, they took some workers hostage and didn’t allow the other workers to attend their shifts.

At Zaporizhzhia we may see the same.

There is a human element in running a nuclear power plant – operators are the first and last layers of defense for the facility and the public. They are the first people to detect any anomaly and to stop any incident. Or if there’s an accident, they will be the first to heroically try to contain it.

2) Power failure

The second problem is that the nuclear plant needs constant electricity, and that is harder to maintain in wartime.

Even if you shut down the reactors, the plant will need off-site power to run the huge cooling system to remove the residual heat in the reactor and bring it to what is called a “cold shutdown.” Water circulation is always needed to make sure the spent fuel doesn’t overheat.

Spent fuel pools also need constant circulation of water to keep them cool. And they need cooling for several years before being put in dry casks. One of the problems in the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan was the emergency generators, which replaced lost off-site power, got inundated with water and failed. In situations like that you get “station blackout” – and that is one of the worst things that could happen. It means no electricity to run the cooling system.

In that circumstance, the spent fuel overheats and its zirconium cladding can cause hydrogen bubbles. If you can’t vent these bubbles they will explode, spreading radiation.

If there is a loss of outside power, operators will have to rely on emergency generators. But emergency generators are huge machines – finicky, unreliable gas guzzlers. And you still need cooling waters for the generators themselves.

My biggest worry is that Ukraine suffers from a sustained power grid failure. The likelihood of this increases during a conflict, because pylons may come down under shelling or gas power plants might get damaged and cease to operate. And it is unlikely that Russian troops themselves will have fuel to keep these emergency generators going – they don’t seem to have enough fuel to run their own personnel carriers.

How else does a war affect the safety of nuclear plants?

One of the overarching concerns is that war degrades safety culture, which is crucial in running a plant. I believe that safety culture is analogous to the human body’s immune system, which protects against pathogens and diseases; and because of the pervasive nature of safety culture and its widespread impact, according to psychologist James Reason, “it can affect all elements in a system for good or ill.”

It is incumbent upon the leadership of the plant to strive for immunizing, protecting, maintaining and nurturing the healthy safety culture of the nuclear plant.

War adversely affects the safety culture in a number of ways. Operators are stressed and fatigued and may be scared to death to speak out if something is going wrong. Then there is the maintenance of a plant, which may be compromised by lack of staff or unavailability of spare parts. Governance, regulation and oversight – all crucial for the safe running of a nuclear industry – are also disrupted, as is local infrastructure, such as the capability of local firefighters. In normal times you might have been able to extinguish the fire at Zaporizhzhia in five minutes. But in war, everything is harder.

So what can be done to better protect Ukraine’s nuclear power plants?

This is an unprecedented and volatile situation. The only solution is a no-fight zone around nuclear plants. War, in my opinion, is the worst enemy of nuclear safety.

With Russian forces occupying one of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants as well the site of the decommissioned Chernobyl facility, the world is getting an unprecedented look at the first major war to ever take place in a country with an established nuclear power infrastructure.

Ukraine runs 15 nuclear reactors accounting for about half of its electricity generation, according to the World Nuclear Association. But seven of these reactors have been disconnected from the grid since Russian attacks began on February 24 in order to keep them cool.

Last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency and Ukrainian nuclear authorities acknowledged that the six reactors of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine had fallen into Russian hands after an intense fire fight that saw a training laboratory on plant premises catch fire.

Now, according to reports from the BBC, Russian troops are training their sights on the three reactors South Ukraine nuclear power plant near the city of Mykolaiv in the country’s southern central region.

The Zaporizhzhya plant – which is Europe’s largest nuclear power station – is now surrounded by the invading troops while Ukrainian technicians continue monitoring plant functions from the inside. Ukrainian regulators have claimed that Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear corporation, has sent engineers to the plant who are now giving orders to the captive staff.

But in a March 12 statement on its website (which may be inaccessible after an attack by the Anonymous hacker group) Rosatom denied that, and characterizing the presence of its engineers at the Ukrainian plant as “consultative assistance” which takes place on “a regular basis.”

Last week, Russian troops detonated ammunition on Zaporizhzhya plant territory that hadn’t exploded during their March 4 attack, though reportedly caused no damage to plant structure. None of the plant’s six reactors, only two of which are currently operational, were affected and there was no radiation leak.

On February 25th, the second day of the invasion, Russian troops overran Chernobyl, which now stores 20,000 spent nuclear fuel rods. The defunct site also houses the remains of the plant’s exploded Number 4 reactor, which is slowly being dismantled under a huge steel dome. The staff that perform those critical activities had been held hostage until last weekend, when about half of them were finally allowed to rotate out after 600 hours on the job since the Russian invasion began.

On two separate occasions, power has been cut to the plant by fighting in the area, leaving critical spent fuel storage pools and radiation ventilation structures without electricity. Power has since been restored, the IAEA reported, but the situation highlights how vulnerable Ukraine’s nuclear facilities are to Russian military aggression.

Now that the coming days could bring the seizure by Russian troops of the South Ukraine plant, we thought it would be useful to revisit our 2018 report on the Ukrainian nuclear industry and highlight the basic characteristics of each of the country’s four Soviet- and Russian-built nuclear power stations.

The Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: Ralf1969

Reactor type: Six Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000/320s

Location: The Zaporizhzhya plant is situated on the steppes along the Kakhovka reservoir in the Zaporizhzhya Oblast of Ukraine, near the city of Enerhodar, 690 kilometers southeast of Kyiv. It is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, consisting of six nuclear power units, each with a capacity of 1000 mW. The power produced by the plant provides one fifth of the total power used in Ukraine.

Reactor construction: Soviet authorities adopted the decision to build the plant in 1978 and construction started in 1981. Between 1984 and 1987, Units One, Two, Three and Four were commissioned.

Unit Five was commissioned in 1989 and Unit Six began operations only in 1995, after a post-Chernobyl moratorium on new reactor construction was lifted.

Special spent fuel storage features: The Zaporizhzhya plant is the first in Ukraine to use a dry spent fuel storage facility. Under this scheme, spent fuel elements that have been previously cooled in spent fuel pools for at least five years, during which their residual energy is released, are then transferred to the dry storage facility. There, the assemblies are stored vertically and ventilated by air. The dry spent fuel storage facility at Zaporizhzhya when into service in August of 2001.

Reactor Lifetime extensions: Units One, Two, Four and Five at the Zaporizhzhya plant have received lifetime extensions. Unit One was due to retire in 2015 but will run until 2025. Unit Two was due to retire in 2016 but will run until 2026. Unit Four was due to retire in 2018 but will run until 2028. Unit Five was due to retire in 2028 but will run until 2030. Unit Three was shut down in 2017 for upgrades associated with a lifetime extensions, though one has not yet been granted.

Notable events: The startup of Unit One was delayed by 11 months because of a fire that occurred at the reactor on January 27, 1984. News about the fire was concealed from the public until Gorbachev’s policy of Glasnost began six years later.

In May of 2014, several armed men representing a far-right political group attempted to gain access to the plant but were stopped by Ukrainian police. The plant’s proximity to the fighting that has ground on in the Donbas region for the last eight years, prior to the outbreak of the current war, has made the plant vulnerable to military attack.

How many reactors currently running: Two, both at reduced power.

The Khmelnitsky Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: RLuts

Reactor type: Two Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000s

Location: The Khmelnistky nuclear plant is located in the northern part of the Khmelnitsky region 350 kilometers west of Kyiv in an area of high seismic activity. The plant operates 2 Russian-built VVER-1000 reactors, each produced 1000 mW.

Reactor construction: Soviet authorities adopted the decision to build the plant in 1975 and originally envisioned that it would consist of 4 reactors. Construction on Unit One began in 1981 and finished in 1987, and construction on Unit Two commenced in 1983 but its completion was delayed by a 1990 government-imposed moratorium on new reactor construction. After the moratorium was lifted, construction on Unit Two resumed. But lack of financing protracted the project, and it wasn’t completed until 2005.

The plant’s remaining two reactors were originally planned for construction under a 2011 deal with Atomstroyexport, Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom’s foreign wing. That deal was annulled in 2015, following Moscow’s annexation of Crimea. A 2016 deal with a Korean power firm to complete the reactors has made little progress.

Also unclear is whether a 2021 deal between the plant and Westinghouse to build an AP 1000 reactor at the site will ever go forward.

Reactor Lifetime Extensions: One reactor at the Khmelnitsky plant has received a lifetime extension. Unit One reactor was scheduled to retire in 2018 but will run until 2028.

Notable Events: In 1987, there was a release of radioactive steam in Unit One’s containment room. The incident was rated by the International Nuclear Event Scale as a 3 its seven-point scale, denoting a “serious” incident with consequences contained within the plant.

How many reactors currently running: One.

The Rivne Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: Victor Korniyenko

Reactor Type: Two Soviet/Russian built VVER 440, two Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000

Location: The Rivne Nuclear plant is located near the town of Varash (known as Kuznetsovsk until 2016) in the Rivne Oblast in Ukraine’s northwest, 390 kilometers west of Kyiv. The combined power of the four units it operates is 2835 mW.

Reactor Construction: The plant operates four reactors, two Soviet-built VVER-440s and two Soviet/Russian-built VVER-1000s. It was the first nuclear plant in Ukraine to see the construction of the VVER series reactor, which were a departure from the Soviet designed graphite moderated RBMK-type reactors, one of which exploded at Chernobyl in 1986.

Originally conceived by the Soviets in 1971 as the West Ukraine nuclear plant, the name was changed to Rivne during commissioning. Construction in 1973 and two VVER-440 units were commissioning in 1980 and 1981. Unit Three, which was the first of the two VVER-1000s, was commissioned in 1986.

Unit Four was scheduled to be commissioned in 1991, but the Ukrainian government’s 1990 moratorium on new reactor builds prevented that. After the moratorium was lifted, construction on Four resumed in 1993, and it finally entered commercial service in 2006.

Reactor Lifetime extensions: Units One, Two and Three at the Rivne plant have received lifetime extensions: Unit One was due to retire in 2010 but will run until 2030. Unit Two was due to retire in 2011 but will run until 2031. Unit Three was due to retire in 2017 but was granted a 20-year extension to run until 2037.

Notable Events: In December of 2010, Units One and Two of the Rivne plant were granted lifetime extensions of 20 years, nearly doubling their original 30 life expectancy, and putting off their decommissioning until the early 2030s. In 2018, Unit Three received an identical extension, putting off its retirement until 2037.

Another safety issue at the plant is the ground on which it stands, which is characterized by shifting soils and sinkholes, which, if not properly monitored, could endanger plant infrastructure.

How many reactors currently running: Three

The South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant

Credit: Xy713

Reactor Type: Three Soviet/Russian built VVER-1000s

Location: The South Ukraine nuclear plant is located near the city of Yuzhnoukrainsk in the Mykolaiv Oblast 350 kilometers south of Kyiv. It is Ukraine’s second largest functioning nuclear plant and is part of the South Ukrainian Energy Complex, along with the Tashlyk Pumped-Storage Power Plant and the Oleksandrivska hydroelectric plant. The plant lies on the steppes on the banks of the Pivdennyi Bug River and its three reactors generate 2850 mW of electicity.

Reactor Construction: Construction of the South Ukraine nuclear plant’s Unit One began in 1975 and was completed in 1983. Units One and Two followed in 1985 and 1989, respectively. A fourth reactor was planned but its construction was suspended by Soviet order.

Reactor lifetime extensions: Two reactors at the South Ukraine nuclear plant have received lifetime extensions and one was shutdown in 2019 to accommodate upgrades toward an extension.

All three reactors at the South Ukraine nuclear plant have received lifetime extensions. Unit One was due to retire in 2013 but will run until 2023. Unit Two was due to retire in 2015 but will run until 2025. Unit Three was due to run until 2020 and is undergoing upgrades that would see it run until 2030.

Notable events: The South Ukraine plant became the first to burn fuel fabricated by western nuclear fuel supplier Westinghouse – part of an effort to wean the Ukrainian industry off its dependents on fuel produced in Russia by TVEL.

In 2005, the plant’s Unit Three was loaded with a mixture of Russian and experimental Westinghouse assemblies for a period of pilot operation. However, the test was unsuccessful with Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear operator, claiming the Westinghouse assemblies had defects. For its part, Westinghouse alleged that its fuel assemblies were loaded incorrectly. This led to a lengthy outage of Unit Three.

Nevertheless, in 2008, Energoatom contracted with Westinghouse for 630 assemblies that would be loaded into the South Ukraine plant’s three reactors.

In 2008 Energoatom and Westinghouse Electric Sweden contracted to ship fresh fuel to as many as six reactors. However, during trial use at South Ukraine NPP in 2012, the fuel became deformed and caused serious damage to the reactor. The use of Westinghouse fuel was then suspended by Ukraine pending its redesign. However, following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, the contract was revived and extended.

The Zaporizhzhia* nuclear power station, with six reactors that began commercial operation between 1985 and 1996, is the largest nuclear power station in Europe in terms of net capacity. Each of its six Russia-designed VVER-1000/V320 reactors has a net capacity of 950 MW for a total of 5,700 MW (the second biggest is Gravelines in France with net capacity of 5,460 MW). State nuclear operator Energoatom says it can generate enough energy for roughly four million homes. In normal times it produces one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity and almost half the energy generated by the country’s nuclear power facilities. The facility is in southeast Ukraine in Enerhodar on the banks of the Kakhovka reservoir on the Dnieper river. It is about 200km from the contested Donbas region and 550km southeast of the capital Kyiv.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear station has been seized by Russian military forces, after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours.

What has happened at Zaporizhzhia?

According to regional authorities Zaporizhzhia has been seized by Russian military forces, after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours.

The Ukrainian state inspectorate for nuclear regulation SNRIU said in a statement on its Facebook page the plant had been “captured by the military forces of the Russian Federation”, but added that employees were continuing to work on the premises.

Energoatom said on the messaging and chat network Telegram at 07.33 local time that the administrative building and checkpoint at Zaporizhzhia were under Russian control. Staff continued daily work ensuring the stable operation of facilities. According to reports from Energoatom, there were three dead and two wounded among Ukrainian defending forces.

Ukraine told the International Atomic energy Agency that Zaporizhzhia had been shelled overnight. SNRIU said a fire at the site had not affected “essential” equipment and plant personnel were taking “mitigatory actions”. There was no reported change in radiation levels at the facility, it said. The IAEA said it was putting its Incident and Emergency Centre (IEC) in full response mode due to the situation. The fire broke out in a training building outside the station in the early hours of Friday, after being shelled by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said.

An employee at Zaporizhzhia posted on Telegram that Russian forces had fired on the facility and there was “a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe”. Ukraine’s foreign minister confirmed the reports at 02.30, tweeting that the Russian army was “firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP... fire has already broken out.” He called for an immediate ceasefire to allow firefighters to control the blaze. A short time later, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service reported that radiation at the plant was “within normal limits” and the fire conditions at the station were “normal”. They later reported that a third unit at the station was disconnected at 2.26am, leaving just one of the facility’s six units, number four, still operating.

What is the station’s status?

Of the six reactor units, Unit 1 is shut down for maintenance, Units 2 and 3 have undergone a controlled shut down, Unit 4 is operating at 60% power and Units 5 and 6 are being held “in reserve” in low power mode. The IAEA said the safety systems of the six reactors had not been affected and there has been no release of radioactive material. However, Energoatom has reported that the situation remains “very challenging” and therefore it has not yet been possible to access the whole site to assess that all safety systems are fully functional.

The fire, which has been extinguished, was in a training centre (circled in photo).

Is there a radiation threat?

Ukrainian authorities said at 11.00 on Friday that the facility was secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed”. Earlier, the IAEA said SNRIU told the agency that there was “no change reported in radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant site”. The US also said their latest information showed no indication of elevated radiation levels at the plant. The US energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, said the reactors “are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”.

What about Chernobyl?

Russia has already captured the shut-down Chernobyl nuclear station, 100 km north of Kyiv. The Zaporizhzhia station is of a different and safer type to Chernobyl, which was the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986. The IAEA said last week that Ukraine had informed the agency that “unidentified armed forces” had taken control of all facilities of the state-owned Chernobyl NPP enterprise, located within the exclusion zone. The facilities include the shut-down Units 1, 2, and 3, the destroyed Unit 4 and a two recently constructed spent nuclear fuel storage facilities.

SNRIU said an automated radiation monitoring system in the exclusion zone had shown gamma radiation doses exceeding control levels in parts of the exclusion zone. The regulator said its analysis attributed those readings to heavy military machinery movement in the area and subsequent disturbance of the radioactive residue, or dust, on the ground.

On Thursday, Ukraine asked the IAEA to appeal to Nato to close airspace over its nuclear facilities and to intensify actions to prevent what it called “acts of nuclear terrorism” over the seizure of the Chernobyl nuclear power station and exclusion zone.

The six nuclear plants at Zaporizhzhia are VVER-1000/V320 units. These “water-water energetic reactors” (WWER), or VVER units, are a series of pressurised water reactor designs originally developed in the Soviet Union, and now Russia, by OKB Gidropress. VVERs were originally developed before the 1970s, and have been continually updated. As a result, the name VVER is associated with a wide variety of reactor designs spanning from Generation I reactors to modern Generation III+ reactor designs. VVER power stations have mostly been installed in Russia and the former Soviet Union, but also in China, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, India, Iran and Ukraine. Units are under various stages of planning or construction in Finland, Hungary, Belarus, Bangladesh, Egypt, Turkey, India, Iran, and China.

The chances of explosion, nuclear meltdown or radioactive release are low, said Tony Irwin, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University. Mr Irwin, who operated nuclear power plants in the UK for three decades, said the PWR reactors are “a lot safer” than the reactors at Chernobyl, and did not appear to be damaged yet. The reactors have large concrete contaminants and built-in fire protection systems, he said, adding: “Obviously, it’s not a good idea if you start shooting massive missiles at reactors,” he said. “The PWR [pressurised water reactor] type is a much safer sort of reactor, because it’s a two-circuit design reactor. The water that keeps the reactor cool is on a separate circuit to the second one, which actually supplies the power to the turbine and the outside.”

“These reactors have back-up emergency cooling systems as well. In addition to the normal reactor cooling, they’ve got a passive system, they’ve got high-pressure injection systems, they’ve got low-pressure injection systems.”

Wald', 'Andrew Whittaker']",,"According to a Reuters piece, the fire broke out in a building during fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Reuters described the location of the fire as being “outside the station perimeter.”

As verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the safety systems of the plant’s six reactors have not been affected by the attack and there has been no release of radioactive material. Radiation monitoring systems at the site are fully functional. IAEA confirmed that the reported fire occurred at an administrative training building and has been extinguished.

Russian troops had entered the nearby town of Energodar earlier on Thursday after breaking through a makeshift barricade—largely consisting of trucks and piles of tires—set up by Energodar residents and Ukrainian regional defense forces.

Responding to the news of the attack on the plant, U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm tweeted, “I just spoke with Ukraine’s energy minster about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Russian military operations near the plant are reckless and must cease. @ENERGY has activated its Nuclear Incident Response Team and is monitoring events in consultation with @DeptofDefense, @NRCgov, and the White House. We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility. The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures, and reactors are being safely shut down.”

Home to six 950-MWe VVER-1000 units, Zaporizhzhia is Europe’s largest nuclear power facility and the provider of approximately one-quarter of Ukraine’s power generation.

Latest on Energoatom: Energoatom, the state-owned utility that operates Ukraine’s four nuclear plants, announced on Thursday that “Ukraine is working on the technical side of the process of integration of the domestic energy system with the European one, and this issue will be resolved in the near future.”

Since 2017, Ukraine has been seeking to decouple from the system linked to Russia, Belarus, and other former Soviet states and to integrate instead with the European Union grid. According to Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s grid operator, integration with the EU would permit Ukraine to receive emergency power in the event that a military attack led to power outages.

On Wednesday, at the urging of Petro Kotin, Energoatom’s chief executive officer, Ukraine called on the International Atomic Energy Agency to create a 30-kilometer no-entry zone around each of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants. Ukraine further demanded that the IAEA impose sanctions on Russia’s nuclear technology and conduct an international audit of its nuclear stockpiles.

Latest on IAEA: The IAEA has released daily updates since the invasion began on February 24. It recently consolidated all of its updates and statements on the impacts of the war in Ukraine on nuclear facilities and staff at iaea.org/ukraine-conflict. The latest update, issued on March 3, describes the current situation at the Chernobyl power plant. According to IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, a joint appeal to the IAEA from the Ukraine government, the country’s regulatory authority, and Energoatom received earlier that day said that staff at the Chernobyl site were facing “psychological pressure and moral exhaustion” and “have limited opportunities to communicate, move, and carry out full-fledged maintenance and repair work.”

The Ukrainian communication to the IAEA also confirmed that Ukraine has lost regulatory control over all facilities in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and asked the IAEA to take measures “to reestablish legal regulation of safety of nuclear facilities and installations within the Chernobyl NPP site and within the Exclusion Zone.”

In a separate March 3 update from the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU), the IAEA reportedly learned that power from one of the two off-site power transmission lines supplying electricity to the Chernobyl site had been lost overnight, and that while that power did not serve safety-related equipment, it caused difficulties in carrying out routine maintenance and repair of some safety-critical equipment.

IAEA convenes emergency meeting: On March 2, the IAEA convened a meeting of its 35-member board of governors to address the situation in Ukraine.

“The safety and security of nuclear facilities and nuclear and other radioactive material in Ukraine must under no circumstances be endangered,” Grossi told the board. “I have called for restraint from all measures or actions that could jeopardize the security of nuclear and other radioactive material and the safe operation of any nuclear facilities in Ukraine.”

While Grossi noted that Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were operating normally, he added, “While we may use expressions like ‘normal operations’ in a technical context, I want to emphasize there is nothing normal about the circumstances under which the professionals at Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants are managing to keep the reactors that produce half of Ukraine’s electricity working.”

The board of governors voted to back a resolution that “deplores” the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with Russia and China voting against it.

While the IAEA board meeting was closed to the press, Grossi held a press conference following the meeting. In response to a question on the IAEA’s plans to address a request for help from the SNRIU, Grossi said: “Ukraine is a member state of the IAEA, and they are entitled and expect to get assistance when there is a problem, in this case related to the safety of their facilities. Obviously, in the present circumstances, delivering assistance is not a straightforward or easy process. This is why I am in contact with all sides to ascertain in which effective way we could be providing this assistance.”

ANS issues appeal: On March 3, ANS President Steven Nesbit and CEO/Executive Director Craig Piercy issued a statement: “We echo the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Association of Nuclear Operators in appealing to all armed combatants in Ukraine to refrain from military actions near nuclear facilities. The staff of Ukraine's nuclear power plants must be able to fulfill their duties without interruption, undue pressure, or the fear of being killed or injured. We also urge the securing of off-site power supplies for every nuclear facility, uninterrupted transportation to and from sites for plant workers and supply chains, and unfettered communications with regulators and inspectors. Ukraine's nuclear workers need their rest between shifts, access to their homes, and peace of mind that their loved ones are safe.”

In response to the need for support of the nuclear professionals of Ukraine and their families, ANS has established the Ukrainian Nuclear Workers Humanitarian Fund. One hundred percent of the donations made to the ANS fund will be provided to the Ukrainian Nuclear Society (UKRNS).

The agency issued a statement that a fire broke out at the training building outside the NPP which was extinguished by 6:20 AM (Ukraine Time). The fire, due to heavy shelling by Russian Army was localized on an area of ​​2,000 square meters, stated SNRIU.

'Zaporizhzhya under Russian control': Ukraine

""ZNPP power units remain intact, unit 1 reactor compartment auxiliary buildings have been damaged, which does not affect the safety of the unit. The systems and components important to the safety of the NPP are operational. At present, no changes in the radiation situation have been registered. Currently, the site of the Zaporizhzhia NPP is occupied by the military forces of the Russian Federation,"" stated SNRIU. Russia has already taken over the now-defunct Chernobyl power plant.

The SNRIU added that operational personnel are monitoring the state of the power units and are ensuring their operation in accordance with the requirements of process procedures for safe operation. As of now of the six reactors at Zaporizhzhya - Unit 1 is in outage, Units 2, 3 have been disconnected from the grid, Unit 4 is in operation at 690 MW power and Units 5, 6 are being cooled down. No casualties has been reported due to the fire.

Attack on Zaporizhzhia power plant

The Zaporizhzhia power plant - operational since 1984 - has an installed capacity of 6GW - six units which produce up to 42 billion kWh of electricity, according to Power Technology. Each unit comprising of a pressurised water reactor (PWR) generates 1000 MW each. The plant - which is controlled by Ukraine’s national nuclear energy generating company NNEGC Energoatom - has been surrounded by Russian troops for the past two days.

On March 1, Russia informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that its military forces have taken control of the territory around Zaporizhzhia NPP. Russia added that personnel at the plant continued their “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in the normal mode of operation. The radiation levels remain normal”. On March 3, Ukraine warned IAEA that Russian forces were moving towards Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.",https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/russian-troops-occupy-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-informs-ukraine-fire-doused-articleshow.html
