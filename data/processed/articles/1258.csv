There has been heavy artillery fire from the Russian forces for the past few weeks with administrative buildings being the target of attacks including homes and apartment blocks.

So little light is emanating from Ukraine’s second-biggest city that the constellations above are, like they were centuries ago, vivid in the blackness.

Kharkiv, home to nearly 1.5 million people before the war, has suffered the most relentless Russian bombardment of any Ukrainian city other than the battered southern port of Mariupol. Hundreds are dead; the living — the third or so of the population that remains — are hungry and terrorized.

Whole city blocks have fallen to ruins, lined with burned car husks. The sheared-off facade of a shelled apartment building reveals a tableau of life interrupted: charred books, stuffed animals, coffee cups. The golden spires of a landmark Orthodox cathedral are scarred by shrapnel.

Sometimes, the air raid sirens don’t start until after the thunderous explosions have already begun. Huddled in basements and subway stations, mothers soothe their little ones, and people wait for fitful sleep to come.

“It can’t go on like this,” said Oksana Kabachenko, a 27-year-old mother of two who has been hiding for days in a makeshift subterranean shelter in the city center. “We are Ukrainians. We are civilians. We just want to live in our homes.”

Even now, more than a month into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion, an air of disbelief hovers like smoke. This is a largely Russian-speaking city, only 25 miles from the border; one of Putin’s main pretexts for the invasion was that Ukraine’s Russian speakers needed protection.

Instead, the city became a prime target, among the first areas in the country to be subjected to large-scale bombing of densely populated civilian neighborhoods, a tactic that is now a dominant component of the Russian military campaign.

“It’s not just a war, this is a massacre,” Kharkiv’s mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said on Telegram after Russian forces began savaging the city with missiles and artillery fire.

So vast is the scope of the destruction that Ukrainian officials have likened it to Stalingrad (now Volgograd), the Soviet city that was besieged by the Germans in 1942-43. The city’s defenders prevailed, though at a cost of 40,000 civilian lives, and the battle remains a source of immense pride to Russians.

× What had been a thriving metropolis of nearly 1.5 million people, Kharkiv, remains in Ukrainian hands, but at an enormous cost.

In Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials like to posit, it is the Russians who will face a humiliating defeat. Ukrainian troops and volunteers have managed so far to repel feints by Russian ground forces — leading to fears that the invaders will attempt, from a distance, to simply pulverize the city into submission. In a single 24-hour period ending Friday, city officials counted 55 hits by rockets and missiles.

Lying at the confluence of three rivers, Kharkiv has for centuries been a hub of industry and transport. But it is also a center of science, education and culture, a city that cherishes its poets and artists, as well as its museums and monuments.

And its musicians. A concert cellist, Denys Karachevtsev, has been staging elegiac performances among the ruins — a Bach cello suite, Ukraine’s national anthem — and posting videos of them online, saying he wants to inspire his fellow citizens to imagine Kharkiv rebuilt.

“I love my heroic city,” he wrote on Facebook.

In homes fortunate enough to have power, residents conceal their lights at night behind makeshift blackout curtains. Metal “hedgehogs” — tank obstacles constructed of angled beams — glimmer in the dimmed car headlights. The darkness can be filled with deafening blasts or eerie silence.

Every dawn illuminates weeks-old wreckage, as well as fresh destruction.

On Friday, gruesome scenes marked the aftermath of an airstrike the day before in the city’s east-central Moskovskyi district. Outside a post office-turned-aid distribution center, which was struck Thursday as dozens of people waited in line for supplies, a frozen pool of blood, part of a severed human hand and a bloodied cigarette could be seen. Plumes of smoke filled the sky.

In another eastern district, Nemyshlianskyi, a nine-story building was still standing after being hit by bombardment some days earlier. Neighbors said the four who were killed there included an 8-year-old; people were still living in units that escaped major damage.

Inside one of the burned-out apartments, a child’s bicycle leaned against scorched concrete. In the bedroom was a teddy bear; on the floor, the pages of a picture book were crisped and sooty. The kitchen was intact but blackened by flames. In the corner, a picture-tube TV was melted.

In another kitchen, a wall inscription read “Morning loves Arina.” A top-floor unit was filled with books, not all of them burned.

At the city’s Hospital No. 7, near a neighborhood called Saltivka that has been under near-constant barrage, beds lined the corridors; an indirect hit had shattered windows. The 280 beds were dedicated to the war-injured; patients suffering other ailments were turned away.

One patient, 50-year-old Viktoria Rusanova, said she hoped to regain use of her shrapnel-pierced leg. She was walking near her mother’s house in Saltivka when a Russian shell landed, wounding her and wrecking the structure. Her mother was pulled from the ruins alive.

Before the war, Rusanova worked in a grocery store, now demolished.

“Nothing to go back to,” she said.

Vitaliy Sukharev, 39, was also hospitalized. He was in a car when he was hit by gunshots. The power was out at the hospital when he arrived, so medical staff carried him up seven flights of stairs. He was one of the fortunate ones.

“Luckily, we had generator for surgery!” said Kozyryev Aleksandr, the deputy medical chief.

Sukharev liked fixing up cars before the fighting. Now he wonders if there will be anywhere to drive them.

“We have to rebuild all the roads here in Kharkiv and in Ukraine,” he said.

Kharkiv’s sprawling Barabashovo market once claimed to be the biggest in Eastern Europe. It was ravaged by bombardment, as if a swift, cruel storm had gusted through its alleys. A few fires smoldered Friday. Shattered shops were littered with damaged wares: cracked ceramics, burned teapots.

A few men were loading salvaged items into a beige Lada with two bullet holes in the windshield.

At Kharkiv National University — premier among the city’s dozens of colleges — an administrative center was crushed. Only the front facade with three large window frames remained standing, offering a triptych-like view of the ruined interior. Firefighters were clearing the rubble.

In the subterranean world where many of those remaining in the city spend their nights, an overture of snores could be heard at a subway station on the city’s western side.

Some slept on a platform as cold as ice. Others bedded down in subway cars and stretched out on benches where commuters once awaited trains, even nesting in piles of donated clothing. A windowsill held carefully arranged supplies: mouthwash, toothbrush, chewing gum, sanitizing wipes.

In the eastern district of Rogan, at least 50 people took refuge in a freezing cellar after their neighborhood was cut off from the rest of the city three weeks ago by heavy bombardment. A 64-year-old woman named Galina Dmitrievna Kuka said her home, and those of all her neighbors, had been destroyed.

“My life is now divided into before the war and after war,” Kuka said. “I don’t want another person to experience anything like this. I feel like I have lived half the life that I had before, in just this month alone.”

Conditions in the cellar are primitive: People use tied-together tree branches as insulation on the bare floor, with salvaged bedding piled on top. They have only candles for light. They drink water from a leaky pipe.

“I could never imagine this kind of war,” Kuka said. “I could never believe this. But it came true.”

When the bombs fall, the walls shake. Sometimes gunfire rings out. From below ground, trembling families hear heavy vehicles moving above; whether their own or the enemy’s, they cannot know.

2,469beb6c-aa97-466a-907e-8cdc4b58f9a6,[],,"Smaller-scale strikes on Ukrainian targets continued without pause on Friday as Russia, suffering heavy losses and meager progress against key targets, pursued a relentless campaign of bombardment while claiming the first phase of its “military operation” was over.

Giving only its second death toll of the war, the Russian army said it had suffered 1,351 fatalities in the invasion. Ukraine and Western intelligence say it is many thousands more.

In a potentially significant shift, the Russian army said the first phase of its campaign was over and its troops would now focus on the “liberation” of the Russian-speaking Donbas region in Ukraine’s east.

Sergei Rudskoi, chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff of Russia’s armed forces, said the shift was possible because “the combat potential of Ukraine’s armed forces has been significantly reduced.”

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, however, indicated no let-up in his country’s refusal to accede to Russian demands after what he termed “very difficult” talks with Moscow.

“We insist, first of all, on a ceasefire, security guarantees, and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he said.

And while Mariupol and other places are now charred ruins, Western systems including shoulder-fired anti-tank missiles have helped Ukraine’s armed forces hold their line — and increasingly to go on the offensive.

“Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to re-occupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of Kyiv,” Britain’s defense ministry said in a daily update.

Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden, visiting troops in Poland, referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as “a man who, quite frankly, I think is a war criminal,” adding: “And I think we’ll meet the legal definition of that as well.”

Potentially highlighting that, Russian strikes targeting a medical facility in Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv killed at least four civilians and wounded several others, police said.

Several residents said that cluster munitions were used, spraying death indiscriminately.

“This morning, following a bombardment on civilian infrastructure from several rocket launchers, seven civilians were injured, four of them died,” police in the eastern city near Russia’s border said.

Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov accused Russian forces of “indiscriminate” shelling of his city and said that nearly two-thirds of its 1.5 million residents have had to flee since the war started a month ago.

“These criminal bombings target residential areas, civilians and infrastructure such as schools,” Terekhov told reporters during an improvised briefing in a secret location meant to be safe from bombs.

“It’s a war against Kharkiv, against Ukraine, against civilians,” he said.

Friday’s strikes targeted a medical center in the Osnovyansky district of the city, police said.

In the aftermath, several people stood near the site of the strike in the residential area near the airport.

“I had gone out looking for bread. There were explosions. When I came back there were four bodies lying there, with relatives crying by their side,” 71-year-old Mykola Hladkiy said.

Several residents said cluster munitions were used and there were large fires after other hits in the city.

Kharkiv has seen heavy fighting and vast destruction since Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion launched late last month.

The World Health Organization said Friday that the number of verified attacks on health care in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 has reached 72, killing 71 deaths and wounding 37.

For just a few seconds on Thursday, Sergei Shoigu was back on Russians’ television screens, sitting in the corner box of a teleconference with Vladimir Putin.

The Russian defence minister, arguably the man most responsible for the floundering war effort in Ukraine, had not been seen in public for 12 days. Nor had the chief of the general staff of Russia’s armed forces, Valery Gerasimov.

Rumours were beginning to circulate that they may have been punished over the bungled invasion, which has failed to capture key Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv or Kyiv and plunged Russia into economic isolation.

Russians had already watched Putin browbeat and humiliate the head of the country’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, during a televised meeting over the fate of the Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine.

Journalists have since filed reports on an investigation in the FSB directorate responsible for foreign intelligence, including on Ukraine, and on the arrest of a senior official from Russia’s national guard.

It is unclear if any of those events are related to Russia’s war in Ukraine, an effort that is going according to plan, a Russian foreign ministry official said on Thursday. For many Russians, however, it is apparent that the war is not going to plan, and the expectation among Kremlin watchers is that men such as Shoigu could shoulder the blame.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/24/russia-ukraine-war-latest-news-zelenskiy-expects-meaningful-steps-at-nato-eu-and-g7-summits-live

The relevant statement was made by Kharkiv Regional Military Administration Head Oleh Syniehubov on Telegram, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.

“Talking of Kharkiv, last night the city came under fire 24 times. It is relatively low, but each time may cause casualties among civilians. Yesterday there were quite many casualties,” Syniehubov told.

Over the past day, no enemy aircrafts have been recorded over Kharkiv. Meanwhile, reconnaissance drones were detected, and some of them were destroyed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

According to Syniehubov, the Ukrainian military are not only keeping the defense lines in Kharkiv Region but also launching counterattacks. In particular, several settlements in the direction of Mala Rohan have been liberated, and battles are currently underway there. Battles are also raging in the Izium direction.

A reminder that, on February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, starting a war. Russian troops are shelling and destroying the key infrastructure facilities, launching missile and air strikes on Ukrainian cities and villages, killing civilians.

The city is just 25 miles from the Russian border, but Ukrainian forces have thus far been able to prevent the advance of Russian ground troops. In retaliation, the Russians have spent the past weeks using artillery to bombard the city’s defenders and civilians. The residents of the most-targeted areas remain either trapped in their apartments, many without electricity and hot water, or have been sheltering in the city’s subway stations for weeks. A tour of Kharkiv last week made clear the city could be next to suffer a mass humanitarian crisis in a war that has already cost thousands of lives and displaced millions.

Most of this residential neighborhood feels abandoned. We are on the edge of the town, the frontier, where the fighting takes place. The Ukrainian military let us tour the area to see the destruction. Half of a 16-floor residential building, totally burned by the airstrike, looms over the street we are on. Personal belongings litter the pavement, including burned photo albums with the faces of the people who lived nearby, a stark reminder that this area was once full of life. Only rarely do the locals dare to venture out. I spot an old man in a doorway staring at me and my photographer. He looks scared.

“Why are you staying? Isn’t it dangerous?” I ask.

“I wish to leave,” he tells me. “I have been here for 18 days without electricity, the water in the pipes in my flat got frozen. I just do not know how to get out of here. I called some people. I wish to get to the train station.”

His name is Leonid Andriyovych, he is 72 and a grandfather. Even in these circumstances he is neatly dressed in suit trousers and clean shoes. He speaks in a soft voice. A journalist traveling with us suggests that we help the man right away. We tell him to get his documents. We need to get out of this dangerous area in a hurry, so he has to run upstairs to the ninth floor of the building he lives in to get his papers. The constant shelling continues.

“I saw you by accident,” Andriyovych tells me. “Most of the time I stay in my flat. Where else? There is this place in one of the basements where there was electricity to charge the mobile phone and boil hot water, so I went there now, but it’s better to be inside. Shrapnell killed a woman who was walking on the streets in front of my eyes.”

The elderly of Kharkiv suffer the most. Many, like Andriyovych, are stuck in their flats under heavy bombardment, the electricity in the suburban areas of town mostly doesn’t work; they are the least mobile and often have neither a place to go, nor the ability to easily get around the country.

Two or three minutes — that’s how much time Andriyovych has to grab the documents and flee from the flat he’s lived in for 30 years. He worked in one of the research institutes in Kharkiv — the largest scientific hub of Ukraine. His daughter and grandson managed to escape in the first hours of the war. He planned to make it later. But waiting even one day was too late.

As we drive away we pass a demolished kindergarten where Andriyovych’s grandson Oleh used to attend. “He will turn six at the end of March, he was going there till the first day of the invasion,” Andriyovych says. “I wonder when I will see him. But I am happy he is in a safe place in western Ukraine”.

On our way to the train station, Andriyovych asks, “Is Kharkiv still standing?” He’s been stuck inside his apartment building cowering in terror and is surprised to see parts of the city still function as we drive from the outskirts through an industrial part of town filled with warehouses, factories, and supermarkets. From time to time we see lines of people — mainly to the post offices, ATMs, or pharmacies. “I thought the whole city was like my area — burned, empty,” he says with some hope, “but here there are lines to the shops, people walking …”

We don’t show him downtown, so as not to disappoint him. In addition to the outskirts, the oldest, central part of Kharkiv was also bombed and is heavily damaged.

We ask the local volunteers to bring Andriyovych to the train station and to give him some hot food. The Ukrainian railroad has made all traveling free, and added trains to evacuate civilians. The station in Kharkiv — and every rail station all over the country — serves as a shelter offering warm food, relative safety, and a place to ​​charge your phone. Andriyovych says he’s going to stay with his sister in western Ukraine.

“We used to have a nice life here,” Andriyovych tells me as we say goodbye. “We didn’t have much trouble, things worked. I believe the war will be over soon. Don’t you think so too? It shouldn’t be like this, the world should find a solution. It can’t be otherwise.”

I nod. I didn’t want to disappoint him.

Many residents of Kharkiv believe that the brutality of the attacks on the city are Russian revenge for successfully resisting the invasion for so long. According to Putin, the fact that the majority of Kharkiv speaks Russian, and many have relatives over the border, the city would welcome the invaders. My friends and colleagues from Kharkiv had insisted to me this was not the case and they would resist. They were correct, but the city has paid a terrible toll.

I have friends who live on one of the most-damaged streets in the city. I visited them a month before the war. Today, everything lies in ruins. Their favorite wine store, the local bar, a boutique, the office building of a news agency are all destroyed, all that’s left is debris. Most of the buildings, windows blown out, are now covered with icicles. Mid-March has been unusually cold — hitting lows of -18 C, only adding to the misery .

“Doesn’t matter what, I will rebuild Kharkiv,” Anatolii, an architect tells me. “We possess all the drawings. I live here, I am Ukrainian, it’s my house. Unfortunately, now I am wounded.” He’s sitting on a bed in one of the city’s hospitals. (Rolling Stone has chosen not to reveal the specific location of the hospital at the request of sources, who all fear the Russians may deliberately target medical facilities.) A palm-size shell hit him in the leg. He wasn’t enlisted to the military and had stayed with his wife to take care of at least eight elderly people living in their apartment building.

“I went out to buy some groceries,” Anatolii recalls. “I was two minutes away from my home, just near the school, and felt insane pain. I started to crawl, then a man and a woman came to help me. My wife came down and managed to bind the wound, so I did not lose blood.” He’s worried that since he won’t be able to walk for a few months, he won’t be able to help the residents of his building.

The hospital is filled with wounded. Scores of new patients arrive 24 hours a day. The wounds from artillery shelling became the new norm. The doctors here are normally strict with the press, not wanting to violate their patients’ privacy. But since the war started and they are facing mass casualties every day, they have been allowing journalists into the emergency room “so the world can see,” one doctor tells me.

Stanislav, a middle-aged friendly man, volunteers at the hospital — cleaning, moving things around, anything to help. His son Dima’s life was recently saved here. Dima was in an apartment just a few minutes away from the Regional Administration in central Kharkiv when it was hit on March 1.

“He is an adult,” Stanislav tells me. “We call each other once a day. I received a call from an unknown person who said, ‘Dima is unconscious, he is bleeding at his home.’ I rushed there. It was not easy. The street was filled with debris, ambulances couldn’t get through easily. I saw him on the floor. I went down to the street to ask people there to help me to get him out.”

Three weeks after the incident, Dima can now talk. He has a hematoma in his head, and requires a complex operation. The last thing Dima remembers before waking in the hospital is the blast.

For the doctors, still reeling from the pandemic, the stress has been enormous. Maria Matvienko, an anaesthetist, describes the first week of the war as the hardest, because there were still too many civilians around. Up to 1.7 million people live in the city. Many Kharkiv residents refused to believe that a full-scale invasion was coming, but not because they were careless or naive. It was simply hard to accept that something like that was possible in the 21st century. Most expected that the Kremlin would just continue to meddle in Ukrainian politics or intensify fighting in eastern Ukraine, and would never bomb civilians.

The city authorities do not release the number of the casualties, but talk about there being about 1,200 wounded. The local police registered 250 deaths, but in many cases investigations have not been opened. The numbers of confirmed dead will almost certainly rise in the next weeks and months.

Matvienko herself now lives in the hospital with her husband and 11-year-old daughter, who wants to be useful, so, for instance, she entertains the younger patients. “A few doctors left, mainly those with small kids, but most stayed and we all live here in the facility,” Matvienko tells me. “It’s more convenient, as if something happens we can be ready within a moment. Kharkiv is my home. I love it. If we left, who would treat the people?”

The fiercest battles still take place in the villages outside the city, where the media have no access. On one of the first days of the war, Russian paratroopers managed to reach the middle of the town, but were pushed back. They hid in the school — one of the oldest in the town, which was badly damaged in the fight and set on fire. Firefighters were unable to put out the blaze. The paratroopers were reportedly all killed by Ukrainian troops. On the street I may see a burned military vehicle, but also packages of military rations marked “The Russian Army.”

Since the first days of the conflict, the Kharkiv subway system has served as a bomb shelter. One of the stations became an asylum for people who lost their houses or were afraid to go out. Some of them have stayed in the station for more than 18 days now.

“I thought Putin was a reasonable man, a smart person,” says Nina Maksymivna, 80. “Now I wish for him and also the Lavrov family, their kids, to suffer as much as we do. I don’t really know where to go. I have problems with my legs, I can’t move properly, so I just sit here all the time.” She was born in Kharkiv during World War II and didn’t expect to see another war in her lifetime.

There are volunteer groups that try to help evacuate the people, but the scale of the problem is too big. Even if half of the city has fled, almost a million remain. Currently, up to 600 people are camped on a subway platform and in trains. During the first bombardments, up to 2,000 people gathered there. Yulia, the head of the station, said the subway authorities made the decision to shut down the metro lines and let people walk along the tunnels to another station.

“Take your cups, hot borsch (the Ukrainian soup) is available,” the subway conductor who used to announce the next subway stop calls out.

To spend even three hours inside the station is difficult, and there are hundreds of old people who have been down here for weeks. Most of the people try to make the best of it. They read, talk, cry, play, laugh, and most of all, scroll through the news.

Every video statement from President Volodymyr Zelensky draws attention, and crowds huddle around phones. The president looks unshaved and tired. “This time he probably didn’t sleep,” someone near me says.

“I can imagine. I am responsible for about 2,000 people here, and after 18 days, we are drained; he bears responsibility for the whole country,” says Igor, a police officer who seems to be in charge of the subway station. He is 24, but looks way younger.

He’s a charismatic guy, and is followed around by the children in the station who treat Igor like a hero, asking him to give them orders to help. Igor graciously takes time to be their elder brother. He also addresses each grandma or anybody who asks anything, from what type of medicine to use to train schedules, but mostly he just hears people out and listens. His efforts help calm some of the people. Igor himself resides nearby. Before joining the police, he worked as an auto mechanic. He wants to go home to take a shower, but there is no hot water at his flat, the windows are broken, and it’s no longer habitable.

I ask why he is not wearing a uniform.

“My bosses were not happy about it,” Igor tells me. “But it’s more about security. Can you imagine if somebody wants to overtake the station or do something here? A person in uniform would be their primary target. But I would have at least five minutes to build a barricade, or start evacuating the people.”

What he says makes sense. A 24-year-old making calls that will mean life or death. Everyone here is in survival mode and preparing for the worst still to come.

Russia signaled a possible recalibration of its war aims in Ukraine on Friday as the Kremlin faced spreading global ostracism for the brutal invasion, hardened Western economic punishments and a determined Ukrainian resistance that appeared to be making some gains on the ground.

A statement by Russia’s Defense Ministry said the goals of the “first stage of the operation” had been “mainly accomplished,” with Ukraine’s combat capabilities “significantly reduced,” and that it would now focus on securing Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years.

The Defense Ministry statement was ambiguous about further possible Russian territorial ambitions in Ukraine, where its ground forces have been mostly stymied by the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian military response.

But on a day when President Biden was visiting U.S. soldiers in Poland near the Ukrainian border, the statement suggested the possibility that the Russians were looking for a way to salvage some kind of achievement before the costs of the war they launched a month ago became impossibly onerous.

While Russia “does not exclude” that its forces will storm major Ukrainian cities such as Chernihiv, Mykolaiv and the capital, Kyiv, the Defense Ministry statement said that taking them over was not the primary objective.

“As individual units carry out their tasks — and they are being solved successfully — our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing: the complete liberation of the Donbas,” Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, a senior Russian military commander, said in the statement, his first since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24.

Whether General Rudskoi’s statement was sincere or simply strategic misdirection was difficult to assess. But the statement amounted to the most direct acknowledgment yet that Russia may be unable to take full control of Ukraine and would instead target the Donbas region, where Russia has recognized the independence of two Kremlin-backed separatist areas that it calls the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic.”

Russia has also insisted that Ukraine recognize its control of Crimea, which President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces seized from Ukraine in 2014.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has ruled out ceding those regions to stop the war.

Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst, cautioned that the public pronouncements of Russian military commanders should be regarded skeptically. While Russia could indeed be narrowing its war aims, he said, General Rudskoi’s statement could also be a feint as Russia regroups for a new offensive.

“We could say that this is a signal that we’re no longer insisting on dismantling Ukrainian statehood,” Mr. Luzin said. “But I would rather see it as a distracting maneuver.”

General Rudskoi’s statement came as Ukraine acknowledged that Russian forces had been “partially successful” in achieving one of their key objectives — securing a land corridor from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula.

While Russia already controlled much of the area, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the route allowed Russian troops and supplies to flow between Crimea and Russia.

But some Ukrainian officials said the significance of such a route might be overstated. Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine under Mr. Zelensky, described the land bridge as a minor Russian victory and said the Kremlin was moving to secure Donetsk and Luhansk to “sell to the Russian public as a potential victory.”

In Moscow, Mr. Putin, who has made any criticism of the war a potential crime, used a televised videoconference with the winners of a presidential arts prize on Friday to deliver a diatribe about “cancel culture” that made no mention of the war in Ukraine.

In embracing a term that has become a favorite of the American political right to reprise his contention that the West is trying to erase Russian culture and history, Mr. Putin cited J.K. Rowling, author of the “Harry Potter” books, whose comments about transgender women have been criticized as transphobic.

“Not so long ago, the children’s writer J.K. Rowling was also ‘canceled’ for the fact that she — the author of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies around the world — did not please fans of so-called gender freedoms,” Mr. Putin said.

Ms. Rowling responded on Twitter that, “Critiques of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics.” She added the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine.

As Mr. Putin spoke, there were indications that Ukrainian forces were making some progress in the second week of their counteroffensive. A senior Pentagon official said that Russian forces no longer had full control of the southern port of Kherson and that the city, the first major urban center to be captured in the Russian invasion, was now “contested territory.”

The Pentagon assessment contradicted General Rudskoi’s claim on Friday that the Kherson region was “under full control.”

In another sign of the bloody stalemate in Ukraine, Russian soldiers have adopted “defensive positions” near Kyiv, the Pentagon official said, adding that Russia appeared to be “prioritizing” the fight in eastern Ukraine, as General Rudskoi had indicated.

“Clearly, they overestimated their ability to take Kyiv and overestimated their ability to take any population center,” the Pentagon official said.

Mr. Biden, on the second day of his three-day visit to Europe because of the Ukraine crisis, traveled to Rzeszow, Poland, about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border, where he met with members of the 82nd Airborne Division who are serving as part of NATO’s efforts to protect Poland and other member states from Russian aggression.

Greeting American service members who were eating pizza in a cafeteria, Mr. Biden called them “the finest fighting force in the history of the world,” and added, “I personally thank you for what you do.”

Later, Mr. Biden met with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and officials managing the humanitarian response to the more than two million Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland to escape the shelling and deprivation.

Mr. Biden also announced a deal to increase U.S. shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. But it remained unclear exactly how the administration would achieve its goals.

The deal calls for the United States to send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. But it does not address the lack of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic.

Still, American gas executives welcomed a renewed emphasis on exports as a sign that the Biden administration was now seeking to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry rather than punish it for contributions to climate change.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Robert Habeck, the vice chancellor and economic minister of Germany, said his country expected to halve imports of Russian oil by midsummer and nearly end them by year’s end — sooner than many thought possible. He estimated that Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, could be free of Russian gas by mid-2024.

Images and videos from Ukraine that emerged on Friday underscored the escalating death toll and destruction.

Newly surfaced security camera footage, verified by The New York Times, showed an attack on people in line for emergency aid outside a post office and shopping center in the battered northeastern city of Kharkiv on Thursday. Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the regional government there, said that at least six civilians had been killed and 15 wounded.

Photographs out of Kharkiv on Friday also showed a large fireball and nearby cars and buildings on fire, as residents fled on foot and bicycle, carrying whatever belongings they could grab in the aftermath of the attack.

In the central city of Dnipro, Russian missile strikes on a military facility destroyed buildings late Thursday night, according to Ukrainian officials, who said that casualties were still being assessed.

And in Mariupol, the southern port savaged by Russian attacks, Ukrainian officials said that an estimated 300 people had been killed in a March 16 strike on a theater used as a bomb shelter.

It was unclear how officials had arrived at that estimate. Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the theater, which was attacked even though “children” had been written in giant letters on the pavement on both sides of the building.

The United Nations said on Friday that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, including 93 children, since Russia’s invasion began, many in what appeared to have been indiscriminate bombardments that could constitute war crimes.

The United Nations cautioned that it had not been able to verify the death toll in areas of intense conflict, including Mariupol, and said the actual number of injured and dead was likely to be considerably higher.

In a sign that diplomatic efforts were struggling, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rejected comments by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had suggested that Ukraine was open to concessions in four key areas.

In an interview released Friday, Mr. Erdogan, who is hosting talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, said that Ukraine was willing to drop its bid for NATO membership, accept Russian as an official language, make “certain concessions” about disarmament and agree to “collective security.”

But Mr. Kuleba said the negotiations had proved “very difficult” and that Ukraine had “taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands.”

“We insist, first of all, on a cease-fire, security guarantees and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he said, adding that there was “no consensus with Russia on the four points mentioned by the president of Turkey.”

“In particular,” he said, “the Ukrainian language is and will be the only one state language in Ukraine.”

Chic eateries and sleek shopping malls sat alongside elegant neo-baroque architecture in what had been a rapidly developing urban centre.

Now, large areas of the city resemble Stalingrad more than Stuttgart, as Kharkiv falls victim to what locals and experts say is a Russian strategy of targeting civilians.

Entering the city from the south, there are initially few signs of the war, save the military barricades and checkpoints at regular intervals.

Downtown Kharkiv is a different story: windows and storefronts blown out by artillery shelling, other buildings demolished entirely by airstrikes or cruise missile hits.

Along Kharkiv's central Moskovsky Avenue, an apartment building scorched by rocket artillery fire sits across from a massive crater in a parking lot, the result of an airstrike the day prior to CBC's visit on Saturday.

""The rockets hit yesterday, and there was a huge fire in the apartment building,"" said Oleg Tornenko, a 55-year-old resident of the building.

""[The Russians] want people to leave here. They're trying to force them out.""

While most Russian shelling of Kharkiv to date has occurred during the evening, strikes in daylight hours have picked up in recent days, locals say.

""The last two or three days, they're bombing us during the day,"" said Elena Yelagina, a 62-year-old museum director who lives in the city centre.

""Not only by plane, but Grads (vehicle-mounted rocket launcher) and Smerch (rocket artillery), even Iskanders (ballistic missiles). I can already tell them apart just by the sound.""

'Every single day, something explodes'

The timing of the strikes appears designed to maximize civilian casualties and instill terror in the local population.

""This strike was at 8 a.m.,"" said Dmitri Yakovlev, a 26-year-old police officer, of the strike that hit the Moskovsky Ave. apartment building.

""Very often [Russian] shelling starts just after the curfew ends at 6 a.m. People go to queue for humanitarian aid, and they hit them.""

The strikes have been constant, and without apparent military goals.

""Every single day, something explodes,"" said Yakovlev. ""There are no military objects [in the city centre], only residential areas. They are intentionally shelling [civilians].""

Kharkiv is a key Russian prize in this war — a Russian-speaking city just 15 kilometres from the border. There were numerous Russia-backed attempts in 2014 to declare a ""Kharkiv People's Republic"" in the mould of those established in Donetsk and Luhansk, but the city has remained under Ukrainian government control.

Russian forces made numerous attempts to capture the city in the invasion's opening day, sending in lightly armoured special forces units in a bid to seize local government buildings.

Yakovlev, the police officer, witnessed some of those battles.

""They tried to break through in the first days, but too many of them died,"" he said.

""On Feb. 27, five Russian Tigr [armoured vehicles] broke into the city. One of them reached our [police] base — I think they were lost, because [the soldiers inside] just ran out and tried to hide in the nearby school.

""We captured one of the two that survived [the ensuing battle], who told us that he wanted to surrender earlier, but [Russian] commanders don't allow that.""

Following those failed incursions, Russian forces have made few attempts to breach the city, instead subjecting it to massive — and increasing — bombardment.

Russian strategy unclear

Experts say this is part of a shift in Moscow's strategy to focus more on siege warfare as its initial advances in Ukraine bog down.

Ukrainian forces have thus far managed to keep Russian troops on the outskirts of Kharkiv, after defeating the attempts in the war's opening days for a Russian ""thunder run"" to capture the city.

Russia, for its part, denies that its troops are even attacking Kharkiv, as foreign minister Sergei Lavrov stated on March 3.

""In some cases, it appears that Russian forces do not plan to take major cities like Kharkiv,"" said Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at the Virginia-based Center for Naval Analyses.

""They lack the manpower for those assaults. Instead, they've been striking cities to apply pressure and signal to other towns that they're prepared to engage in indiscriminate shelling in order to coerce them into surrender.""

This strategy is also in play in other areas of Ukraine — particularly, the southeast city of Mariupol, where Russian forces are pounding the trapped civilians and defenders amid a grinding advance.

Officials in Mariupol say 80 per cent of the city's civilian infrastructure has been destroyed, including the Mariupol drama theatre, which was struck on March 16 despite housing more than 1,000 civilians who had taken shelter there and with the word ""children"" written in large Cyrillic script outside.

Others have confirmed Russia's intentionally destructive approach. Human Rights Watch found evidence of cluster munitions use in heavily populated areas of Kharkiv, where fewer than 500,000 civilians from a pre-war population of 1.5 million remain.

Kharkiv regional police said that between Feb. 24 and March 7, 133 civilians were killed in the city, with another 319 wounded.

'They won't beat us'

The results of Russia's tactics are evident across Kharkiv.

Moving northward from the city centre, it feels as if nearly every street is bombed out. Twisted rebar and blasted concrete dominate the cityscape for kilometres on end. The damage is so widespread that it's difficult to imagine what military purpose the Russians hoped to accomplish.

Yakovlev, the police officer, needs no more convincing of Russia's approach.

""After they failed to enter the city, they understood that they wouldn't be able to take [Kharkiv],"" he said.

""Their soldiers are far worse [fighters] than ours, and absolutely everyone here is against them. So they decided that instead, they would terrorize the civilians to make people leave.""

Fear, he believes, is the primary objective of these attacks.

""The only option Russia has is to just destroy the city, as they have done with Mariupol,"" Yakovlev said. ""So it's pure terror that they are using now.""

As he speaks, distant artillery thumps echo constantly, coming in small groups every few seconds. The tone of one group is different — lighter and without the change in air pressure.

""That was ours,"" said Yakovlev. ""They bomb us because they can't beat us. They won't beat us.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/kharkiv-ukraine-russian-bombardment-1.6396229
