Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv had come under a missile attack.

Ukrainian forces downed an enemy aircraft over Kyiv in the early hours of Friday, which then crashed into a residential building and set it on fire, said Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister.

Russia has launched a barrage of missile, artillery and air attacks on Ukraine early Thursday, triggering the worst security crisis Europe has witnessed in decades. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry warned that the capital, Kyiv, was being targeted and urged citizens to go to shelters. Ukraine’s border guard said that it was being shelled from five regions, including from Crimea in the south and Belarus to the north, and that Russian forces had crossed into the country.

The U.S.-drafted resolution is then expected to be taken up by the 193-member UN General Assembly within days, a senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier on Thursday.

The United Nations Security Council will vote on Friday on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia for invading Ukraine and require Moscow to immediately and unconditionally withdraw, but the measure is set to fail because Moscow can cast a veto.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday and Kyiv has reported dozens of casualties and hundreds of wounded.

As Russian forces attacked cities across Ukraine, requests for volunteers began to appear on hacker forums on Thursday morning, as many residents fled the capital Kyiv.

The government of Ukraine is asking for volunteers from the country’s hacker underground to help protect critical infrastructure and conduct cyber spying missions against Russian troops, according two people involved in the project.

Although action will be blocked in the 15-member Security Council, Washington and allies see a vote as a chance to show Moscow is isolated over its actions. Diplomats said it appeared at least 11 members would vote in favor, while it was unclear how China, India and the United Arab Emirates would vote.

The volunteers would be divided into defensive and offensive cyber units. The defensive unit would be employed to defend infrastructure such as power plants and water systems. In a 2015 cyberattack, widely attributed to Russia state hackers, 225,000 Ukrainians lost electricity.

A person directly involved in the effort confirmed that the request came from the Defense Ministry on Thursday morning.

“Ukrainian cybercommunity! It’s time to get involved in the cyber defense of our country,” the post read, asking hackers and cybersecurity experts to submit an application via Google docs, listing their specialties, such as malware development, and professional references.

A Ukrainian security official said earlier this month that the country had no dedicated military cyber force, the Washington Post reported. “It’s our task to create them this year,” he told the Washington Post.

The effort to build a cyber military force is coming late in the game, Aushev acknowledged.

“We have an army inside our country,” said Yegor Aushev, co-founder of a cybersecurity company in Kyiv. “We need to know what they are doing.” On Wednesday, a newly discovered piece of destructive software was found circulating in Ukraine, hitting hundreds of computers, according to researchers at the cybersecurity firm ESET. Suspicion fell on Russia, which has repeatedly been accused of hacks against Ukraine and other countries.

The Biden administration announced sweeping export restrictions against Russia on Thursday, hammering its access to global exports of goods from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts.

Russia’s benchmark MOEX Russia Index closed 33 per cent lower in Moscow, the fifth-worst plunge in stock market history in local currency terms. It marked the first time since 1987’s Black Monday crash that a decline of that magnitude hit a market worth more than US$50 billion.

But it got much worse for their net worth after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. In less than 24 hours, they lost US$39 billion — more than they had up to that point this year.

Russia’s wealthiest individuals were already feeling the squeeze from escalating tensions between the nation and Ukraine.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin, when making threats about using nuclear weapons, needs to understand that NATO, too, is a nuclear alliance.

In a White House speech announcing the new controls, President Joe Biden said they would “impose severe costs on the Russian economy both immediately and over time,” noting that allies including 27 members of the European Union such as France, Germany and Italy, as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, had joined in the response to maximize its impact.

The controls, announced by the Commerce Department and first reported by Reuters, rely on a dramatic expansion of the so-called Foreign Direct Product Rule, forcing companies making high- and low-tech items overseas with U.S. tools to seek a license from the United States before shipping to Russia.

UN nuclear watchdog says it is appealing for maximum restraint in Ukraine to avoid any action that may put the country’s nuclear facilities at risk.

Separately, the deputy defence minister reported heavy Russian shelling was still underway in the eastern Donetsk region.

Ukraine’s Health Minister Oleh Lyashko said 57 people had been killed and 169 wounded on Thursday after Russia launched a full scale invasion of Ukraine.

“Yes, I think that Vladimir Putin must also understand that the Atlantic alliance is a nuclear alliance. That is all I will say about this,” Le Drian said on French television TF1.

Asked whether Putin’s threat of “such consequences that you have never encountered in your history” was tantamount to threatening to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, Le Drian said it was understood as such.

Who is responsible for the wiper is unclear, although suspicion immediately fell on Russia, which has repeatedly been accused of launching data-scrambling hacks against Ukraine and other countries. Russia has denied the allegations.

The company said on Twitter that the data wiping program had been installed on hundreds of machines in the country, an attack it said had likely been in the works for the past couple of months.

The United States believes that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is designed to debilitate Ukraine’s government and one of the three main axes of assault is directed at the capital Kyiv, a senior U.S. defence official said on Thursday.

“We want the biggest possible package, targeting industrial sectors, export controls, financials, maybe visa policy,” the diplomat said, adding that EU sanctions would target Russian oligarchs, especially those around President Vladimir Putin.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy said on Thursday Ukrainian forces were fighting to prevent Russian troops from capturing the former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl.

Russian forces fired missiles at several cities in Ukraine and landed troops on its coast on Thursday, officials and media said, after President Vladimir Putin authorized what he called a special military operation in the east.

“For more than 70 years, we have avoided large-scale war in Europe,” said U.S. senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “With his illegal invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has tragically brought decades of general peace to an end.

MOSCOW/KYIV — Russian forces fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities and landed troops on its south coast on Thursday, officials and media said, after President Vladimir Putin authorized what he called a special military operation in the east.

The assault came shortly after Putin declared on state television that Russia was beginning a military operation for the “demilitarization and denazification” of eastern Ukraine. He said that Russia did not intend to occupy the country. But explosions were occurring across a wide swath of Ukraine’s territory, not just near separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, suggesting that at least for now, Russia intended a far wider operation.

“Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.

“This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”

Flashes could be seen and explosions could be heard in Kyiv, a city of 3 million people, as a senior Ukrainian official said the city’s main airport was under assault. Explosions could also be heard in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, which lies just 12 miles from the border with Russia. A Ukrainian official also said the city of Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, was being shelled.

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” U.S. President Joe Biden said. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a military operation in eastern Ukraine on Thursday in what appeared to be the start of war in Europe over Russia’s demands for an end to NATO’s eastward expansion.

Shortly after Putin spoke in a special televised address on Russian state TV, explosions could be heard in the pre-dawn quiet of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Gunfire rattled near the capital’s main airport, the Interfax news agency said.

Explosions also rocked the breakaway eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk and civilian aircraft were warned away as the United States said a major attack by Russia on its neighbor was imminent.

Putin said he had authorized a special military operation in breakaway areas of eastern Ukraine and clashes between Russian and Ukrainian forces were only a matter of time.

Hours earlier, pro-Russian separatists issued a plea to Moscow for help to stop alleged Ukrainian aggression – claims the United States dismissed as Russian propaganda.

Putin said he had ordered Russian forces to protect the people and demanded Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.

“All responsibility for bloodshed will be on the conscience of the ruling regime in Ukraine,” Putin said.

A wholly unprovoked attack on a peaceful country 🇺🇦 is unfolding. Horrified. Just because you’ve prepared and thought about this possibility for weeks and months doesn’t mean it isn’t shocking when it actually happens. — Melinda Simmons (@MelSimmonsFCDO) February 24, 2022

He repeated his position that NATO expansion to include Ukraine was unacceptable and said Russia had been left with no choice but to defend itself against what he said were threats emanating from Ukraine.

The scope of the Russian military operation was not immediately clear. Moscow has long denied that it has plans to invade despite massing tens of thousands of troops near its neighbour.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy said on Wednesday that Moscow had approved an offensive and had not replied to an invitation for talks.

“Today I initiated a telephone conversation with the President of the Russian Federation. The result was silence,” he said.

U.S. President Joe Biden said his prayers were with the people of Ukraine “as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces.”

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.”

He said he would announce further sanctions on Russia on Thursday, in addition to financial measures imposed this week.

President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. https://t.co/Q7eUJ0CG3k — President Biden (@POTUS) February 24, 2022

The Russian operations began as the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on the Ukraine crisis in New York.

A draft resolution calling out Moscow over its actions toward its neighbor is doomed to fail due to Russia veto power, however a Security Council diplomat said it would put Russia on notice that it is “not in compliance with international law.”

Ukraine restricted civilian flights in its airspace due to “potential hazard,” hours after a conflict zone monitor warned airlines should stop overflights over the risk of an unintended shooting down or cyber attack.

An El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Toronto and a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Kyiv turned out of Ukraine’s airspace around the time a notice was issued, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24.

Russia also partially closed its airspace in the Rostov flight information region to the east of its border with Ukraine “in order to provide safety” for civil aviation flights, according to its notice to airmen.

Convoys of military equipment including nine tanks were seen moving towards Donetsk earlier on Wednesday from the direction of the Russian border, a Reuters witness reported.

Shelling has intensified since Monday when Putin recognized two separatist regions as independent and ordered the deployment of what he called peacekeepers, a move the West calls the start of an invasion.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke separately with her counterparts from Britain and Canada, while G7 leaders are also due to talk on Thursday.

Satellite imagery taken on Wednesday showed new deployments in western Russia, many of them within 10 miles (16 km) of the border with Ukraine and less than 50 miles from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, U.S. satellite company Maxar said.

The images showed field deployment, military convoys, artillery and armored personnel carriers with support equipment and troops. The images could not be independently verified by Reuters.

A 30-day state of emergency in Ukraine restricting the freedom of movement of conscripted reservists, curbing the media and imposing personal document checks, according to a draft text, begins on Thursday.

The Ukrainian government has also announced compulsory military service for all men of fighting age.

Western countries and Japan imposed sanctions on Russian banks and individuals but have held off their toughest measures until an invasion began.

The United States stepped up the pressure on Wednesday by imposing penalties on the Russian firm building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and its corporate officers.

Germany on Tuesday froze approvals for the pipeline, which has been built but was not yet in operation, amid concerns it could allow Moscow to weaponize energy supplies to Europe.

10:10 p.m.

Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a special military operation in Ukraine’s Donbass region in the early hours of Thursday morning and told the Ukrainian military to lay down its weapons and go home.

In a special televised address on Russian state TV, Putin said Russia has been left with no choice but to defend itself against what he said were threats emanating from modern Ukraine.

Putin also made an appeal to the Ukrainian military.

“I urge you to immediately lay down your weapons and go home. All servicemen of the Ukrainian army who fulfill this demand will be able to freely leave the combat zone and return to their families.”

The scope of the Russian military operation in Ukraine was not immediately clear. A Reuters reporter in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, heard explosions which sounded like artillery shelling in the distance soon after Putin had finished speaking.

Putin said Russia would respond instantly if any external force tried to interfere and that Moscow would try to de-militarize and ‘de-Nazify’ Ukraine.

“Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of modern Ukraine,” said Putin.

His comments come after the United States said Russia had stationed nearly 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders and after Russian-backed separatists appealed to him for military help against what they said was growing Ukrainian aggression.

Kyiv has denied any such aggression.

7:45 p.m.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expects Russia to invade Ukraine before the night is over but still sees a chance to “avert a major aggression,” told NBC News on Wednesday.

“Everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine,” Blinken told NBC, adding he could not be precise about time or place.

7:40 p.m.

United Nations Security Council members are preparing to put forward a draft resolution on Ukraine that will call out Russia over its actions toward its neighbor, said a Security Council diplomat, but the move is doomed to fail.

It will not be adopted by the 15-member council as Russia is a veto power – along with the United States, France, Britain and China – but it gives Washington and allies a chance to show that Moscow is internationally isolated over its actions on Ukraine.

“We work on the resolution in the Security Council. I hope we can move to action in the next hours or days, … and if we cannot succeed in the Security Council we’ll go right away to the General Assembly,” said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

5:20 p.m.

Satellite imagery taken on Wednesday showed a number of new deployments in western Russia, many of them within 10 miles of the border with Ukraine and less than 50 miles from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, a private U.S. company said.

The images shared with Reuters showed field deployment, military convoys, artillery and armored personnel carriers with support equipment and troops. The images released by Maxar Technologies, which has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces for weeks, could not be independently verified by Reuters.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Tuesday that Canada will deploy an additional 460 Canadian troops to help NATO in its standoff with Russia, including an artillery unit, a naval frigate and a surveillance aircraft.

It’s unclear what impact, if any, the deployment of additional forces to Europe will have on Canada’s other military commitments in Asia as well as the Middle East, where hundreds of Canadian troops continue to participate in the fight against the Islamic State.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military is as ready as it can be to launch what the United States believes could be a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with 80 per cent of troops assembled around Ukraine in attack positions, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday.

“He is as ready as he can be. We’ve been saying any day now and it’s certainly possible that today is that day,” the U.S. defence official said, without predicting an invasion would take place on Wednesday.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told representatives of the finance industry, regulators and trade associations on Wednesday he wanted the toughest possible next tranche of sanctions against Russia, a government source said.

Johnson met regulators and heads of top banks and financial sector industry groups to discuss the government’s approach to sanctions against Russia after Moscow heightened fears of a full-scale invasion by recognizing breakaway regions in Ukraine.

The government source said the prime minister told the meeting he wanted the “toughest possible next tranche” and that he thought it “will make a difference and change the outcome. Putin must fail.”

10:00 a.m.

Cyberattack on Ukraine government sites reported.

Several government websites as well as some banks faced a DDOS attack around 4 p.m. local time, the Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov said on social network Telegram.

The web pages of ministries including the Foreign Ministry and the Defence Ministry are either temporarily out of order or are not operating smoothly. The respective press offices acknowledged problems with the sites, but didn’t elaborate on the reason.

“We’ve not seen something [like this] that’s taken it to a completely different level,” an official told the BBC.

9:00 a.m.

President Vladimir Putin said that Russia was always open to diplomacy but put its own national security interests first and would continue to strengthen its military in the face of what he called a difficult international situation.

8:30 a.m.

7:12 a.m.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan left for Moscow on Wednesday to push for the construction of a long-delayed, multi-billion-dollar gas pipeline to be built in collaboration with Russian companies, an official said.

Khan’s trip to meet President Vladimir Putin and discuss issues including economic cooperation comes hours after a number of Western nations hit Russia with new sanctions for its military deployment into parts of eastern Ukraine.

“Both countries are eager to launch the project at the earliest,” Pakistan’s energy ministry spokesman told Reuters about the Pakistan Stream gas pipeline. He confirmed that Energy Minister Hammad Azhar is accompanying Khan on the visit.

7:00 a.m.

A Russian-backed leader in the breakaway Donetsk region of Ukraine said that a military mobilization was gathering pace to counter Ukrainian “aggression.”

Denis Pushilin, leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic that was recognized by Russia this week, said the situation had become critical but the separatists would win with support from “big Russia.”

Andrey Turchak, a senior member of Russia’s ruling party, said no force in the world could change the legal result of Russia’s recognition of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.

On a visit to Donetsk, Turchak told the separatist leader of the Russian-backed Donetsk People’s Republic that Russia would not abandon its people.

He said 93,000 people had already been evacuated over the border to Russia.

6:18 a.m.

The European Union’s member states have given their green light, via their envoys in Brussels, to a first package of sanctions on Russia, an EU diplomat said.

The sanctions still need formal approval by the foreign ministers.

The EU chose not to sanction Putin himself but instead blacklist all members of the lower house of the Russian parliament who voted in favour of the recognition of the breakaway regions, freezing any assets they have in the EU and banning them from traveling to the bloc.

Banks involved in financing separatist activities in eastern Ukraine will also be targeted and the two enclaves will be removed from a free-trade deal between the EU and Ukraine.

The impact of the new sanctions on banks and of limits on the Russian government’s ability to raise capital on the EU’s financial markets is likely to be limited.

Western governments for now are preferring to keep the much larger sanctions packages that they have planned in reserve should the crisis escalate.

6:00 a.m.

Ukraine will introduce a nationwide state of emergency in which special restrictions will apply in order to keep the country calm and protect its economy amid fears of a Russian invasion, a senior Ukrainian security official said.

The state of emergency will last for 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days, Oleksiy Danilov told a briefing. Parliament must now vote to enact the decision.

Introducing a state of emergency gives powers to the authorities, who can choose which ones to implement. These could include restrictions on transport, extra protection for critical infrastructure and a ban on strikes.

Regional authorities can make decisions on whether to introduce curfews and other measures, Danilov said.

“These are preventive measures to keep calm in the country, so that our economy and our country can work,” Danilov said.

“Depending on the threats that may arise in certain territories, there will be either a more strengthened or more weakened state of emergency. We are talking about border areas where we have a border with the Russian Federation, with Belarus,” he said.

5:00 a.m.

Ukraine’s parliament voted to approve in the first reading a draft law which gives permission to Ukrainians to carry firearms and act in self-defence.

“The adoption of this law is fully in the interests of the state and society,” the authors of the draft law said in a note, adding that the law was needed due to “existing threats and dangers for the citizens of Ukraine.”

Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov shared footage of an ammunition delivery from Canada arriving in Ukraine.

4:00 a.m.

Ukraine’s parliament on Wednesday approved imposing sanctions on 351 Russians, including lawmakers who supported the recognition of the independence of separatist-controlled territories and the use of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine.

The sanctions restrict almost all possible types of activities, in particular a ban on entry into Ukraine, prohibit access to assets, capital, property, licenses for business. The security council was due to impose the sanctions after the vote.

European Union governments expect to set a 1400 GMT Wednesday deadline for formal approval of a package of sanctions drawn up to punish Russia for its move on two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, a senior EU diplomat said.

3:00 a.m.

Ukraine has started conscripting reservists aged 18-60 following a decree by President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy, the armed forces said in a statement.

Ukraine’s foreign ministry warned Ukrainians not to visit Russia and urged its citizens already there to leave the country, in a travel advisory issued on Wednesday.

1:00 am

The Ukrainian military said on Wednesday one soldier had been killed and six wounded in shelling by pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine in the past 24 hours as ceasefire violations remain at a high level.

The military said on its Facebook page it had recorded 96 incidents of shelling by separatists over the past 24 hours compared with 84 a day earlier. It said separatist forces used heavy artillery, mortars and Grad rocket systems.

The mission of the International Monetary Fund is starting its work in Ukraine for the second review of the Fund-supported program, the global lender said on Wednesday.

Ukraine hopes that the continuation of cooperation with the IMF can reassure markets that have been rattled by tensions with Russia and that the talks will result in disbursement of US$700 million under its US$5 billion IMF program.

michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. As Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine enters its second day, the people of Ukraine are starting to come to terms with the reality that the unthinkable has actually happened. Today, my colleague Anton Troianovski explains the significance of this moment. And Sabrina Tavernise, Lynsea Garrison, and Michael Schwirtz speak to Ukrainians about the agonizing decisions that they now must make.

[music]

It’s Friday, February 25. Anton, we are talking to you on Thursday night in Moscow. We are coming to the end of day one of this invasion. Help us wrap our heads around what’s happening and the significance of what we’re all witnessing. Because even if we’ve been hearing warnings about this for weeks, it’s hard to believe that we’re now experiencing a full scale attack on Ukraine by Russia.

anton troianovski

Yeah. It is really hard to believe. It’s the biggest attack of one nation on another nation in Europe since World War II. It is really kind of the worst case scenario of all those scenarios of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine that have been discussed. It’s something that I’ve spent just about every day writing about this crisis for the last two months or so. And honestly, even until yesterday I didn’t think that this could actually happen. It’s Europe’s most powerful military, bearing, basically, its entire firepower, much of its firepower against the neighboring country. So since about 5:00 AM, we have seen cruise missile, ballistic missile strikes against infrastructure targets, military targets in Ukraine. Then during the day, today, we started seeing footage coming in of helicopter assaults, of paratroopers landing, of tanks rolling across the border. And this is happening from 3 sides, from the North, Belarus, from the East, Russia, from the South, from the Black Sea in Crimea. It started, what, like 18 hours ago or so, and it’s still very hard to just wrap our heads around the magnitude of what’s happening.

michael barbaro

And what do we understand to be the end goal here at this point?

anton troianovski

Well, Putin laid it out quite clearly in his early morning speech. He said, our goal is to demilitarize and de-Nazify, in his words, Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And just explain that because—

anton troianovski

Yeah.

michael barbaro

De-nazification is not a familiar phrase in 2022.

anton troianovski

Exactly. And I mean, I will say, until recently, it hasn’t been a familiar phrase in Russia either. But the Kremlin in their propaganda they consider the democratically elected government of Ukraine a Nazi regime. They claim falsely that it has perpetrated a genocide on Russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine. And so Putin is trying to claim the moral high ground here. He is saying he’s going in to remove this evil regime. And what that means is this is a full scale military assault to topple the government, most likely, of another country. This is just a massive undertaking that we’re only seeing the beginnings of.

michael barbaro

So we’re talking about a sovereign nation in Europe being attacked by another European nation. And its democratically elected leadership being, by what you just described, deposed. And these are developments that are unheard of in modern Europe. So how should we think about that?

anton troianovski

Yeah. I think it’s really the end of a certain post-Cold War order in Europe. It’s the end of 30 years of Russia trying to find a place in that kind of Western led order. It’s the end of 20 years of Putin trying to use diplomacy as well as his kind of hybrid warfare tactics to try to further his interests in Europe. That’s all gone now. We’re in a new reality now, where Russia is showing it is prepared to fight a large land war in Europe to achieve what it describes to be its aims. It’s just a totally different world that we’re in now.

michael barbaro

Well, so let’s talk about the consequences of that for all involved.

anton troianovski

Yeah. I mean, I would break it up into a few different parts, the consequences for Ukraine, for Russia, for Europe, and the U.S., and the rest of the world. So starting with Ukraine. This is just the beginning, I fear. If this continues, if this continues the way we think it’s going to, to Putin pursuing regime change, it could get much more bloody. So we don’t know yet what happens to the cities. There is a fight for territory going on in Eastern Ukraine, where those separatist regions are. But the big question is, will they go into Kyiv?

michael barbaro

Right.

anton troianovski

Very scarily, it looks like they may well.

michael barbaro

OK. So what about Russia, where you are based? What are the consequences you are seeing and expecting there?

anton troianovski

Well, so people are expecting a new crackdown on civil liberties, on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, even on business. The reason being that whenever we’ve had crackdowns here in Russia, the justification has always been that the Kremlin is hunting down internal enemies, who are serving some kind of foreign agenda to destabilize the country. So that’s certainly one thing to watch over the coming days and weeks is how much of an additional crackdown is there.

protesters [CHANTING]

anton troianovski

Tonight, we had pretty significant anti-war protests—

protesters [CHANTING]

anton troianovski

—in Moscow, and St. Petersburg, and in a number of cities in Siberia all told several thousand people were in the streets and there were more than 1,500 arrests. So—

michael barbaro

Wow.

anton troianovski

—one thing that’s very important to point out is, there has been next to no outpouring of support for this. And there is a lot of anger, disbelief, fear to see your country inflicting so much suffering on a neighboring country is awful, and this narrative for why it was necessary to do it. It really does fall apart quite quickly upon inspection. Why— How does Ukraine actually threaten Russia? Can it really be true that the Ukrainians were planning an invasion of these pro-Russian separatist areas in the East just as 150,000 plus troops were surrounding Ukraine on three sides? There’s just so much in the Kremlin propaganda narrative that doesn’t hold up, that I think a lot of people aren’t buying that story.

michael barbaro

OK. Finally, let’s talk about the consequences for the United States and for the rest of the world.

anton troianovski

So President Biden and the E.U. announced major sanctions today against Russia. And Russia has promised to respond potentially asymmetrically. So we might not see sanctions by Russia against the U.S., but we might see Russia take other actions that could cause harm and pain in the U.S. And they’re— We can really only speculate what that would be. Some folks are talking about the potential for cyber attacks here in Moscow. There’s been a lot of talk that Russia could base missiles or other military assets in Latin America, to more directly threaten the United States. Russia, obviously, is one of the world’s biggest energy suppliers, especially to Europe. If it were to turn that spigot, that could cause incredible problems for Europeans. So there is so much uncertainty here still, not just in Ukraine, not just in Russia, but really about how this crisis plays out and what it means for the rest of the world.

michael barbaro

And Anton, as you’re preparing to sign-off for the night, I want to return to Ukraine and where this situation leaves its people at this moment.

anton troianovski

I mean, it’s a horrible situation. These are people who— I think there was so little expectation that Russia could actually go ahead with this kind of invasion. And now they are making choices they would never thought they would have to make. Do they stay in Kyiv? Do they try to flee West? Do they try to get out of the country? Do you sleep in the basement? It’s really an unimaginable situation for millions and millions of people right now.

[music]

michael barbaro

Well, Anton, thank you. We’ll talk again soon. Stay safe.

anton troianovski

Thank you.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

All day yesterday, my colleagues in Ukraine and back in the U.S. we’re speaking with Ukrainians around the country about their experiences of the past 24 hours.

denis surkov

Hello.

lynsea garrison

Hi. How are you?

denis surkov

Hi, Lynsey. Not good.

lynsea garrison

Not good.

denis surkov

It’s not the same.

michael barbaro

Lynsea Garrison got on the phone with Denis Surkov, who lives in a city called Dnipro in Eastern Ukraine.

denis surkov

I am doctor, Chief of Dnipro Regional Children’s Hospital.

lynsea garrison

You’re a doctor at Dnipro Regional Children’s Hospital.

denis surkov

Yep.

lynsea garrison

OK.

denis surkov

And I am Chief of NICU and I.C.U.

lynsea garrison

Chief of NICU?

denis surkov

Exactly.

lynsea garrison

Got it. Can you just tell me a little bit about what the past 24 hours have been like for you?

denis surkov

So in the morning, we wake up and we have heard, first, rocket explosions near Dnipro Airport. So I was in my hospital. We were nervous. We were confused. Everybody was near their laptops or iPhones.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

And checked the news. And the news were and are dramatic.

lynsea garrison

Dramatic. How were you understanding this? Did you think that this would happen?

denis surkov

Honestly, no. We were expected for the beginning of the attack, but we didn’t know that it could be so, so fast, so right now. And now, the borders between Ukrainian regions are closed. We had some possibilities and some efforts to go last week.

lynsea garrison

OK.

denis surkov

I can’t explain, but something stopped us. We hoped that finally everything will resolve. But now, honestly, I don’t know exactly what to do.

lynsea garrison

What do you think stopped you?

denis surkov

My family didn’t want to leave Ukraine because we love Ukraine, and we wanted to live here happy and in peace, and so on. So I said, OK, maybe everything will be not so bad. Let’s wait. So my main question for myself is, if I made a very, very big mistake not to move from Ukraine when I had an opportunity to do this.

lynsea garrison

That’s a heavy question.

denis surkov

Yes. If there was a big mistake or not so big, and I have no answer. I can ask you, do you want to wake up in the morning and understand you should go forever, not for one day, not for two days, forever? Can you make such a decision in— I don’t know, in 10 minutes? My question to you.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

To bring just a bit of water, just a bit of food, single cloth, documents, money, and go outside your home forever, can you make such a decision? Just imagine.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

So this was my family feeling last week. Even though yesterday in the evening, I told to my wife that this is the last calm day we can evacuate. In the morning, we realized that war came to Ukraine, not conflict, not disturbs, war, conventional war.

lynsea garrison

What are your children asking you? Like, how are you talking about this with them?

denis surkov

I say to my children, everything will be OK, your father will care about you.

lynsea garrison

How old are they?

denis surkov

My elder daughter is 30 and she lives abroad. And my younger daughter, she is 14. She’s with me.

lynsea garrison

How is she doing?

denis surkov

She believed me.

lynsea garrison

That you’ll protect her? And how does that make you feel that she believes you?

denis surkov

I will do all I can to protect her. I don’t know exactly what, but I will do everything, everything can.

lynsea garrison

Are you worried it won’t be enough?

denis surkov

I am worried. Everything could be changed, I don’t know, next few hours or even next few maybe minutes.

[music]

It does feel ominous.

michael schwirtz Day one of the war it’s been a very long day. The town I’m in, Slovyansk, kind of continued on as normal. There were bits of panic that could be evident. There were lines at the A.T.M.s. And people were stocking up on medications. But overall, the mood was pretty calm and collected, probably because these people have been through this before, the town came under heavy attack in 2014 when Ukrainian forces clashed with Russian backed rebels who had come in from the East. And so when I’m walking around town, people are telling me that this is just part of their lives. Very few people I met around town today said that they had any intention of leaving even though rocket attacks hit an airport nearby and Russian forces were fighting with the Ukrainian military just a few dozen kilometers away. lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz I met a woman named Lera Alekseevna, who was in the courtyard near my hotel. Oh, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And she had stuffed her pet hairless cat in her jacket and it was shivering. lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And she was telling me how she was planning on going to work at a company that sells cash registers and bringing her animals with her, so that they wouldn’t have to be alone. So if she had to make a quick dash for it, she could be with her animals. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz But she said she had no intention of leaving, mostly out of fear that she would be forced to leave behind her pets. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Outside a blood bank in Slovyansk, I met a young man named Bogdan Kravchenko,

who was just sitting in his car listening to the Ukrainian national anthem cranked up on high volume.

bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He had just gone and donated blood. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And he said he wasn’t panicked, but he said that he was acting according to the situation and that things had only just begun. bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I walked up to a base of the National Guard Unit here in Slovyansk. And out front there were a few couples, men dressed in drab green uniforms, and women— all of them were being sent off. The men, they were all being sent off somewhere. Some of them said they couldn’t tell me where they were being sent. Some of them admitted that they didn’t even know. I met one couple, Yelena and Eugenia. Yelena had brought Eugenia, her husband, some clothes that he was going to take with him on his deployment wherever he was headed. Another couple just held each other for what seemed like 15, 20, 30 minutes, just held each other on the street in the sun ahead of whatever deployment this young man was being sent on. speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 12 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz You both [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And then, I met Lyubov Vasilyevna, a 75-year-old pensioner, she was carrying a bag filled with newly purchased loaves of bread. And she said she had spent her last bit of cash on. And was waiting in line at an A.T.M., it would appear that there was no cash left. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz All she wanted, she said, was to live in peace in her native Donbass, which is what this Eastern region is called. lyubov vasilavna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And then, she paused and recited a poem that she said she wrote 2 years ago. It was supposed to be evocative, the piece that she was looking for. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And I’ll read that poem that I translated from the Russian into English. I’m so looking forward to peace, but it is coming to us so slowly. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz We still have a little patience. Peace is close at hand, and we’re waiting for it to arrive without gunfire, without blood. Enough has been spilled in Donbass. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Let the sun smile, and the sky brighten, and the children smile. Let it go in a black moment. There will be peace for all. And people will say, god hurt us. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Let all stormy skies leave us. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Donbass [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And hail Donbass and the city of Slovyansk. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

sabrina tavernise It’s 11:30 AM on Friday in Kyiv. Last night, in the city there were a lot of airstrikes and it seems like they’re getting closer. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 13 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] sabrina tavernise [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

[music]

The airstrikes are beginning again. You can hear the siren. We’re trying to decide whether to leave. Our colleagues, a few of them drove out this morning because it’s really unclear what’s going to happen. Will there be a big fight with the Ukrainian military? Or will the Russians just come in? What will happen if they take the city? And it seems like that is imminent. So we’re trying to make arrangements. Our hotel doesn’t have a generator, which means we would be out of power if the power gets cut off in the city, which is a pretty good chance. Yeah. We’re trying to figure it out. I guess, like a lot of people here, we’re trying to make that decision. Should we leave or should we stay?

As of Friday afternoon in Kyiv, Ukrainian officials were bracing for an attack on the capital city as Russia’s military offenses pressed closer to the heart of the government.

In a televised address, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said that at least 137 Ukrainians, military and civilians, had already been killed. And he called on Ukrainians to defend themselves against Russian forces, saying that nobody else would come to their rescue.

Zelensky, who was unshaven and in a t-shirt said that he himself was now Russia’s number one target. Followed, he said, by his own family.

5,fa3a3c0d-abfe-4e37-89f3-e346c3d494c0,['Joseph Trevithick'],2022-02-24 23:01:58,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine is entering its second day with another massive barrage of strikes targeting Kyiv. There are unconfirmed reports that as many as 40 cruise and ballistic missiles have pounded the Ukrainian capital. It's not entirely clear what kinds of missiles may have been employed, but you can read more about the types that we know have been used in the conflict so far here.

You can find out more about what has transpired already in the past day or so from our previous rolling coverage of the conflict here. For the latest info, including the fire at the Russian airbase near the border with Ukraine, scroll to the bottom of the article.

There are conflicting reports about a major explosion that was seen in the sky over the Ukrainian capital. An advisor to the country's Interior Minister, Anton Herashchenko (Gerashchenko), reportedly said that Ukrainian air defenses had shot either an aircraft or a missile down. CNN, citing Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, has reported that it was a Ukrainian Su-27 Flanker fighter jet that was shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile. Right now we just can't say for certain and all of these reports could potentially be in error, either in part or in full.

There had been rumors that such an attack was coming and many of Kyiv's residents had already taken shelter in the city's subway stations, which are now serving as bomb shelters. Videos and pictures are already starting to emerge showing damage above ground to residential areas as a result of the strikes. It is only logical that Russia would have assessed the damage of its strikes from the night before and built up a new target list to re-attack certain targets as well as prosecute new ones.

Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had also defiantly refused to flee despite saying he is the Kremlin's number one target.

""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" Zelensky said in an earlier televised address from an undisclosed location in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, adding that he and his family were not leaving. ""We have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv.""

Zelensky also criticized NATO and its members for refusing to publicly say whether or not Ukraine would ever be admitted to the alliance. ""Everyone is afraid, does not answer,"" he said. ""And we are not afraid, we are not afraid of anything.""

On the battlefield, so far, Ukrainian forces appear to have had some success in frustrating Russian advances on multiple fronts. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has said that there are indications that Russia's military did not meet its Day 1 objectives despite having made non-insignificant territorial gains – including the capture of the now-defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The U.S. military has given its own assessment that the Ukrainians are very actively fighting back, as well.

After holding the line against ground assaults on multiple fronts, while also losing ground in other areas, earlier today, which followed barrages of air and missile strikes, as well as artillery fire, Ukrainian forces had already continued to fight into the night and are reported to have launched counter-attacks in some areas. In one particularly notable example, Ukrainian troops were reportedly able to retake Hostomel Airport near Kyiv, which currently hosts the only flying example of the An-225 Mriya, one of the world's largest aircraft, after a pitched back and forth battle with Russian paratroopers. Russia clearly saw this airfield as a critical staging location for operations near Kyiv. You can read more about this battle here.

Russian troops had still been able to make important gains, including in and around the site of the now-defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Satellite imagery taken earlier today shows that Russian forces, possibly in cooperation with the Belarusian counterparts, erected a pontoon bridge over the Pripyat River in Belarus in order to affect that movement south into Ukraine. Satellite images from earlier this month had shown a similar bridge spanning a section of the river in the same general location, highlighting this area as a potential vector for an advance as part of a larger Russian invasion.

Ukraine's state nuclear regulator has denied that there has been any worrisome damage to the facility, despite earlier reports of ""destruction"" that could have caused a radiation leak.

U.S. officials said earlier that they could not confirm or deny that Russia's troops had done anything besides move through the area, despite Ukrainian officials saying that personnel there had been detained by occupying forces. A subsequent U.K. Ministry of Defense statement said that it was likely that Russian forces were in control of the plant. That same statement said that Ukrainian forces were putting up significant resistance and had likely prevented the Russians from meeting their intended objectives on the first day of the invasion.

Ukraine has also issued an appeal to the country's ""hacker underground"" to help defend the country by launching cyberattacks against Russia. A statement purportedly from the Anonymous hacker collective said that the group is now ""officially in cyber war against the Russian government."" Anonymous has already claimed responsibility for the inaccessibility of the pseudo-Russian state media outlet RT's website.

All told this still very young conflict continues to evolve rapidly and it remains highly uncertain what direction it will take in the coming hours, let alone days.

We will continue to update this story as more information becomes available.

UPDATE: 1:10 AM EST—

After a brief lull, things are moving fast once again in terms of news coming out of Ukraine.

Russian forces emanating from Belarus are now streaming down toward Kiyv where heavy fighting is approaching the capital. Six hours ago, it was estimated that Russian forces were just around two dozen miles from the northern reaches of the capital. By the accounts we are seeing, much of that distance has already been covered. Clearly, this is extremely worrisome as it has been clear part of the goal of this entire operation is to neuter the sitting Ukrainian government and basically take control over the country's political apparatus. The seizure of the capital, whether block-by-block or via siege, would be a key part of such a plan.

There are also reports of an airborne assault far to the east of Kyiv, which could provide another vector of attack, basically opening up a western front:

In the south and the east the fight seems to be only picking up steam:

As it sits, this is the tally from yesterday, according to Lithuania's defense minister:

As for the aircraft that was shot down over Kyiv. The Ukraine Ministry of Defense says it was one of their own Su-27 flying a combat air patrol that was shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile. An Su-27 would make sense given the huge size of the fireball. Images from the crash scene appear to corroborate the MoD's statement:

The pilot was remarkably brave for flying in such heavily contested airspace with what was surely no real support and SAM activity nearby.

UPDATE: 2:13 AM EST—

Unconfirmed reports state that Ukraine launched a strike on Russia's Millerovo Air Base not far from the Ukrainian border.

Millerovo is home to the 31st Fighter Aviation Regiment. Formerly a MiG-29 operator, it has upgraded to the Su-30SM, with a total of 24 aircraft divided between two squadrons. Located less than 20 miles from the Ukrainian border, this base was involved in the fighting in Donbas in 2014.

There does look to be the tail of an Su-30 visible in the frame near the flames. There are claims that an OTR-21 Tochka (SS-21 Scarab) tactical ballistic missile was used in the strike or possibly a TB2 drone. Ukraine has a small inventory of the Soviet-era missiles. While they are not extremely accurate, they can deliver a relatively large payload over up to around 110 miles, depending on the variant. It's also possible that some other circumstances are at work here that do not include an aerial strike by Ukraine. Hopefully, some additional info will clear up exactly what happened.

6,fa3a3c0d-abfe-4e37-89f3-e346c3d494c0,[],,"US President Joe Biden will nominate federal appeals court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, according to a person familiar with the matter, making her the first Black woman selected to serve on a court that once declared her race unworthy of citizenship and endorsed segregation.

In Jackson, Biden delivers on a campaign promise to make the historic appointment and to further diversify a court that was made up entirely of white men for almost two centuries. He has chosen an attorney who would be the high court’s first former public defender, though she also possesses the elite legal background of other justices.

Jackson would be the current court’s second Black justice — Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, is the other — and just the third in history.

The news was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it before the president’s official announcement later today.

She would also be only the sixth woman to serve on the court, and her confirmation would mean that for the first time four women would sit together on the nine-member court.

The current court includes three women, one of whom is the court’s first Latina, Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Jackson would join the liberal minority of a conservative-dominated court that is weighing cutbacks to abortion rights and will be considering ending affirmative action in college admissions and restricting voting rights efforts to increase minority representation.

Biden is filling the seat that will be vacated by Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, who is retiring at the end of the term this summer.

Jackson, 51, once worked as one of Breyer’s law clerks early in her legal career. She attended Harvard as an undergraduate and for law school, and served on the US Sentencing Commission, the agency that develops federal sentencing policy, before becoming a federal judge in 2013.

Her nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority by a razor-thin 50-50 margin with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaker. Party leaders have promised swift but deliberate consideration of the president’s nominee.

The next justice will replace one of the more liberal justices, so she would not tip the balance of the court, which now leans 6-3 in favor of conservatives.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-february-25-2022/
