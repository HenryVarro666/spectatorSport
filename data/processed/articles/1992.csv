The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, in southern Ukraine, has posted photographs of a long Ukrainian flag draped down the wall of the city hall.

Russian forces are normally stationed at the city hall but don't appear to have intervened.

There have been several protests by Ukrainian civilians in the square where the building is located since Russian forces moved into Kherson.

The photographs show workers on a crane mounting the new flag.

""On the night when the city council was shelled, the wire which held our national flag was damaged. And the flag itself should have been replaced a long time ago -- it had faded and frayed,"" Kolykhaiev said in a Facebook post.

""Today we found a way to replace it. Have a nice day, my Hero City,"" Kolykhaiev added.

Kherson, a key port city on the Black Sea, in southern Ukraine, was overrun by Russian forces on March 2, after days of heavy bombardment and shelling.

People living in Kherson have described days of terror confined to their apartments and houses, fearful to go outside for even basic necessities -- their city now a dystopian shell of the home they knew and loved.

‚ÄúOn the night when the city council was shot, the rope on which our state flag was held broke. Yes, it was time to replace the flag itself - it burned and burned,‚Äù wrote the mayor of the city, Igor Kolykhaev, on his Facebook account.

‚ÄúIt wasn't good like that. Today we had the opportunity to hang a new one. Have a nice day my hero city! ‚Äù, he wrote.

Russian troops have made progress in smaller cities and close to the borders. But even in them, they have not been able to establish total domination.

Kherson is on the verge of humanitarian catastrophe, denounced the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry.

‚ÄúThe humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly. The city critically lacks food and medical supplies due to the siege. Newborns, who lack nutrition and child hygiene products, and critically ill patients constitute the population at special risk,‚Äù the ministry said in a statement.

He claims that ‚ÄúRussian invaders retaliate against the residents of the city‚Äù and recalls that on Monday they opened fire on peaceful protesters in Freedom Square, injuring an elderly man.

The ministry adds that ‚Äúaround one hundred international students, mainly from African countries, are currently in Kherson.‚Äù

‚ÄúDespite the efforts of the Government of Ukraine and international humanitarian organizations, the Russian Federation continues to refuse to create a humanitarian corridor for the evacuation of civilians and the delivery of food. The city is approaching a humanitarian catastrophe every day that passes,‚Äù the statement said.

The city, with nearly 300,000 inhabitants, is located next to the Dnieper River and on the shores of the Black Sea, and is a strategic point in the Russian offensive launched on 24 February, due to its proximity to Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.

Markian Lubkivskyi, an adviser to the Ukrainian defense minister tells the BBC: ‚ÄúI believe that today the city will be fully under the control of Ukrainian armed forces.

‚ÄúWe have finished in the last two days the operation in the Kyiv region so other armed forces are now focused on the southern part trying to get free Kherson and some other Ukrainian cities,‚Äù he says, according to Sky News.

I was in the city centre yesterday and saw it. Our mayor is also in the city.

‚ÄúThe risk is still there. At a peaceful rally, Russian soldiers wounded several Kherson residents a few days ago. And some were taken prisoner. A few days ago they took the director of the theatre prisoner, but they released him yesterday, he is fine. There are many people in the city despite the risk.‚Äù

She prays that life for her fellow residents will soon return to normal.

‚ÄúIt is not known what will happen tomorrow. I know one thing for sure, we are for peace, we want to live in our native Ukrainian city and we believe in our army and president.

‚ÄúI feel hope. Faith and hope are the best feelings that bring us closer to victory. I will feel pride, joy and freedom if Ukraine wins back Kherson. I will cry of happiness all day long.‚Äù

‚ÄòMore people are returning‚Äô

Like everyone else in the city, Viacheslav, a 27-year-old events manager, is looking forward to that moment of liberation, when victory is assured.

‚ÄúWe always knew Ukraine would get back control of Kherson. We just waited for them to come. Because Kherson is a Ukrainian city and always will be and nobody wants to join Russia. Russian soldiers come here like terrorists. Every one of our citizens wants to return to the old life, like one month ago,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe will help each other to return to normal life. We will help our army. We want to be with Ukraine. Everybody wants to come to visit relatives from another city. We will celebrate. It will be the main day of Ukrainian history, when we win in this cruel war.‚Äù

The war is far from won. Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine, has been effectively surrounded and continues to endure constant shelling designed to bomb the city into submission, with water rationed, food supplies running low and bodies lying unburied in the streets.

But even in Kharkiv, where residents have endured some of the worst devastation of the war outside of Mariupol, people are trying to go about their normal lives with growing confidence.

‚ÄúYou get used to the war pretty fast,‚Äù Glib Mazepa, a biology PhD student from the city, told the BBC. ‚ÄúPeople have been coming back to their flats. More people are coming back from other places, maybe a cottage in the countryside where they were hiding for several weeks, and they‚Äôve decided to come back to their flats in the city. More people are returning. This is a clear sign.‚Äù

There is still intense danger in districts closer to the edge of Kharkiv. In one incident, people queuing for humanitarian aid on Friday were shelled, with several thought to have been injured, and shelling continues on an hourly basis.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/03/26/ukraine-set-seize-back-strategic-port-city-kherson/

But as people continue to disappear, Russians open fire on protesters and medicines run low, two female journalists, whose identities we are protecting, say the people of Kherson are coming under increasing strain.

Monday 21 March

‚Äú21st, night, Monday ‚Ä¶‚Äù This is the first line of Anna Akhmatova‚Äôs poem. We all know Russian literature very well. But now we cannot admire it. Russian culture cancellation is not just a trend, but a sincere feeling of rejection of everything Russian.

In the morning we are in a good mood, welcoming spring at last. There are about 100 people at the rally. We chat with friends, admitting we don‚Äôt really want to run away when we stand like this, together, among brave citizens ‚Ä¶ We are told we can buy wine nearby. Exactly five minutes after that, the shooting and explosions start, the siren sounds ‚Ä¶ We know we have to run straight to the museum ‚Äì the closest place to hide.

The occupiers threw light and tear grenades at the people and started firing. An old man was wounded in his legs, bleeding heavily. The rest were beaten with rifle butts and boots, and three protesters were detained. We are very scared, but not ready to give up so easily yet.

Journalist Oleg Baturin is with us again. Again he writes bold critical posts on social media. We promise to meet each other after the war.

He said he spent more than a week in Russian captivity. Even though he omitted the more terrifying details, it was scary. It‚Äôs good that he had a thick, warm jacket ‚Äì it softened the blows. They were interested in who organised the rallies in Kherson.

The fate of many of the abductees is still unknown. Many village heads and mayors of small towns who refused to cooperate with the occupiers were arrested. It‚Äôs especially hard for the ATO members ‚Äì they are subjected to brutal beatings. Russians say they will spare no one.

At night, for the seventh time, our army hit Russian military hardware in Chernobaevka. The whole world is laughing ‚Äì with what persistence Russians get there in order to lose everything.

Tuesday 22 March

Gritting our teeth, we went to protest. Unfortunately, we forgot the water. We stood for literally 10 minutes when the shooting started and teargas reached us. The scarf did little to help, we swallowed smoke; tears flowed.

But when the next grenade fell right at my feet ‚Äì cinematically spinning, I made a jump worthy of a world champion of high jump. I successfully landed next to the office door and a strong guy pulled me inside. I came to my senses, cleared my throat, and decided to rush outside, striving to be back, but my eyes burned badly, so I listened from a distance as the daredevils returned and continued to send Russians to hell. Grenades flew around for a long time.

The Russians defiantly and brutally beat those who were leaving the rally, detaining several men. People decided not to protest openly in the main square.

The deputy of Kherson regional council, Sergei Khlan, wrote on his Facebook account that the invaders plan to introduce their currency, roubles, into circulation in the territory of the temporarily occupied Kherson region from April.

Russian soldiers continue to loot. They robbed another store on the outskirts of Kherson at night.

Children are born in Kherson. The whole city donated to buy a stroller for a newly born little Kherson citizen. But because of the blockade, the city lacks baby food.

Wednesday 23 March

Today a director of a local theatre, city deputy and opinion maker, Alexander Kniga, was kidnapped. According to his family, at 7am, nine cars drove up to their house and took him away in an unknown direction. Closer to 10pm, Alexander was returned home. He is all right. He said they demanded he name the organisers of the rallies. The Russians cannot believe that the people of Kherson themselves go to Freedom Square to express their wish to remain Ukrainian.

Today only about 50 people came to the rally. The Russian Guard attacked protesters with batons.

They try to apply a combination of sticks and carrots. In Chernobaevka, the Russians tried to distribute their humanitarian aid. No one got tempted. They left the aid in the village. The locals burned it down. Mighty people!

On the website of Kherson City Hall, you can apply to search for the missing.

Thursday 24 March

Exactly a month ago, at 5am, we were informed that the war had begun. Since 1 March, Kherson has been occupied and time has stopped here.

A new state flag of Ukraine was hung out at the Kherson City Hall today. The old one suffered in battles ‚Äì the cable on which it was attached was broke, and the flag itself burned out and frayed.

The whole country shares memories of the first day of the war. I have a personal story: on the first day of the war, my son, a doctor, returned heartbroken from the hospital, where they tried to save the lives of our soldiers who fell under the shells. ‚ÄúMum, they are torn to shreds, they shouted so loudly ‚Ä¶‚Äù You can‚Äôt get used to the horrors of war.

People are leaving the villages that are completely looted. Before that, they release cows and goats so that the cattle will not die on their leads. At home, farmers leave jars with jam and a note in Russian for invaders: ‚ÄúGuess where the poison is?‚Äù Occupiers continue to search and loot activists‚Äô homes.

At 5pm I am slowly walking home and see that a Z-car is driving along. I slow down even more ‚Äì and it slows down, too. It‚Äôs tinted glass, so I don‚Äôt see who‚Äôs having fun there, but this game of nerves triggers adrenaline and we move at that pace for another five minutes until I turn the corner ‚Ä¶ They could abduct me easily.

Friday 25 March

I left the house and immediately came across the Russian Guard. I walked in the opposite direction, feeling their gaze on my back.

We listened to our news on the radio and suddenly Ukrainian broadcasting disappeared and was completely replaced by Russian.

From April, they want to start teaching the Russian syllabus in schools. They are going to remove Ukrainian fiction and historical literature from libraries. Let‚Äôs see how this experiment ends.

Finally, it became clear how people manage to get out of the siege. It‚Äôs just a matter of money. Departure price is $800 to $1,500. There is a Telegram channel where people discuss the details of the deal, share stories of checkpoints, expose fraudsters who take money and disappear. There are secret trails and guides.

Those who decide to leave on their own are at great risk. It‚Äôs a roulette wheel. A friend dared to leave. Her route was Kherson-Stanislav-Aleksandrovka-Nikolaev-Odesa-Moldova (Chisinau).

The humanitarian disaster continues. According to volunteers, we have more deaths from lack of medication than from bullets.

Saturday 26 March

Kherson residents whose houses were hit by shelling will be supplied with new windows at the expense of the city.

The UN promises to agree on the opening of a humanitarian corridor to Kherson on 26 March to bring in medicines and food.
