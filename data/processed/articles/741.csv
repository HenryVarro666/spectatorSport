According to OSW experts, the Ukrainian army is not able to relieve the besieged Mariupol.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine are able to inflict painful losses on the aggressor, but have not yet been able to regain the operational initiative, and their successes are temporary and short-lived, write the authors of the analysis: Andrzej Wilk, Piotr Żochowski and Sławomir Matuszak. Considering the fact that the Russian army started to systematically destroy the enemy’s base (as opposed to the situation in the first week of the war) without any significant support, it can be assumed that the resistance put up by Ukrainian units will be less and less effective, experts predict.

OSW: the significant losses suffered by the aggressor do not turn out to be so severe that he loses the initiative

In their opinion, the continuation of the defense of the besieged cities, in the first place of Mariupol, remains an open question.

- Advertisement - The Ukrainian army – according to OSW – is not able to carry out an effective unblocking operation (in both directions north of Mariupol, Donetsk and Zaporizhia, the forces of the defenders are on the defensive) or support the besieged with supplies of weapons and supplies. The significant losses suffered by the aggressor do not turn out to be so severe that he loses the initiative and withdraws from offensive actions (the only exception is the stabilized situation in the vicinity of Kiev for a long time), analysts say.

The Ukrainian side is afraid of an attack on Kyiv, Poltava, and also from the territory of Belarus to Volyn. The information that the Belarusian ambassador and 10 diplomats left the territory of Ukraine is noteworthy.

In the Polesie and Siewier defense lines, both sides maintained their previous positions, and fights and shelling in the vicinity of Kiev took place sporadically. The aggressor continued the engineering expansion and strengthening of the grouping based on the villages located 20–30 km to the west and north (mainly in the Buczański region) and 30–60 km to the east (in the brewery region) from the center of the capital. Russian forces are to strengthen, inter alia, in Irpien.

On the left bank of the Dnieper, the enemy troops gathered in a wedge with a blade at the height of Zalissy and Bohdanivka, less than 10 kilometers from the north-eastern border of Kiev.
