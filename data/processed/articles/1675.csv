Estonia and Romania on Saturday banned Russian airlines from their airspace after the U.K., Poland, Moldova, and the Czech Republic did the same.

Romania's foreign minister Bogdan Aurescu tweeted Saturday morning that the country ""just joined other EU member states in banning (Russian) airlines from our airspace."" Aurescu went on to say Romania encourages all partners and allies ""to take such action, as we stay resolute in our support for #UkraineUnderAttack.""

Kaja Kallas, Estonian Foreign Minister, echoed similar sentiments, stating there's""no place for planes of the aggressor state in democratic skies.""

After Russia attacked Ukraine on Thursday, United Kingdom officials issued a ban restricting Russian-owned airlines from the country's airspace.

""This means that Aeroflot will not be permitted to operate flights to or from the United Kingdom until further notice,"" the UK Civil Aviation Authority said in a Feb. 24 announcement.

In response, Russian officials decided to bar any aircraft owned, leased, or operated by individuals associated with the UK from its airspace, as Insider reported.

Additionally, as Aljazeera reported, Russia also placed the ban on other European countries, including Poland, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, aviation officials said Saturday.

GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger has called on the US to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine to aid in their fight against Russia, according to Yahoo News.

""The fate of #Ukraine is being decided tonight, but also the fate of the west. Declare a #NoFlyZone over Ukraine at the invitation of their sovereign govt,"" Kinzinger tweeted Friday. ""Disrupt Russia's air ops to give the heroic Ukrainians a fair fight. It's now, or later.""

When asked Saturday if the US has given any consideration to Ukraine's call for a no-fly zone, spokesperson for the US Department of State Ned Price responded, ""We are in regular dialogue with our Ukrainian partners. We are looking at a range of ways we can continue to support them.""",https://www.insider.com/estonia-romania-banned-russia-from-airspace-officials-2022-2

“Romania has started the procedures for suspending the right to fly over its territory, as well as the right to land on Romanian territory for aircraft belonging to companies from the Russian Federation “, said the Government spokesman, Dan Cărbunaru, after the meeting of the Task Force for the management of the situation generated by the Russian military aggression in Ukraine.

In retort, Russia has just announced a similar measure, to close its airspace for all aircraft operated by companies from Bulgaria, Poland and Czechia. Regarding Romania, there is no such decision yet.

At the same time, the Romanian Gov’t spokesperson announced that Romania will leave the International Investment Bank in which it is a partner with Russia and several other countries.

“Romania is about to start the procedures for withdrawing from the International Investment Bank (IIB),” Cărbunaru said, after announcing that Romania is also closing its airspace for Russian aircraft.

5,56a0903f-d522-4c62-aba7-acf92ab01e08,['Joanna Partridge'],2022-02-27 00:00:00,"Russian airlines are facing an almost complete blockade from flying west over Europe after they were barred from the airspace of nearly 30 countries following the invasion of Ukraine.

On Sunday evening the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the whole bloc would close its airspace to Russian aircraft.

Hours earlier, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, Spain, Norway and Finland had joined the long list of states across the continent that have imposed national bans on Russian aircraft flying overhead.

The UK, Ireland, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia had already taken the step to close their airspace to Russian planes, severely limiting Russia’s options for flying west.

Lithuanian airspace usually provides Russia with the shortest flight to its Kaliningrad exclave – a small parcel of land next to the Baltic Sea between Lithuania and Poland – which has no common border with Russia.

The route of flight SU2500, operated by the Russian national airline, Aeroflot, from Moscow to Madrid on Sunday morning illustrated the changes to flight routing already necessary before Sunday’s wave of bans were announced.

The flight tracker website FlightRadar24 showed the Airbus A321 jet flew north-west across Russia to the Baltic Sea, which it crossed to reach Germany’s northern coast, before travelling across Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and finally Spain.

FlightRadar24 showed that an Aeroflot flight travelling on Sunday from Moscow to Athens took a similar route before dipping south, skirting the coast of Italy before finally reaching the Greek capital. A more much direct journey would have taken an aircraft over Ukraine and the Black Sea.

This is the ridiculous route an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Madrid now has to take. Once the German ban comes into force it will be even worse. And that's an A321, spare parts for which can't be exported to Russia. I wouldn't want to fly on it. pic.twitter.com/s5ttjFvWYk — Andy Netherwood (@AndyNetherwood) February 27, 2022

The airspace closures are redrawing the route map for Russian jets, resulting in longer journeys, which use significantly more fuel and cost more for the airlines to operate, at a time when Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed oil prices higher. The situation will become far more challenging for Russia now that the EU has closed its airspace, almost completely blocking most flightpaths to the west.

The German flag carrier, Lufthansa, had already cancelled all of its flights to Russia for the coming week.

Russia has banned all British aircraft from landing in the country in retaliation over Boris Johnson’s decision to ban Aeroflot from landing in the UK.

“The immediate impact is on flights between Russia and other countries around Europe, the bigger issue is whether Russian airspace is closed off,” said the aviation consultant John Strickland, of JLS Consulting. “This would have an impact on other countries’ airlines, from the UK and EU states, who would ordinarily use Russian airspace to fly to many destinations in Asia. That means more indirect routings and flying for significantly longer.”

He added: “We don’t know how long this might last for. Airline management teams will be racking their brains right now and thinking about contingency plans.”

The measures come just as international air travel is beginning to return following the pandemic, although there are fewer passenger flights between Europe and Asia, as many countries, such as China and Japan, remain mostly closed to foreign visitors. However, the route changes are also expected to affect the transport of cargo.

Sections of international airspace have been closed off in recent years – including during the Gulf war and when US airspace was shut in the days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 – but rarely have so many countries banned another from their airspace.

Parts of Ukrainian airspace were avoided by international airlines from July 2014, after Malaysia Airlines MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down, leading to the deaths of all 298 people onboard. International investigators say the Boeing 777 was brought down by a Russian-made missile fired from territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia rebels, but Moscow has denied involvement.

If Russia decided to shut out international flights from its airspace, the move would have a significant impact on the country’s finances. “Russia makes a lot of foreign exchange for charging for overflight rights, the use of airspace and navigation, and it is a substantial amount,” Strickland said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/germany-and-italy-are-latest-to-ban-russian-aircraft-from-airspace

Russia has reportedly prohibited airlines from 36 countries, including 27 EU nations, as a response to sanctions imposed on the country for the Ukraine invasion.

The move comes soon after Europe, Canada and the UK shut their airspace for Russian airlines.

Names of some of the banned nations were announced by the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency Rosaviatsiya.

Rosaviatsiya said that countries including Albania, Anguilla, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Jersey, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Malta are part of the banned countries list.

The list also includes countries such as the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.

By imposing a ban on using Russian airspace, airlines will have to take a new path for carrying passengers from Europe to Asia.

However, Rosaviatsia noted that flights will be allowed to use the Russian airspace only during special circumstances and must obtain the approval of the Russian aviation authority or foreign ministry.

Last month, the Russian aviation authority banned UK airlines from landing at its airports and crossing its airspace.

The move was made after the UK banned Russian flag carrier Aeroflot from landing in the country.

BBC quoted Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia as stating: “This measure was taken in accordance with the provisions of the Intergovernmental Air Services Agreement between Russia and the UK as a response to unfriendly decisions by the UK aviation authorities regarding the restriction on regular flights of aircraft owned, leased or operated by a person associated with Russia or registered in Russia.”",https://www.airport-technology.com/news/russia-shuts-airspace/
7,56a0903f-d522-4c62-aba7-acf92ab01e08,[],2022-03-09 13:10:24+00:00,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered dozens of overflight bans that have taken international aviation decades backwards.

These are the key effects.

Who’s banned from Russian airspace?

According to Rosaviatsiya, Russia’s Federal Agency for Air Transport, airlines from all 27 members of the European Union plus the UK, Albania, Canada, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland are banned from flying to, from and over the biggest country in the world.

(The order also covers British Overseas Territories including Anguilla, Gibraltar and the British Virgin Islands, but these are irrelevant since their airlines do not use Russian airspace.)

Other carriers, such as Japan Airlines, have voluntarily decided to avoid Russian airspace.

In addition, Ukraine’s airspace is closed to civilian traffic.

What is the main effect?

Links between the four main western European hubs – London, Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt – and east Asia are blocked from their obvious and most direct flight paths. The “keep out” sign over the world’s biggest country particularly affects flights from western Europe to Tokyo.

Russia’s state-owned news agency, Tass, says that on 25 February, UK air carriers planned to carry out 70 flights in Russia’s airspace, as well as two London-Moscow flights operated by British Airways.

Japan Airlines’ daily service is now flying from London to the Japanese capital via Iceland, Greenland, Canada and Alaska, effectively reinventing the Polar Route between Europe and Tokyo.

Links from Paris and Frankfurt to the Japanese capital are currently suspended.

But Korean Air is continuing to fly over Russian airspace between London and Seoul.

The impact would be far greater if the Covid-19 pandemic had not effectively closed down most flights between western Europe and the key Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The most direct flight between London and Beijing spends many hours overflying Russia, while about half the journey time of the former Cathay Pacific link between Manchester and Hong Kong was spent in Russian airspace.

Who is worst affected?

Finnair, which has built its entire operation on a Helsinki hub perfectly placed between western Europe and East Asia, flying over Russia, is now in a tricky position.

The Finnish airline resumes flying from Helsinki to Tokyo Narita four times a week today, but with the normal nine-hour flight time almost 40 per cent longer at 12 hours 30 minutes.

Ole Orvér, Finnair’s chief commercial officer, said: “Japan is one of our most important markets, and we want to continue offering safe and reliable connections between Helsinki and Tokyo.”

Ahead of the relaunch, Robert Boyle, former director of strategy for the airline combine IAG, wrote: “The geographic position of Helsinki has allowed Finnair to operate highly efficient aircraft schedules to northeast Asia.

“A daily flight [from Helsinki to Tokyo and back] uses just one aircraft. Adding three hours to the journey time each way to avoid Russia would destroy that. Very loosely, they would need twice as many aircraft to operate the same number of flights.”

Finnair continues to fly to Bangkok, Delhi, Phuket and Singapore, but with much longer flightpaths.

Mr Boyle believes Asian carriers “are the main beneficiaries of overflight restrictions on European carriers”.

While British Airways, Air France/KLM and Lufthansa cannot cross Russian airspace en route to south and southeast Asia – including key destinations including Delhi, Bangkok and Singapore – they are only seeing flights times increase by only 10 per cent or so.

Which way are they flying?

A good example is the flightpath of British Airways BA118 from Bengaluru in India to London Heathrow, which the captain has tweeted.

Going places: the flightpath of British Airways 118 from Bengaluru to London Heathrow (British Airways)

The most direct route would overfly Ukraine. With airspace closed, an alternative track would be to go further north over Russia.

Instead, the current route heads west to the Gulf, over much of Iraq and northern Turkey, clipping the southwest corner of the Black Sea. This is popular flight path, with Iraqi airspace now regarded as safe.

What is happening to Russian airlines?

They are banned from the UK, the European Union and many other nations. On Tuesday evening, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, tweeted: “I have made it a criminal offence for ANY Russian aircraft to enter UK airspace and now HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] can detain these jets.

“We will suffocate Putin’s cronies’ ability to continue living as normal while thousands of innocent people die.”

In practice, Russian airlines are already limiting their operations to domestic and Belarus links. This is because so many aircraft are leased from Western firms, and there are concerns that they would be impounded if they were to land at a foreign airport.

Are there any flights in and out of Russia? Yes. Looking at Wednesday’s operations from the nation’s three biggest airports (by 2019 passenger numbers), these are the options:

Moscow Sheremetyevo

Abu Dhabi (UAE) on Etihad

Antalya (Turkey) on Nordwind and Pegasus

Istanbul (Turkey) on Nordwind

Belgrade (Serbia) on Air Serbia

Delhi (India) on Air India

Doha (Qatar) on Qatar Airways

Moscow Domodedovo

Baghdad (Iraq) on Red Wings

Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) on Avia

Baku (Azerbaijan) on Azerbaijan Airlines

Casablanca (Morocco) on Royal Air Maroc

Dubai (UAE) on Emirates

Minsk (Belarus) on Belavia

Nur-Sultan (Kazakhstan) on Air Astana

Samarkand (Uzbekistan) on Red Wings

Sharjah (UAE) on Air Arabia

St Petersburg

Belgrade (Serbia) on Air Serbia

Doha (Qatar) on Qatar Airways

Istanbul (Turkey) on Turkish Airlines

Minsk (Belarus) on Belavia

Do the flight bans have ripple effects in other regions?

Marginally. On journeys such as New York-Delhi, a natural choice for American travellers would be to connect in a western European hub such as Heathrow, Amsterdam, Paris or Frankfurt.

But the speed advantage of connecting in western Europe has been lost, making Turkish Airlines and the Gulf-based airlines relatively more appealing.

Will air fares rise?

Yes – partly because of the soaring price of oil, partly by the extended routes. Just as aviation was finally opening up post-Covid, the horrific situation in Ukraine has triggered a near-doubling in the price of oil within 10 weeks.

While some airlines are protected to some extent by “hedging” - effectively financial insurance against price surges in the oil market - lots have given up the practice because it is expensive.

Adding three or four hours to the flying time between London or Helsinki and Tokyo is also extremely costly, and means that aircraft utilisation is poor.

However, the financial hit from having to avoid Russian airspace is not so great, because the country’s airspace charges are so high in normal times.

The precise arrangements are a closely guarded secret, but using available published data it appears there is a special payment to Aeroflot – under the terms of an agreement signed in the days of the USSR, when Aeroflot was a national airline.

The Independent calculates that the payment is around £5,000 per flight, in addition to standard overflight charges of around £6,000 for a five-hour journey above Russia on a full wide-bodied plane. The overflight charge works out at around £37 per passenger.

This represents almost eight times as much as flying the same distance over American territory.

On a typical £500 return flight between London and Bangkok the “toll” works out at 15 per cent of the total fare.

Optimists hope that once peace returns, Moscow will be in a weaker position for demanding what is effectively an extremely expensive toll – because the world’s airlines will have seen they can do without Russia.",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/airspace-ban-travel-disruption-flights-b2031833.html

Thirty-three countries blocked Russian flights from their airspace following President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, as of Wednesday.

All 27 EU countries, as well as Albania, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, the UK, and the US, imposed the ban after Russian forces invaded Ukraine. The ban is shared by some of the world's most powerful nations, including most members of NATO.

President Joe Biden signaled that the US would be the latest to close its airspace to Russia in Tuesday's State of the Union address, saying Putin has ""no idea what's coming.""

With the flight ban, most countries provide exceptions for diplomatic or humanitarian reasons, but otherwise the step significantly limits the global movement of planes owned or chartered by Russian — including those of Russian oligarchs.

A map showing the US, EU, Canada and other countries that have banned Russian planes from their airspace. Insider/Mapchart.net

The move is distinct from enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine itself, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pleaded with NATO for.

The bloc is reluctant to close Ukraine's sky, as it risks a major escalation if Putin were to defy the ban — forcing NATO into military retaliation.

Putin responded to the flight bans on Monday by closing Russian airspace to 36 countries, according to Deutsche Welle.

The airspace bans come as part of a major sanctions effort, which includes, variously, limiting Russian banks' access to SWIFT international transaction system, the freezing of Russian assets, and the targeting of oligarchs. These are starting to bite as Putin's invasion continued apace, causing the rouble to tumble to a record low on Monday.

Switzerland's joining in with the airspace ban on Monday — along with the EU's sanctions — came as a surprise, ending the country's historically neutral status in times of conflict.",https://www.businessinsider.com/map-shows-countries-that-closed-airspace-russia-over-ukraine-war-2022-3

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union would shut down its airspace for planes owned, registered or controlled by Russians, ""including the private jets of oligarchs.""

Canada's transport minister, Omar Alghabra, said his nation was closing its airspace to all Russian planes to hold the country accountable for an unprovoked attack on its neighbor. The European Union action came after many of its member countries had said they were barring Russian planes or planned to do so by Sunday night.

Additionally, officials for Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Austria and Iceland all separately announced the measures that would further isolate Russia. It follows similar restrictions from the U.K., Poland, Romania, Finland, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

The moves by the nations put even more pressure on Russia, with countries banding together to impose wide-reaching sanctions on Russia and its elite. A ban means Russian aircraft can't fly over or land in the nations that impose the rules, which often means lengthy and costly reroutes.

Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said on Twitter his government is pushing for a European Union-wide ban of Russian flights at a meeting of the bloc's ministers of foreign affairs. An EU official told Reuters that could be a part of fresh sanctions.

""We will hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked attacks against Ukraine,"" Canada's minister of transport Omar Alghabra said in a tweet.

Some airlines and delivery services had already been rerouting planes around the potential conflict zone in the days before Russia began its attack. United Parcel Service said Sunday it would temporarily suspend packages going into Russia. FedEx has also paused inbound service to Russia. The company will still provide domestic and export service in Russia where conditions allow, a spokesperson said in an email.

Hungary-based Wizz Air said Sunday it would suspend all flights temporarily to and from Russia.

In response to the nations banding together, Russia has said it would ban flights from several nations that introduced their own measures. Russian airline Aeroflot said on Sunday it would cancel all flights to European destinations until further notice. Russia's S7 airline is also suspending many of its flights to European countries until mid-March.
