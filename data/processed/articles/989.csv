Spurred by reports of Russian atrocities outside Ukraine’s capital, and alarmed at signs that Russia’s invasion force is about to escalate assaults in eastern Ukraine, many civilians in that region are fleeing while they can, officials said Wednesday.

“The cities of the Luhansk region are in ruins,” warned one eastern governor. “Thousands of residents have not yet left. Get out of the way!”

The exodus accelerated as Western nations moved to provide more weapons to Ukraine’s military and further ostracize Russia economically with new sanctions, including restrictions on its leading banks and on the assets of President Vladimir V. Putin’s children.

The new sanctions are a response to outrage and revulsion over the atrocities, including executions and torture, that appear to have been carried out by Russian forces before they retreated from areas outside Kyiv in the past few weeks. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the atrocities were fabricated or were committed by the Ukrainians themselves.

The European Union also was weighing a ban on coal from Russia, the leading provider of fossil-fuel energy to Europe, and Russia appeared to move closer to default on its foreign debt because of U.S. currency restrictions.

“Together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” said President Biden, who has described Mr. Putin as a war criminal and suggested he should not remain in power.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — roughly one in four — have fled their homes since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the United Nations, including more than four million who have fled the country. It is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The Russian military announced last week that it would focus its campaign on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. The redeployment came as the Russians, hampered by botched planning and fierce Ukrainian military resistance, retreated from the Kyiv area and apparently abandoned — at least for now — any effort to capture the capital in their war to subjugate the former Soviet republic.

Western military analysts have said the Russians vastly underestimated the challenges in Ukraine and that their initial invasion force of more than 150,000 has been weakened by losses, exhaustion and low morale. But that does not mean Russia’s military cannot undertake a powerful new assault in eastern Ukraine.

The shift has accelerated civilian displacement in the east. Thousands of people have been leaving, according to Ukrainian officials, and photos and videos posted online. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have been massing in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.

In Kramatorsk, a city in the north of the Donetsk region, photos showed crowds of people huddled at a platform in a central train station.

At least two people were killed and five injured when Russian forces launched a strike on a humanitarian aid site in the town of Vugledar in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk governor.

Russian forces now control 60 percent of the town of Rubizhne, in the Luhansk region, according to the governor there, Serhiy Haidai, who said the attackers had scaled up their offensive this week.

“Evacuations are taking place under the roar of enemy guns,” Mr. Haidai wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that approximately 30,000 people had left the region since Russia invaded. He urged remaining residents to flee before Russia scaled up attacks.

Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the Kharkiv military region, said Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the army would evacuate two towns in the eastern part of the country because fighting was escalating there.

The towns, Lozova and Barvinkove, are southwest of Izium, a city Russian forces seized as part of an apparent drive toward Sloviansk, which military analysts say is strategically critical to Russia’s plan to gain full control of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, speaking on national television, said “large groupings of Russian troops” had been massing in the region.

“They are not going to stop,” he said. “They have a great desire to create big problems for our armed forces in this direction, and we also expect that fierce battles will be fought there for our territory in the near future.”

The Pentagon’s assessment of Russian deployments appeared to corroborate what Ukrainian officials were saying. Pentagon officials said Russia had withdrawn all of its troops arrayed against Kyiv and another city in the north, Chernihiv, and sent them back to Russia or to its ally Belarus to rearm, resupply and possibly redeploy in eastern Ukraine.

The Pentagon officials said those forces included as many as 40,000 troops that, in many cases, had departed under fierce attack from the Ukrainian military units that retook the territory.

“We believe they are all out,” one senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational issues.

Russia now has about 30 battalion tactical groups — as many as 30,000 troops — in the east, the senior Pentagon official said. Earlier this week, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said Russia would most likely send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east” in the coming weeks.

Largely in anticipation of this next major phase of the war, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been used with high success in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.

NATO foreign ministers, meeting this week, have been discussing how to further help Ukraine prosecute the war without entangling the alliance in direct combat with Russian forces.

The war, they said, is far from over, noting that however badly Russia’s forces have performed, and their retreat from areas around Kyiv notwithstanding, they are making slow and brutal progress in the east.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general.

Ukrainian officials in a number of areas, including Mykolayiv in the south and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, have been sharing schedules of planned evacuations or links to online portals for people to sign up to join buses and trains that are transporting residents to safer places.

But in some besieged cities in the south, like Mariupol, it is already nearly impossible to leave, making evacuations sporadic and risky.

Attempts by the Red Cross to enter Mariupol to supervise civilian departures have repeatedly been scrubbed, leaving fearful residents to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, 500 people who had escaped Mariupol to join a Red Cross convoy in the nearby city of Berdyansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 100 miles away.

The climate of fear gripping Mariupol has spread to the region of Kherson, near the Black Sea, where people have lived under occupation by Russian forces since they encircled and entered the city and its suburbs on March 2.

“Anyone who did not leave early is now stuck here,” said Evgeniya Selivantseva, a doctor from Velyka Lepetyka, a village on the Dnipro River, in the Kherson region.

Dr. Selivantseva, 38, described a deepening humanitarian crisis in the village: Gasoline stations have run out of fuel, and food and medical supplies are running low. Food is so scarce that local leaders have started a makeshift flour mill.

“We feel helpless and totally defenseless,” she said. “People are afraid to leave their homes.”

The proposed European Union ban on Russian coal, part of the bloc’s effort to further penalize Russia over atrocities in Ukraine, reflected a choice of an imported energy source that would be the easiest to replace.

Deliberations over the ban and other sanctions were set to continue into Thursday, and European Union officials and diplomats anticipated that the measures would be approved. The process reflected the challenges of reaching agreement among all 27 member nations on the penalties, which would also include banning Russian ships from E.U. ports.

If approved, the sanctions would be the harshest enforced by the bloc since the invasion.

Though the European Union depends on Russian coal, the bloc could find substitute imports more easily than for natural gas and oil.

But banning coal from Russia could send energy prices soaring for European consumers, given the existing shortages in the bloc, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Carlos Torres Diaz, a senior vice president at Rystad, called the potential sanctions “a double-edged sword.”

As Russian forces have retreated around Kyiv, Ukrainian forces have gained ground in the country’s northeast and south. The southern city of Mariupol has been encircled and under siege by Russian troops for weeks, but has not been captured. Neither has another southern coastal city, Mykolaiv, also a target of Russian attacks. Dueling artillery battles have become the norm as infantry forces on both sides dig in.

But even though Russia was plagued by low morale, logistical problems and casualties, its units, for the most part, did not surrender en masse or flee.

The Russian failure boiled down to one point, analysts said: doing too much at once.

“Eventually it became clear their initial campaign was a completely unworkable military strategy,” Mr. Kofman said. “They were competing along axes of advancement, and they were basically advancing in opposite directions on the way. There was no way they were going to succeed.”

Russia’s repositioning has created, in some ways, a pause in the war. With its first phase over and the second phase just beginning, both sides are trying to prepare for each other’s next move.

“To attempt an assault in the Donbas, the Russians will need access to all the forces they’ve stuck around Kyiv,” Mr. Kofman said, a conclusion that military officials in Washington have also reached.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/ukraine-war-east-russia.html

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

The ministry added that another 13 journalists had been wounded, eight had been abducted or taken prisoner and three journalists were still missing. It said that several crimes had been committed against journalists from 11 countries, including Ukraine. Share this -







Ukrainian Foreign Minister: No place for Russia on the U.N. Human Rights Council Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he has spoken with the head of the United Nations and pledged that Ukraine will do all it can to hold Russia accountable for war crimes. Kuleba tweeted that he spoke to U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres about what he called a massacre in the Kyiv-area city of Bucha. “Stressed that Ukraine will use all available UN mechanisms to collect evidence and hold Russian war criminals to account,” Kuleba wrote. “No place for Russia on the UN Human Rights Council.” Photos have shown what appeared to be the bodies of civilians in the street in Bucha after Russian forces left. Ukraine’s prosecutor-general has said that the bodies of 410 killed civilians have been removed from the Kyiv region. Residents of Bucha have accused Russian forces of targeting civilians. Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said more than 300 people were killed. Russia’s Defense Ministry has denied the claims. Human Rights Watch also said Sunday that its investigators had documented “summary executions” and “other grave abuses” in several regions Russia controlled in Ukraine, including around Kyiv.

Zelenskyy to address U.N. Security Council Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he will address the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday, a day after he visited a town where authorities said they found hundreds of dead civilians. Speaking in a nightly address, Zelenskyy again called on democratically elected leaders to supply the country with more weapons and to impose “strong” sanctions on Russia “for the mass murders of civilians.” “Ukraine needs to get all the needed weapons in order to repulse the occupiers faster from our land,” he said. “To free our cities. And if we already had what we needed, all the planes, tanks, artillery, rocket defense systems, we could have saved thousands of people. I am not blaming you. I am only blaming the Russian soldiers. But you could help.” Earlier, Zelenksyy visited Bucha, one of the Kyiv-area towns where Ukrainian officials have said the bodies of 410 civilians have been found. Associated Press reporters who visited the city said some appeared to have been killed at close range; at least two had their hands tied behind their backs, and one had been shot in the head. Zelenskyy said there may be even more casualties in the nearby town of Borodyanka. Russia, which has veto power on the key 15-member U.N. Security Council, has denied targeting civilians, and its Defense Ministry has accused Ukrainian officials of staging the deaths in Bucha for Western media. Share this -







Death toll in another town outside Kyiv could top Bucha's, Zelenskyy says The number of fatally wounded victims in a town outside Kyiv could surpass the death toll in Bucha, where Ukrainian authorities have said they found hundreds of civilians’ bodies after Russian forces retreated, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday. Zelenskyy said officials have “information” showing potentially high fatality counts in Borodyanka, about 15 miles west of Bucha, and other towns that are no longer under Russian control. NBC News has not independently verified the claim, nor has it confirmed the 410 deaths that Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova said have been discovered in and around Bucha. After visiting Bucha and two other cities in the region, Zelenskyy said many bodies had been recovered in areas with bullet-riddled cars and torched military equipment. “It is especially hard to see the bullet holes on the cars that have ‘children’ written on them,” he said. A Maxar satellite image shows destroyed homes and vehicles Thursday along Vokzalna Street in Bucha, Ukraine. Satellite image (C)2022 Maxar Technologies Satellite images released Monday by a U.S. defense contractor, Maxar, showed what the company said were sections of Bucha that had been devastated by Russian bombardment. Blackened streets and charred vehicles could be seen next to houses that appeared to have been leveled. Zelenskyy said “all the crimes of the occupiers are being documented” for a war crimes investigation that he said would be “full and transparent.” “The time will come when every Russian will learn the whole truth about who killed their fellow citizens,” he said. “Who gave orders. Who turned a blind eye to the murders. We will establish all this and make it globally known. It is now 2022. And we have many more tools than those who prosecuted the Nazis after World War II.” Russian authorities have denied targeting civilians. In a statement, the country’s Defense Ministry accused Ukrainian authorities of having “stage managed” the casualties in Bucha “for the Western media.” Share this -







Drug shortages persist in Russia after start of Ukraine war First came the warnings, in messages among friends and families and on social media, to stock up on vital drugs in Russia before supplies were affected by crippling Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. Then, some drugs indeed became harder to find at pharmacies in Moscow and other cities. Experts and health authorities in Russia say the drug shortages are temporary — due to panic- buying and logistical difficulties for suppliers from the sanctions — but some remain worried that high-quality medicines will keep disappearing in the Russian market. “Most likely there will be shortages. How catastrophic it will be, I don’t know,” said Dr. Alexey Erlikh, head of the cardiac intensive care unit in Moscow Hospital No. 29, and a professor at the Moscow-based Pirogov Medical University. Experts say panic-buying has played a role in creating drug shortages. “People rushed to stock up, and in some cases, supplies that were supposed to last a year or a year and a half were bought out within a month,” Nikolay Bespalov, development director of the RNC Pharma analytical company, told AP. Bespalov also pointed to logistical problems that occurred early in the crisis. While major Western pharmaceutical companies pledged not to withdraw vital medications from the Russian market, sanctions cut Russia’s key banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system, hindering international payments. Dozens of countries halted air traffic with Russia, disrupting supply chains. The expert stressed the logistical issues have been largely resolved, but panic-buying, prompted by fears that foreign companies will halt supplies, may continue fueling shortages for some time.

Number of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine declining, senior U.S. official says The number of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine has declined in recent days, and the Russians have “reprioritized” their air activity, a senior defense official said. The Russian forces have refocused on Ukrainian positions in the south and around Izyum, near Kharkiv in the eastern portion of Ukraine, the official said, and the level of airstrikes on Kyiv has fallen in recent days. Russian troops around Izyum have been moving south and southeast toward the Donbas region, where they are repositioning and reinforcing their artillery. Share this -







Two-thirds of Russian troops around Kyiv have left, senior U.S. official says About two-thirds of the Russian troops that were positioned around the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv have now left and are headed to Belarus, according to a senior defense official.

The U.S. believes they are being refitted, resupplied and perhaps reinforced with additional manpower, and then will be sent back into Ukraine to continue fighting elsewhere. The U.S. thinks they may go to the Donbas region. “That doesn’t mean Kyiv is not under threat,” said the official. “And it doesn’t mean the Russians can’t change course or that there isn’t still a ground threat against Kyiv. Nobody is spiking any footballs here.” Share this -

More than 20 schools attacked in Ukraine per day, U.K. aid group says About 22 schools have been attacked in Ukraine per day since the war began five weeks ago, according to a news release Monday from the U.K. humanitarian organization Save the Children. The group said that ongoing military operations have disrupted the education of around 5.5 million children who remain in the country. More than 2 million children have fled, it noted. About 869 education facilities have been damaged — about 6 percent of schools in the country — and 83 destroyed, the Ukrainian ministry of education and science has said. Of those attacks, 43 percent have taken place in eastern Ukraine, where the organization said more than 400,000 children lived prior to Feb. 24. Peter Walsh, Save the Children's country director in Ukraine, called for those involved in the conflict to ""protect the civilian nature of schools, students, and education staff,"" as well as avoid using educational facilities for military purposes. ""Schools should be safe places of learning for children and must be free from attacks at all times,"" he said. The organization noted that the war has ""exacerbated an already challenging educational context"" in Ukraine. Prior to the conflict, the group said 30 percent of education facilities in eastern Ukraine reported not having enough teachers, a problem that is worsening as many flee the country.

Bucha mayor says 90 percent of victims shot, not shelled

Nearly all of the Ukrainian civilians killed in Bucha were deliberately shot, the town’s mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, has alleged.

“Almost 90 percent are bullet shots, not shrapnel,” Fedoruk told the Deutsche Welle broadcaster, contesting Russian claims that the victims were killed by shelling from the Ukrainian side.

Putin’s daughters targeted in US sanctions: Who are they?

The latest round of sanctions by the US on Russia has drawn renewed scrutiny to the family life of Russian President Vladimir Putin, unveiling two new targets: daughters Katerina and Maria.

Despite Putin’s domination of Russian politics, he rarely talks about his family and little is known about his personal life or children.

Katerina and Maria have never confirmed publicly the Russian leader is their father. Putin’s marriage to their mother Lyudmila, who was once part of the cabin crew with national carrier Aeroflot, ended with divorce in 2013.

Russian elites won’t be able to stop war in Ukraine, expert says

Elites close to President Putin who disagree with the invasion of Ukraine will not be able to influence the situation, a Russian political scientist has told an independent news programme.

Speaking on exiled Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s YouTube channel, Valery Solovei said some of the elites wanted Russia “to get out” of Ukraine “at any price”. But he stressed it was impossible for them to unite and change Russia’s position on Ukraine.

“They fear each other. And they don’t fear for nothing. That’s because they know if they say anything in the company of three people, two of those people will sell them out.”

Solovei is the former head of the public relations department at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He resigned for unspecified reasons. Russian authorities previously detained him for anti-Kremlin rhetoric and protest participation.

US Senate to vote on ending normal trade with Russia

The US Senate will vote on Thursday to end normal trade relations with Russia and to ban the importation of its oil. Both bills have been bogged down in the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he wished the vote could have happened sooner, “but after weeks of talks with the other side, it’s important that we have found a path forward”.

The trade suspension measure paves the way for US President Joe Biden to enact higher tariffs on certain Russian imports. The bill banning Russian oil would codify restrictions Biden has already put in place through executive action.

Putin’s actions are detestable. He must be held accountable. Tomorrow morning, the Senate will vote to strip Putin’s Russia of permanent normal trade relations with the United States, and we will take action to ban the import of Russian oil. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) April 7, 2022

US sanctions will hurt people, says Russian ambassador

US sanctions in relation to Sberbank and Alfa-Bank are a “direct blow to ordinary Russians”, Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov has said.

Russian teacher faces prison after telling students of bombings in Mariupol

A teacher in the Russian town of Penza is facing a fine of three to five million roubles ($36,500-$61,000) or five to 10 years in prison after telling her students about Russian forces bombing Mariupol.

US government-funded news organisation Radio Liberty reported the teacher, Irina Gen, was interviewed by an agent of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) after her students posted her lesson online. She has been charged with spreading “fake news” about the Russian army.

“He insisted that I confess to spreading fakes on purpose. But I was one hundred percent sure that all this was true,” Gen told Radio Liberty.

The Russian parliament toughened its “fake news” laws in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Under the legislation, those who “knowingly” spread so-called false information about Russian state bodies operating abroad face fines and a prison sentence of up to 15 years.

Gen told Radio Liberty she was “in for a painful trial”.

UN to vote on suspending Russia from its human rights body

The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) will vote on Thursday on whether to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council.

US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield brought the move for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the 47-member council, in the wake of videos and photos of corpses strewn along the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv.

UNGA Spokeswoman Paulina Kubiak said the assembly will meet to vote on the resolution to suspend Russia at 10am on Thursday. The resolution’s approval requires a two-thirds majority of assembly members that vote “yes” or “no”.

Russian forces ‘dismiss’ Zaporizhzhia mayor: Kyiv Independent

The Kyiv Independent news website says Russian forces have dismissed the mayor of Enerhodar in the Zaporizhzhia Region, Dmytro Orlov, and installed a regime-friendly head.

According to Energoatom, the operator of nuclear power stations in Ukraine, a deputy of the Enerhodar city council was chosen as head of the city administration “by an illegal order”, the Kyiv Independent said on Twitter.

Key moment for citizens of Russia: Zelenskyy

The Ukrainian president has spoken directly to Russian citizens saying now is the time for them to decide whether they are for war or peace.

“Everyone in Russia who will not demand an end to this shameful war and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine has no future,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly national address.

“It is better now, demanding peace, to lose something, to somehow face the Russian repressive machine than to be equated with the Nazis for the rest of your life,” he added.

‘Very small’ number of Ukrainian troops get drone training in US

Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the US to operate the Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv, a Pentagon official has said.

Pentagon Spokesperson John Kirby said a “very small” number of Ukrainian troops – less than a dozen – who were already present in the US before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, are being trained.

“We took the opportunity, having them still in the country, to give them a couple of days’ worth of training on the Switchblades, so they can go back … to train others in the Ukrainian military,” Kirby said, adding that 100 drones have been sent to Ukraine.

Delay on Russia oil embargo decision is costing lives: Zelenskyy

The Ukrainian president has blasted Western leaders for being too slow to agree to impose an embargo on Russian oil – at the cost of Ukrainian lives.

“Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of petrodollars and oil euros to Russia so as not to put their own economies at risk,” Zelenskyy said in a video.

“The only question is how many more Ukrainian men, how many more Ukrainian women, the Russian military will have time to kill in order for you, certain politicians – and we know who you are – to find some determination.”

Zelenskyy added that Moscow was making so much money from oil exports that it did not need to take peace talks seriously and called on the “democratic world” to shun Russian crude.

Russia has completed withdrawal from around Kyiv: US official

The US has assessed that Russia has completed its withdrawal from around Kyiv and is refitting and resupplying its troops for an expected redeployment into Ukraine, a senior US defence official said.

“We are assessing that all the Russians have left,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, adding that the US assessment was completed in the past 24 hours.

But the official said Kyiv remained under threat, even if Russian ground troops had left the area. “The threat of [a] ground invasion [of Kyiv] is clearly gone for the moment … but it’s not clear what their longer-range goals are,” the official said.

Ukrainian refugees continue to stream to US-Mexico border

Ukrainian refugees have continued to make their way to Tijuana, Mexico, as they wait to cross the border into the US, and temporary shelters have sprung up in Mexico.

“This is very nice, really very nice. We have food. We have sleep,” Anastasiia Derezenko, a Ukrainian refugee, told the Associated Press news agency from a shelter run by a charity called Agape Ministries.

“For us, it’s difficult – a little cold at night … But you know it’s not dangerous. We stay without worry. Because we think about our people who stay now in Brovary, in Kyiv, in Bucha, in Irpin,” she said.

Coordinator Alex Fedorchuk said that 2,000 refugees have already made their way through the shelter to date.

Ukraine war is descending towards ‘brutalisation’: expert

Jonathan Leader Maynard, an expert on genocide and war crimes at King’s College in London, has said that there is now evidence that the war in Ukraine is seeing an increasing “brutalisation”.

“To some extent, all wars involve significant civilian suffering, but this kind of severe violations of the laws of war is not universal, it is specific to certain conflicts,” Maynard told Al Jazeera.

“The evidence so far would suggest that this has been much more widespread in areas of Russian occupation particularly against civilians but there have been a few isolated crimes that appears to show Ukrainian forces engaging in violations of the law of war as well,” Maynard said in reference to a recent video that emerged that appeared to show Ukrainian soldiers shooting a captured Russian soldier.

Putin’s daughters hiding president’s wealth: US officials

US officials have said that Putin’s two adult daughters, Katerina and Maria, are hiding his wealth.

“We have reason to believe that Putin, and many of his cronies, and the oligarchs, hide their wealth, hide their assets, with family members that place their assets and their wealth in the US financial system, and also many other parts of the world,” a senior US administration official said.

“We believe that many of Putin’s assets are hidden with family members, and that’s why we’re targeting them,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) team says it has led a convoy of buses and private cars carrying more than 1,000 people to Zaporizhzhia after the civilians fled Mariupol on their own.

“This convoy’s arrival to Zaporizhzhia is a huge relief for hundreds of people who have suffered immensely and are now in a safer location,” Pascal Hundt, the ICRC’s head of delegation in Ukraine, said in a statement.

“It’s clear, though, that thousands more civilians trapped inside Mariupol need safe passage out and aid to come in.”

US treasury secretary says Biden wants Russia out of G20

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that Russia’s aggression will have “enormous economic repercussions in Ukraine and beyond” and that President Joe Biden wants Moscow expelled from the Group of 20.

“President Biden’s made it clear, and I certainly agree with him, that it cannot be business as usual for Russia in any of the financial institutions,” Yellen said. “He’s asked that Russia be removed from the G20, and I’ve made clear to my colleagues in Indonesia that we will not be participating in a number of meetings if the Russians are there.”

Her comments at a US House Financial Services Committee hearing raised questions about the future of the G20, which has been the premier global economic and policy forum since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

“We’ve seen a pattern over time [that] President Putin and Russian oligarchs stash assets and resources in the bank accounts of their family members.

Russia faces ‘genocide’ charge, but experts urge caution

Images of corpses lining the streets and bodies stuffed into plastic bags in Bucha, near Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, have shaken the world, raising calls for credible investigations and accountability.

But the explosive “genocide” charge levied by Ukrainian and foreign government officials against Russia over the killings has proven contentious.

Legal experts say it is too early to determine whether genocide has occurred in Ukraine, stressing that while the term is politically damning, other human rights violations are also serious and should not be ignored.

(Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images)

The bodies of at least 20 civilian men were found strewn across a street in the town of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, following the withdrawal of Russian forces from the area, according to disturbing images released by AFP on Saturday.

European leaders have condemned the alleged atrocities and called for an investigation into the Russian military. The Russian Ministry of Defense denied the allegations on Sunday.

Here's a look at how leaders from around the continent are reacting:

UK: Foreign Secretary Liz Truss on Sunday accused Russian forces of committing ""appalling acts"" in the Ukrainian towns of Bucha and Irpin and demanded that they be investigated as war crimes.

“As Russian troops are forced into retreat, we are seeing increasing evidence of appalling acts by the invading forces in towns such as Irpin and Bucha,"" Truss said in a statement on Sunday.

Their indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians during Russia’s illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes,"" Truss added.

Truss stressed that Russia should not be allowed to ""cover up their involvement in these atrocities through cynical disinformation,"" adding that the UK will play its part in ensuring this doesn't occur.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also released a statement on Sunday condemning the events in Ukraine.

“Russia’s despicable attacks against innocent civilians in Irpin and Bucha are yet more evidence that Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine,"" the statement said.

“No denial or disinformation from the Kremlin can hide what we all know to be the truth – Putin is desperate, his invasion is failing, and Ukraine’s resolve has never been stronger,"" the leader added.

""I will do everything in my power to starve Putin’s war machine. We are stepping up our sanctions and military support, as well as bolstering our humanitarian support package to help those in need on the ground,"" the statement said.

Truss committed the UK's full support to ""any investigations by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in its role as the primary institution with the mandate to investigate and prosecute war crimes."" On March 24, the UK offered the ICC an additional £1 million funding to assist efforts to investigate Russian war crimes.

Last week, the Attorney General for England and Wales Suella Braverman offered the assistance of top UK lawyer Howard Morrison QC to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General.

She said in a statement that he would ""provide independent and expert legal advice to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova in relation to the investigation and prosecution of war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine.""

European Union: Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, tweeted on Sunday: ""Appalled by reports of unspeakable horrors in areas from which Russia is withdrawing. An independent investigation is urgently needed.""

“Perpetrators of war crimes will be held accountable,"" she continued.

European Parliament chief Roberta Metsola, who became the first leader of a European Union institution to visit Ukraine since the Russian invasion began when she paid a visit to Kyiv on Friday, said the images from Bucha and other liberated areas in Ukraine show the ""cold reality of Putin's war crimes.""

In a tweet Sunday, Metsola said she was ""appalled"" by the ""atrocities of Russian army in Bucha & other liberated areas"" and stressed that the world must be made ""aware of what is happening"" in Ukraine and ""tougher sanctions must be imposed"" on Russia in retaliation.

""The perpetrators & their commanders must be brought to justice,"" she concluded.

Germany: German chancellor Olaf Scholz called the Bucha images “terrible and horrifying"" and said the perpetrators must be held accountable.

""We must relentlessly investigate these crimes committed by the Russian military. I demand that international organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross be given access to these areas in order to independently document the atrocities. The perpetrators and those who commissioned them must be held consistently accountable,"" Scholz said.

German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, meanwhile, said the images coming out of the Ukrainian town of Bucha were “unbearable.”

Baerbock tweeted on Sunday that “Putin's unrestrained violence wipes out innocent families and knows no boundaries,"" and called for those responsible for “war crimes” to be held accountable.

“We will tighten the sanctions against Russia, and will support Ukraine even more with their defense,” she tweeted.

France: French President Emmanuel Macron also called the images of Bucha ""unbearable.""

“The images that reach us from Bucha, a liberated city near Kyiv, are unbearable. In the streets, hundreds of civilians were cowardly murdered. My compassion for the victims, my solidarity with the Ukrainians,"" Macron said in a tweet.

""The Russian authorities will have to answer for these crimes,” he added.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warned that if what he called “massive abuses” in Bucha, Ukraine turn out to be war crimes, those responsible will be “tried and convicted.”

“The strongest possible economic and international pressure must be maintained and reinforced on Russia to force the Russian authorities to put an end to the war of aggression that they launched on February 24 against Ukraine, the human cost and humanitarian impact of which are becoming more serious every day,"" Le Drian said in a statement Sunday afternoon.

Italy: Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy on Sunday condemned Russia's alleged violence against civilians in Bucha.

“The images of the crimes committed in Bucha and in the other areas liberated by the Ukrainian army leave us astonished,"" he said in a statement released by his press office.

“The cruelty of the massacres of unarmed civilians is frightening and unbearable. The Russian authorities must immediately cease hostilities, stop the violence against civilians, and must account for what has happened,"" he added.

Spain: Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez expressed “horror, pain, and outrage” after seeing images of civilians killed in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, in a tweet on his official account on Sunday.

The war crimes that are being committed cannot go unpunished,” Sánchez said. “All our solidarity, help and support to the Ukrainian people.”
