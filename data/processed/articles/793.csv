Kuleba: I sincerely hope Mr. Lavrov will follow up with his colleagues in the military to help arrange the safe passage of people from the besieged cities, especially Mariupol, and to allow humanitarian aid to reach Mariupol.

x We effectively abandoned [the Ukrainian people] during their eight-year-long struggle to hold back the dark Putinist tide of state terror and violence. And now they are paying the price for our appeasement. ENDS https://t.co/hj4SKVIHxq — Peter Jukes (@peterjukes) March 8, 2022

The outline of Vladimir Putin’s long war against the West has been brought into stark, almost apocalyptic relief by his brutal invasion of Ukraine, and his mass bombardment of Ukrainian civilians. The Kremlin’s plan to recreate a new Russian Empire has been noted for years in various think tanks and publications, though very few believed it.

Thanks to Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr we know this is partly due to a ‘Great Information War’, using the fifth battlespace of propaganda and non-linear lies to deceive and distract. But after FBI investigations, congressional intelligence reports and dozens of journalistic investigations, we have confirmation from the US Army itself that Brexit was the first step in Putin’s ‘information blitzkrieg’.

But why has it taken so long to realise we were under attack? Why was there so little preparation for the biggest war in Europe in 77 years? And why did Britain do so little to counter it? The failure to do so will be seen as a bigger intelligence failure than 9/11. But was there more than wilful blindness in our (in)ability to see and predict the plans of the Kremlin?

[...]

Meanwhile, for at least five years, Vladimir Putin has been given a free hand to launch a war in Europe with little opposition, amid signals from the British establishment that he could only have taken as compliance and surrender. We waved a white flag. And though we are currently arming the Ukrainians with anti-tank missiles, and promising strong sanctions (which are always behind the rest), we effectively abandoned them during their eight-year-long struggle to hold back the dark Putinist tide of state terror and violence. And now they are paying the price for our appeasement.

4,ad25ad8d-87ce-443d-91d5-b0cb2e522258,[],,"Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Tuesday pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept an offer from Russian President Vladimir Putin, which would require Kyiv to make significant concessions in order to end Moscow’s invasion, the Walla and Haaretz news sites report.

The Prime Minister’s Office denied the claim.

Walla does not specify the details of Putin’s offer as reportedly conveyed by Bennett, but previous reports from the news site said that Putin is demanding an independent Donbas region, while stopping short of seeking regime change in Ukraine. Other reports have suggested that the plan Bennett brought to Zelensky includes recognizing Russia’s annexation of Crimea, recognizing Donetsk and Luhansk as separate entities, and changing the Ukrainian constitution to excise a commitment to joining NATO.

“If I were you, I would think about the lives of my people and take the offer,” Bennett told Zelensky during a phone call on Tuesday, according to a senior Ukrainian official who spoke to Walla and Haaretz on condition of anonymity.

Zelensky did not take well to the proposal, responding with a brief “I hear you.”

“Bennett has proposed that we surrender,” the senior Ukrainian official tells the Hebrew news sites. “We have no intention of doing so. We know that Putin’s proposal is just the beginning.”

The report says that Israel has also asked that Ukraine cease its requests for Israeli military or defense assistance, as this could hinder Jerusalem’s efforts to mediate and maintain neutrality.

Thus far, Zelensky has been unimpressed with Bennett’s mediation efforts, saying the Israeli premier has sufficed with being a “mailbox” that passes along messages between Russia to Ukraine without coming up with any proposals of his own, the senior official says.

“We do not need a mailbox. We have enough of these,” the senior Ukrainian official says. “President Zelensky’s office does not believe this is the way to mediate. If Bennett wants to be neutral and mediate, we would like to see him appoint someone who will deal with the matter day and night to try and reach a compromise.”

Zelensky is under the impression that Bennett has taken up the role of mediator as part of his effort to avoid picking sides in a war because of the risk of damaging Israel’s ties with Russia, the official claims. (Bennett was asked by Zelensky on February 25 to try to mediate a solution to the crisis, and flew to Moscow on Saturday night for a Kremlin meeting with Putin. Zelensky has also criticized Bennett, however, saying on March 3 that he did not feel the prime minister is “wrapped in our flag.”)

The official reportedly pointed out that other countries such as Germany and France have also played roles in passing along messages between Russia and Ukraine while still maintaining a clear public stance against Moscow’s invasion, unlike the Israeli prime minister, who has not condemned Russia.

Zelensky’s office has identified a wide gulf between Bennett’s position and that of the Israeli public, which has been far more supportive of Ukraine, the official reportedly says. This has led to significant frustration and even personal offense on the part of Zelensky with the Israeli government, according to the senior official.

The official reportedly said Zelensky feels he has all but exhausted his efforts to influence the Israeli government.

He is hoping to deliver a speech to the Knesset plenum, as he has done in other parliaments around the world. But Israel has instead proposed that he hold a less formal Zoom session with all MKs invited, Walla reports.

Zelensky has rejected the idea and is weighing the possibility of a speech at Yad Vashem, though it is not clear whether the Holocaust museum would be interested in the idea.

Israeli officials have given a number of reasons to Zelensky’s office for why he cannot give a speech at the Knesset plenum — including that parliament is in recess and that the building is undergoing renovation.

But Walla reports that those are mere excuses, as Bennett and Foreign Minister Lapid do not want to anger Russia by granting Zelensky such a high-profile appearance.

Responding to the report, a source in the Prime Minister’s Office says, “It is doubtful whether this is a senior official who is in Ukraine and on [Bennett’s] call [with Zelensky], since it took place on a private line.

The PMO source denies that Bennett told Zelensky to take Putin’s offer, “as Israel does not have such an offer.”

“In any case, the prime minister does not intend to give Zelensky recommendations or advice on how to act at any stage,” the source tells Walla. “The conversation between the two was long and positive and included the possibility of a meeting [between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators] in Jerusalem.”

The source declines to say whether Bennett will be prepared to make proposals of his own. “The prime minister’s efforts are aimed at one thing: to stop the bloodshed in Ukraine and the unnecessary suffering.”",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-11-2022/

Previous administrations after the Allied Forces defeated the German-Japan Axis in 1945, put in a policy of containment versus the Soviet Union and the CCCP. Later it moved to a policy of coexistence until the implosion of the Soviet Union in 1989-90. Unfortunately the top dogs in the West and East are elderly men rusted in old ways and thinking. US Congress plays a aggressive legislative role in setting foreign policy which eats away at Executive Power of the President. To mob up any dissent, powerful lobby groups pour money into the campaigns of senators and representatives. In fact, not new ideas but narrow capital interests determine the course of history of the United States.

From the Banana republics of Central America, Kissinger doctrine in South America, to the Pacific Islands and the Philippines. Perceived threats are build upon to increase military spending beyond the scope necessary for human kind to survive. The planet is in mortal danger, yet the coal and fossil fuel lobby managed another, perhaps final, war on the European continent.

Media to explain thirty years of failed foreign policy for dummies.

America and NATO military command knew the national security red lines of Russia, got Putin into a corner, knew it was unacceptable yet failed in honest diplomacy for many years.

Churchill's secret papers released

Operation Unthinkable - Churchill's plans to invade the Soviet Union in 1945 If you thought the Cold War between East and West reached its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, then think again. 1945 was the year when Europe was the crucible for a Third World War. So concerned was the Prime Minister Winston Churchill, that in the spring of that year he ordered his Chiefs of Staff to prepare a plan, `Operation Unthinkable' to attack the Soviet Empire. The top secret plan was so sensitive that only Churchill's immediate circle of military advisors were privy to the blueprint. The detailed proposal, which may seem fanciful today, sought to claw back East Germany and Poland, which had fallen under Soviet domination. Churchill felt particularly guilty over the fate of the Poles, who had fought valiantly for the Allies during the war but whose future was now dictated by Stalin. If Churchill wanted to act, he knew that time was running out. The United States were about to move vast numbers of their troops and ordnance out to the Far East for the assault on mainland Japan, leaving Western Europe at the mercy of Stalin. Furthermore, demobilisation would start after VE Day and would rapidly reduce the size of the British Army and their capacity for offensive action. The plan called for a massive Allied assault on 1 July 1945 by British, American, Polish and German - yes German - forces against the Red Army. They aimed to push them back out of Soviet-occupied East Germany and Poland, give Stalin and bloody nose, and force him to re-consider his domination of East Europe.

This was true when FDR connived to enter WWII and ""discovered"" kamikazi fighters. It was true for the host of ignorant ""statesmen"" who inherited his state department and antagonized communist Korea, communist Han, Viet Cong, ""raghead"" sheiks and ""islamist"" suicide bombers, and independent states of Africa and India. So it shall be for Russia's heirs. The idea of personal omnipotence is a fallacy. No one realizes leadership alone. No leader acts alone. | by Cat on Wed Mar 9th, 2022 |
