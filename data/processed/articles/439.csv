Ukraine's Army said that Russia fired on civilian areas of Kyiv but that Ukraine's air defence systems repelled ""two deadly gifts,"" according to a post on its verified Facebook page.

Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko said three people were injured with one in critical condition after ""missile debris"" hit a residential building.

He tweeted a photo showing a building with part of its wall torn down and firefighters present at the scene.

Russian missiles and shelling rained down on Ukrainian cities on Thursday after President Vladimir Putin unleashed a full-scale ground invasion and air assault, forcing civilians to shelter on metro systems.

Russia's forces pressed deep into Ukraine as deadly battles reached the outskirts of Kyiv and the West responded with punishing sanctions.

On Thursday, Russian paratroopers wrested control of the Gostomel airfield, on the northwestern outskirts of Kyiv, after swooping in with helicopters and jets from the direction of Belarus.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Friday that Russian ""sabotage groups"" have entered Kyiv and urged citizens to remain vigilant.

137 deaths

Across Ukraine, at least 137 ""heroes"" were killed after the first day of fighting, President Zelensky said, calling up conscripts and reservists nationwide to fight in a general mobilisation.

The United States moved to impose sanctions on Russian elites and banks, but stressed that US forces would not head to eastern Europe to fight in Ukraine, but would instead defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory.

Zelensky said there was now a ""new iron curtain"" between Russia and the rest of the world, like in the Cold War, adding in a later speech that his nation had been ""left alone"".

""Who is ready to fight alongside us? I don't see anyone.""

Ukraine said Russian forces had seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, an area still heavily contaminated with radioactive material after a devastating 1986 accident, prompting the IAEA nuclear watchdog to call for ""restraint.""

Witnesses told AFP that Russian paratroopers wrested control of the strategic Gostomel airfield, on the northwestern outskirts of Kyiv, after swooping in with helicopters and jets from the direction of Belarus.

""The helicopters came in and then the battles started. They were firing machine guns, grenade launchers,"" resident Sergiy Storozhuk said.

'Better to die'

Western intelligence has said that Russia is seeking to mass ""overwhelming force"" around the Ukrainian capital and that Moscow has established ""complete air superiority"" over Ukraine.

Elsewhere, Russian ground forces moved into Ukraine from the north, south and east, forcing many Ukrainians to flee their homes as the sound of bombing reverberated.

Moscow's Defence Ministry said its forces had ""successfully completed"" their objectives for the day, earlier claiming to have destroyed over 70 Ukrainian military targets, including 11 airfields.

Olena Kurilo was among 20 people wounded by flying shards of glass following a blast in the eastern Ukrainian town of Chuguiv.

""Never, under any conditions will I submit to Putin. It is better to die,"" the 52-year-old teacher said, her face covered in bandages.

US President Joe Biden announced export controls against Russia to cut off more than half of the country's high-tech imports, alongside sanctions on Russian elites he called ""corrupt billionaires,"" and banks.

He earlier said the G7 group of wealthy nations had agreed to impose ""devastating"" economic sanctions.

The EU moved to impose ""massive"" sanctions on Russia's energy and finance sectors, while French President Emmanuel Macron called Putin to ""demand immediate halt"" to the offensive.

Biden once again said additional US forces were not heading to eastern Europe to fight in Ukraine, but would defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory.

Weeks of diplomacy failed to deter Putin, who massed over 150,000 troops on Ukraine's borders in what the West said was Europe's biggest military build-up since World War II.

KYIV, Ukraine — By midmorning, there was little left outside the shopping mall beyond rubble, blood stains and broken glass. On one side, the building had been reduced to a pile of debris. On the other lay remnants left by several victims — including their clothes. Used surgical gloves were scattered on the ground nearby.

The missile that struck the Retroville shopping complex late Sunday night killed at least eight people, officials here said, the latest violent attack on the capital in the past week that have left residents fearing what might come next. The devastation at the mall on Monday was some of the worst seen in Kyiv since the war began, and concern is mounting that Russia’s frustration over its failure to seize key territory could prompt its forces to escalate its attacks.

Civilians milled about outside the next morning to survey the damage, well aware that the unpredictable nature of the assault meant those who died here just hours before could just as easily have been them.

“The whole city is dangerous,” said Vitaliya Dubovetska, who lives on the 16th floor of an apartment building nearby and saw the strike from her window. “Any place could be safe or unsafe. It’s like a lottery.” Photos on her phone showed an orange fireball erupting in the distance. She moved closer to the strike site on Monday to repair the windows at a relative’s apartment across the street and then visited what remained of the mall.

Dubovetska and others said the attack occurred around 11 p.m. on Sunday, causing an enormous boom that rippled through the area. Due to a citywide curfew from 8 p.m. each night, journalists could not reach the scene until morning. It was not immediately clear who was killed in the attack, which took place at a time when most civilians would not be allowed outside their homes or shelters.

Just inside the damaged mall sat a grocery store that one former employee said was now being used for storage. Shards of glass and a large puddle of water sat in the hall. The ceiling was also damaged.

Troops guarding the door initially allowed a group of journalists to enter but then forced the press corps to leave. Vladyslov Kosiak, 21, stood across the street with two friends. They, too, had heard the strike the night before from a fourth-floor balcony nearby, then came to see the damage after the curfew lifted Monday morning.

“There was a very loud bang and the building started to shake like an earthquake,” Kosiak said. Throughout the morning, the heavy report of outgoing artillery could be heard.

A territorial defense volunteer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely, said the strike was the result of a hypersonic missile — but did not offer any evidence. “Maybe it was to show the Ukrainian military what they can do, that they can damage anything,” he said.

Booms echoed continuously throughout the area Monday morning. When asked if one loud blast was incoming or outgoing, the territorial defense member shrugged. “I don’t know, but it’s not here,” he said, and laughed as he gestured to his immediate surroundings. “So it’s okay.”

The attack Sunday came as Russia insisted Ukraine surrender the besieged city of Mariupol. Weeks of attacks on the port have created a deadly humanitarian disaster. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky refused. Civilians in Kyiv said Monday that his defiance left them feeling proud despite their horror over the events unfolding within their borders.

Most communication to Mariupol has been cut off since the beginning of March, but some civilians have managed to flee. They have brought with them stories of hellish conditions, including mass graves and bodies left in the streets. Two Associated Press journalists stayed in the city for weeks, documenting the horrors firsthand and helping the world understand the gravity of Russia’s attack, which has allegedly included strikes on a theater, an art school and a maternity hospital.

“If he would agree to give them Mariupol, tomorrow it would be Kharkiv. It’s better not to negotiate,” said Natalia, 44, who worked at the grocery store inside the mall before the war started. She spoke on the condition that only her first name be used due to security concerns. She, too, visited the site Monday to assess the damage.

“From the beginning,” she said, “Russian soldiers thought we in Kyiv would meet them with a flower in our hands. But if they come, we will each give them two,” a reference to the tradition of leaving flowers by a grave.

Her friend Oksana works in a food store next to where the strike occurred. She said the attacks on civilian infrastructure have only bolstered the civilians’ resolve to stand their ground. “We will never let the Russian army come to Kyiv,” she said. She had decided to stay in the capital out of a sense of patriotic duty. “It’s better to die in an apartment here than to try to live somewhere else.”

Still, residents worry the growing assault could make living here unbearable. Already, they are fearful and anxious — but keep pressing forward in hopes the situation will resolve.

“Every day I wake up to have breakfast and don’t know if I will be alive for dinner,” Natalia said.

3,bc1aaaec-4c18-4990-8c7a-3fc394368a13,[],2015-02-01 02:23:03-08:00,"The ancient city of Kiev continues to thrive as the most populous city of Ukraine. Much like other post-Soviet capitals, Kiev’s future looks bright, despite the global economic crisis and growing concern about corruption. While Kiev is probably best known for its historical connection to the Old Rus’ polity, a historical predecessor to the modern Russian state, Kiev is an important modern center for industry, education, and culture for not only modern-day Ukraine, but all of Eastern Europe.

History of Kiev

According to legend, Kiev was founded Kiev by three legendary Slavic brothers, Kyi, Scheck, and Khoryv, and their sister Lybed. This legend is circumstantially supported by the fact that the city’s name can be understood to mean “Kyi’s” in Ukrainian. However, other historians believe that the city may originally been have been founded by Turkic peoples, possibly the Magyars or Khazars, who had originally named the city in their own language as (Küi = riverbank + ev = settlement).

Exactly when the city was founded is also a subject of debate. Most historians date the city to the 5th century, but some hypothesize that the area was not really settled until the 6th century. Some have argued that the founding occurred much later, closer to the 8th or 9th centuries, but archeological evidence has largely disproved this.

What can be said with relative certainty is that the city only began to develop into a center of regional importance in the late 9th centry. It was then sized by the Varangians from the Khazars, who had built a fortress there.

The Varangians were a Baltic people associated closely with the Vikings. However, the particular Varangians who took Kiev were known as the “Rus'” and were led by Oleg of Novgorod. Novgorod, at the time, was the capital of the Rus’ polity and a flourishing trade center servicing the lucrative trade routes from the Baltics to Constantinople which the Vikings and Varangians dominated. Oleg moved his capital from Novgorod to Kiev and the military settlement of Kiev soon became a regional center for commerce and culture.

In 988, Prince Vladimir the Great introduced Christianity as the religion of the realm from his seat in Kiev. Legend states that Vladimir initially considered Christianity along with Judaism and Islam as state religions, but rejected the latter two due to their bans on pork and alcohol (two staples of Kievan Rus’). However, there were also political consequences to Vladimir’s decisions. The famed “Baptism of Rus’” firmly cemented the polity’s alliance with the Byzantine Empire. In addition, Vladimir based the new church in Kiev and structured it around himself, giving him not only political authority, but now religious authority over the Rus’ people.

In 1240, the city was besieged and destroyed by the invading Mongols, led by Batu Khan. Kiev and the surrounding land, which are highly fertile, positioned on lucrative trade routes, and generally flat and navigable, now saw how this combination can be a recipe for success, but also an combination too tempting for invading armies to pass up.

For the next 400 years, the city was was passed between multiple empires. In 1362, Kiev became a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after the Golden Horde Mongolian army suffered a defeat at the hands of the Grand Duke. Later, the city and surrounding area were transferred to Poland as part of the Union of Lublin, an alliance that created the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569. However, political differences led to hostilities between Ukraine and Poland and, in 1654, Ukraine and Russia signed the Treaty of Pereyaslav in which Ukraine pledged allegiance to Russia in return for Russian military help against the Poles. Kiev was still claimed by Poland, however, and would be ceded to Russia only in 1667.

As part larger empires, and especially during its early days as part of the Russian Empire, Kiev played a marginal role in terms of commerce. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Kiev’s religious, cultural, linguistic, and economic institutions were increasingly influenced and altered by Russia’s military and ecclesiastical concerns and the city was largely Russified by the end of the 19th century.

Ukrainian nationalism, however, developed in underground political societies during this period, in part in reaction to the Russification that was occurring. This movement was of major concern to the Tsar and was ruthlessly repressed. In large part, this repression only served to push the movements further underground and further radicalize its members.

During Russia’s industrial revolution during the 19th century, Kiev again became an important trade and transportation hub – now by both rail and river. Kiev was a major export point for the massive amounts of grain and sugar produced by Russia. It was also populated by a number of successful merchants and artisans, whose number included heavy amounts of Jews, who helped build many of the city’s important landmarks from theatres to synagogues.

During the Russian Revolution of 1917 and WWI, control of Kiev shifted between governments led by the various Soviet, Anti-Soviet, and Nationalist parties. The city would also see its government shift a total of sixteen times from 1918 to 1920 as Ukraine first declared independence after the revolution and then was occupied by various invading forces.

Finally, in 1921, Kiev became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Yet, the previous years of turmoil had greatly damaged Kiev. Despite Kharkiv being named the capital of the Ukrainian SSR, a massive restoration of Kiev’s economic and cultural life took place on the basis of reviving its industrial capacity; under Soviet industrialization, Kiev became a new center of industry, science, and technology. However, while it benefitted from Soviet policies, it also suffered under them as Kiev would, like the rest of Ukraine, be decimated by The Great Famine of the early 30’s and, later, Stalin’s purges. In 1934 Kiev became the capital of Soviet Ukraine, and period of dramatic economic development ensued.

WWII and the German invasion again destroyed much of the city. The Nazis took Kiev in September of 1941 and tens of thousands of Kiev’s Jews were simply massacred, and other “undesirable” Kievans were deported to forced labor and concentration camps. The Soviets retook Kiev in November of 1943. For the next 50 years, Kiev continued to grow and strengthen its industrial base, especially in the production of machinery, steel, chemicals, weaponry, food, paper, and hydrocarbons. There was also a famous brand of camera produced here known as the Kiev which is still sought after by photographers.

In 1991, with the fall of the USSR, Ukraine declared its independence. Like many other post-Soviet states, Ukraine suffered a deep recession in the 1990’s as its economy struggled to transition to capitalism and its government experimented with new governing techniques. The economy eventually stabilized in the 2000’s, but is still struggling. Politically, Kiev was the center of the Orange Revolution, which saw 500,000 people took to the city’s streets to protest the 2004 presidential elections, in which Viktor Yanukovych had been declared the winner amid widespread evidence of electoral fraud. Ironically, Ukrainians as a whole elected Yanukovych back into office in 2010. However, Kiev has remained largely “orange” and liberal, with more than 60% of Kievan votes going to one of the Orange Revolution’s figureheads, Yulia Tymoshenko.

The Kievan Economy and Population Today

While Ukraine’s population has declined in the post-Soviet era, Kiev’s total population has grown, thanks largely to its relatively stable economy. Like the rest of the world, Kiev was hit by the financial crisis of 2007-08, losing 13.5% of their gross regional product. However, this is 1.6% less than the national average that Ukraine lost during the same period.

Kiev’s economy today dominated by large energy companies and, as such, is heavily tied to Russian interests and hydrocarbon supplies. Utilities, including electricity, gas, and water, make up the 26% of the city’s industrial output. In 2008, Naftogaz Ukrainy, one of the largest natural gas importers in Ukraine, based in Kiev, made a deal with Russia’s natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, in which it was stipulated that Naftogaz would be the sole importer of Gazprom gas.

Kiev’s other primary industries are also largely inherited from its Soviet past. The manufacture of food and beverage make up 22% of Kiev’s total industrial output, chemical and mechanical engineering takes another 30%, and the manufacture of paper and paper products takes 11%.

Today, services and particularly IT outsourcing are also beginning to make their mark on the city. In May of 2011, the Kiev authorities presented a 15-year plan for the city’s economic development which forsees the city focusing on engineering and high-tech industries and drawing as much as 82 billion Euros of foreign investment into these sectors.

Modern Culture in Kiev

Given its turbulent history and frequent occupation, Kiev, like the rest of Ukraine, can be said to have issues with its self-identity. Of its 2.7 million inhabitants, only 24% speak solely Ukrainian in their households, according to a 2006 survey. Nearly 52% percent speak primarily Russian at home, and that number rises the closer one gets to the city’s economically powerful center. Interestingly, although Russian is the lingua franca of the city, Russians only account for 13% of Kiev’s population. Approximately 130 different nationalities and ethnicities make up the other 87%.

Kiev’s cultural life is rich and diverse. The city’s Slavic architecture, including ancient monuments and cathedrals, clearly represent Kiev’s ancient history and enduring spirit. Two of Ukraine’s “Seven Wonders” reside in Kiev. One of these is the Saint Sophia Cathedral (Собор Святой Софии), which was built in the 11th century. Named after an ancient cathedral in Constantinople, it was in this cathedral where centuries of Kievan princes were crowned in the polity’s golden age. The second “wonder” is Kiev’s Pechersk Lavra, or “Monastery of the Caves.” The monastery is a historic orthodox Christian attraction consisting of soaring bell towers, beautiful cathedrals, and underground caves that were also used as an important outpost of Kiev’s resistance movement during WWII.

Kiev is also littered with note-worthy museums and theatres. One such museum is the Museum of the Great Patriotic war, which documents the victory in World War II as well as its devastating cost in lives. Visiting this museum, one gets a true understanding of Ukraine’s sacrifice during those horrendous times. The city also abounds in art museums and theatres, including the National Art Museum, the Pinchuk Art Center, and the Kiev Opera House. The National Art Museum’s current collection consists of over twenty thousand pieces, including works by famous Ukrainian and Russian artists. Many theaters perform in Russian and Ukrainian. The Kiev Opera House, established in 1867, continues to please audiences with various operas and a broad repertoire of ballets.

While Kiev’s fate has been largely decided by non-Ukrainians, today’s Kiev, with its high-tech industry, higher education institutions, and famous landmarks, is one of Eastern Europe’s most important industrial, scientific, and cultural centers. Kievans, strong-willed and determined, will undoubtedly continue along their country’s chosen path of democracy and capitalism. Perhaps someday Kiev will be less known for its role in Russian history and more for its part in establishing Ukraine as an independent nation.

Kyiv is one of the most beautiful cities of the world that picturesquely spreads on the Dnipro river hills. As others old cities Kyiv has no exact date of foundation. According to the legend, Kyiv was founded more than 1,500 years ago by three brothers Kyi, Schek, Khoryv and their sister Lybid. The city was named after the oldest brother Kyi. In the 9th century Kyiv became the capital of the Ancient Rus. The territory of this independent state stretched out from the Baltic Sea in the North to the Black Sea in the South and from Volga River in the East to the Carpathians Mountains in the West. Kyiv is often referred as ""the mother of all cities"" by Russians and Ukrainians and as a cradle of Slavonic civilization. Since then, Kyiv has developed into an important center of East Europe attracting foreign businesses and investors to its economic and natural potential. Considering population Kyiv is among the 10 largest cities of Europe. Its historical path is related to the great political and cultural events in Europe and represented in many age-old architectural monuments. 2148 objects of history and culture are located on the territory of Kyiv. Among them are over 100 museums 33 theatres and theatres-studios 53 cultural buildings 140 libraries, 20 concert organizations and independent musical collectives that are working in the capital of Ukraine.

There are many historical places and architecture monuments located around the Conference Palace. In park zone, close to the Conference Palace, there is the monument of St. Apostle Andrew who brought the Christianity to the place which was destined to become the city Kyiv. Near this monument is the monument of Askold Tomb. As legend says, in 882 prince Oleg arrived to the Kyiv and killed Kyiv kings Askold and Dir in the nearby wood on the Dnipro banks and took the Kyiv throne. In 1810 on this place, was built a new stone church-rotunda which was later turned into a park pavilion. Picturesque, legendary place kept on attracting the attention of both Kyiv resident and its guests. The Ukrainian poet Shevchenko reproduced Askold Tomb in one of his numerous works of paint art. In 10 minutes walk from the Conference Palace is Great Belltower (Belfry) of Pecherska Lavra Monastery - a symbol of spiritual power and architectural challenge. It was founded in 1051 by the monks Anthony and Feodosiy as an underground cave monastery. Since the foundation it became the greatest spiritual, politic and cultural center. Most of the buildings in the Monastery date from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries but still there is one church in the Monastery that has been preserved from the twelfth century with very few architectural changes introduced since that time. The territory of Lavra is 28 hectares and includes complex of temples, kilometers of caves with underground churches, and unique museums such as the Museum of historical treasures, the Museum of the Book and printing, the Museum of the Ukrainian decorative-applied art and many others. It is almost a miracle that it has survived as the Monastery itself throughout numerous historical events and many crippling misfortunes. This greatest monument is a national heritage site and one of the four UNESCO World heritage site within Ukraine. The complex serves as the official residence of Metropolitan the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. www.lavra.Kyiv.ua On the south from Kyivo-Pecherska Lavra you can see the blue domes dotted with gold stars and gold crosses of the churches in the Vydubytsky Monastery. The Monastery is located at the foot of the Dnipro hills. It was found by Kyivs Prince in 1070-88 years. Many legends of Orthodoxy history is bound up with this place. During its long history, the monastery has seen and suffered numerous fires, inundations and even a collapse. Contemporary ensemble of Vydubytsky monastery formed in late-17th-early 18th centuries. Today Vydubytsky monastery is declared one of the most worthy monuments, and one of the masterpieces of Ukrainian baroque. Also, Kyiv is often referred to as one of the most green world cities. City has always been famous for its large number of parks, squares and boulevards. The symbol of Kyiv, the chestnut leaf, is not in vain. Conference palace is also situated not far from the oldest central park  Mariinsky. The park was founded in early 18th centuries and forms chain of open alleys. It is placed on the pictorial hills along the right coast of the river Dnipro and has lot to offer to nature admirers. There are marvelous vistas that open on the river, islands and left Dnipro bank from the park. This place is majestic in all seasons, but it becomes especially beautiful in autumn when the trees on Dnipro hills turn in a wide range of colors from yellow to deep crimson. The decoration of this park is gorgeous blue-and-cream palace designed by Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Mariinsky Palace was built in 1750 and used as Kyiv residence of the Tsar family. Facades and interiors of the palace impress with luxury of furnish. Now the Mariinsky palace is a residence of the President for the high-rank person reception. Kyivs main downtown thoroughfare, Khreshchatyk, located considerably close to the Conference palace. This is a place of all festive events: parades, festivals, concerts, and celebrations. Needless to say, Khreshchatyk is everyones favorite place to stroll on the weekends and listen to street musicians, watch performances by mimes, dancers and caricature artists. In the middle of the Khreshchatyk is the Square of Independence  the main square of the Ukrainian capital. The streets disperse from the Square fan-shapely and lead to the Prince Hill. Their conformation is preserved from the ancient times. The city of 200 churches, the city of golden domes and the Jerusalem of the lands of Rus  these words used foreign merchants to describe Kyiv and the glory and splendor in eastern and western lands. In 988, Prince Volodymyr the Great baptized Ancient Rus into Christianity in Kyiv. According to legend, he laid the foundation to the first Christian temple in Kyiv, the Desyatynna Church. Monument to Grand Kyivs Prince Volodymyr was founded in 1853. It stands on Volodymyrs Hill, and towers up 70m height above the Dnipro. One of the best panoramas of city opens from this place. From here start the lands of Ancient Rus  were engraved on the monument. On the top of Volodymyrs Hill was erected St. Michaels Monastery of the golden domes. The monastery was founded in 1108. Today, the complex of monuments of St. Michaels Monastery of the golden domes includes the Bell Tower (1716-1720), a stone wall (middle of the 18th), and the Refectory (1713). At present it is a working monastery. Out of the walls of the St. Michaels Monastery there is a monument to the victims of the Famine, which is always covered with fresh flowers. It is also a monument to the Grand Princess Olga on Mykhailivskiy Square. The applied material is the white Italian marble. The famous Kyivan princess is surrounded by statues of Apostle Andrew and the creators of the Cyrillic alphabet saints Cyrill and Mephody. There is a beautiful Cathedral not far from the Michael's Monastery. The solemn laying of the foundation stone of St. Nicholas Cathedral took place in August of 1899, whereupon group of Catholics turned to Kyiv's governor-general with a petition to get the permission for the construction of cathedral in commemoration of staying in Kyiv tsar Nikolay II. By that time in Kyiv already was one Roman Catholic cathedral  Alexandrs Cathedral, but taking into account that in Kyiv lived about 40 thousands of Catholics it was obviously not enough. The cathedral had been constructed for 10 years on the donations of private persons. It was spent about 500 thousands rubles in general. For the project of the cathedral the competition was announced. The winner became a student Stanislav Volovskiy. In as much as young engineer had lacked practical experience, the revision and building supervision was entrusted to famous Kyiv architect - Vladislav Gorodetskiy. The construction works dragged out because of poor ground condition, thats why, for the first time in Kyiv, the soil was strengthen by mighty cast-in-place concrete piles. Raised cathedral became real architectural masterpiece and was consecrate on the 6 December 1909. During the USSR times, when religion considered to be detrimental and unfavorable, cathedral was closed for public worship, in the beginning of World War II in the building was placed state regional archives. Only in 1980 in the year of Olympic Games the cathedral was restored and opened like an organ and chamber music hall. The organ was constructed specially for this hall. When creating an instrument masters tried as much as possible to approach its look to the architectural style of the cathedral, this joined the unique architecture and unique instrument. Organ has 55 spots, 3945 organ-pipes of various diameter(from 13 mm to 6 meters) made from metal and precious wood.. The great St. Sophia Cathedral is situated opposite to St. Michaels Monastery. This temple was founded in 1036, in commemoration of the victory over the Pecheneg tribe. The cathedral became a major cultural and political center of Kyivan Rus and a sate for receiving ambassadors from many countries. In 1050, in this church was matchmaking ceremony of the French queen Anna, the daughter of Kyivs Prince Yaroslav. The Bell Tower of Sophia Monastery (1699-1706) is 76 meters high; its bell towers dome surface (about 600 sq.m.) was gilded with about 4kg of pure gold. At present it is a museum. The St. Sophia Cathedral is famous for it original mosaic (XI century), and approximately 3000 sq.m. of the frescoes dated for the same period. The ancient legend tells, that Apostle Andrew visited Dnipro hills in 51s year before B.C. He hoisted the Cross on the hill and prophesied about the great city and that Christian faith will shine in this place. On this place in 1754 a stone Andrews Church was built and street was named Andriyvsky Uzviz. This street is a favorite place for outdoor fairs, festivals, and concerts. Art galleries, shops and studios make Andriyvsky Uzviz the best place to shop for Ukrainian crafts and art-works. There are galleries, exhibitions and different museums located here. St. Andrew Church XVIII century architecture pearl dominates this street. Height of the church is 60 m, the external and internal decoration surpasses all imagination. This five-domed church remains the major adornment of the upper city. Within 3 km from the city you can find the Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine. The museum, one of the largest open-air museums in the world, is situated in a picturesque area totaling 150 acres. It is designed to reflect the landscape and the architectural style of the wooden buildings and village life of different Ukrainian regions.

After using airstrikes on cities and military bases, Russian military units moved swiftly to take on Ukraine's seat of government and its largest city in what US officials suspect is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime.

Ukrainian leaders pleaded for help as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee, and hotels in Kyiv were being evacuated amid early indications of an assault.

Ukrainian forces braced for more attacks after enduring for hours a Russian barrage of land- and sea-based missiles, an assault that one senior US defence official described as the first salvo in a likely multi-phase invasion aimed at seizing key population centers and “decapitating” Ukraine's government. Already, Ukraine officials said they had lost control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world's worst nuclear disaster.

In unleashing the largest ground war in Europe since World War II, Putin ignored global condemnation and cascading new sanctions. With a chilling reference to his country's nuclear arsenal, he threatened any country trying to interfere with “consequences you have never seen,” as a once-hoped for diplomatic resolution now appeared impossible.

“Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won't give up its freedom,” Zelenskyy tweeted. His grasp on power increasingly tenuous, he pleaded Thursday for even more severe sanctions than the ones imposed by Western allies and ordered a full military mobilization that would last 90 days.

Zelenskyy said in a video address that 137 “heroes,” including 10 military officers, had been killed and 316 people wounded. The dead included all border guards on the Zmiinyi Island in the Odesa region, which was taken over by Russians.

He concluded an emotional speech by saying that “the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.” He also said the country had heard from Moscow that ”they want to talk about Ukraine's neutral status.""

US President Joe Biden announced new sanctions against Russia, saying Putin “chose this war” and had exhibited a “sinister” view of the world in which nations take what they want by force. Other nations also announced sanctions, or said they would shortly.

“It was always about naked aggression, about Putin's desire for empire by any means necessary — by bullying Russia's neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause,” Biden said.

Blinken said in television interviews that he was convinced that Russia was intent on overthrowing the Ukrainian government, telling CBS that Putin wants to “reconstitute the Soviet empire.""

Fearing a Russian attack on the capital city, thousands of people went deep underground as night fell, jamming Kyiv's subway stations.

At times it felt almost cheerful. Families ate dinner. Children played. Adults chatted. People brought sleeping bags or dogs or crossword puzzles — anything to alleviate the waiting and the long night ahead.

But the exhaustion was clear on many faces. And the worries.

“Nobody believed that this war would start and that they would take Kyiv directly,” said Anton Mironov, waiting out the night in one of the old Soviet metro stations. “I feel mostly fatigue. None of it feels real.”

The invasion began early Thursday with a series of missile strikes, many on key government and military installations, quickly followed by a three-pronged ground assault. Ukrainian and US officials said Russian forces were attacking from the east toward Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city; from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014; and from Belarus to the north.

Zelenskyy, who had earlier cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law, appealed to global leaders, saying that “if you don't help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.”

Though Biden said he had no plans to speak with Putin, the Russian leader did have what the Kremlin described as a “serious and frank exchange"" with French President Emmanuel Macron.

Both sides claimed to have destroyed some of the other's aircraft and military hardware, though little of that could be confirmed.

Hours after the invasion began, Russian forces seized control of the now-unused Chernobyl plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle, presidential adviser Myhailo Podolyak told The Associated Press.

The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said it was told by Ukraine of the takeover, adding that there had been “no casualties or destruction at the industrial site.”

The 1986 disaster occurred when a nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kyiv exploded, sending a radioactive cloud across Europe. The damaged reactor was later covered by a protective shell to prevent leaks.

Alyona Shevtsova, adviser to the commander of Ukraine's ground forces, wrote on Facebook that staff members at the Chernobyl plant had been “taken hostage."" The White House said it was “outraged” by reports of the detentions.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense issued an update saying that though the plant was “likely captured,” the country's forces had halted Russia's advance toward Chernihiv and that it was unlikely that Russia had achieved its planned Day One military objectives.

The chief of the NATO alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said the “brutal act of war"" shattered peace in Europe, joining a chorus of world leaders decrying an attack that could cause massive casualties and topple Ukraine's democratically elected government. The conflict shook global financial markets: Stocks plunged and oil prices soared amid concerns that heating bills and food prices would skyrocket.

Condemnation came not only from the US and Europe, but from South Korea, Australia and beyond — and many governments readied new sanctions. Even friendly leaders like Hungary's Viktor Orban sought to distance themselves from Putin.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he aimed to cut off Russia from the U.K.'s financial markets as he announced sanctions, freezing the assets of all large Russian banks and planning to bar Russian companies and the Kremlin from raising money on British markets.

“Now we see him for what he is — a bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest,” Johnson said of Putin.

The US sanctions will target Russian banks, oligarchs, state-controlled companies and high-tech sectors, Biden said, but they were designed not to disrupt global energy markets. Russian oil and natural gas exports are vital energy sources for Europe.

Zelenskyy urged the US and West to go further and cut the Russians from the SWIFT system, a key financial network that connects thousands of banks around the world. The White House has been reluctant to immediately cut Russia from SWIFT, worried it could cause enormous economic problems in Europe and elsewhere in the West.

While some nervous Europeans speculated about a possible new world war, the US and its NATO partners have shown no indication they would send troops into Ukraine, fearing a larger conflict. NATO reinforced its members in Eastern Europe as a precaution, and Biden said the US was deploying additional forces to Germany to bolster NATO.

European authorities declared the country's airspace an active conflict zone.

After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putin launched the operation on a country the size of Texas that has increasingly tilted toward the democratic West and away from Moscow's sway. The autocratic leader made clear earlier this week that he sees no reason for Ukraine to exist, raising fears of possible broader conflict in the vast space that the Soviet Union once ruled. Putin denied plans to occupy Ukraine, but his ultimate goals remain hazy.

Ukrainians were urged to shelter in place and not to panic.

“Until the very last moment, I didn't believe it would happen. I just pushed away these thoughts,” said a terrified Anna Dovnya in Kyiv, watching soldiers and police remove shrapnel from an exploded shell. “We have lost all faith.”

With social media amplifying a torrent of military claims and counter-claims, it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening on the ground.

Russia and Ukraine made competing claims about damage they had inflicted. Russia's Defense Ministry said it had destroyed scores of Ukrainian air bases, military facilities and drones. It confirmed the loss of one of its Su-25 attack jets, blaming “pilot error,” and said an An-26 transport plane had crashed because of technical failure, killing the entire crew. It did not say how many were aboard.

Russia said it was not targeting cities, but journalists saw destruction in many civilian areas.

Poland's military increased its readiness level, and Lithuania and Moldova moved toward doing the same.

Putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine — a false claim the US predicted he would make as a pretext for invasion. He accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees, saying the military action was a “forced measure.”

Anticipating international condemnation and countermeasures, Putin issued a stark warning to other countries not to meddle.

In a reminder of Russia's nuclear power, he warned that “no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to the destruction and horrible consequences for any potential aggressor.”

KYIV: Two loud blasts were heard in central Kyiv early Friday, an AFP journalist said, as Russian troops push closer to the Ukrainian capital in an invasion of its Western-backed neighbour.

Ukraine's army said that Russia fired on civilian areas of Kyiv but that Ukraine's air defence systems repelled ""two deadly gifts"", according to a post on its verified Facebook page.

Ukrainian foreign minister also tweeted out condemning rocket strikes on Kyiv.

Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv. Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia. Severe all ties. Kick Russia out of everywhete. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) February 25, 2022

Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko said three people were injured with one in critical condition after ""missile debris"" hit a residential building.

He tweeted a photo showing a building with part of its wall torn down and firefighters present at the scene.

Russian missiles and shelling rained down on Ukrainian cities on Thursday after President Vladimir Putin unleashed a full-scale ground invasion and air assault, forcing civilians to shelter on metro systems.

Russia's forces pressed deep into Ukraine as deadly battles reached the outskirts of Kyiv and the West responded with punishing sanctions.

On Thursday, Russian paratroopers wrested control of the Gostomel airfield, on the northwestern outskirts of Kyiv, after swooping in with helicopters and jets from the direction of Belarus.

That was the title of a video posted on Facebook Friday night by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as he vowed to defend his country while standing on a Kyiv street with other leaders of his administration.

""Good evening everyone! Leader of the faction is here. Head of the president’s administration is here. Prime Minister (Denys) Shmyhal is here. (Adviser to the head of the President's Office Mykhailo) Podoliak is here. The President is here,"" said Zelensky, pointing to the various men around him as he spoke, ending with himself.

“We are all here. Our military are here. Citizens and society are here. We are all here defending our independence, our state and it will remain so. Glory to our defenders! Glory to our women defenders! Glory to Ukraine!""

The rest of the group chimed in: ""Glory to heroes!""

Zelensky's post, which has since gone viral online has been widely shared across different social media platforms.

Also on Friday night, Zelensky released a formal national address, confirming that Russian forces were close to the capital, advancing from the north and the east. He added that he was still communicating with world leaders including US President Joe Biden.

""Our main goal is to finish this slaughter,"" Zelensky said in the address. ""Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically.""

Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, was awakened by explosions in the early hours of Friday morning local time, CNN reported.

""Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,"" Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Ukraine, told CNN.

The outlet said its reporters had heard two blasts in central Kyiv and another explosion in the distance.

It wasn't immediately clear how many people had been injured or how much damage the city had sustained.

Social-media users in Kyiv posted videos showing the sky lit up with explosions.

One user showed that what appeared to be an apartment building had been set ablaze.

The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, reported that the building fire injured three people — one of whom was said to be in critical condition.

The Biden administration told House lawmakers during a Thursday briefing that it believed Russian forces were intending to surround Kyiv — home to 3 million people — before capturing it, CNN reported.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday called himself Russia's ""No. 1 target"" but said, ""I stay in the capital, I stay with my people.""

""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" Zelensky added. ""We also have information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv. That's why I am asking Kyivites very much: Be careful, follow the rules of curfew.""

On Thursday, some Ukrainians took refuge in the subways for safety from attacks.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday in what Russian President Vladimir Putin called a ""special military operation"" — essentially declaring war on the country early Thursday morning. Ukraine says more than 100 Ukrainians have been killed in the conflict so far.

The United Nations estimated Thursday evening that more than 100,000 people had been displaced within Ukraine.

Former and current Ukrainian diplomats condemned the Russian attacks, comparing them to World War II.

""Russia, the sin is on you. Shame is indelible,"" Olexander Scherba, Ukraine's former ambassador to Austria, tweeted. ""They say that you will bomb Kiev at 4 o'clock in Kiev. Well, you are true to tradition. Hitler was bombing at the same time.""

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's minister of foreign affairs, urged the West to ""sever all ties"" with Russia.

""Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,"" Kuleba said on Twitter. ""Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one. Stop Putin. Isolate Russia.""

Mykhailo Podoliak, an advisor to Zelensky, argued, ""Just like in 1941, now the attacker can only get the hatred of the people and nothing more,"" according to The Kyiv Independent.",https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-capital-kyiv-attacked-missiles-2022-2
