The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting as Russia began an attack on eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s ambassador at the U.N. told the Security Council that Putin had “declared war on Ukraine.” Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya then pressed his Russian counterpart to promise that Russia would not shell and bomb Ukrainian cities. As members were speaking, President Vladimir Putin announced on Russian state television that he was launching a “special military operation” in eastern Ukraine, and he warned other countries that any attempt to interfere would lead to consequences never seen.

The United States ambassador to the United Nations (UN) urged the intergovernmental organization to take immediate action as Russia invaded Ukraine in what the president called an “unprovoked” attack.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield warned that the UN’s peace-keeping arm needed to draft an emergency resolution amid dwindling diplomatic options in what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to convince Russia to stop its attack that had already begun Wednesday night. The UN Security Council was expected to hold an emergency meeting Thursday after Thomas-Greenfield referred to the military conflict as a “message of war” sent by Russia to the entire world.

After reminding the UN Security Council during remarks Wednesday night that the U.S. had basically predicted what Russia was going to do to Ukraine, Thomas-Greenfield later acknowledged the attack was already underway while she was speaking.

“At the exact time as we are gathered in the Council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war in total disdain for the responsibility of this Council,” Thomas-Greenfield, the second Black woman to serve as UN ambassador, said late Wednesday night. “This is a grave emergency. The Council will need to act, and we will put a resolution on the table tomorrow.”

Why did Russia invade Ukraine?

Russia has been accused of manufacturing military tension with Ukraine in order to create a false narrative to support initiating war against the neighboring country. International relations experts suspect the real reason is to prevent Ukraine from joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a move that would align Ukraine with Western nations — like the U.S. — that Russian President Vladimir Putin perceives as a threat to his tyrannical ambitions.

It was under that context that Thomas-Greenfield, earlier Wednesday night before the Russian invasion of Ukraine was reported to have begun, suggested UN member China was being sympathetic to Putin. China previously tried to extend the blame beyond Russia to other nations, including Ukraine.

“So let us be clear: ‘All parties’ are not culpable here. There is no middle ground,” Thomas-Greenfield told the UN Security Council. “Calling for both sides to de-escalate only gives Russia a pass. Russia is the aggressor here.”

What can the UN Security Council do?

If the UN Security Council doesn’t take immediate action, Thomas-Greenfield suggested that would set a precedent and could embolden other nations to take similar military conflict that doesn’t meet the international standard for war.

“The Security Council is charged with adjudicating threats to peace and security,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Russia is bypassing it entirely and taking matters into its own hands. And that undermines the institution. It undermines everyone who participates in it.”

NPR reported that a resolution from the UN Security Council “would declare that Russia is violating the U.N. Charter, international law and a 2015 council resolution on Ukraine” and “urge Russia to come back into compliance immediately.”

It was unclear what else a UN Security Council resolution could do amid the ongoing conflict.

Russia previously successfully annexed — took by force — the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.

Black history

Thomas-Greenfield, along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, is among two high-ranking Black members of President Joe Biden’s administration involved in trying to resolve the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where a growing number of Russian military troops had been gathering along the border in recent weeks.

Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. was right about Russia’s intentions for war with Ukraine all along.

‘We predicted Russia’s false flag attacks, the misinformation, the theatrical emergency meetings, and the cyber attacks,” she said.

What’s next?

Meanwhile, Biden was set to announce yet another round of economic sanctions against Russia, neither of which appear to have deterred its resolve for war nor its disdain for the West, and the U.S., in particular.

“Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and our Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,” Biden said Wednesday night. “The world will hold Russia accountable.”

Who is Linda Thomas-Greenfield?

Thomas-Greenfield is a career diplomat who has held comparably lofty posts in the U.S. government, including serving as ambassador to Liberia, as director-general of the Foreign Service and assistant secretary for African affairs. Much of her time in leadership positions in the State Department was during President Barack Obama‘s administration.

Thomas-Greenfield was all but forced to retire in 2017 after then-President Donald Trump’s first Secretary of State Rex Tillerson began scaling back career diplomats at an alarming rate, firing most of the department’s senior African American diplomats in the process.

Thomas-Greenfield is the fifth Black person and the second Black woman to serve as ambassador to the United Nations. Susan Rice previously served as the ambassador to the United Nations from 2009 to 2013 before she became the national security adviser from 2013-2017.

United Nations: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has termed Russian President Vladimir Putin announcement of a special military operation in Ukraine as the saddest moment in my tenure, while Security Council members blasted the Russian leader for the unprovoked and unjustified action and for delivering a message of war.

Putin on Thursday announced a special military operation in eastern Ukraine, claiming it's intended to protect civilians.

In a televised address, Putin said Russia's move to launch a special military operation in Ukraine came in response to threats emanating from that country. He also warned other countries that if they attempted to interfere with the Russian military operation, they would see consequences they have never seen.

“This is the saddest moment in my tenure as Secretary-General of the United Nations. I started this meeting of the Security Council addressing President Putin and telling him from the bottom of my heart: Stop your troops from an offensive against Ukraine, give peace a chance because too many people have died,” Guterres told reporters at the UN headquarters here as he came out of an emergency Security Council meeting on Ukraine on the night of 23 February, 2022.

“During the meeting President Putin announced a special military operation' in the Donbas and required the Ukrainian troops to lay down their arms,” he noted.

""So, in the present circumstances I must change my appeal,” Guterres said.

“I must say, President Putin: In the name of humanity bring your troops back to Russia. In the name of humanity, do not allow to start in Europe what could be the worst war since the beginning of the century, with consequences not only devastating for Ukraine, not only tragic for the Russian Federation,"" but for the entire world, he said.

The UN chief said the impact of the attack ""we cannot even foresee in relation to the consequences for the global economy in a moment when we are emerging from the COVID (pandemic) and so many developing countries absolutely need to have space for the recovery which would be very, very difficult, with the high prices of oil, with the end of exports of wheat from Ukraine, and with the rising interest rates caused by instability in international markets.”

The announcement by Putin came just at the time the Council was meeting on the situation in Ukraine, the second such meeting this week and the fourth since 31 January, 2022.

Council members made their remarks calling for de-escalation, restraint and diplomacy just as explosions and artillery fire were beginning to be reported from eastern Ukraine. Several Council members, including permanent members US, UK and France, took the floor again after making their initial statements to react to Putin's announcement.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, “At the exact time as we are gathered in the Council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war in total disdain for the responsibility of this Council. This is a grave emergency. The Council will need to act, and we will put a resolution on the table tomorrow.”

She added that earlier in her remarks, “I said that we predicted Russia's false flag attacks, the misinformation, the theatrical emergency meetings, and the cyber-attacks but one piece had not come to pass. Unfortunately, while we've been meeting in the Security Council tonight, it appears that President Putin has ordered that last step.”

UK Ambassador Barbara Woodward said, “As we sat in this Chamber urging Russia to step back, President Putin announced special military operations on Ukrainian territory"".

“This is unprovoked and unjustified. This is a grave day for Ukraine and for the principles of the United Nations,” Woodward said, adding that the UK and its partners have been clear that there will be consequences for Russia's actions. “We fully support the United States call for a UN Security Council resolution. This Council must do all it can to stop war and uphold the Charter.”

French envoy Nicolas De Riviere said, “At the very moment when we were urgently meeting to try to prevent the worst and the outbreak of war, we learned, as you all did, that the President of the Russian Federation has ordered a special military operation in the Donbas and that Russia will try to demilitarise Ukraine"".

“Russia has thus made the choice of war,” he said, voicing his country's condemnation in the strongest terms of the launching of these operations.

“This decision, announced at the very moment when this Council is meeting, illustrates the contempt in which Russia holds international law and the United Nations,” the French envoy said.

He added that Russia must be held accountable before the Security Council and this is why France will join its partners in the Council to prepare in the coming hours a resolution condemning the war led by Moscow.

“We call on all members of this Council to support us in these tragic circumstances. We call on the Russian Federation to respect international humanitarian law in all circumstances, and we call for the protection of and respect for all civilians, including vulnerable people, women, children and humanitarian personnel,” Riviere said.

Ireland's Ambassador Geraldine Byrne Nason said when she spoke earlier in the Council, she had said that the path for diplomacy and the path for dialogue was perilously narrow.

""And I didn't realise how narrow, and indeed how close to the precipice we really were just over an hour ago.”

“We now see that that path has been closed by the announcement of a military aggression on the part of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. That is something that we roundly condemn. We stand with the people of Ukraine tonight with every man, woman and child who is seeing this news as we did as we sat here in the chamber, and whose lives are at risk,” Nason said.

She said it is now time for the Council to stand up and to assume its responsibility and to speak out in the strongest possible terms about this act of aggression.

A visibly agitated and upset Ukrainian envoy at the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, told Russia's Ambassador Vasily Nebenzia, President of the Security Council for the month of February, that he should relinquish his duties as Chair, and call Putin and (Russian Foreign Minister Sergey) Lavrov to stop aggression.

He welcomed the decision of some Council Members to meet as soon as possible to consider the resolution that will ""condemn the aggression that you launched on my people. There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell, Ambassador.”

Nebenzia said, “We aren't being aggressive against the Ukrainian people but against the junta that is in power in Kyiv. This isn't called a war, it is called a special military operation in the Donbas.”
