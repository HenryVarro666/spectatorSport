2:53 P.M. EDT

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for joining. I just — at the top, I want to say, you know, incredibly sorry for the delay today. We really try for this not to ever happen. And just some scheduling and logistical challenges today put us a little bit back. So, again, true apologies, and we know how important your time is.

So, that being said, you know, welcome to the call. This call is on background. It is attributable to a “senior administration official.” And this call is embargoed until the end of the call.

For your awareness and not for reporting, the speaker on this call is [senior administration official]. And with that, I’ll turn it over to you to give some remarks, and then we’ll take some questions. Thanks, again, everyone.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, [senior administration official]. And I’ll just reiterate: Everybody, thanks for your patience today. And I’ll, with that, just get right to it.

You all have hopefully now seen the readout that has gone out. So, just building on that with a little bit more detail for all of you, you know, the call between President Biden and President Xi this morning lasted approximately two hours. Of course, it was conducted by a secure video link.

I would say the conversation was direct. It was substantive and it was detailed. The two leaders spent the preponderance of their time discussing Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, as well as the implications of the crisis for U.S.-China relations and the international order.

President Biden shared with President Xi a detailed review of how things have developed to this point, his assessment of the situation today, and President Biden underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.



The President described our assessment of Putin’s actions and his miscalculations. He also described the unity of the United States and its Allies and partners, the unprecedented coordination with our European, NATO, and Indo-Pacific partners, and the overwhelming global unity and condemnation of Russia — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as the support for Ukraine.

President Biden made clear the implication and consequences of China providing material support — if China were to provide material support — to Russia as it prosecutes its brutal war in Ukraine, not just for China’s relationship with the United States but for the wider world.

And he stressed concerns, as you’ve heard us speak about more broadly, that Russia is spreading disinformation about biological weapons in Ukraine as a pretext for a false-flag operation and underscored concerns about echoing such disinformation.

President Xi raised Taiwan. President Biden reiterated that the United States remains committed to our one-China policy and is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiqués, and the Six Assurances. And he underscored the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.

The two leaders also discussed the importance of managing competition between the two countries — between the United States and China — of addressing areas of strategic risk and maintaining open lines of communication. And to that end, they tasked their teams to follow up on the leaders’ discussion in the days and weeks ahead.

Of course, today’s conversation followed up on National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan’s meeting with his counterpart in Rome earlier this week in which the two agreed that the two presidents would speak — again, as both sides believe that there is no substitute for leader-to-leader engagement.

And, as you all know, this call comes amid the intensive engagement we’ve had with allies and partners in Europe and the Indo-Pacific in recent weeks.

And with that, I will be happy to take your questions.

Q Hi, [senior administration official]. Thanks for doing this. First, I wanted to ask if President Biden warned Xi Jinping specifically about sanctions, or did he refer to more vague consequences should China provide any support for Russia in the war? And regardless, what was Xi’s response to that?

Yeah, I appreciate that.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Of course. Well, thanks, Michael. So, you know, as I mentioned, the President described the implications, you know, if China provides material support to Russia as it prosecutes this brutal war, but I’m not going to talk — I’m not going to, sort of, publicly lay out our options from here.

We’re going to continue to talk directly with China, as well as to our Allies and partners, about the broader situation. And I will let the PRC characterize what Xi Jinping’s comments were.

Q Thank you. Do you have an assessment of whether or not China has made a decision to go down this road with Russia?

And then, second: More broadly, was there any talk of, sort of, the commercial ramifications that have happened for Russia as a result of this war, with big Western companies leaving and the prospect that that could happen to China if they were to get involved in assisting?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, Aamer. On your first question, I’m not going to comment on specifics at this time.

On the question about the actions — the economic responses to Russia and the private sector: Yeah, I would say, you know, the President, you know, really laid out in a lot of detail the unified response from not only, you know, governments around the world but also the private sector, to Russia’s brutal aggression in Ukraine.

And, you know, the President made clear that, you know, there would be — that there would likely be consequences for those who are — who would — who would step in to support Russia at this time.

Q Thank you. Can you tell me if the President expressly asked Xi — Xi Jinping — to intercede with Moscow, with Putin, to stop the war and specifically to withdraw from (inaudible)?

And did Xi offer in any way to use his influence with Putin to end the aggression?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks, Ellen. Yeah, look, you know, the call wasn’t really — and I mean, the President really wasn’t making specific requests of China. He was laying out his assessment of the situation, what he thinks makes sense, and the implications of certain actions.

You know, I think our view is that China will make its own decisions, and so I’d describe that as sort of the nature of the call. And again, on any response from President Xi, you know, you’d have to talk to Beijing.

Q Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for doing the call. Can you tell us if President Xi made any guarantees to President Biden that he would not help Russia?

And did the President come away from the call with a sense that President Xi is ready to condemn the invasion? Because China’s still hasn’t done that publicly. Did President Xi condemn the invasion in this call, or did President Biden come away with this with a sense that he will do so? Thank you.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, look, on your first question, you know, China will make its own decisions. And I think you probably have seen the readout that they have put out; I would refer you to that as their characterization of President Xi’s words.

You know, as I said, I think the President was — President Biden was candid and direct in discussing his assessment of the situation and, you know, what he believes would be necessary, in order to find a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.

But, you know, I think, in terms of what President Xi said, again, I’m going to leave it to the Chinese side to characterize their words.

MODERATOR: Can we do our next question, please?

Q Thanks so much. And thanks for doing this. Two questions for you. Did President Biden get the sense that President Xi was caught off guard by the nature of the Russian invasion and how it’s gone? And during this two-hour call, did Xi ever refer to it as an invasion?

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sorry, I was taking down notes to make sure I remember your questions.



You know, look, on the first question: You know, I think, you know, the National Security Advisor has — has spoken publicly about our assessment of Beijing’s reaction to the invasion. And so, I will just point you to his comments. I don’t have them exactly in front of me, but I think he’s been on the record about this.



You know, and in terms of how Xi referred to — you know, referred to the situation, again, I would just point you to their own words as they have characterized them.

Q Hi, [senior administration official]. Thanks for doing the call. Can you just share a little bit of color on whether the President felt more or less optimistic about where China st- — where President Xi stands on the issue of Ukraine after this call?



And just a follow-up: The Chinese readout suggests that President Xi complained to President Biden about people in the U.S. sending wrong signals to Taiwan’s independence forces. Can you detail President Biden’s response to this? Thanks.

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks so much, Patsy. Look, I — you know, I think, as we felt with the conversation in Rome with Director Yang earlier this week and the conversation with, you know, President Xi here today, this was really about President Biden being able to lay out very clearly in substantial detail, with a lot of facts, and a lot of just — you know, really walking President Xi through the situation, making very, very clear our views, the views of others, what we have laid out in the previous months and the actions we’re taking now.



And I think it was the — I think, from our perspective, we will — we will see what decisions China makes in the days and weeks ahead.



And so, I think it was sort of less about coming away with a particular view out of the conversation today and more about making sure, again, that they were able to really have that direct, candid and detailed and very substantive conversation at the leader level. And we know there really is no replacement for that.



So, that’s how I would think about the conversation today.



In terms of the question about Taiwan, President Biden was very clear that our policy has not changed, that — you know, he reiterated our one-China policy based on the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Communiqués, the Six Assurances.



And he underscored, as well, concerns about Beijing’s coercive and provocative actions across the Taiwan Strait. President Biden made clear that we remain opposed to any unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.



And, you know, I would just remind, obviously, that President Biden himself voted for the Taiwan Relations Act, and he’s firmly committed to the principles in it, and that the Biden administration has consistently demonstrated rock-solid support for Taiwan and will continue to do so.



But, again, you know, President Biden’s response was really about just reaffirming our continued, consistent policy — very longstanding policy — while underscoring concerns about Beijing’s coercive and provocative actions across the Strait.

MODERATOR: Great. Thanks, [senior administration official]. And thanks, everyone, for joining.



You know, again, very sorry for the delay. You know, I know we’ll have a press briefing shortly, so hopefully more questions can be taken there. And then if there’s still more that you all need, we’re here to provide any sort of help that you might — you might need.



So, just as a reminder, this call was on background, attributable to a “senior administration official.” And the embargo on the contents of the call have now lifted.



So, thanks again, everyone. Have a good day.

The White House said President Biden warned Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday of the ""consequences"" should China ""provide material support"" to Russia amid the invasion of Ukraine, while maintaining that the U.S. policy toward Taiwan ""has not changed.""

Biden and Xi spoke on a secure video call for nearly two hours Friday morning. Biden took the call, which started at 9:03 a.m. ET, in the White House Situation Room. The call concluded at 10:53 a.m. ET.

""President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China (PRC),"" the White House said, hours after the conclusion of the call. ""The conversation focused on Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.""

The White House said Biden ""outlined the views of the United States and our allies and partners on this crisis.""

""President Biden detailed our efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion, including by imposing costs on Russia,"" the White House said.

""The president underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis,"" the White House added. ""The two leaders also agreed on the importance of maintaining open lines of communication, to manage the competition between our two countries.""

Meanwhile, the White House said Biden ""reiterated that U.S. policy on Taiwan has not changed, and emphasized that the United States continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo.""

CENTCOM COMMANDER WEIGHS IN ON PUTIN'S EFFORTS TO RECRUIT FOREIGN FIGHTERS

""The two leaders tasked their teams to follow up on today’s conversation in the critical period ahead,"" the White House said.

Biden ignored questions Friday after about his message to Xi after he made remarks about a new government health research project.

Shortly after the conclusion of the meeting, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Xi underscored the ""severe challenges"" around the globe.

""The Ukraine crisis is something we don't want to see,"" the Chinese Foreign Ministry reported Xi said. ""Relevant events once again show that state-to-state relations cannot go to the point of confrontation. Conflict and confrontation are not in anyone's interests. Peace and security are the most treasured treasures of the international community.""

""As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the world's two largest economies, we must not only lead the development of China-US relations on the right track, but also shoulder our due international responsibilities and make efforts for world peace and tranquility,"" the Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said.

U.S. intelligence officials said Russia asked China for military and economic aid following its invasion of Ukraine. In an attempt to protect intelligence sources, U.S. officials have been reluctant to detail what type of aid is being sought.

A senior administration official said this week that the Biden administration has ""deep concerns"" about China’s ""alignment"" with Russia amid Moscow’s multi-front war against Ukraine.

The official shared those concerns after White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with his Chinese counterpart, director of Chinese Foreign Affairs Commission Yang Jiechi, Monday in Rome, Italy.

""We do have deep concerns about China’s alignment with Russia at this time, and the national security adviser was direct about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions,"" the official said, without commenting directly to the reports that Russia had requested aid from China after invading Ukraine.

The official, though, maintained that the Biden administration is ""communicating directly and privately to China about our concerns about the kinds of support that other countries might be providing to Russia.""

BIDEN ADMIN HAS 'DEEP CONCERNS' ABOUT CHINA'S 'ALIGNMENT' WITH RUSSIA AMID WAR AGAINST UKRAINE, OFFICIAL SAYS

China has yet to condemn the invasion, though an official praised the Ukrainian people on Wednesday.

""We will always respect your state, we will develop relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We will respect the path chosen by Ukrainians, because this is the sovereign right of every nation,"" China's ambassador to Ukraine, Fan Xiangong, who relocated with the Chinese embassy from Kyiv to Lviv after Russian forces invaded on Feb. 24, told Lviv officials on Monday, according to the Lviv regional government.

""In this situation, which you have now, we will act responsibly. We have seen how great the unity of the Ukrainian people is, and that means its strength,"" Fan added.

German news outlet BILD reported that Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Viktorovich Lavrov was halfway to Beijing Wednesday night when his plane turned around abruptly and returned to Moscow. It’s unclear if Putin called him back or if Chinese abruptly canceled any planned meeting. Fox News has not yet independently verified the report.

The White House, this week, warned China of ""consequences"" should Beijing provide aid to Russia.

""The world is watching closely,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. ""There will be consequences should they violate our sanctions.""

But Russia has denied reports claiming they made the request for aid from China, and China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian dismissed allegations Beijing agreed to send such aid to Russia as ""misinformation."" He maintained that China remains ""completely objective, impartial and constructive,"" on the ""Ukraine issue,"" refusing to call the conflict a ""war.""

RUSSIA ASKED CHINA FOR MILITARY, ECONOMIC AID IN UKRAINE CONFLICT FOLLOWING INVASION

Zhao has also repeated the Russian line about U.S.-backed Ukrainian laboratories near the border creating bioweapons – claims Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department have all unequivocally denied.

The White House warned last week that Russia could use ""chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine"" or could create a ""false flag operation"" using them, after the Kremlin accused the U.S. of being involved in biological weapons research at Ukrainian labs, and said they have seen ""Chinese officials echo these conspiracy theories.""

And a senior defense official also said Russia's allegations against the U.S. are ""a piece of the Russian playbook here: claim they're the victims, create a false narrative to try to justify their own aggressive actions.""

WHITE HOUSE WARNS OF 'CONSEQUENCES' IF CHINA PROVIDES AID TO RUSSIA: 'THE WORLD IS WATCHING CLOSELY'

""It is absurd. It is laughable. It is untrue,"" the official said.

This week, Sullivan, speaking with the secretary of the Russian Security Council on Wednesday, called for Russia to ""stop attacking"" Ukrainian cities and towns, and warned of ""consequences"" should Russia decide to use any chemical or biological weapons on Ukraine.

Sullivan spoke with Gen. Nikolay Patrushev on Wednesday as Ukraine and Russia continued talks on the current crisis.

Zelenskyy delivered an address to Congress Wednesday during which he showed a video demonstrating the death and destruction suffered by Ukrainian civilians, especially women, children and the elderly as Russian troops have bombarded cities and advanced toward the capital of Kyiv in the three weeks since the invasion began.

In response, Biden announced an additional $800 million in military aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, amounting to a total of $1 billion in U.S. aid allocated since Saturday.

BIDEN APPROVES MORE ANTI-AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS, DRONES FOR UKRAINE, WARNS OF 'LONG AND DIFFICULT BATTLE'

The new package includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems; 2,000 Javelins, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems; 100 unmanned drones; 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns; more than 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds; 25,000 sets of body armor; and 25,000 helmets. The equipment will be transferred directly from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military, Biden said.

Friday's call was the fourth engagement between the U.S. and Chinese presidents since Biden took office.

Biden and Xi last spoke during a virtual meeting on Nov. 15.

Senior administration officials told Fox News that during that call, Biden did not explicitly discuss the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic Xi, but instead maintained the importance of ""transparency"" in global health matters, focusing on ""broader health security issues"" in an effort to bring ""an end"" to the pandemic.",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-xi-video-call-russia-war-in-ukraine

US President Joe Biden told CNN that his call with Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday ""went well.""

According to the White House, Biden ""described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia"" in a nearly two-hour phone call with China's leader.

""The President underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis,"" the White House said.

The White House added that the two leaders ""also agreed on the importance of maintaining open lines of communication.""

A senior administration official, meanwhile, said that Biden's phone call was ""direct,"" ""substantive"" and ""detailed.""

The bulk of their discussion centered on the war in Ukraine, and the implications the crisis would have both on US-China relations and the ""international order,"" the official said.

Biden provided an assessment of Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in his conflict with Ukraine, the official said, and ""made clear"" the implications and consequences of potentially assisting Russia in its war.

More on the call: The secure video call between Biden and Xi began at 9:03 a.m. ET on Friday. It lasted one hour and 50 minutes, and concluded at 10:53 a.m EDT, the White House said.

According to Chinese state media CCTV, Xi told Biden, ""conflict and confrontation are not in the interests of anyone,"" and ""China and the US have a responsibility to work for peace.""

Here's a full readout of the call from the White House:

""President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke today with President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The conversation focused on Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

3,93ba91cf-f2f0-4e42-86da-5018e6e7bf66,['Julian Borger'],2022-03-18 00:00:00,"Joe Biden spoke for nearly two hours with Xi Jinping as the US sought to dissuade China from backing Russia’s war on Ukraine.

A White House account of the call on Friday said that the US president “described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians”.

A senior administration official said there would be consequences “not just for China’s relationship with the United States, but for the wider world”, but would not give more details on whether Biden had gone into specifics on possible sanctions, other than to point out what had happened to Russia as an example.

“The president really laid out in a lot of detail the unified response from not only governments around the world, but also the private sector to Russia’s brutal aggression in Ukraine,” the official said. “The president made clear that there would likely be consequences for those who would step in to support Russia at this time.”

Biden did not make any direct requests to Xi to persuade Putin to end the attack.

“The president really wasn’t making specific requests of China. He was laying out his assessment of the situation … and the implications of certain actions,” the official said. “Our view is that China will make its own decisions.”

The Chinese account of the conversation in the state news agency, Xinhua, said it was “candid and in-depth” but gave little detail about Ukraine. The report said that Xi expressed the wish that the war was not happening, but gave no sign of what the Chinese leader’s intentions were towards support for Moscow.

Xi said the situation in Ukraine had developed to such a point “that China does not want to see” according to the report, which stuck to Beijing’s policy of avoiding the words “war” or “invasion”.

Beijing’s readout of the call did not suggest any Chinese role in ending the war. It quoted Xi as referring to a favourite aphorism, “Let he who tied the bell on the tiger’s neck take it off”, a seeming reference to China’s position that the US and Nato are ultimately to blame for Vladimir Putin’s actions.

Beijing blames the war on Nato’s refusal to rule out future Ukrainian membership of the alliance, and western supplies of weapons to the country. Xi also expressed concern about the impact on Taiwan, which he has vowed to restore to rule from Beijing.

Xi claimed “some people in the United States are sending the wrong signals to the ‘Taiwan independence’ forces, which is very dangerous”.

“If the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have a subversive impact on the relationship between the two countries,” Xi added. The US “One China” policy acknowledges that Taiwan is part of China, but Washington does not recognise Beijing has sovereignty over the island.

Before the call, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Biden would question Xi about Beijing’s “rhetorical support” of Putin and an “absence of denunciation” of Russia’s invasion.

US officials fear that Xi has already decided to give Russia economic assistance and some military aid, though it unclear what difference Chinese arms supplies would make on the battlefield, as the more sophisticated weapons, like drones, would not be compatible with Russian equipment.

France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, both had hour-long conversations with Putin on Friday morning,

According to Scholz’s office, the German leader had “put pressure on [Putin] to introduce a ceasefire as soon as possible, to improve the humanitarian situation and to make progress in the search for a diplomatic solution for the conflict”.

A spokesman gave no details on whether any progress had been made, adding that the conversation had been focused on the war and attempts to stop it.

In the Kremlin’s version of the conversation, put out ahead of the statement from Berlin, it was described as “harsh but businesslike”, with Putin complaining about war crimes he said had been committed by the Ukrainian army, referring to attacks he said had taken place in the eastern cities of Donetsk and Makiivka that had led to “numerous deaths”.

“These war crimes are being ignored by the west,” Putin said according to Russian news agency reports referring to the Kremlin. Putin reportedly told Scholz the Russian army “is doing everything to avoid civilian victims”.

According to the Kremlin’s account, Putin accused Ukraine of trying to “slow down” the discussions with Russia, and said that the government in Kyiv was making “unrealistic suggestions”. It added that the Russian leadership was “ready to seek solutions appropriate to its basic views”.

The Kremlin account of Putin’s call with Macron said the Russian president had talked about the Kremlin’s approach to peace talks with Ukraine but gave no details. The Elysée Palace said Macron had said he was “extremely concerned” about Mariupol, which has suffered constant shelling. According to the Kremlin version, Putin repeated the claim that Russian forces were doing everything possible to avoid civilian casualties.

The US, UK, France, Albania, Ireland and Norway have all accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine, and the prosecutor at the international criminal court has begun collecting evidence. The UN’s international court of justice has ordered Russia to halt its invasion, declaring that it had no evidence to support Russian claims, used to justify the attack, that Ukrainian forces were committing genocide against Russian speakers in the east of the country.

The UN security council met on Friday to hear a repetition of Russia’s unsubstantiated claims, circulated after the invasion as a justification, that Ukraine had run biological weapons laboratories with US help.

“The UN was clear that there was no evidence. It was nonsense then. It’s nonsense now,” the UK permanent representative, Barbara Woodward, said afterwards. “And as far as we’re concerned, frankly, this is the disinformation of the desperate. Things are clearly not going well for Russia in Ukraine.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/18/joe-biden-xi-jinping-call-china-russia-ukraine

The White House, in statement released Friday afternoon, detailed President Biden's nearly two-hour virtual meeting with President Xi, which focused largely on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Biden ""described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians,"" while also underscoring his support for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict, according to the White House.

A senior Biden administration official described the conversation as direct, substantive and detailed.

According to the White House, Biden explained to Xi ""the views of the United States and our Allies and partners"" on the invasion, as well as their ""efforts to prevent and then respond to the invasion,"" including the sanctions imposed on Russia.

Biden ""described the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians"" and ""underscored his support for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.""

Biden did not lay out specific requests to China, the senior official added, but instead described in detail how the U.S. views the invasion, the international response and the possible implications if China or any other nation were to materially support Moscow.

“China will make its own decisions,” they added.

Biden and Xi also agreed on the ""importance of maintaining open lines of communication, to manage the competition between our two countries,"" the White House said, with Biden detailing to Xi that the United States' ""policy on Taiwan has not changed, and emphasized that the United States continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo.""

""The two leaders tasked their teams to follow up on today’s conversation in the critical period ahead,"" the readout concluded.

The U.S.-China relationship, long fraught, has only become more strained since the start of Biden’s presidency. Biden has repeatedly criticized China for military provocations against Taiwan, human rights abuses against ethnic minorities and efforts to squelch pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong.

But the relationship may have reached a new low with the Russian invasion.

In the days after Putin deployed Russian forces in Ukraine, Xi’s government tried to distance itself from Russia’s offensive but avoided the criticism many other nations have leveled at Moscow. At other moments, Beijing’s actions have been provocative including amplifying unverified Russian claims that Ukraine ran chemical and biological weapons labs with U.S. support.

Earlier this week, the U.S. informed Asian and European allies that American intelligence had determined that China had signaled to Russia that it would be willing to provide both military support for the campaign in Ukraine and financial backing to help stave off the impact of severe sanctions imposed by the West.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday reiterated that the Biden administration remains concerned that China is considering providing military equipment. He said Biden would make clear to Xi “that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs.”

The White House says China has been sending mixed messages. There were initial signs that Chinese state-owned banks were pulling back from financing Russian activities, according to a senior Biden administration official.

But there have also been public comments by Chinese officials who expressed support for Russia being a strategic partner.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi met in Rome this week for an intense, seven-hour talk about the Russian invasion and other issues.

Ahead of the Rome talks, Sullivan said the U.S. wouldn’t abide China or any other country helping Russia work around economy-jarring sanctions inflicted by the U.S. and other allies since the Feb. 24 invasion.

Sullivan also said the administration determined China knew that Putin “was planning something” before the invasion of Ukraine, but the Chinese government “may not have understood the full extent” of what Putin had in mind.

Xi and Putin met in early February, weeks before the invasion, with the Russian leader traveling to Beijing for the start of the Winter Olympics. The two leaders issued a 5,000-word statement declaring limitless “friendship.”

Beijing’s leaders would like to be supportive of Russia, but they also recognize how badly the Russian military action is going as an overmatched Ukrainian military has put up stiff resistance, according to a Western official familiar with current intelligence assessments.

The official said Beijing is weighing the potential “reputational blowback” of being associated with the Russian camp. The Chinese response to Russia’s request for help is still being formulated, the official said.

Though seen as siding with Russia, China has also reached out to Ukraine, with its ambassador to the country on Monday quoted as saying: “China is a friendly country for the Ukrainian people. As an ambassador, I can responsibly say that China will forever be a good force for Ukraine, both economically and politically.”

“We have seen how great the unity of the Ukrainian people is, and that means its strength,” Fan Xianrong was quoted by Ukraine’s state news service Ukrinform as telling regional authorities in the western city of Lviv, where the Chinese Embassy has relocated to.

Separately, in a reminder of China’s threat to assert its claim to Taiwan by force, the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Friday, just hours before the Biden-Xi call, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said.

Any conflict over the self-governing island democracy stands to involve the U.S., which is legally obligated to ensure Taiwan can defend itself and treats threats to the island as matters of “grave concern.”

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said he had no details about the ship’s passage through the strait, but added that “I believe the carrier has its routine training schedule, and it should not be linked with the communication between Chinese and American leaders.”

State media quoted Xi as saying China-U.S. relations had yet to “emerge from the dilemma created by the previous U.S. administration, but instead encountered more and more challenges,” singling out Taiwan as one area in particular.

“If the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have an undermining impact on the relationship between the two countries,” Xi reportedly told Biden.",https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2022/03/18/biden-looks-to-assess-where-china-s-xi-stands-on-russia-war

The call is 'part of our ongoing efforts to maintain open lines of communication between the United States and the PRC [People's Republic of China],' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement on Thursday.

'The two Leaders will discuss managing the competition between our two countries as well as Russia's war against Ukraine and other issues of mutual concern,' she noted.

Biden and Xi last spoke in November, when they held a three and a half hour virtual meeting.

Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan was in Rome earlier this week, where he was trying to keep China - Russia's most powerful diplomatic partner - from coming to President Vladimir Putin's aid in his invasion of the Ukraine.

Putin was in Beijing for the opening of the Winter Olympic Games where he met with Xi.

China appears to be distancing itself from Russia with officials saying their country would 'never' attack Ukraine.

Fan Xianrong, Beijing's ambassador, said China 'will never attack Ukraine and will 'respect the path chosen by Ukrainians.' Zhao Lijian, China's foreign ministry spokesman, then endorsed Fan's comments on Thursday.

We have seen how great the unity of the Ukrainian people is, and that means its strength' - Fan Xianrong, Beijing's ambassador to Ukraine Advertisement

At the time of their meeting Putin and Xi issued a 5,000-word statement declaring limitless 'friendship.'

And China initially seemed to support Russia's menacing of Ukraine, with the joint statement denouncing 'NATO's eastward expansion' - which has been Moscow's position.

Beijing has offered to act as mediator between Russia and the Ukraine but it also denounced trade and financial sanctions against Russia.

Meanwhile, Sullivan met for seven hours with China's top diplomat, Communist Party Politburo member Yang Jiechi, on Monday.

Ukraine was the main topic in what a senior administration official called an 'intense' conversation.

Officials said Sullivan made clear there would be 'severe' and 'significant' consequences should China assist Russia.

'What was conveyed by our National Security Advisor in this meeting is that should they provide military or other assistance that, of course, violates sanctions or supports the war effort, that there will be significant consequences,' Psaki said at Monday's press briefing.

Ahead of Sullivan's meeting American intelligence suggested that Moscow had reached out to Beijing for support.

The Kremlin was said to have asked for ration packs for its troops, drones, armoured vehicles, intelligence equipment and relief for economic sanctions.

Beijing also initially refused to refer to a 'war' or 'invasion' in Ukraine, instead preferring Moscow's description of a 'special military operation'.

But as the tide of the conflict has turned against Putin's men and the civilian death toll has mounted, Chinese diplomats have slowly dropped their support.

Wang Yi, the foreign minister, said last week that China 'laments' the conflict and the civilian death toll, before referring to it as a 'war' for the first time.

Yi then spoke out again this week to say that sanctions levelled against Russia 'should not affect' China, before Zhao's comments today.

It means that much of the support Putin appeared to be counting on ahead of giving the order to attack has now melted away, leaving him increasingly isolated on the world stage.

Biden's administration is hoping China can use its influence with Russia to help end the conflict. The U.S. has pushed Beijing to take up some economic sanctions against Moscow - to no avial.

The Russian and Ukraine conflict is entering its fourth week with Russian forces haven taken control of large sections of Ukraine, particularly in the east and south.

The Pentagon estimated that in t he three weeks of fighting, 7,000 Russian soldiers have been killed — greater than the number of American troops killed over 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan, the New York Times reported.

The White House has rallied NATO allies and the West to impose harsh economic sanctions on Putin, his inner circle, the oligarchs who became billionaires with his policies and Russian banks in response to Kremlin's invasion of the Ukraine.

The administration has also sent $2 billion in military assistance - including $800 million in new aid announced Wednesday - to the Ukraine and addressed the growing humanitarian crisis coming out that nation.

Biden´s national security team was somewhat surprised that Pacific partners - Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea - moved so quickly to hit Russia with sanctions following the invasion, a U.S. official familiar with the administration´s thinking told the Associated Press.

The official said there was a recognition among the Pacific allies that Beijing is watching how the world responds to Russia as China calculates how aggressive it can be with its smaller neighbors in the region. In backing sanctions, the Pacific nations were trying to send a message to Xi as well as Putin, the official added.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10623335/Biden-call-Chinese-President-Xi-Friday.html

WASHINGTON (AP) - Face to face by video, President Joe Biden laid out to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday the stiff consequences the Chinese would face from the U.S. if they provide military or economic assistance for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

There was no indication he got any assurance in return.

In fact, Xi blamed the U.S. for the crisis and insisted with a Chinese proverb that the next move was up to Biden:

“He who tied the bell to the tiger must take it off,” Xi said, according to a Chinese government readout.

More formally after the nearly two-hour conversation, China's Foreign Ministry deplored “conflict and confrontation” as “not in anyone's interest,” but assigned no blame to Russia and said nothing of next steps.

At the White House, press secretary Jen Psaki said, “China has to make a decision for themselves, about where they want to stand and how they want the history books to look at them and view their actions.”

She declined to detail possible consequences Biden specified to the Chinese president if his country provides support for the Russian invasion.

But a senior administration official who briefed reporters following the leaders' call said that Biden pointed to the economic isolation that Russia has faced - including economy-battering sanctions and major Western corporations suspending operations - as he sought to underscore the costs that China might suffer.

Xi urged the U.S. and Russia, which have had limited engagement since the Feb. 24 invasion, to negotiate. He noted China's donations of humanitarian aid for Ukraine, while accusing the U.S. of provoking Russia and fueling the conflict by shipping arms to the embattled country. He also renewed China's criticism of sanctions imposed on Russia over the invasion, according to State media. As in the past, Xi did not use the terms war or invasion to describe Russia's actions.

Ahead of the call, Psaki noted Beijing's “rhetorical support” of Putin and an “absence of denunciation” of Russia's invasion.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying pushed back, calling the U..S. administration “overbearing” for suggesting China risks falling on the wrong side of history.

The two leaders also discussed the longer-simmering U.S.-China dispute over Taiwan. In a reminder of China's threat to assert its claim by force, the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Friday, just hours before the Biden-Xi call. The U.S. is legally obligated to ensure the self-governing island democracy can defend itself and treats threats to it with “grave concern.”

Planning for the leaders' discussion had been in the works since Biden and Xi held a virtual summit in November, but differences between Washington and Beijing over Russian President Vladimir Putin's prosecution of his three-week-old war against Ukraine were at the center of Friday's conversation.

The U.S.-China relationship, long fraught, has only become more strained since the start of Biden's presidency. Biden has repeatedly criticized China for military provocations against Taiwan, human rights abuses against ethnic minorities and efforts to squelch pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong.

But the relationship may have reached a new low with the Russian invasion.

In the days after Putin deployed Russian forces in Ukraine, Xi's government tried to distance itself from Russia's offensive but avoided the criticism many other nations have leveled at Moscow. At other moments, Beijing's actions have been provocative including amplifying unverified Russian claims that Ukraine ran chemical and biological weapons labs with U.S. support.

Earlier this week, the U.S. informed Asian and European allies that American intelligence had determined that China had signaled to Russia that it would be willing to provide both military support for the campaign in Ukraine and financial backing to help stave off the impact of severe sanctions imposed by the West.

The White House says China has been sending mixed messages. There were initial signs that Chinese state-owned banks were pulling back from financing Russian activities, according to a senior Biden administration official who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal analyses. But there have also been public comments by Chinese officials who expressed support for Russia being a strategic partner.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi met in Rome this week for an intense, seven-hour talk about the Russian invasion and other issues.

Ahead of the Rome talks, Sullivan said the U.S. wouldn't abide China or any other country helping Russia work around economy-jarring sanctions inflicted by the U.S. and other allies in response to the invasion.

Sullivan also said the administration determined China knew that Putin “was planning something” before the invasion of Ukraine, but the Chinese government “may not have understood the full extent” of what Putin had in mind.

Xi and Putin met in early February, weeks before the invasion, with the Russian leader traveling to Beijing for the start of the Winter Olympics. The two leaders issued a 5,000-word statement declaring limitless “friendship.”

Beijing's leaders would like to be supportive of Russia, but they also recognize how badly the Russian military action is going as an overmatched Ukrainian military has put up stiff resistance, according to a Western official familiar with current intelligence assessments.

The official, who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Beijing is weighing the potential “reputational blowback” of being associated with the Russian camp. The Chinese response to Russia's request for help is still being formulated, the official said.

Though seen as siding with Russia, China has also reached out to Ukraine, with its ambassador to the country on Monday quoted as saying: “China is a friendly country for the Ukrainian people. As an ambassador, I can responsibly say that China will forever be a good force for Ukraine, both economically and politically.”

“We have seen how great the unity of the Ukrainian people is, and that means its strength,” Fan Xianrong was quoted by Ukraine's state news service Ukrinform as telling regional authorities in the western city of Lviv, where the Chinese Embassy has relocated to.

State media quoted Xi as saying China-U.S. relations had yet to “emerge from the dilemma created by the previous U.S. administration, but instead encountered more and more challenges,” singling out Taiwan as one area in particular.

“If the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have an undermining impact on the relationship between the two countries,” Xi reportedly told Biden.
