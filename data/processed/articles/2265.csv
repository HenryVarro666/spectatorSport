Meanwhile, at Moderna, shareholders will vote on whether the company should study the feasibility of sharing vaccine technology to help increase global production. This has been a hot issue in recent months as many of the world's mRNA shots have gone to developed countries, while low- and middle-income countries were forced to wait for donations.

At J&J's upcoming annual meeting, shareholders will have a chance to vote on an Oxfam proposal to force the company to release its COVID-19 vaccine pricing strategy. Oxfam previously asked J&J to share the information considering the drugmaker received substantial funding assistance from the U.S. government while it was developing the shot. During the company's shareholder meeting last year, 32% of J&J's shareholders voted for a similar resolution, Oxfam notes.

“The losses we are seeing continue to be elevated over 2019 levels due at least in part, we believe, to the pandemic and the existence of either delayed or unavailable healthcare,” Globe Life finance chief Frank Svoboda told analysts and investors earlier this month.

In earnings calls for the past two quarters, Globe Life Inc., Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Primerica Inc. and Reinsurance Group of America Inc. were among insurers noting higher non-Covid-19 deaths, compared with pre-pandemic baselines.

Some insurers see continued high levels of these deaths for some time, even if Covid-19 deaths decline this year.

Industry executives and actuaries believe many of these other fatalities are tied to delays in medical care as a result of lockdowns in 2020, and then, later, people’s fears of seeking out treatment and trouble lining up appointments.

U.S. life insurers, as expected, made a large number of Covid-19 death-benefit payouts last year. More surprisingly, many saw a jump in other death claims, too.

I doubt Putin was a WEF Young Leader, I think Schwab misremembered. But I also think that Schwab wrongly remembering Putin being a young WEF hope is notable.

Also, WEF didn’t start the Young Global Leaders program (as “Global Leaders for Tomorrow”) until 1993 when Putin was already 41.

Apparently WEF “Young Global Leaders” must be 38 or under when they are admitted. At 38 Putin would have still been in the KGB in the dying days of the USSR in 1990.

Ghislaine Maxwell's husband selling mansion for nearly $7.3M Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 16:09 Ghislaine Maxwell's estranged husband has put the historic Massachusetts mansion he shared with the now-convicted madam on the market for nearly $7.3 million. Scott Borgerson '-- who reportedly dumped the British socialite while she was in jail '-- told the Wall Street Journal that he was selling the Manchester-by-the-Sea mansion he had shared with his ex. ''She was here years ago, but actually left when this thing started to rear its ugly head '-- her situation from conduct decades ago,'' Borgeson told the paper of Maxwell sex trafficking underage girls for her earlier ex, pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The waterfront property, known as the Phippen-Smith house, is owned by Borgerson's limited liability company Tidewood LLC. He told the WSJ that although Maxwell, 60, had lived there, she has no ownership stake, which was confirmed by Brian Basham, a friend of the Maxwell family who has served as their spokesman. Borgerson refused to discuss with the WSJ whether he and Maxwell had legally married. Arctic Circle AssemblyBorgeson told the paper that he believes his house was built around 1660 in Salem, Mass., before it was moved by barge in 1917 to its current location in an enclave known as the Sharksmouth Estate. His company paid $2.45 million for it in 2016, records show. He also spent another $2.5 million restoring it, he told the paper. The house now has five bedrooms spread across roughly 6,100 square feet, with modern amenities including Tesla charging stations. The property first came into focus in the summer of 2019 when it first emerged that Maxwell was hiding out there amid the intensifying focus of her earlier involvement of Epstein's sex trafficking. Borgerson reportedly dumped the British socialite while she was in jail. Josh Reynolds for The New York PostShe managed to avoid the spotlight, however, secretly moving to a rented mansion in New Hampshire where she was tracked down and arrested in a major operation in July 2020. It was only after her arrest that it emerged she was married '-- with even Maxwell's supportive siblings later admitting they had no idea. However, Borgerson refused to discuss with the WSJ whether he and Maxwell had legally married. Maxwell was found guilty of sex-trafficking underage girls for pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. (C) SDNY via ZUMA Press WireThe Post first revealed in December, in the middle of Maxwell's trial, that Borgeson had been spotted having affectionate outings in Manchester-by-the-Sea with Kris McGinn, a yoga enthusiast with ''an ass that could crack open a walnut,'' according to one admiring local. Later reports said that he had dumped Maxwell in a ''confrontational'' phone call while she was in solitary confinement. The real estate agents with the listing, Tracy Campion and Ryan Clunan, told the WSJ that they did not expect the shady history to affect interest in the sale. ''We believe the beauty of the house and the location will surpass or outweigh the connection,'' Mr. Clunan said, noting that a house on the same street sold for $20 million in 2020. Maxwell, who often socialized with disgraced UK royal Prince Andrew, was convicted at the end of last year of recruiting and grooming underage girls for years as Epstein's madam. She faces up to 65 years in prison. However, she formally called for a retrial last month after it was revealed that a juror failed to disclose their childhood sexual abuse during jury selection. Epstein, 66, killed himself in his Manhattan lockup in August 2019 while awaiting trial on further serious sex charges.

The U.S. Import Surge Is Skipping the Train - WSJ Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 15:39 Shippers are increasingly choosing trucks over railroads because of supply-chain bottlenecks and a need for speed, pushing more freight onto the country's highways Tens of thousands of container loads of cargo that would normally move on railroads are being hauled on American roads each month as companies look to get around continuing supply-chain bottlenecks.

Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Tens of thousands of container loads of cargo that would normally move on railroads are being hauled on American roads each month as companies look to get around continuing supply-chain bottlenecks. U.S. intermodal transports, in which railroads carry containers and truck trailers, were down nearly 12% in the first six weeks of this year from a year ago, according to the Association of American Railroads, after tumbling in the second half of last year even as retailers and manufacturers rushed to bring in goods. Trucking and rail industry officials say demand to move freight 500 miles or more'--which is often done by rail'--remains strong, as companies restock depleted inventories. But shippers are more often than usual choosing highways over railroads because shortages of labor, equipment and warehouse space across supply chains can create unpredictable delays. Railroads ''should be seizing the day and winning more business,'' said Paul Svindland, chief executive of Bensenville, Ill.-based STG Logistics. Mr. Svindland's firm has been placing more cargo than usual on trucks because he can't find enough of the containers railroads need to most easily handle such shipments, he said. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Intermodal transport, which uses trucking for the final leg of delivery, is slower and more complicated than long-haul trucking. But it is also cheaper and less damaging to the environment. Lawrence Gross, president of Gross Transportation Consulting, said intermodal loads have lost a little over 1% of their market share to long-distance trucking since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Based on current freight volumes, that translates to about 30,000 additional long-distance truck moves each week, he said. John Gray, senior vice president for policy and economics at the AAR, said freight railroads could comfortably handle an extra 20,000 to 30,000 intermodal loads a week. ''I am confident there is a lot more capacity out there,'' Mr. Gray said. U.S. supply chains are struggling to ingest record cargo volumes that began surging into the country in the summer of 2020, a few months after the Covid-19 pandemic triggered lockdowns, when consumers switched their spending from services to goods. Imports were up 14% in 2021 over the year before at the nation's busiest container port complex at Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., clogging port terminals, rail yards, truck yards and warehouses. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Railroads carried record levels of intermodal cargo toward the end of 2020 and through the first half of 2021. But last summer, the system ground to a halt as rail yards in the Chicago area filled with tens of thousands of boxes, backing up shipments at a key hub for transport to destinations east of the Mississippi River. Rail and trucking industry officials say the congestion was caused by too many boxes flowing into the region for warehouses and truckers to handle, a situation that has popped up intermittently at other intermodal hubs around the country. Jim Filter, chief commercial officer of Green Bay, Wis.-based trucking and logistics provider Schneider National Inc., said shipping customers took 30% longer than usual, on average, to unload containers last year because their warehouse space was packed and they had too few workers. That tied up the containers and the steel trailers used to pull boxes, making it harder to find equipment already in short supply. In July, some railroads restricted cargo into Chicago for days until the bottlenecks cleared, pushing shippers to trucking for long-distance routes to inland warehouses. The period coincided with massive bottlenecks at U.S. ports, where container ships at the port complex in Southern California waited weeks or months to unload cargo. To make up for lost time, some shippers chose to pay more for the certainty and speed of trucking, said Bob Biesterfeld, chief executive of freight broker C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue ''If they're waiting for days and weeks to get product out of the port and into their warehouse, they're looking for the fastest way to do that, and ultimately that is almost exclusively by truck,'' he said. Truckload volumes moving through the spot market on routes that mirror the nation's busiest inland route, from Los Angeles to Chicago, were up 130% year-over-year in early February according to DAT Solutions LLC. Such demand is contributing to high trucking rates. Dean Croke, DAT's principal freight market analyst, said spot rates on the Los Angeles to Chicago routes are up 59% year-over-year, or $1.04 a mile. But railroad officials say there are signs intermodal freight is beginning to bounce back. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Tom Williams, group vice president for the consumer products business unit of BNSF Railway, said intermodal cargo volumes on container ships en route to the United States are up 25% compared with the start of the year. ''It hasn't arrived yet, but it's coming,'' he said. Still, officials warn that without sufficient equipment, truck drivers, warehouse space and workers to process cargo, rail systems could become clogged again. ''We need the entire chain to be able to handle it at the same pace so we don't get into a similar situation where the trains keep coming and the street and the warehouses can't process it fast enough,'' said Elise Gosch, assistant vice president of intermodal sales at Union Pacific Corp.

Trump calls Putin's moves on Ukraine 'smart' and 'savvy' - The Washington Post Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 15:16 Those clamoring for former president Donald Trump's voice in their social media feeds can turn to Liz Harrington, once an attorney for the Republican National Committee and now spokeswoman for him. Until Trump's own social media platform is actually running, Harrington's Twitter feed is the best immediate source for the various Twitter-esque riffs and links that Trump puts out through his political action committee several times a day. So, for example, one could learn from Harrington on Tuesday morning that Trump would be making an appearance on a right-wing radio program. And then, a few hours later, you could hear part of the discussion for yourself, dutifully shared by Harrington. Sign up for How To Read This Chart, a weekly data newsletter from Philip Bump For example, you could hear how Trump replied when the show's hosts asked him about President Biden's response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's sending military forces into Ukraine. Story continues below advertisement ''In the last 24 hours we know Russia has said that they are recognizing two breakaway regions of Ukraine, and now this White House is stating that this is an 'invasion,' '' host Buck Sexton said. ''That's a strong word. What went wrong here? What has the current occupant of the Oval Office done that he could have done differently?'' ''Well, what went wrong was a rigged election,'' Trump said, once again misrepresenting the results of the 2020 presidential contest. ''What went wrong is a candidate that shouldn't be there and a man that has no concept of what he's do '-- '' Trump said ''doing,'' actually, but Harrington's clip cut off a bit too early. That's probably because of what Trump said next. Story continues below advertisement ''I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, 'This is genius,' '' Trump continued. ''Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine '-- of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful. So, Putin is now saying, 'It's independent,' a large section of Ukraine. I said, 'How smart is that?' And he's gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That's strongest peace force '... We could use that on our southern border.'' He continued to praise Putin a bit later. ''Here's a guy that says, you know, 'I'm gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent' '-- he used the word 'independent' '-- 'and we're gonna go out and we're gonna go in and we're gonna help keep peace,' '' Trump said. ''You gotta say that's pretty savvy. And you know what the response was from Biden? There was no response.'' Story continues below advertisement Harrington's clip didn't include all of that about how Putin's move was ''genius'' and ''smart'' and ''savvy,'' something Trump said more than once. And when your press person is cutting off quotes early, that's not an accident. On Feb. 22, White House press secretary Jen Psaki dismissed former president Donald Trump's comments after he called Russia's move on Ukraine ''smart.'' (The Washington Post)I suspect that you are not surprised to hear this. The disdain for Biden that enveloped the comments about Putin isn't a surprise, even as Trump's dismissal of Biden's response was undercut by the announcement of new sanctions on Tuesday afternoon. Nor is it a surprise that Trump would express admiration for Putin. Few people better encapsulate the right's mixture of respect for Putin's autocratic tendencies and the perceived embarrassment of Democratic presidents that results than Donald Trump. When Putin seized Crimea in 2014, Trump declared that ''Putin has eaten Obama's lunch'' and pretended to worry that President Barack Obama would do something ''very foolish and very stupid to show his manhood.'' This, of course, came less than a year after Trump wondered if Putin would become his ''new best friend'' when the Miss Universe pageant was held in Moscow. Story continues below advertisement There's little need to articulate the extent to which Trump flirted with Putin and Russia during his 2016 campaign and his presidency. Remember when he invited Russia's foreign minister to the Oval Office the day after he fired FBI Director James B. Comey for pressing forward on the Russia probe? Remember when he met with Putin in Helsinki and then emerged to take Putin's side on Russia's 2016 election interference? Remember his repeated insistences that he thought it was important to get along with Russia, by which he meant it was important to get along with Vladimir Putin '-- someone who was not his enemy but might still turn out to be a friend? Remember when he said that Putin said he was brilliant, which Putin didn't really say but which helped fuel months of Trumpian enthusiasm about how he and Putin might end up as pals? Remember, too, how Putin was just one of a contingent of authoritarians (Turkey, China, North Korea) who Trump enjoyed being around, preferring being stroked by America's enemies to being challenged by our allies? So, without even being asked to take sides in the power struggle between our country and Russia, Trump took sides. Putin was clever and wily, and Biden inept and toothless. There are ways to criticize Biden without explicitly praising the Russian authoritarian actively seeking to reorder democracy in Europe '-- see the example of every vocal Republican in the Senate '-- but this was not the path Trump chose to follow. Story continues below advertisement At another point on Tuesday '-- and about two seconds later in the radio interview '-- Trump reiterated his claim that Putin wouldn't have entered Ukraine were he president. The impression he hopes to give is one of strength; that Putin feared his response. There's no evidence for that, of course. What was the point in Trump's presidency when Putin might have felt intimidated by Trump's exercising of American power? The sanctions he didn't want to apply? His refusal to blame Russia for interfering? As I wrote on Tuesday, it seems much more likely that, if American politics played any role at all, Putin would want to move when he could expect the political right to criticize Biden more than himself. That includes the former president. After all, Putin's so savvy, right? This response from Trump is not surprising. It is nonetheless noteworthy.

Industry executives and actuaries believe many of these other fatalities are tied to delays in medical care as a result of lockdowns in 2020, and then, later, people's fears of seeking out treatment and trouble lining up appointments. Some insurers see continued high levels of these deaths for some time, even if Covid-19 deaths decline this year. In earnings calls for the past two quarters, Globe Life Inc., Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Primerica Inc. and Reinsurance Group of America Inc. were among insurers noting higher non-Covid-19 deaths, compared with pre-pandemic baselines. ''The losses we are seeing continue to be elevated over 2019 levels due at least in part, we believe, to the pandemic and the existence of either delayed or unavailable healthcare,'' Globe Life finance chief Frank Svoboda told analysts and investors earlier this month. Among the non-coronavirus-specific claims are deaths from heart and circulatory issues and neurological disorders, he said. ''We anticipate that they'll start to be less impactful over the course of 2022 but we do anticipate that we'll still at least see some elevated levels throughout the year,'' he said. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Primerica executives similarly cautioned in their fourth-quarter call about outsize numbers of non-Covid-19 deaths in 2022. ''Some of these will be the result of delayed medical care or the increased incidence of societal-related issues, such as the increased prevalence of substance abuse,'' Chief Financial Officer Alison Rand said in an email interview. From early stages of the pandemic, many medical professionals have raised concerns about Americans' untreated health problems, as Covid-19 put stress on the nation's healthcare system. Trade group American Council of Life Insurers said the pandemic in 2020 drove the biggest annual increase in death benefits paid by U.S. carriers since the 1918 influenza epidemic, totaling billions of dollars. The hit to the industry's bottom line has been less than initially feared, however, because many victims have been older people who typically have smaller policies, if any coverage. Still, Covid-19 and other excess deaths have cut into many carriers' quarterly earnings, especially as deaths linked to the Delta variant increased for people in their working years with employer-sponsored death benefits. ''Earnings impacts have been material and there still appears to be some Covid-19 discount, but investors are starting to look through mortality claims costs,'' said Andrew Kligerman, Advertisement - Scroll to Continue a stock analyst with Credit Suisse Securities. Industrywide, death-benefit claims usually vary only slightly year-to-year, so the recent increases are outside the norm. Non-Covid-19 excess deaths jumped in last year's third quarter, after negligible or modest counts in earlier quarters, some life insurers said. Those numbers line up with results from an ongoing Covid-19 survey of 20 of the nation's leading sellers of group-life insurance to employers by the Society of Actuaries Research Institute. In the third quarter, the survey shows, incurred claims counts were 37.7% higher than a pre-pandemic baseline, with a nearly 50-50 split between claims directly tied to Covid-19 and those that weren't, according to R. Dale Hall, managing director of research at the society, a professional organization. The group is still assessing fourth-quarter data. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue The third-quarter non-Covid-19 excess claims were 19%, compared with 18.7% for Covid-19 claims, Mr. Hall said. Non-coronavirus-specific excess claims hadn't topped 6.4% in previous quarters. In discussing third-quarter results with analysts, Hartford Financial Chief Executive Christopher Swift said the company had ''experienced higher levels of non-Covid excess mortality during the quarter,'' including heart, stroke and cancer causes of death. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue He said the company's experience with such claims ''has been very bouncy over the last six quarters so I don't see a trend per se,'' beyond those seeming ''to indicate maybe a second-order effect with Covid and people not taking care of themselves.'' The insurer is one of the nation's biggest group-benefits providers. At nonpublicly traded OneAmerica Financial Partners, another group-life-insurance seller, claims for working-age adults ran at about 140% of a pre-pandemic baseline during the third quarter, CEO J. Scott Davison said. About two-thirds of these excess deaths are Covid-19-specific, he said. Of the remainder, in addition to deaths driven by deferred medical care, Mr. Davison's team believes that some may stem from earlier Covid-19 infections. He cited scientific research indicating that the virus may pave the way for future medical complications, so survivors may ''later die from the toll Covid has taken on their bodies.'' The impact on the cost of life insurance from Covid-19 both directly and indirectly is unclear. Some insurers say they are repricing group-life contracts modestly on the assumption that the virus will be around at least through 2022. Those contracts are typically repriced every couple of years. Meanwhile, insurers are still trying to determine what implications there may or may not be on long-term mortality.

Johnson & Johnson, Moderna set to face shareholder votes on vaccine pricing strategy, manufacturing tech sharing | FiercePharma Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 15:09 Throughout the global push to produce COVID-19 vaccines, pharma companies have frequently come under fire for unequal access to their shots. Oxfam, in a bid to force better access, has scored a pair of wins in its effort to exact pricing and intellectual property information from Johnson & Johnson and Moderna, respectively. At J&J's upcoming annual meeting, shareholders will have a chance to vote on an Oxfam proposal to force the company to release its COVID-19 vaccine pricing strategy. Oxfam previously asked J&J to share the information considering the drugmaker received substantial funding assistance from the U.S. government while it was developing the shot. During the company's shareholder meeting last year, 32% of J&J's shareholders voted for a similar resolution, Oxfam notes. Meanwhile, at Moderna, shareholders will vote on whether the company should study the feasibility of sharing vaccine technology to help increase global production. This has been a hot issue in recent months as many of the world's mRNA shots have gone to developed countries, while low- and middle-income countries were forced to wait for donations. After Oxfam filed the shareholder resolutions late last year, J&J and Moderna asked the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow them to omit the proposals from their annual meeting materials. The SEC denied the requests, according to agency records. In rejecting Moderna's request, SEC said the proposal ""transcends ordinary business matters and does not seek to micromanage the company."" As for J&J, the SEC disagreed with the drugmaker that its public disclosures ""substantially implement the proposal."" RELATED: Shareholders to push for detailed COVID-19 pricing strategies from Pfizer, J&J at annual meetings Oxfam also filed a technology-sharing proposal with Pfizer, similar to Moderna. It isn't clear whether the SEC has ruled on that potential shareholder vote yet. An Oxfam representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The vaccine heavyweights have come under fire from a range of global groups amid the COVID-19 immunization drive that started last year. Last March, as it became clear there'd be a serious supply shortfall in developing countries, calls to break vaccine patents began to gather steam. In May 2021, the Biden administration backed a proposal at the World Trade Organization to suspend intellectual property protections for COVID shots so that companies around the world could begin to pump out their own doses. The move angered the industry, which has argued that established vaccine players are in the best position to quickly scale up production of pandemic vaccines. Further, companies have argued that suspending patent rights will spur a global fight for critical raw materials, hurting output. Meanwhile, COVID vaccine sales have been adding up in a big way, especially at Pfizer and Moderna. Pfizer reported $36.8 billion in 2021 COVID-19 vaccine sales, and Moderna is set to report full-year revenues on Thursday. RELATED: Biden admin backs proposal to suspend intellectual property on COVID-19 vaccines, angering industry After Pfizer reported its earnings earlier this month, Oxfam's senior manager of private sector advocacy Robbie Silverman responded that the results are ""clear evidence of how the company has used its monopoly to enrich its shareholders at the expense of almost half the world's population, who still have no access to lifesaving vaccines."" ""It is obscene that we have allowed pharmaceutical companies to put their profits before the good of humanity as the pandemic drags on,"" he added. ""No corporations should decide who lives and who dies."" As for J&J, the company's COVID shot generated $2.39 billion in 2021. In the U.S., the shot faced an early setback when authorities briefly paused its use to investigate rare blood clots. Afterward, the vaccine never really gained traction to keep up with its mRNA rivals. In all of last year, the industry churned out an estimated 12 billion doses.

Antibiotics can impede flu vaccines | Nature Reviews Immunology Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:55 Perturbations in the gut microbiota have been shown to affect various immune components and impair the efficacy of treatments such as cancer immunotherapy. Now, work from the group of Bali Pulendran shows that antibiotic-mediated disruption of the gut microbiota can impair the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in individuals with low levels of pre-existing immunity. Credit: S. Bradbrook/Springer Nature Limited Most studies exploring how the microbiota shapes immune function have used animal models. To examine the effects of the microbiota on the human immune system, Hagan et al. vaccinated antibiotic-treated or control subjects with the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). They initially enrolled 22 healthy adults and subjected 11 individuals to a 5-day broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen (commencing 3 days before vaccination and ending 1'day after) and collected biological samples regularly until 1 year after vaccination. Antibiotic-treated subjects showed a marked reduction in bacterial loads and profound changes in microbial community composition, chiefly characterized by an overabundance of Enterobacteriaceae and reduced proportions of Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae and Veillonellaceae. This restriction in bacterial diversity was apparent for at least 6 months after cessation of antibiotics administration. In this initial study, the authors did not see any differences between the TIV-induced antibody responses of antibiotic-treated and control individuals. However, many individuals showed high baseline antibody titres; therefore, in a subsequent study the authors enrolled additional subjects with low pre-existing titres of antibody against influenza. In this follow-up study using individuals with limited pre-existing immunity, antibiotic treatment markedly impaired binding and neutralization antibody responses against the H1N1 A/California strain of influenza (although not against the other two strains targeted by the vaccine) following TIV vaccination. Specifically, the antibiotic-treated subjects showed markedly impaired production of IgG1 and IgA1 specific for H1N1 A/California following vaccination. The authors found that antibiotic treatment alone was associated with increased expression of gene modules linked with pro-inflammatory signalling and dendritic cell activation, similarly to what had previously been observed in elderly subjects. These changes normalized following cessation of antibiotics, suggesting they were linked with perturbations in the gut microbiota. As the gut microbiota plays an important role in dietary metabolism, the authors examined changes in the blood metabolomes of the different groups. They found that antibiotic treatment was associated with metabolite changes, including changes in bile acid and tryptophan metabolism. The gut microbiota is responsible for converting liver-derived primary bile acids into secondary bile acids; notably, treatment with antibiotics led to a dramatic reduction in levels of secondary bile acids. Accordingly, the authors found prominent differences in the metabolic response to TIV between the antibiotic-treated and control subjects. Analyses by the authors suggested an inverse correlation between the levels of individual secondary bile acids and expression of various inflammatory modules. In particular, the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid (LCA) showed a 1,000-fold reduction in the plasma of antibiotic-treated subjects and downregulation of LCA was associated with increased expression of inflammasome signalling genes. Further gene network analyses by the authors suggested that the increased inflammatory signalling associated with secondary bile acid disturbances and the impaired IgG1 response to TIV vaccination arise as independent effects of antibiotic-mediated disturbance of the microbiota. ''antibiotic-mediated disruption of the gut microbiota can impair the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in individuals with low levels of pre-existing immunity'' Virtually all humans have been previously exposed to influenza virus and this study indicates that, where pre-existing immunity exists, the immune system can maintain appropriate responses to pathogens despite significant metabolic disturbances arising from transient dysbiosis. However, in situations where immunity may be less mature (such as in adults with low pre-existing immune memory or in infants), dysbiosis may have a greater impact on the development of an appropriate immune response.

The Next Step for the World Economic Forum ' Brownstone Institute Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:55 It has been obvious since early 2020 that there has been an organized cult outreach that has permeated the world as a whole. It's possible that this formed out of a gigantic error, rooted in a sudden ignorance of cell biology and long experience of public health. It is also possible that a seasonal respiratory virus was deployed by some people as an opportunity to seize power for some other purpose. Follow the money and influence trails and the latter conclusion is hard to dismiss. The clues were there early. Even before the WHO declared a pandemic in March 2020 (at least several months behind the actual fact of a pandemic) and before any lockdowns, there were media blitzes talking about the ''New Normal'' and talk of the ''Great Reset'' (which was rebranded as ''Build Back Better''). Pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Astra-Zeneca were actively lobbying governments to buy their vaccines as early as February 2020, supposedly less than a month after the genetic sequence (or partial sequence) was made available by China. As a person who spent his whole professional career in pharmaceutical and vaccine development, I found the whole concept of going from scratch to a ready-to-use vaccine in a few months simply preposterous. Something did not add up. I knew of the names with which everyone has become familiar. Bill Gates, Neil Ferguson, Jeremy Farrar, Anthony Fauci, and others had either been lobbying for or pursuing the lockdown strategies for many years. But still, the scope of the actions seemed too large to even be explained by those names alone. So, the fundamental questions that I have been asking myself have been why and who? The ''Why'' seems to always come back to issues besides public health. Of course the ''Who'' had the obvious players such as the WHO, China, CDC, NIH/NIAID, and various governments but there seemed to be more behind it than that. These players have been connected to the ''public health'' aspect but that seemed to be only scratching the surface. I am not an investigative journalist and I would never claim that role, but even I can do some simple internet searches and start to see patterns evolve. The searches that I have done have yielded some very interesting ''coincidences.'' If I give you the names of the following people '' Biden, Trudeau, Ardern, Merkel, Macron, Draghi, Morrison, Xi Jinping '' what do you think that they have in common? Yes, they are all pampered and stumble over themselves, but that is also not the connection. One can see very quickly that these names certainly connect to lockdown countries and individuals who have ignored their own laws and/or tried in some way to usurp them. But, there is more to it than that and I will give a hint by providing a link with each name. Joseph Biden, President, United States Boris Johnson, PM of United KingdomJacinda Ardern, PM of New Zealand Angela Merkel, Former PM of GermanyEmmanuel Macron, President of France Justin Trudeau, PM of Canada Xi Jinping, CCP Leader, ChinaMario Draghi, PM of Italy Scott Morrison, PM of Australia They are all associated with the World Economic Forum (WEF), a ''nonprofit'' private organization started (in 1971) and headed by Klaus ''You will own nothing and be happy'' Schwab and his family. This is a private organization that has no official bearing with any world governance body, despite the implication of the name. It could just as well have been called the ''Church of Schwabies.'' The WEF was the origin of the ''Great Reset'' and I would guess that it was the origin of ''Build Back Better'' (since most of the above names have used that term recently). If you think that the WEF membership ends with just leaders of countries, here are a few more names: Gavin Newsom, Governor of California Jay Inslee, Governor of Washington State Anthony Fauci, Director NIAID Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House Allow me to introduce more of the WEF by giving a list of names for the Board of Trustees. Al Gore, Former WP of the USMark Carney, UN Special Envoy for Climate ActionT. Shanmugaratnam, Seminar Minister SingaporeChristine Lagarde, President, European Central BankNgozi Okonja-Iweala, Director General, WTOKristalian Georggieva, Managing Director, IMFChrystia Freeland, Deputy Minister of CanadaLaurence Fink, CEO, BlackRock You can see a cross section of political and economic leaders on the board. The leader of the organization, that is the leader of the Board, is still Klaus Schwab. He has built an impressive array of followers. If you want to really see the extent of influence, go to the website and pick out the corporate name of your choice; there are many to choose from: Abbott Laboratories, Astra-Zeneca, Biogen, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India, BASF, Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, Blackrock, CISCO, Dell, Google, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Zoom, Yahoo, Amazon, Airbus, Boeing, Honda, Rakuten, Walmart, UPS, Coca-Cola, UBER, Bank of China. Bank of America. Deutsche Bank, State Bank of India, Royal Bank of Canada, Lloyds Banking, JP Morgan-Chase, Equifax, Goldman-Sachs, Hong Kong Exchanges, Bloomberg, VISA, New York Times, Ontario (Canada) Teacher's Pension Plan The extent of reach is huge even beyond the worldwide leader network. For example, we all know what Bill Gates has been doing with his wealth via the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). But, the Wellcome Trust is equal to the task. Who is the Director of the Wellcome Trust? One named Jeremy Farrar, of the United Kingdom SAGE and lockdown fame '' arguably the architect of the US-UK lockdowns in 2020 '' is closely associated with WEF. Concerning the reach that can occur, let me give some examples from the BMGF alone, and it comes from the time that I spent in 2020 reading their extensive funding list. A few years ago, the BMGF awarded the Institute for Health Metric Evaluation (IHME) a ten-year, almost $280 million award. IHME (associated with the University of Washington in Seattle) was at the forefront of the computer modeling that was driving the lockdowns and the nonpharmaceutical Interventions during 2020. People have seen their name often in print or on MSNBC or CNN. In 2019, IHME awarded the Editor of the Lancet (Dr. Richard Horton) a $100,000 award and described him as an ''activist editor.'' The Lancet, once considered one of the best medical journals, has been at the forefront of censoring opposing scientific viewpoints since 2020 and publishing ''papers'' that were not fit to be published. I never could understand what it meant to be an ''activist'' editor in a respected scientific/medical journal because, stupid me, I always thought that the first job of the editor was to be impartial. I guess I learned in 2020 how wrong I was. Of course, the Lancet is also heavily funded from pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer (also a member of the WEF). But, the BMGF reach goes far beyond just IHME and these connections have been quite recognizable. Here are some examples of the organizations and moneys received during 2020 alone broken down by areas. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grants 2020Organization NameAmount USDJohns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health20+ millionWorld Health Organization (WHO)100+ millionOregon Health Sciences Univ.15+ millionCDC Foundation3.5+ millionImperial College of London7+ millionChinese CDC2+ millionHarvard TH Chan School of Public Health5+ millionInstitute of Health Metric Evaluation (IHME)28 million (part of a 10 yr/279 million USD grant)Nigeria CDC1.1 millionDeutsche Gesellschaft f¼r Internationale Z.

The BMGF has also given close to $100 million to the Clinton Health Access Initiative. The questions now have to be asked: Is this some beginning of a controlled authoritarian society intertwined via the WEF? Has the Covid panic been staged to set the stage? Please note, I am not a ''Covid Denier'' since the virus is real. But, has a normal seasonal respiratory virus been used as an excuse to activate the web?The next questions, for those of us who at least pretend to live in ''Democratic'' societies, have to be: Is this what you expected and/or want from the people you elect? How many people knew of the ''Associations'' of the people that they voted for? (I certainly did not know of the associations until I did the searches but maybe I am just out of touch)Can we anticipate their next moves? There may be some hints. The Next Move Jeremy Farrar of The Wellcome Trust recently wrote an article for the WEF with the CEO of Novo Nordisk Foundation, Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen. It is a summary of a larger piece written for and published by the Boston Consulting Group. In this article, they propose that the way to ''fix'' the problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria is via a subscription service. That is, you pay a fee and when you need an antibiotic, presumably an effective one will be available for you. My guess is that they have the same philosophy for vaccines and that certainly seems to be the approach with Coronavirus. Keep paying for and taking boosters. In view of this philosophy, the vaccine mandates make sense. Get society ''addicted'' to an intervention, effective or not, and then keep feeding them. This becomes especially effective if you can keep the fear going. This approach is so shortsighted, from a scientific viewpoint, it astounds me. But, like much of recent history, I think science has little to do with it. The goal is not scientifically founded but control founded. After the discovery of penicillin almost one century ago, there were scientists who warned that antibiotic usage should be considered very carefully in practice because evolutionary pressures would lead to antibiotic resistant species of bacteria. At that time, they were considered to be rogue scientists; after all, didn't we suddenly have a miracle cure for many deadly problems? From the time of discovery, it took over a decade before fermentation methods were developed to produce sufficient quantities of antibiotics to be practical. These methods allowed for the use of penicillin on the battlefield towards the end of WWII and undoubtedly saved many lives then and later in subsequent wars (Korea and Vietnam) by preventing serious infections resulting from wounds sustained during battle. However, it did not take long before the medical establishment was handing out antibiotics like candy. I experienced this myself when I was a child in the 1960s. It seemed like every time we went to the doctor, no matter what the problem, I was given a series (not just one) of injections of penicillin. There were never any attempts to determine if I had a virus, bacteria, or even an allergy. The answer was: in with the needle. I cannot count how many times I was ''jabbed'' as a child. It didn't take long before resistance species started to appear. The result was that more and more money was pumped into R&D for antibiotics. When I was in graduate school during the 1980s, one sure way to get some NIH funding was to tie the research into the ''antibiotic'' search. Antibiotics became big business. We now have several classes of antibiotics that are used for specific cases. We have Aminoglycosides (Streptomycin, Neomycin, etc.), Beta-Lactams Cephalosporins (four generations including Cefadroxil-G1, Cefaclor-G2, Cefotaxime-G3, Cefepime-G4 , Beta-Lactams Penicillins (including Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, and Penicillin), Other Beta-Lactams (Meropenem), Fluoroquinolones (Levofloxacin, Gemifloxicin, etc.), Macrolides (Azithromycin, Clarithromycin, etc.), Sulfonamides (Sulfisoxazole, etc.), Tetracyclines, and others such as Clindamycin and Vancomycin (typically reserved for resistant bacteria). All in all, physicians have over 50 different choices for antibiotics. The most common place to encounter antibiotic resistant bacteria is in a hospital. Most people who get some sort of infection in the normal routine of life, like a sinus infection or skin infection, will not likely encounter an antibiotic resistant species. Except there has been another source of the problem and that has been in the food supply. Antibiotics have become very popular with large scale meat production facilities of all types including beef, poultry, swine, and even fish. These include actual farms where the animals are raised as well as in the processing of the meat. The overuse of antibiotics in these industries has also produced resistant forms of bacteria. For example, in attempts to limit the bacteria e. coli, common to mammalians, antibiotics have been used and this has resulted in some antibiotic resistant forms of e. coli. An infection via e. coli (antibiotic resistant or not) can be avoided by proper cooking and handling of meats. However, sometimes that does not happen and there are e. coli outbreaks (also from improperly washed vegetables that may use contaminated irrigation water). For most healthy people, experiencing e. coli (either resistant or not) is only a passing discomfort that includes intestinal cramps, diarrhea, and other GI complaints. Depending on the amount of contamination, a person may suffer for a day or two or for several days. But, with some people, it can be serious or deadly (such as in elderly people in poor health and young children). If that occurs, then the presence of an antibiotic resistant form can be a serious matter. Presence of a non-resistant form can be treated more readily. A few years ago I had pneumonia; a relatively mild case. I was given a choice of in-patient treatment or out-patient and it was a no-brainer. If I wanted to make sure that my pneumonia could be handled by the normal course of antibiotics (I was given a quinolone), staying at home and away from the hospital was important. I knew that hospital-acquired pneumonia could be a much more serious situation. So, I stayed at home and easily recovered. That did not mean I was guaranteed getting a more serious resistant form in the hospital but I understood that the risk was much greater. Producing more antibiotics and giving them on subscription to the users is not the answer. That will only lead to more resistant forms and there will be this continuing loop of antibiotic use. But, if the actual goal is societal addiction to antibiotics out of fear, just like addiction to universal Covid vaccines out of fear, then it makes sense. Finding a few universal antibiotics that deal with the resistant forms is important and it is also important to use those sparingly and only as a last resort. In addition, better management of antibiotic use in our society would go a long way to attenuating the problem. There is nothing particularly controversial about that observation. It was accepted by nearly every responsible health professional only two years ago. But we live now in different times of extreme experimentation, such as the deployment of world-wide lockdowns for a virus that had a highly focused impact, with catastrophic results for the world. It was the WEF on March 21, 2020 that assured us ''lockdowns can halt the spread of Covid-19.'' Today that article, never pulled much less repudiated, stands as probably the most ridiculous and destructive suggestion and prediction of the 21st century. And yet, the WEF is still at it, suggesting that same year that at least lockdowns reduced carbon emissions. We can easily predict that the WEF's call for a universal and mandated subscription plan for antibiotics '' pushed with the overt intention of shoring up financial capitalization of major drug manufacturers '' will meet the same fate: poor health outcomes, more power to entrenched elites, and ever less liberty for the people.

Fast-spreading HIV variant doubles rate of immune system decline | | UN News Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:53 Newly published research from the Netherlands has revealed the existence of a more transmissible and damaging variant of HIV, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) said on Monday. People living with the newly revealed subtype, experience double the rate of immune system decline (measured by the CD4 count level of infection-busting T cells) and have higher viral loads. They are also vulnerable to developing AIDS two to three times faster after diagnosis, than if they were living with other strains of the virus. The research also revealed that the variant has been circulating in the Netherlands for years and remains receptive to treatment. The study, led by researchers from the University of Oxford's Big Data Institute, is the first to report on the subtype-B of the virus. Treatment still worksAccording to UNAIDS in press statement, the discovery highlights the urgency to ''halt the pandemic and reach all and reach all with testing and treatment'' The long-running HIV pandemic continues to take a life every minute and scientists have long worried about the evolution of new, more transmissible, variants of the virus. According to UNAIDS, the newly identified variant does not represent a major public health threat but underscores the urgency of speeding up the UN's drive to end AIDS. In a statement, the Programme Deputy Executive Director, Eamonn Murphy, noted that around 10 million people living with HIV are still not on antiretroviral therapy, ''fuelling the continued spread of the virus and potential for further variants.'' ''We urgently need to deploy cutting-edge medical innovations in ways that reach the communities most in need. Whether it's HIV treatment or COVID-19 vaccines, inequalities in access are perpetuating pandemics in ways that harm us all'', he said. 79 million infectionsHIV remains the deadliest pandemic of our time, said UNAIDS. Since first discovered in the early 80s, an estimated 79 million people have become infected with the virus, for which there is still no vaccine and no cure. Some 36 million people have died from AIDS-related illnesses since the start of the pandemic and 1.5 million people were newly infected in 2020. Of the 38 million people living with the virus today, 28 million are on life-saving antiretroviral therapy, keeping them alive and well and preventing transmission.

A Truck Caravan With Far-Right Links Heads to Washington, D.C. - The New York Times Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:47 Many backers of the caravan, planned as an American version of the past month's chaotic Canadian protest, have connections to the violent attack on the Capitol in January 2021. After a flag-strewn rally, a convoy of about 40 truckers and their rigs departed Adelanto, Calif., on Wednesday with Washington, D.C., as the destination. Credit... Meridith Kohut for The New York Times Feb. 23, 2022 ADELANTO, Calif. '-- Though it was billed as a grass-roots, nonpartisan event intended to oppose government Covid-19 mandates, a trucker demonstration that left California for Washington, D.C., on Wednesday appeared to be tightly aligned with far-right organizations and activists. Many of those behind the demonstration, which was planned as an American version of the past month's chaotic Canadian protest, have connections to the violent attack on the Capitol in January 2021, or supported the lie that fraud in the 2020 presidential election was to blame for Donald J. Trump's loss. ''We're just trying to show what the people who back us believe '-- and our own beliefs '-- of what our country needs to go back to,'' said Jeff Sandberg, a Republican truck driver from Texas whose vehicle was hauling a massive banner covered in slogans such as ''We Will Not Comply!!'' and ''Let's Go Brandon,'' a meme created to insult President Biden. Brian Brase, a convoy spokesman and Ohio-based truck driver, said the motorcade was expected to grow as the trucks wended across the country. ''We believe tens of thousands will join in,'' he said. About 40 truckers were on hand with their rigs as the convoy rolled out on Wednesday in Adelanto, Calif., about 180 miles west of the Arizona state line. A flag-strewn send-off rally that resembled a Make America Great Again event drew about a hundred more vehicles. At truck stops in the surrounding area, most local drivers seemed only dimly aware of the California convoy or too busy to take part. Unlike in Ottawa, where a recent weekslong protest shut down parts of Canada's capital, the activity near Barstow, Calif., on Wednesday seemed highly staged, with memorabilia stands and food trucks. The group behind the convoy '-- one of several in the United States expected to launch over the next few days '-- is demanding an end to the national emergency, meant to streamline the government response to the pandemic, that was first declared by Mr. Trump in March 2020 and recently extended by Mr. Biden. The protesters also want congressional hearings into the origin of the pandemic and an end to government health rules requiring masks and vaccinations, a move that has already begun as new cases have ebbed. Image Charity Reyes, the wife of Adelanto's part-time mayor, Gabriel Reyes, sang the national anthem. Credit... Meridith Kohut for The New York Times Image The protesters want an end to government health rules requiring masks and vaccinations. Credit... Meridith Kohut for The New York Times Mr. Brase, a former public affairs director for an advocacy group that pushed during the Trump administration to relax limits on driving time for commercial truckers, said that the cross-country protest would be peaceful. A statement by the group said the demonstration would end near the nation's capital, but that the convoy would not enter Washington. Law enforcement authorities warned against disruption of the sort that roiled Canada for several weeks. ''Attempting to block or shut down a freeway or state highway to protest is unlawful, dangerous and prevents motorists from safely reaching their destinations,'' the California Highway Patrol said in a statement. ''If necessary, the C.H.P. will take enforcement action that includes, but is not limited to, issuing citations, impounding vehicles, arresting individuals who intentionally block traffic on the state's transportation system or pose a threat to public safety.'' In Washington, officials from the U.S. Capitol Police said they would facilitate the demonstration as a ''lawful First Amendment activity,'' but also had set some security measures in motion. The Defense Department authorized deployment of about 700 unarmed National Guard personnel from the District of Columbia and neighboring states to help manage traffic, and Capitol Police said that plans were being drawn up to reinstall the temporary fence that was erected around the Capitol after last year's Jan. 6 riot. An American trucker protest has been discussed for at least a month on social media and right-wing news outlets, inspired by the one that crossed Canada, demanding an end to a mandate requiring truckers crossing the U.S.-Canada border to get vaccinated against Covid-19. American truckers have no such mandate, and as a towering surge in new cases has rapidly ebbed, most states '-- including California '-- have eased restrictions. But Mr. Brase said his group felt compelled to express solidarity with health care workers, public employees and others for whom vaccination has become a requirement. Last week, a conservative political action committee that has focused in the past on defending Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and ally of Mr. Trump who is being investigated by the Justice Department, issued a call for participation in an American convoy that would start in Ohio and California and reach Washington on March 6. Darrel Courtney, the chief executive of the Adelanto Stadium and Event Center, said he received a call last Tuesday from Leigh Dundas, an Orange County lawyer and Republican activist, who wanted to rent the parking lot. Ms. Dundas, a lawyer for an anti-vaccine group whose leader was charged with entering the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, was videotaped the day before the riot rallying pro-Trump crowds with calls to kill any ''alleged Americans'' who might have helped undermine the 2020 elections. Two hours northeast of Los Angeles, Adelanto is known chiefly for its prisons. Gabriel Reyes, the city's part-time mayor '-- a Republican who operates a small currency trading and marketing business '-- said the city-owned stadium, which once hosted minor league baseball, was little used except for an annual cannabis festival, ''Kushstock.'' Image The truckers are hoping to build on the protests in Canada that paralyzed Ottawa. Credit... Meridith Kohut for The New York Times Image About 40 truckers gathered at Adelanto Stadium before heading east. Credit... Meridith Kohut for The New York Times ''I didn't see us making beaucoup bucks off of this,'' he said, ''but if they all want to fill up at our Arco station and we get that California tax, then hey, we're going to say, 'Thank you!''' On Wednesday, the mayor's wife sang the national anthem for the truckers before they departed for their next stop, Kingman, Ariz. Speakers at the rally included Dr. Pierre Kory, a vocal advocate of the discouraged use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin as a Covid-19 treatment, and Rob McCoy, a Republican politician and Southern California evangelical pastor who has gained prominence flouting pandemic rules and calling the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, ''Governor Newssolini.'' Ms. Dundas, who was the event's M.C., said, ''It's been two years, and it is time to open this darn economy with no more restrictions on it.'' A list of organizations supporting the convoy included those led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leader in the anti-vaccine movement, and Gen. Michael Flynn, the former Trump administration national security adviser. That latter group, the America Project, has combined its attempts to challenge Covid-19 policies with the relentless promotion of pro-Trump election conspiracy theories. The group is run by Patrick Byrne, the former chief executive of Overstock.com, who, with General Flynn, was central in a bizarre plot to persuade the former president to use the military to seize voting machines in a bid to stay in power. Yet another group, the American Foundation for Civil Liberties and Freedom, which is raising money for the truckers, hosted an event in Los Angeles last summer at which participants promoted baseless claims that there were widespread irregularities in the presidential voting results in Michigan. Outside Adelanto, Mario Acevedo, who had stopped to wash the tires of his big rig on the way to Nevada, said he did not ''have that time or luxury, unfortunately,'' to skip work for the convoy. ''I got to provide for my family,'' he said. Shawn Hubler reported from Adelanto, Calif., and Alan Feuer from Albany, N.Y. Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.

Credit: TwitterFrench No 1 Gael Monfils withdraws from Davis Cup citing a ''health glitch'' following the Covid vaccine.FRENCH No 1 tennis player Gael Monfils withdraws from next month's Davis Cup citing a ''health glitch'' following his third dose of the Covid vaccine. He revealed that this was the reason for his absence from recent competitions. Writing on Twitter, the 35-year-old said: ''Hello everyone, I wanted to give you some news following my recent withdrawals from tournaments. I suffered a small health glitch (probably following my third dose of vaccine). ''On the advice of my doctor, I decided to take some time to rest. So unfortunately I will not be able to play the Davis Cup next week. I hope to be able to return in the United States.'' The world number 25, who has not played for over three weeks, opened up further about his announcement after receiving hateful comments calling him an anti-vaxxer '' despite receiving three doses of the mRNA vaccine. In a series of tweets following the backlash, the Frenchman, who is married to current Ukrainian tennis number one Elina Svitolina, revealed that he wasn't trying to push anti-vax propaganda. ''Thank you very much for all your messages of support,'' he wrote. ''This tweet was just an update on my current state of fitness following my latest tournament withdrawals. After several tests, the doctors have made a hypothesis about the potential nature of my condition. ''The causes of my pins and needles remain unclear and even the doctors can't tell me exactly what it is. My goal was simply to be transparent with you and not to push anti-vax propaganda,'' the tennis star continued. ''Let's stop appropriating everyone's words for political purposes or simply to serve your beliefs. I don't regret having been vaccinated at all. Everyone does what they want. ''I feel better and better and I hope to be ready for Indian Wells! (I don't want to answer all the haters like last time but you still make me laugh and thanks for that.)'' According to the Daily Mail, Monfils is the second French player to be forced off court after a suspected adverse reaction to a coronavirus vaccine.

Metal prices surge on fears of supply disruption, aluminum hits record Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:22 A worker watches as aluminum ingots pass along a conveyor belt after cooling in the foundry at the Krasnoyarsk aluminum smelter, operated by United Co. Rusal, in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. Andrey Rudakov | Bloomberg | Getty Images Commodities prices surged across the board Thursday amid fears of a supply disruption after Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia is a key producer and exporter of not just energy, but metals and grains, too. Markets were already tight ahead of the invasion, meaning there's little ability to absorb any output cuts. ""With base metals inventories already running extremely low, there is very little additional cushion for further supply disruptions '-- either from Russia directly or via higher-for-longer gas and power prices,"" JPMorgan said in a note to clients. Aluminum prices jumped more than 3% to hit a record high of $3,450 per ton on the London Metal Exchange. Nickel is now trading at the highest level in more than a decade: around $25,000 per ton. Platinum jumped more than 2%, while palladium surged more than 6%. Russia is a key producer of all four metals. The country supplies 35% of the world's palladium and 10% of world platinum, according to data from Cru. Aluminum, nickel, and crude steel production stands at 6%, 5% and 4%, respectively. ""[A]luminum and nickel are making further gains amid fears that these two base metals could suffer supply outages from Russia as sanctions are imposed and counteraction is taken,"" Commerzbank said Thursday in a note to clients. Wheat prices jumped to the highest level in more than nine years, while corn futures also advanced. Oil surged more than 8%, breaking above $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. oil benchmark, traded as high as $100.54 per barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded above $105. ""Though there have been no physical supply disruptions yet, there are serious concerns that Russia could move to restrict commodity exports in response to US sanctions,"" RBC said Thursday. ""With the notable exception of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has already been halted, the White House has gone to great lengths to convey that it will not target the Russian energy sector and exacerbate an already tight supply situation,"" the firm added. Natural gas futures jumped 4.6% to trade at $4.835 per million British thermal units. The move in Europe was far more extreme, with prices surging more than 30%. Russia supplies around one third of Europe's natural gas.

Here's how your Tesla could be affected by AT&T's 3G network shutdown | TESLARATI Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 14:09 AT&T will officially shut down its 3G network today, completing a phase-out of the near-obsolete connectivity as newer, high-speed options are now available. If you own a Model S vehicle built before June 2015, your car may be affected. AT&T planned to shut down its 3G network as LTE, 4G, and 5G networks offer customers faster speeds. 3G is simply no longer needed. However, customers of other companies who have used AT&T's 3G network are also affected. This, unfortunately, includes anyone who owns a pre-June 2015 build of the Model S, as its infotainment center needs to be upgraded to be compatible with the newer networks. In July, Teslarati reported that AT&T's 3G network shutdown would require a retrofit in any Model S built before June 2015. The retrofit is available for only $200, even though a vehicle affected could be nine years old by this time. Infotainment Upgrades for owners who drive pre-April 2018 versions of the Model S or Model X are eligible to purchase the MCU2 upgrade as well, but it's available for $2,000 plus tax unless Autopilot Computer 2.0 or 2.5 is installed. For vehicles equipping the Autopilot 2.0 or 2.5 computer, the upgrade is only $1,500. How to know if your Tesla Model S is affectedTesla encourages owners to check if their vehicles are affected. ''Your vehicle will be affected by AT&T's 3G network shutdown if it is a Model S vehicle built before June 2015 and has not been upgraded to an LTE-capable modem or purchased Infotainment Upgrade, as these vehicles were not produced with a 4G/LTE capable modem.'' ''You can also check your vehicle's cellular network by looking at the connectivity status bars/icon near the top of the touchscreen. If 'LTE' is displayed next to this icon at any time (may require stable cellular connectivity), your vehicle will not be affected by AT&T's 3G network shutdown,'' Tesla said. Owners can schedule the appointment by going to the Tesla Mobile App. Select 'Schedule Service' > 'Upgrades & Accessories' > 'LTE Upgrade.' The upgrade is needed because the Model S built before June 2015 uses a modem that is 3G compatible. New builds contain LTE-compatible modems that will operate with 4G and 5G networks. Without upgrading, owners will lose the ability to access the following features unless connected to Wi-Fi: Roadside assistance to unlock your vehicle remotelyCertain mobile app capabilities, including Summon, cabin pre-conditioning, vehicle location, remote unlock, etc.Certain Infotainment features, including navigation, maps, live traffic updates, up-to-date Supercharger availability and outage information, online music streaming, and onboard map updatesOver-the-air updatesAT&T told CNN Business in a statement earlier today, ''For nearly two years, we've proactively sent numerous communications via direct mail, bill messaging, emails and text messages to help customers transition to next-generation networks before 3G services end on February 22.'' AT&T has been provided free replacement phones to many users with a 3G device since 2020. 3G networks launched back in 2002 and were an integral part of the growth of cell phones and wireless communications. Eventually, faster speeds were needed and shutting down the 3G networks globally is part of a larger commitment to re-use 4G and 5G infrastructure, which is more efficient than 3G. Verizon and T-Mobile will also deactivate their 3G networks by the end of the year. I'd love to hear from you! If you have any comments, concerns, or questions, please email me at joey@teslarati.com.

Gijzelnemer Leidseplein is bekende van justitie en kreeg hulp voor verward gedrag | NU - Het laatste nieuws het eerst op NU.nl Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 13:45 De 27-jarige Amsterdammer die dinsdagavond tientallen mensen gijzelde in een Apple Store aan het Leidseplein, is een bekende van justitie. Dat schrijft Het Parool woensdag. Het zou gaan om Abdel Rahman A., die in het verleden geregeld verward en dreigend gedrag vertoonde. Volgens de krant is de verdachte eerder opgepakt voor verboden wapenbezit en het belagen van zijn ex-vriendin. Zijn laatste veroordeling dateerde van mei vorig jaar. Het Parool schrijft op basis van ingewijden dat A. geregeld verward gedrag vertoonde en daarvoor hulpverlening kreeg. Eerder op de dag schreef RTL Nieuws dat de verdachte werkzaam was voor de bezorgdienst van Albert Heijn. Tijdens de gijzeling stond er urenlang een bestelbus met knipperlichten bij de Apple Store.

Director Warns Of Urgent CYBERATTACK Threat By Russia Against Power Plants, Banks, Communications, GPS Navigation and Water Treatment Facilities Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 13:33 Biden responded to Russia's incursion into Eastern Ukraine that is happening right now by placing sanctions on the country that will undoubtedly affect gas prices in the US and costs on other items. Biden billed this as a necessary 'sacrifice' that Americans will have to make to stand up to Russia. This morning, Russia issued a warning after the United States imposed sanctions, warning that there would be a 'painful' response.

Advocaat: gijzelnemer Apple Store overleden | Het Parool Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 13:00 Gekleed in een camouflagepak hield A. een klant van de winkel urenlang onder schot. Beeld ANP Dat laat advocaat Jan-Kees van den Brink op verzoek van de moeder van Akkad weten aan Het Parool. ''Hij was niet meer aanspreekbaar en is inmiddels overleden,'' zegt Van den Brink. De raadsman stond Akkad in het verleden meermaals bij in strafzaken. Omdat Akkad niet bij kennis is geweest, heeft hij niet om een advocaat kunnen vragen. Van den Brink benadrukt dan ook dat hij namens de moeder van Akkad spreekt en niet namens zijn oud-clint. Gijzeling duurde 5 uur Abdel Rahman Akkad liep dinsdag aan het eind van de middag, gehuld in een camouflagepak waaraan explosieven bevestigd waren, met twee vuurwapens de Apple Store aan het Leidseplein in. Hij schoot tenminste vier keer op de politie die op de melding van een overval af kwam en zette vervolgens een 44-jarige Bulgaarse klant van de winkel een wapen op het hoofd. Wat volgde was een gijzeling die 5 uur duurde. Een enorme politiemacht en zwaarbewapende eenheden van onder andere de Dienst Speciale Intreventies (DSI) kwamen ter plekke om de situatie tot een goed einde te brengen. Ook waren er gesprekken met onderhandelaars van de politie. Aan het begin van de gijzeling zocht Akkad zelf contact met de politie. Hij eiste uiteindelijk 200 miljoen aan cryptovaluta. In het pand beleefden medewerkers en klanten van de Apple Store ondertussen hachelijke momenten. Vier mensen zaten in doodsangst verstopt in een kast. Op de bovenverdiepingen van het Hirschgebouw, waar de Apple Store op de begane grond zit, zaten nog ongeveer 65 slachtoffers urenlang vast tot de politie ze bevrijdde. Zwaargewond Omstreeks half elf 's avonds vroeg Akkad om water. Toen dat via een robot voor de deur werd bezorgd, kreeg de gegijzelde de opdracht het water te pakken, maar hij nam de benen. Akkad rende hem achterna, waarna een lid van een arrestatieteam vol gas gaf en hem hard aanreed. De gijzelnemer werd zwaargewond overgebracht naar het ziekenhuis en is tot zijn overlijden niet meer bij kennis geweest. ''Het belangrijkste is nu dat de moeder van Abdel Rahman de pers verzoekt om de familie met rust te laten,'' aldus Van Den Brink. Hier zou content moeten staan van bijv.

Chicago lifting mask and vaccine mandates on Feb. 28 but will keep masks in schools for now - Chicago Sun-Times Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 12:56 Chicago will lift its mask and proof-of-vaccine mandates next week, but Chicago Public School students, teachers and employees must keep their masks on '-- at least for the time being. Starting this coming Monday, patrons of restaurants, bars and gyms will be free to take their masks off and keep their vaccine cards in their wallets, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady announced at a City Hall news conference Tuesday. ''It's important for us to recognize this moment for what it is: a huge step forward in our effort to overcome COVID-19,'' Lightfoot said. ''We would not have been in a position '-- even a few weeks ago '-- to be making this kind of announcement today.'' But rather than risk yet another confrontation with the Chicago Teachers Union '-- and with vaccination rates varying dramatically between school communities '-- Lightfoot and CPS CEO Pedro Martinez said they will abide by the agreement struck with CTU that ended a dispute that canceled classes for five days last month. The safety agreement with the teachers union mandates masks in schools until August. ''We have made great progress in recent weeks against this virus, and we do not want to jeopardize that progress by moving too quickly,'' the district said in a statement released later Tuesday. ''We look forward to the day when we can be mask-optional at CPS, but we still need to get more students vaccinated across our District, and we still need to work with our public health and labor partners on the best way to preserve a safe in-person learning environment for all.'' The CTU said in a statement it was ''glad that CPS will continue to honor the safety agreement that our members sacrificed four days of pay [for] last month ... despite a right-wing legal attack to remove public health protections.'' Still, a lawsuit by CPS parents in Mount Greenwood against the mandate could impact the situation going forward. Mask mandates already have been removed in more than 150 school districts around the state after a judge blocked Gov. J.B. Pritzker's school mask requirement. Transit, health care will keep masksThe mayor noted that masks would continue to be required on public transit, in health care settings and in other congregate spaces, following federal mandates and CDC guidance. Lightfoot also urged understanding of individual decisions, something that has been in short supply in recent weeks during the raging controversy over masks that has divided the nation. ''Many residents may continue to wear masks in public spaces for a variety of reasons '--even if they are vaccinated or as more mandates and advisories fade. ... Also, some venues may continue to impose their own mitigation efforts to keep their clients and customers safe. That is their right. And we must respect it,'' Lightfoot said. Noting that she caught a mild case of COVID-19, Lightfoot said she intends to continue wearing a mask, particularly in restaurants where diners will soon have no idea whether other customers are vaccinated. ''I don't want to put myself at risk. ... That's my personal choice,'' Lightfoot said. Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia welcomed the mayor's decision to lift the mandates, keeping to the same statewide date set by Pritzker. ''We're going back to a sense of normalcy. That's what the general public wants to see. And if operators still want to impose mask mandates at their individual restaurants, they can. I think there might be a few,'' Toia said. Since Jan. 3, Chicago has required restaurant, bar and gym patrons to show proof of vaccination and a photo ID. Rudina Alihajdaraj, a hostess with Pequod's Pizza, inspects a COVID-19 vaccination card on Monday, Jan. 3, 2022, the first day that proof of vaccination mandate is required to eat inside at Chicago restaurants. Tyler LaRiviere/Sun-Times The requirement forced restaurants and bars already struggling with a shortage of staff to reassign some workers to check vaccination cards and IDs '-- or ask beleaguered wait staff to do it. Either way, it's been a burden that has occasionally resulted in confrontations between employees and customers, Toia said. ''It has been difficult. When you get a party of five or six that comes in, three or four might have the vaccine and a couple don't. Then, a party of five leaves because all five of 'em do not have the vaccine. That's tough. It's been a tough January and February for restaurant operators,'' he said. The mayor acknowledged that the mask and proof of vaccine mandates have been a ''challenge to enforce and a challenge to the bottom lines'' of restaurants. The move to lift the mandates comes after the bottom dropped out on the Omicron surge. As of Tuesday, Chicago's average daily case rate was 283 '-- down 37% from the 452 cases-a-day just one week ago. Hospitalizations were down 29% '-- to a daily average of 27. Deaths were down 51 % over the last week '-- from 9.7 last week to 4.7. The city's positivity rate was 1.5%. That's down from 2% a week ago. Even by the mayor's own standards for lifting mitigations, Chicago now passes the test with flying colors. Lightfoot was asked Tuesday whether the declaration of independence from masks and proof-of-vaccine mandates marks an end to a pandemic that has dragged on for two years. ''From your lips to God's ears,'' she replied. ''We really don't know.''

City leaders go mute as a scandal involving heroin, a CPD chief's car, a confidential police informant, and the city's police oversight agency brews - CWB Chicago Link to Article Archived Version Thu, 24 Feb 2022 12:56 A scandal is brewing, and city officials appear to be battening down the hatches. Tuesday, three city offices involved in the story, the mayor, the police department, and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) all failed to respond to questions about it. Let's get you up to speed quickly. Last week, news broke that a man with a long list of felony drug convictions was charged with felony heroin distribution after he allegedly threw $6,300 worth of heroin from a Lexus owned by CPD's chief of internal affairs, Yolanda Talley. Talley was not in the car. Her niece was driving it at the time. When cops pulled the Lexus over, the niece told them, ''My auntie's probably your boss,'' the Sun-Times reported last night. The man who allegedly threw the heroin from the car's passenger seat is in a relationship with Talley's niece, according to the report. CWB reported exclusively on Monday that the man who allegedly threw the heroin from the car, Kenneth Miles, is identified in public records as the confidential police source whose bad information led to the wrongful raid of Anjanette Young's home in February 2019. The city cut a $2.9 million settlement check to end litigation with Young just two months ago. Our story also revealed that COPA's public report about the botched raid exposed Miles as the informant by giving the date, time, and police district where the ''John Doe'' informant who sparked the Young raid had been arrested. Arrest records, including dates, times, and locations, are public information. Miles' CPD arrest report from that date includes a police supervisor's note that he wanted to ''John Doe'' a search warrant hours before cops raided Young's home, we reported. Asked to confirm Miles' involvement in the Young search warrant, a CPD spokesperson on Monday said, ''To ensure the safety of all involved and to maintain the integrity of the ongoing investigation, CPD cannot and will not comment on whether someone is or is not a confidential source.'' The department has refused to answer any questions about the heroin arrest involving Talley's car, saying the matter is under investigation by the city's inspector general. A problematic reportCOPA's exposure of a confidential police source is troubling. Also troubling is this: CWB found other information in COPA's report that exposed other private citizens' personal details. One of those additional exposures is particularly egregious. We shared that specific example with COPA and the office of Mayor Lori Lightfoot in separate sets of emailed questions on Tuesday morning. We sent a third set of questions to the Chicago Police Department. Neither the mayor's office, COPA, nor CPD responded to our inquiries. Unanswered questionsWe sent the following questions to CPD's top spokespersons, Don Terry and Tom Ahern, on Tuesday morning. They did not reply. What is Chief Talley's current position and status with the Chicago Police Department?If she is still in position as chief of internal affairs: Why is it appropriate for the person in charge of internal investigations to remain in place while under investigation?Did COPA ask CPD to review the public Anjanette Young report before release to ensure that no compromising information was included? If so, who at CPD handled that review?In a Tuesday morning email to Ephraim Eaddy, COPA's public information officer, we provided examples of compromising information within the agency's Anjanette Young report along with the following questions. Our inquiry noted that we were not asking COPA to confirm our previous reporting. The questions stand on their own. He did not reply. Who is responsible for preparing COPA reports for public release (redacting sensitive information, etc)? What is their training? Do they have law enforcement experience? Which COPA supervisors, managers, and executives signed off on the content of the publicly-released Anjanette Young report?Did COPA ask CPD to review the public Anjanette Young report before release to ensure that no compromising information was included? If not, why not? If so, who at CPD handled that review?Will COPA conduct a review of its report review system to ensure that sensitive information is not released to the public? Who will handle the review? What is the timetable for completion? Will a public report of findings be available? When? If no review will be conducted, why not?Also on Tuesday morning, we sent examples of COPA's compromised information and the following questions to Cesar Rodriguez, the mayor's press secretary. Again, we noted that we were not asking the mayor's office to confirm CWB's reporting in any way. He did not reply. Did the mayor read COPA's public report before it was released?Will the mayor order an investigation and/or review of COPA's report review system to ensure that sensitive information is not released to the public? Who will handle that? What is the timetable for completion? Goals? If no such order will be made, why not?Why is it appropriate for the head of CPD internal affairs to remain in position while OIG is investigating her and the circumstances of the heroin arrest involving her vehicle?Did the city consider bringing in a non-city agency to handle the investigation of the arrest involving Talley's vehicle?

1,5c38da5a-520e-4906-9452-2fb5ca4bb27d,"['Marcus Aurelius', 'You Are Going To Send Email To', 'Move Comment']",2022-02-24,"A board member of a large German insurance company has spoken out over the “alarming” data his company has found regarding Covid vaccine side-effects.

Up to the end of 2021, the German Government recorded around 245,000 vaccine side-effects. However, the analysis by health insurance company BKK ProVita suggests the true figure is up to ten times higher.

A search of the databases of all BKK health insurance companies found that, from January to August 2021, around 217,000 of about 11 million BKK policyholders had to be treated for vaccine side-effects. Andreas Schöfbeck, the board member who spoke out, told Die Welt: “According to our calculations, we consider 400,000 doctor visits by our insured persons due to vaccination complications to date to be realistic. Extrapolated to the total population, this figure would be three million.” That comes out as around ten times higher than the official figure from the Paul Ehrlich Institute, the Government agency responsible for vaccinations.

Mr. Schöfbeck suggests the shortcomings of the passive reporting system are the main explanation for the massive discrepancy, with doctors often having to report vaccine side-effects in their spare time – a time-consuming and unpaid activity. Doctors may also be reticent to see or report problems with the Covid vaccines, which have been the subject of massive public health campaigns and widely seen as the way out of the pandemic.

Mr. Schöfbeck says he sent his company’s analysis to a range of bodies, including the German Medical Association, the Standing Committee on Vaccination (StiKo) and the Paul Ehrlich Institute. He reports he told them the figures were a “strong alarm signal” that “absolutely must be taken into account in the further use of vaccines”. He suggested his figures could be validated by the usual data analyses of health insurance companies, adding it is “ethically wrong not to talk about it” as “danger to human life cannot be ruled out”. When none of the bodies appeared to show interest in the findings he went public with his concerns.

Evidence has been emerging in recent weeks that Government vaccine adverse event reporting systems are systematically under-reporting side-effects. An Israeli survey asking vaccine recipients about side-effects found rates hundreds or even thousands of times higher than official figures. The U.K. MHRA has previously estimated that only around 10% of serious vaccine side-effects are reported, a figure that fits with the German insurance company data. The claims of health authorities that these events are almost all coincidental are beginning to look very shaky indeed.",https://dailysceptic.org/2022/02/24/vaccine-side-effects-up-to-10-times-higher-than-official-figures-insurance-company-board-member-reveals/

HOPE

“In this current climate it is easy to despair and it is easy to give up. But it is exactly at moments like this that we need to reorganise and redouble our efforts, because if we don’t then things could get a whole lot worse. From somewhere we must all find some hope, both to meet the challenges we are facing today, but also to ensure that tomorrow can be better.”

“Democracy depends on elected representatives exercising political power in a transparent fashion. It depends on political influence being distributed between citizens, rather than concentrated among private companies. And it depends upon a vigilant, politically engaged public who can see and care about the point of government. But privatisation corrodes all of these things, and diminishes peoples’ ability to democratically govern themselves.”

The Covid crisis has shown how privatisation corrodes democracy

Not only has outsourcing failed citizens during the pandemic – it makes states less responsive and less accountable

24 December 2020

While Britain hedges its bets on a mass vaccination programme and battles a new variant of coronavirus, daily life in New Zealand and Taiwan has been slowly returning to normal. There are numerous reasons these countries fared better during the pandemic, but one of the main reasons the UK has done so badly by comparison is the government’s decision to outsource huge swaths of its pandemic response to the private sector.

Ministers’ decision to outsource both testing and tracing, awarding contracts worth millions of pounds to companies such as Deloitte and Serco, has been a fiasco. These failings aren’t unique to Britain; in the Italian region of Lombardy, for example, 40% of all healthcare providers are privately owned. Because primary and preventive care are less profitable, the region suffers from a chronic under-provision of both. As a result, hospitals have been overburdened during the pandemic, while many wealthy Italians have turned to private clinics to pay for Covid-related care.

The pandemic has refuted a myth sold to us since the reigns of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan: that private firms are more effective at delivering services than lumbering state bureaucracies. Over the past 40 years, governments have contracted out public services, from welfare benefits to prison management and public transport. Privatisation isn’t always wholesale; in the NHS, for example, the process has been slow and partial, with competitive tendering introduced in the 1980s, followed by the internal market in the 1990s.

Arguments against privatisation tend to focus on companies’ failure to deliver a good service. But there is a more insidious problem at stake. Even when governments fall short of completely selling off public assets, there is a fundamental conflict between democratic values and the privatisation of public services. In large societies, peoples’ ability to democratically govern themselves relies on a functioning system of representation. Governments are elected to represent citizens, who should in turn be able to influence elected governments.

In a democracy, we want those delivering public services to make decisions in our name. When public services are outsourced, decisions are made by private companies (whether for-profit, or non-profit), rather than elected representatives. It’s doubtful whether the private sector can ever act in a genuinely representative capacity – after all, we don’t elect companies. Private firms aren’t the same as civil servants; they have their own goals to pursue, as well as fiduciary obligations to shareholders. Indeed, acting out of private interest often just means not acting in the name of a democratic public.

Governments often turn to private companies and institutions because they lack the capacity to perform certain functions themselves. When it transpired that management consultants were charging the government up to £6,250 a day to work on the UK’s Covid testing system, the Department of Health and Social Care said these consultants had “the specialist skills and experience we need”. But outsourcing doesn’t help this matter. If a state isn’t able to deliver services, then it probably won’t be able to properly regulate private contractors, either. The more services a government turns over to companies, the more people and resources it must marshal to monitor these myriad agreements.

That doesn’t happen. After all, privatisation is often part of cost-cutting drives, and slashing public budgets only makes it more difficult for governments to regulate contractors. People often argue that the issue with privatisation is that governments fail to ensure their contractors deliver. Yet it’s not the delivery or detail that’s the problem, but the very logic of privatisation itself: the more a government turns over its functions to the market, the more it loses the capacity to do things itself and hold contractors accountable.

The result of this is often cronyism, as we’ve seen during the pandemic, with ministers awarding contracts for PPE and medical supplies to companies that had links to the Conservative party but no substantive experience in this field. Even when it doesn’t result in venal corruption, though, privatisation upsets the distribution of political power in a democracy. The more governments depend on private firms, the more those firms can urge politicians to enact policies that aren’t in citizens’ interests.

An equally important but less noticeable outcome is how this process makes the government invisible to its citizens. When Serco was awarded a contract to conduct Covid tracing in the UK, for example, it then subcontracted the service to 29 other companies, outsourcing 85% of jobs. Amid such complex webs of different providers, the role of government becomes obscured. The end result is what has been called the “submerged state”. As more government spending is filtered through private companies, citizens no longer see it as government spending, and the state becomes hidden from view. If government is invisible, how can we expect people to trust the state, or be willing to support it through their taxes?

This not only creates confusion about who is responsible for what – it also produces civic apathy. When people don’t see their own government as the main provider of the benefits they receive, they’re left with little reason to care about the point of government at all.

Democracy depends on elected representatives exercising political power in a transparent fashion. It depends on political influence being distributed between citizens, rather than concentrated among private companies. And it depends upon a vigilant, politically engaged public who can see and care about the point of government. But privatisation corrodes all of these things, and diminishes peoples’ ability to democratically govern themselves

The threat of outsourcing public services isn’t just that it’s frequently more costly, more inefficient and less effective. It’s that it undermines the very possibility of democracy. For societies whose healthcare systems are privatised, or who outsourced large functions of their responses to Covid-19, the pandemic should be a moral and political reckoning. No part of this will be more critical than the slow, difficult job of reimagining what a democratic state, capable of acting in the name of the public, should look like. Nothing less than the fate of democracy depends upon it.

La Lombardia e la debolezza di credersi invincibili. Gli errori della regione ex feudo di Formigoni e Berlusconi

Questo territorio – scrive Saviano – “ha pagato a caro prezzo le mancanze del suo sistema sanitario misto pubblico-privato”. Ecco l’intervento dello scrittore (originariamente pubblicato su Le Monde)

15 aprile 2020

È accaduto in Italia che proprio la regione ritenuta più forte, la più efficiente, la più ricca fosse quella meno pronta a fronteggiare la pandemia portando avanti scelte di cui presto i suoi dirigenti saranno chiamati a rispondere. Nel sistema italiano, le regioni hanno competenza esclusiva in materia sanitaria e la regione Lombardia è capofila, sia per la ricchezza del territorio, che per il connubio pubblico-privato creato dalle amministrazioni di centro-destra, che hanno occupato il potere ininterrottamente negli ultimi due decenni.

La Lombardia è il territorio di Silvio Berlusconi e la Regione era il feudo di Roberto Formigoni, definitivamente condannato a 5 anni e 10 mesi di carcere per gravi episodi di corruzione, innestatisi proprio sul rapporto tra potere regionale e sanità privata. Ma fino a un mese fa si credeva che quella corruzione fosse solo un incidente di percorso. Ma le cose non stavano così

Dal mio osservatorio di studioso delle dinamiche criminali, e in particolare del potere delle mafie, ho negli anni osservato come per un settentrionale sia più accettabile pensare che il marcio sia comunque proveniente “da fuori”. Eppure, solo dieci anni fa, per aver raccontato nel corso di una trasmissione televisiva quello che era un’ovvietà per ogni investigatore – e cioè che la camorra napoletana e la ‘ndrangheta calabrese, seguendo le orme della mafia siciliana, che lo aveva fatto, almeno dagli anni ’70, avevano infiltrato l’economia legale del nord – fui attaccato al punto di dover ospitare, coattivamente, alla puntata successiva un monologo dell’allora Ministro degli Interni, Roberto Maroni (predecessore di Matteo Salvini alla guida della Lega Nord), ora fuori dalla politica per vicissitudini giudiziarie.

Dopo poco arrivarono anche le condanne e oggi è un dato assodato che in molte parti del Nord le mafie la facciano da padrone. Qui racconto ciò che so, ciò che accade. Ma con una premessa necessaria: non c’è un sistema sanitario al mondo che si è dimostrato in grado di fronteggiare con prontezza l’emergenza Coronavirus, ad eccezione, forse, per i dati che si conoscono oggi, della Corea del Sud. Per quanto possa apparire paradossale, il punto debole della Lombardia è rappresentato dalla sua dinamicità economica e dal volume di scambi e relazioni con l’estero e, in particolare, con la Cina.

Nelle valli bergamasche falcidiate dal virus (alcuni già adesso parlano di un’intera generazione cancellata) esiste una miriade (migliaia) di piccole aziende, spesso con meno di dieci dipendenti, che però rappresentano un’eccellenza tale da fare di quei distretti industriali una vera locomotiva, non solo per la Regione Lombardia. A un certo punto, però, mentre i media parlavano delle scelte drammatiche che erano rimesse ai medici delle terapie intensive, tra chi intubare e chi lasciar morire, altre scelte venivano fatte e il tema del contendere è stato: chiudere le produzioni, con il rischio di un collasso economico, o mantenere aperto tutto il possibile, sacrificando vite umane? Va da sé che non c’è stato un dibattito pubblico sulla questione, e ci mancherebbe.

La cosa grave è che la Regione Lombardia e il governo centrale si sono passati, nel corso di molte settimane, la patata bollente della decisione di chiudere tutto. Oggi sappiamo che, nel frattempo, per non confinare in casa operai che erano utili alla catena di montaggio e che, soprattutto nel caso di piccole imprese, dovevano e devono decidere tra la vita e il lavoro, si è favorita una massiccia diffusione del contagio, che al di là della parzialità dei dati, restituisce una mortalità, in termini assoluti, spaventosa.

Oggi questa realtà è venuta fuori in tutta la sua gravità, restituendo l’immagine di un territorio nel quale le classi dirigenti hanno deciso a tavolino di “non fermarsi”, probabilmente mettendo in conto l’ecatombe, magari puntando sulla sorte.

Quanto sta emergendo sui ritardi nel disporre la zona rossa nei comuni di Alzano e Nembro, nella Bergamasca, e sui ricoveri nelle residenze sanitarie in cui si prestano cure agli anziani (RSA) sono questioni sconvolgenti, che non possono non essere messe in connessione con un tasso di letalità del virus che, in quelle zone, è altissima e miete centinaia di vittime ogni giorno. Da molte parti si sta invocando, proprio a causa della crisi lombarda, un passaggio della gestione sanitaria dalle regioni al governo centrale.

Per certi versi, è intuitivo pensare che quanto è accaduto, quindi le “indecisioni”, il “rischiare” siano stati frutto di un’eccessiva dipendenza del potere politico regionale rispetto a quello economico-produttivo. Ora che le cose sono andate malissimo, il rischio concreto è che chi ha deciso queste “strategie” criminali possa avere interesse a occultare le proprie responsabilità.

Il tasso di letalità del virus in Lombardia è frutto soprattutto delle scelte fallimentari compiute da una classe dirigente mediocre, che andrebbe esautorata immediatamente se non ci fosse un’emergenza drammatica in corso. Ma mentre oggi le sirene delle ambulanze coprono ancora le voci dei familiari delle persone lasciate morire a causa di una sequela di errori che hanno aggravato l’effetto dirompente del contagio, tra poco sarà il tempo di processare chi è venuto meno ai suoi doveri.

Il caso lombardo assume peraltro una connotazione ancora più oscura se raffrontato a quello della regione confinante, il Veneto, che pure a fronte di una popolazione assai inferiore (circa la metà), ma caratterizzato da una simile vivacità sul piano economico, ha affrontato la crisi in maniera completamente differente e, ad oggi, più efficace.

Per quello che ora sappiamo, tra Lombardia e Veneto (entrambe governate dalla Lega) esiste una differenza di approccio all’epidemia che è quantificabile nel numero di persone che hanno perso la vita – 10mila in Lombardia vs meno di 1.000 in Veneto – a fronte di un numero di tamponi eseguiti pressappoco identico (quasi 170mila).

Il Veneto, a differenza della Lombardia, ha puntato molto sul tracciamento degli asintomatici per individuare ogni focolaio, per poi agire con prontezza sigillando i territori per impedire l’espansione del contagio. A differenza della Lombardia – dove il virus (come in molte altre parti del mondo, ma non con una tale intensità) ha visto crescere il contagio anche a causa della impreparazione al fenomeno dei piccoli ospedali sul territorio – il Veneto ha provato a ridurre l’ospedalizzazione dei malati (salve, ovviamente, le ipotesi gravi), privilegiando l’assistenza domiciliare.

La Lombardia, di fronte a una crisi senz’altro non prevedibile nella sua velocità di diffusione, ha pagato soprattutto per i deficit organizzativi che il sistema misto pubblico-privato – fino ad allora considerato, anche a ragione, dato che ogni anno migliaia di persone da altre regioni vi si recavano per cure, il meglio possibile – ha mostrato: a fronte di grandi eccellenze, un livello medio piuttosto basso sul piano organizzativo (fondamentale, a tal proposito, leggere la lettera che la FROMCeO Lombardia e cioè la Federazione Regionale degli Ordini dei Medici Chirurghi e degli Odontoiatri della Lombardia ha inviato ai vertici della Regione stigmatizzando l’incertezza nella chiusura di alcune zone, la mancanza di mascherine e dispositivi di protezione e i pochi tamponi effettuati) e un dominio incontrastato della politica e dei gruppi di potere.

Un esempio per comprendere questa dinamica è quello di Comunione e Liberazione, un’associazione cattolica della quale, fino alla condanna definitiva, il corrotto Roberto Formigoni era uomo di punta. Comunione e Liberazione è potentissima in Lombardia e detta legge; basti pensare alla percentuale maggioritaria, nelle strutture pubbliche, di medici antiabortisti e della difficoltà che la maggior parte delle donne trova a farsi prescrivere la pillola abortiva, nonostante sia previsto dalla legge: la “tecnica” elusiva è semplice.

I medici obiettori di coscienza hanno molte più possibilità di fare carriera rispetto a quelli non obiettori. Come si potesse, anche ieri, ascrivere questa dinamica mafiosa al concetto di efficienza è stato per me sempre un mistero. E dispiace che i lombardi debbano rendersi conto oggi, sulla pelle loro e dei loro cari, dell’anomalia di certe dinamiche, che lungi dal rappresentare eccezione gettano una luce sinistra sulla regola seguita in generale.

Vedete, nascere e crescere al Sud Italia, uno dei territori viceversa più poveri d’Europa (con un pil in molte parti inferiore a quello della Grecia), ti dà gli strumenti per capire oggi cosa accadrà domani.

E quello che è accaduto in Lombardia e in Veneto, che sono state le prime zone in Europa colpite dal Covid-19, è di vitale importanza per il resto del continente perché mostra due approcci differenti e indica esattamente, nel caso della Lombardia, cosa non fare, come non agire, come non comunicare.

Ma le colpe non sono solo del centro-destra al potere, poiché viceversa le città di Bergamo e Milano sono amministrate dal centro-sinistra. Ma il virus è arrivato a scoprire l’assoluta inadeguatezza di un approccio economicista e manageriale della cosa pubblica che caratterizza un territorio ricchissimo, nel quale il lavoro è un imperativo e la dimensione individualistica è accentuata fino al parossismo.

Le biografie stesse dei sindaci di centro-sinistra di Milano e di Bergamo aiutano a comprendere le falle nella gestione delle prime fasi dell’emergenza. Il sindaco di Milano Giuseppe Sala è un uomo di estrazione di centro-destra assurto alle cronache per la gestione dell’evento EXPO 2015, mentre quello di Bergamo, Giorgio Gori, è stato per lunghissimo tempo un uomo di punta dell’azienda televisiva di proprietà di Silvio Berlusconi.

Entrambi hanno sottovalutato al principio l’emergenza sanitaria, preoccupandosi solo delle possibili ricadute economiche. Non solo hanno provato in tutti i modi a non “fermare le macchine”, ma hanno addirittura invitato i cittadini, nonostante l’epidemia in corso, a prendere parte alla vita di comunità, assecondando in tutto i desiderata del comparto produttivo, che non riusciva a vedere nel lockdown una alternativa di vita praticabile e che, a questo punto, dobbiamo ritenere sia l’unico riferimento nella loro azione amministrativa.

Il paradosso di questa crisi sembra quasi delineare un insegnamento filosofico. Proprio i politici a capo della regione che si è sempre vantata di aver fatto tutto da sé e che negli ultimi trent’anni ha chiesto sempre maggiore autonomia – il partito più forte del Nord, la Lega, prima di essere sovranista era, fino a pochissimi anni fa, secessionista – lamentando il peso dell’improduttivo meridione (però formidabile serbatoio di “risorse umane”, come direbbe un manager), che ha sempre deprecato ogni accentramento e ogni decisione presa dalla inconcludente e disorganizzata Roma, in questa emergenza hanno finito per dare la responsabilità delle proprie indecisioni, e delle conseguenti omissioni, al governo centrale. Che avrebbe dovuto decidere al posto loro, levandogli le castagne dal fuoco: davvero disonorevole, oltre che criminale.

L’Europa – e il resto del mondo – sta affrontando un momento estremamente delicato in cui si deciderà davvero del suo futuro. È stato detto molte volte, ma questa è quella definitiva, perché oggi in Europa non si decide solo il destino del continente e dei paesi che ne fanno parte, ma si decide soprattutto del destino di tutte le persone che ci vivono e ci vivranno, anche di chi non è ancora nato.

Perché è bene dirlo: oggi si sta decidendo di condannare le future generazioni di buona parte dell’Europa a pagare i debiti contratti dai propri genitori a causa di una forza maggiore. E anche questo è assai poco onorevole, soprattutto per quei piccoli paesi che sottraggono risorse ad altri attraverso il dumping fiscale. Un mondo che è risorto dalle macerie della seconda guerra mondiale, del nazismo e del fascismo, dei campi di sterminio, dei totalitarismi comunisti per giungere alla sublimazione del contabile al posto del politico. Che disonore: non oso immaginare quale trattamento riserverebbero i padri dell’Europa a questi mediocri che credono che gli Stati siano delle aziende e le persone dei numeri da inserire in un bilancio.

Penso a Helmut Kohl e al coraggio che ebbe a riunire la Germania per condurla in un’Europa libera e solidale e al sostegno che trovò nei partner europei. Ma Kohl è morto e con lui, probabilmente, l’ultima idea nobile di Europa.

Se penso alla Germania, non posso non pensare alla nostra Lombardia. Non posso non pensare che l’operosa Germania, in qualche modo, stia all’Europa come l’operosa Lombardia sta all’Italia. E mi torna in mente Scurati che ha descritto il milanese al tempo del Covid-19 come un animale spaventato, atterrito dalle sicurezze perse nel giro di poche, pochissime settimane: la debolezza insita nel credersi invincibili. Che senso ha l’efficienza senza la solidarietà: forse è lì, ancora, la differenza tra l’uomo e la macchina.

I vertici della Regione Lombardia hanno sbagliato ad aver assecondato Confindustria lombarda, il cui presidente, Marco Bonometti in un’intervista ha difeso la scelta di non aver chiuso fabbriche dicendo: “Però ora non farei il processo alle intenzioni, bisogna salvare il salvabile, altrimenti saremo morti prima e saremo morti dopo”. Argomento da industriale, senz’altro; ma la Politica, quella con la P maiuscola, è altro e certo non possono farla gli industriali. Ma essere arrivati al dilemma: se morire prima, fisicamente, e morire poi, economicamente, fa capire bene la sfida posta dal virus alla politica europea, prima che italiana.

Forse, ma non ne sono certo, c’è ancora spazio per uscire dalla pandemia per seguire un’utopia: riscoprire che produttività e conti correnti valgono meno delle persone, riscoprire che allargare diritti, espanderli, significa salvarci tutti. Riscoprire ora che una politica che decide solo seguendo l’odore del denaro è una politica che genera morte e non ricchezza. E che dice a chiare lettere: “l’Europa non esiste più e oggi è un nuovo 1945”. Io spero che gli uomini di buona volontà non lo permetteranno.

“People were killed by politics”

Prosecutors examine claims Covid spread in Italy before official confirmation

New evidence ‘could change the timeline of the pandemic in Italy’, say lawyers for victims’ families

05 July 2021

Italian prosecutors are examining fresh evidence that suggests coronavirus was spreading in the country weeks before the first case of local transmission was officially detected as criminal investigations continue into continental Europe’s deadliest outbreak.

Lawyers representing the families of Covid-19 victims say the medical records of a man in his 50s who was admitted to a hospital with bilateral pneumonia at the end of January 2020 in Bergamo, the Lombardy province severely hit during the first wave of the pandemic, “could change the timeline of the pandemic in Italy”.

“The impact of this possible negligence is that many deaths could have been avoided,” said Consuelo Locati, representing families in two legal cases. “And if this was a choice that came from high up, like a political choice, it would mean people were killed by politics more so than the virus.”

According to the medical records seen by the Guardian, the patient was discharged on 17 February, four days before Italy’s first locally transmitted infection was confirmed in Codogno, a Lombardy town south of Milan.

Before the Codogno case, two Chinese tourists from Wuhan, who arrived in Milan on 23 January before being hospitalised in Rome a week later, had been the only confirmed Covid-19 patients in Italy.

Italy was the first country in the western world to be engulfed by the pandemic, and has the highest Covid-related death toll (127,649 as of Sunday) in Europe after the UK.

At the time of the diagnosis in Codogno, coronavirus testing was only for those who had travelled to China within the 14 days prior to initial symptoms. But, according to guidelines published by the health ministry on 22 January 2020, testing was also supposed to be done on those “with an unusual and unexpected clinical course, especially if followed by an abrupt deterioration despite adequate treatments, irrespective of their place of residence or travel history”.

The Bergamo patient had developed symptoms of “coughing, with a fever” days before being admitted to hospital in the town of Seriate, according to the medical records. A CT scan of the patient’s lungs showed “the left lung had shaded parenchymal thickening looking like ground glass”. The results of the scan reflected features of Covid-19 in patients who had either clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia.

Prosecutors in Bergamo will now need to verify whether a test for Covid-19 was done on the patient, as part of their investigations into criminal negligence by Italian authorities in the handling of the pandemic. If a test was not carried out, they will need to establish if the pandemic guidelines specified by the health ministry were violated by the local health authority.

Five health managers in the Lombardy region and a former director at the health ministry who are under investigation by prosecutors have denied any wrongdoing.

The new evidence will also be presented in the first hearing at Rome’s civil court on Thursday in a case brought by the same group of families as they seek a total €100m in compensation from the Italian government.

Locati said she is convinced the evidence gathered so far represents “solid proof of systemic negligence”.

“And [the medical records] show how coronavirus might have spread undetected for at least one month in Italy due to a lack of compliance with the guidelines on epidemiological surveillance,” she added.

At the start of the pandemic in Italy, doctors said they believed the virus had been circulating in the country for weeks before it was officially detected. Some medics in Lombardy, by far the region worst affected, reported seeing cases of “strange pneumonia” in patients dating back to late December 2019.

Annalisa Malara, an anaesthetist at Codogno hospital, pushed for Mattia Maestri, an otherwise healthy 38-year-old who became known as Italy’s “patient one”, to be given a Covid test after seeing images of his lungs on 20 February 2020. Maestri was not tested before then as he had not travelled to China prior to becoming ill. His Covid-19 diagnosis was confirmed on 21 February 2020.

Genova, morta la 18enne vaccinata con AstraZeneca all’open day del 25 maggio.

Il 3 giugno si era presentata in pronto soccorso con cefalea e fotofobia. È stata sottoposta ad esami: tac cerebrale ed esame neurologico entrambi negativi. Quindi era stata dimessa con la raccomandazione di ripetere gli esami ematici dopo 15 giorni. Il 5 giugno è ritornata in pronto soccorso con deficit motori a una parte del corpo.

10 Giugno 2021

È morta Camilla Canepa, la 18enne di Sestri Levante ricoverata domenica all’ospedale San Martino di Genova dopo una trombosi al seno cavernoso e operata per la rimozione del trombo e ridurre la pressione intracranica. Era stata vaccinata con AstraZeneca il 25 maggio nell’open day per gli over 18.

L’Azienda ligure sanitaria e Regione Liguria avevano segnalato domenica il caso nell’ambito della farmacovigilanza. La ragazza era stata immunizzata dopo un’anamnesi vaccinale negativa. Il 3 giugno si era presentata in pronto soccorso con cefalea e fotofobia. È stata sottoposta ad esami: tac cerebrale ed esame neurologico entrambi negativi. Quindi era stata dimessa con la raccomandazione di ripetere gli esami ematici dopo 15 giorni. Il 5 giugno è ritornata in pronto soccorso con deficit motori a una parte del corpo. I medici l’hanno quindi nuovamente sottoposta a Tac cerebrale con esito emorragico per questo è stata immediatamente trasferita alla Neurochirurgia del San Martino.

Il caso della 18enne e di altre due giovani donne, una sempre in Liguria e un’altra in Toscana, aveva aperto nuovamente il dibattito sul vaccino sviluppato dall’università di Oxford, considerato sicuro ed efficace dall’Ema che non ha mai imposto limiti d’età. Ed è per questo – dopo le parole del professor Franco Locatelli e una riunione di mercoledì era del Comitato tecnico-scientifico – che è atteo un nuovo parere sulla somministrazione del vaccino alla popolazione più giovane. L’Aifa ancora il 26 maggio scorso ricordava che il composto era raccomandato agli over 60 e a fine aprile proprio in un report dell’Ema era possibile leggere che in una condizione di bassa circolazione del coronavirus che provoca Covid il rapporto beneficio rischio non era più a favore del vaccino con il progressivo abbassamento dell’età. Intanto le Regioni continuano a muoversi in ordine sparso, tra chi ha mantenuto gli open day e chi li ha cancellati dopo i dubbi sollevati da sempre più esperti. “Stiamo discutendo in queste ore, l’Aifa il suo parere l’ha dato, ieri ci siamo riuniti con il Cts, ma credo che adesso la responsabilità – sia del parere che della comunicazione – spetti al ministero della Salute. Noi abbiamo una regola di condotta e posso anticipare che su questo sarà il ministro a pieno titolo a dire quale sarà la decisione” ha detto il presidente dell’Agenzia del farmaco, Giorgio Palù, intervenuto al Pharma Talk online dell’Academy Business School di Rcs.

Dopo la morte della 18enne la procura di Genova ha cambiato il reato con cui era stato aperto il fascicolo che è passato da atti relativi, a omicidio colposo a carico di ignoti. Il pubblico ministero Stefano Puppo insieme al procuratore Francesco Pinto disporranno nelle prossime ore l’autopsia che verrà affidata con ogni probabilità al medico legale Luca Tatjana e all’ematologo Franco Piovella. I due esperti hanno già eseguito gli esami sugli altri quattro casi di decessi dopo vaccini. Il primo è stato quello della docente Francesca Tuscano di 32 anni e poi di tre anziani, tra i 70 e gli 80, a cui erano stati somministrati Astrazeneca e Pfizer. “Grande dolore per la scomparsa di Camilla, la 18enne morta all’ospedale San Martino di Genova per trombosi.

Otto e Mezzo

La commozione della prof.ssa Viola per la diciottenne morta dopo il vaccino AstraZeneca: “C’è stata troppa fretta, i vaccini non sono tutti uguali, conoscevamo il rischio. Sono contraria anche al richiamo nelle persone giovani.”

11 Giugno 2021

“Per me è chiaro che è stato fatto un errore, perchè l’EMA avrebbe dovuto dire che [il vaccino AstraZeneca] non è che sia ‘consigliabile’ sopra i 60 anni, ma è da usare solo sopra i 60 anni. L’AIFA avrebbe dovuto fare la stessa cosa. C’è stata una linea troppo morbida, perché c’era fretta di utilizzarlo, c’era fretta di vaccinare un gran numero di persone, c’era l’ansia di dire: ‘stiamo andando bene, stiamo correndo’. Si è trascurato un fattore determinante e cioè che non siamo tutti uguali e che i vaccini non sono tutti uguali. Questo dato noi lo avevamo: sapevamo che il rischio nelle donne giovani supera i benefici e, a maggior ragione, adesso che c’è una circolazione del virus così bassa. Nonostante ciò, le regioni hanno deciso di fare questi ‘Open Day’, hanno ignorato la raccomandazione di AIFA e hanno preso questa decisione che ha il solo scopo di far alzare il numero dei vaccinati. Ma questo è un atteggiamento sbagliato e purtroppo qualcuno ne ha pagato le conseguenze.”

La fretta di “ripartire”, l’ansia di vaccinare subito anche i giovani, per vederli tornare a riempire spiagge e locali della movida, in vista dell’estate. E quindi gli Open Day promossi a tamburo battente dalle regioni, per tutte le fasce d’età, magari ignorando la raccomandazione AIFA di riservare il vaccino AstraZeneca agli anziani. E ora una 18enne che perde la vita, per questo rischio già noto e documentato, riguardante soprattutto le giovani donne (ma con casi accertati anche nella popolazione maschile). Non sembra poi così forzato il paragone con le vittime del Mottarone: la stessa fretta di iniziare la stagione della ripresa, anche a costo di accettare qualche rischio, non molto ben calcolato. L’impressione di avere tutto sotto controllo, di essere sicuri, per poi scoprire che non era esattamente così. E quindi la tragedia, con il solito infinito rimpallo di responsabilità, sempre così difficili (nel nostro paese, direi quasi impossibili) da identificare. Sullo sfondo, un’attenzione generalmente concentrata sulle esigenze delle attività economiche, con interviste quotidiane a esercenti e imprenditori, di cui conosciamo benissimo tutte le problematiche. Mentre, sempre più di rado, sentiamo le voci dei malati o dei loro familiari, le testimonianze sul percorso che devono affrontare e su come lo stiano affrontando. Qualcuno ha mai raccontato, per esempio, come si vive un caso di “long Covid”? Nella retorica della ripartenza si riserva più spazio a ombrelloni e tavolate.

A shadow epidemic of school dropouts risks worsening Italy’s north-south divide

Teachers and experts warn of an increase in absences after months of school closures, especially in the south.

08 June 2021

CATANIA, Italy — On a school day at the end of May, Maria Leotta’s classroom in Sicily’s second-largest city was almost empty: Just seven of her 19 second-grade pupils showed up for their Italian lesson.

The end of term is near, but that’s not why so few children were in attendance. “It’s been like this all year, students would come intermittently,” said Leotta. “And it was even worse when classes were online … only a third of them would connect to attend my lessons.”

Even before the pandemic, Italy lagged behind many of its peers in educational rankings and suffered from one of the highest early school-leaver rates in the European Union. But the coronavirus crisis, which saw schools shuttered for large parts of the past year, has sent dropout numbers soaring, teachers say. In January, a report by Save the Children Italy found 28 percent of teenagers aged 14 to 18 said that at least one classmate had completely disappeared from online lessons.

Only a handful of European countries kept schools closed for longer than Italy did. When the pandemic hit in March 2020, the government suspended in-person teaching for all ages for a period of 35 weeks; in the fall, when the second wave hit, schools welcomed pupils intermittently, with elementary schools open more often than middle and high schools.

The government argued that keeping schools closed was crucial to stemming the spread of the coronavirus, pointing to the risk of the virus circulating in closed spaces such as classrooms and public transport. Teachers and experts, however, warn that this strategy may have done irreparable damage to children’s futures — particularly in the country’s less developed southern peripheries.

The divide between Italy’s wealthier north and poorer south is reflected in the regions’ respective levels of childhood poverty. A 2018 report by Save the Children found that one in five Italian children lives in relative poverty. But while in northern regions such as Emilia-Romagna and Friuli-Venezia-Giulia the number of children at risk of poverty and social exclusion is closer to 13 percent, in regions like Sicily and Calabria it is 56 and 49 percent, respectively.

Any increase in dropout rates risks entrenching these inequalities. And some experts and teachers fear that this new set of left-behind youth will make easy prey for mafia and gang recruitment.

‘Real danger’

The south was spared the worst of the pandemic, which, at its worst moments, saw military vans line up to transport coffins from northern towns. But the economic fallout cut deeper here, where poverty rates were high and infrastructure was lacking even before the pandemic.

“It simply emphasized a number of pre-existing structural problems, particularly in the education sector,” said Mila Spicola, a consultant at the Ministry for the South and education policies researcher at Italy’s department of social cohesion.

No official statistics are yet available — they will be published in January 2022 — but Spicola said that the shift to online classes left already vulnerable population groups behind, particularly in the south.

Higher dropout rates are inextricably linked with a region’s economic situation, she added: Parents losing their jobs due to the pandemic was likely a factor, with teenagers leaving school to contribute to the family income.

“The real impact can be perceived through the view from the [poorer] suburbs where many children during online schooling simply disappeared, despite remaining enrolled,” Spicola said. “Non-attendance has been creating … education gaps that will form semi-illiterate citizens destined to low-paid and black-market jobs.”

Others have warned that the disruption will stall educational progress in areas such as Sicily, where within 30 years illiteracy levels have fallen from as high as 70 percent in some areas to 18 percent today.

Leotta, for example, said that her pupils — who spent the entire second term of their first grade online — passed onto second grade but most still do not know how to read properly.

Her school is close to the San Giovanni Galermo district in Catania, an area already suffering from low school attendance and high rates of crime, leaving many local teenagers to pick up black-market jobs or drug-dealing gigs.

“The risk is that we may lose entire generations to criminal groups at such a critical moment for a post-pandemic recovery of our country, if action is not taken immediately,” said Leotta.

Of 80,000 children between the ages of 10 and 16 not going to school in Sicily, 18,000 live in Catania, according to Judge Roberto Di Bella of the Juvenile Court of Catania. He warned that institutions needed to be more alert about dropout rates ahead of the new academic year as criminal groups would target them as new recruits.

“The risk is very real. It is a real danger, which should not be underestimated,” said Federico Varese, a criminologist at the University of Oxford specializing in Italian organized crime. “When the state fails to protect its citizens during a crisis like that of COVID-19, the danger is that the mafia may seem like a better solution, even in the eyes of the youngest.”

Fighting education poverty

In Campania, a region that remained among the higher-risk infection areas for most of this academic year, schools closed for longer than in the rest of the country. Pupils from third to eighth grade went to school for only 42 days between September 2020 and March 2021.

Before the pandemic, a 2019 study by Openpolis found that in the regional capital Naples, dropout rates were as high as 19 percent. With the summer holidays starting on June 9, many teachers worry that some pupils won’t return in September.

In the most difficult neighborhoods of Naples, nonprofit organizations have tried to step in. In San Giovanni a Teduccio, the association Figli in Famiglia — which works with disadvantaged families in the area — turned their headquarters into a classroom from March onward. Twenty students would come every morning to follow and get help with online classes in the association’s office.

“They received laptops and were assisted with the work of our educators. Schools would report us the names of the students who didn’t connect online, and we would reach out to their families to support them,” said Carmela Manco, president and founder of the association.

But projects like Manco’s cannot work on a large scale. In spring — shortly after Mario Draghi was named prime minister — the government appeared to grasp the severity of the situation and started throwing money at the problem.

In March, the government approved a €35 million plan to invest in education in the south, a sum that came on top of an €85 million fund for schools requiring equipment for distance learning as well as an €8 million budget for educational innovation in 2020.

“The south was caught unprepared by the social crisis created by the pandemic, and the school sector specifically, coming from a notorious past of budget cuts, was already crippled,” acknowledged Roberta Alaimo, a member of the Italian parliament with the anti-establishment 5Star Movement.

The Ministry of Education also recently allocated €40 million for a “summer plan” aimed at fighting educational poverty in disadvantaged areas.

“We also thought of creating initiatives to combat educational poverty specifically in southern regions through the enhancement of socio-educational services for minors, with the aim of involving up to 50,000 kids from high-risk areas,” said Barbara Floridia, undersecretary at the education ministry.

In April, the government allowed pupils of all grades to return to their classrooms for at least half of their lessons, saying that finishing the academic year in person was a priority.

But Leotta worries that the year of school closures will have lasting aftereffects. “A lot of damage has already been done, unfortunately,” she said as she wrote down the many absentees in her class register.

Both teachers and pupils have lost motivation, she added, and even the children who do show up are less engaged at school. “Online classes have also contributed to kids’ loss of interest in the learning process. I fear that many next September will just show up for mere attendance purposes to avoid social services.”

Rome ready for Euro 2020 kick-off but fans struggle to get in mood

Games will not boost local trade by as much as was hoped but there is optimism over Italy’s chances

11 June 2021

The rescheduled European football championships kick off in Rome on Friday in what the city’s mayor, Virginia Raggi, has billed as a symbol of a new beginning.

Andrea Bocelli will sing Nessun Dorma before the opening match between Italy and Turkey at the Olympic stadium, and a football village will open at Piazza del Popolo in the centre of Rome.

But even the most impassioned football fans are struggling to get into the mood. “The atmosphere is a little sad,” said Marco Martinelli, the owner of Osteria Mamma Mia, a small restaurant close to the stadium in the Flaminio area where AS Roma players have eaten. “You don’t have all the fervour that you would usually get before such a tournament … I don’t feel the excitement yet.”

Osteria Mamma Mia and other bars and restaurants in the area usually enjoy good custom before events at the stadium, but with spectator numbers limited to 25% of capacity, trade won’t be as brisk as it was in the past.

Martinelli will screen the Italy matches at the restaurant and said the mood would no doubt pick up if the national team, which last lifted a European cup trophy in 1968, performs well.

Rome will host two other Group A matches – Italy’s against Switzerland on 16 June and Wales on 20 June – along with a quarter-final game on 3 July.

To accommodate fans outside the stadium, there will be big screens set up in several locations in the city and Rome authorities have laid on a programme of events over the next month, including live music and shows tracing the history of Italy in the Euros.

The football village at Piazza del Popolo, said to be the largest fan zone in Europe, can host a maximum of 1,680 fans.

“I’ll watch the matches and obviously want to see Italy win, but everything still feels overshadowed by the pandemic,” said Alessio, a taxi driver, as he watched workers putting together the finishing touches to the football village on Thursday afternoon. “Few of us are living well at the moment.”

Others were in more buoyant spirits. “I can’t wait for the games to start,” said Mattia Simionatti, a tourist from Milan. Like other Italy fans, he was bitterly disappointed when the team failed to make it to World Cup in 2018, its first such failure since 1958. But he said the current squad, which includes key players such as Leonardo Bonucci and Nicolò Barella and is led by Roberto Mancini as coach, was vastly improved.

“The team this year is in really good shape and I really think we can reach the last four,” Simionatti said. “I do also see the tournament as a way to restart and get back to normal after more than a year of the pandemic, which we are all sick and tired of.”

Francesco Apa and his girlfriend, Arianna Miringi, were visiting Rome from Lake Orta, in the Piedmont region, where Apa plays for the local team, San Maurizio. “The atmosphere is totally different and the tournament won’t contribute to the economy as much as it was expected to before the pandemic, but I’m still really looking forward to the matches and will probably watch them in a bar,” Apa said.

Miringi was less enthusiastic: “I won’t have much choice but to go with him … and will obviously be rooting for Italy.”

‘It’s a little late’: US orders healthcare worker protections after thousands die

Labor department warns of ‘grave danger’ amid Covid pandemic

Employers must remove those with Covid-19 from workplace

US labor department officials on Thursday announced a temporary emergency standard to protect healthcare workers, saying they face “grave danger” in the workplace from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The new standard would require employers to remove workers who have Covid-19 from the workplace, notify workers of Covid exposure at work and strengthen requirements for employers to report worker deaths or hospitalizations to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha).

“These are the workers who continue to go into work day in and day out to take care of us, to save our lives,” said Jim Frederick, acting assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. “And we must make sure we do everything in our power to return the favor to protect them.”

The new rules are set to take effect immediately after publication in the Federal Register and are expected to affect about 10.3 million healthcare workers nationwide.

The government’s statement of reasons for the new rules cites the work of KHN and the Guardian in tallying more than 3,600 healthcare worker Covid deaths through 8 April. Journalists documented far more deaths than the limited count by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which through May tallied 1,611 deaths on case-reporting forms that were often incomplete.

The Lost on the Frontline project documented early calls for better respiratory protection for healthcare workers than loose-fitting face masks, noted serious complaints to Osha from hospital workers that went unaddressed and revealed repeated employer failures to report dozens of worker deaths. It also found that healthcare employers were often remiss in notifying workers about exposure to the coronavirus on the job.

The new standard would address some of those problems.

The rules require workers to wear N95 or reusable respirators when in contact with people with either suspected or confirmed Covid. They strengthen employer record-keeping requirements, saying employers must document all worker Covid cases (regardless of whether they were deemed work-related) and report work-related deaths even if they occur more than 30 days after exposure.

There is a lot to like about the new rule – except for the timing, according to Barbara Rosen, vice-president of the Health Professionals and Allied Employees union in New Jersey.

“It’s a little late,” she said. “If we had had this in place at the beginning, it would have saved a lot of lives and a lot of suffering that has gone on with healthcare workers and probably patients in hospitals because of the spread.”

Kristin Carbone said the measure came too late for her mother, Barbara Birchenough, 65, a New Jersey hospital nurse who had asked family members to gather gardening gloves and trash bags to serve as makeshift personal protective equipment before she fell ill and later died on 15 April 2020. Still, she said, it was a necessary step.

“If there is a silver lining,” she said, “I’m glad that out of this tragedy come positives for the people that are left behind.”

Marc Thompson: how an HIV diagnosis at 17 helped him change Britain

In 30 years as an activist, he has fought to stop black gay men being forgotten, broken taboos about homosexuality and campaigned to make life-changing PrEP medication available on the NHS

11 June 2021

Marc Thompson was 17 when he found out he had HIV. He had been out as gay for only a year when a friend suggested he get himself tested. “I thought: ‘Yeah, why not? I’m not going to be positive.’ You had to wait two weeks for the results back then – I’d actually arranged to have lunch with a friend on the day they were due, because it never occurred to me that I would be positive.”

Thompson says he will never forget how he felt that day – partly because he is still asked about it all the time. As one of the UK’s leading HIV, Aids and queer black men’s health campaigners, sharing his own experience comes with the job. “I felt complete and utter numbness,” he says. “All I could hear was white noise. I was walking around in a daze.”

By the time Thompson tested positive in November 1986, public consciousness about HIV was growing, but the prognosis was poor and effective treatment was still a decade away. “It felt like a death sentence,” says Thompson. “I spent a lot of time thinking about what it would be like to die in hospital. I picked the songs for my funeral. I planned the most glamorous send-off possible. That’s the way you deal with that stuff in your early 20s.”

Thompson, 52, is very much still here, however. In a 25-year career as an activist and programme manager working in HIV prevention and sexual health, he has been at the forefront of significant changes in the treatment of HIV and Aids. In 2015, he became one of the founders of PrEPster, an organisation that pushed for the life-changing medication PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) – which dramatically reduces the chance of spreading HIV – to be offered on the NHS. After years of campaigning by Thompson and others, PrEP was made freely available in England in April 2020. (It was rolled out on the NHS in Scotland in July 2017, while routine commissioning was announced in Wales in June 2020; after a two-year pilot, Northern Ireland is expected to make PrEP available imminently.)

It is a watershed moment, he says, especially for gay men. “For nearly 40 years, many gay men have carried a fear of HIV on our shoulders that prevents people from loving freely,” he says. “I know men who are PrEP users who talk about being liberated from the fear of sex.”

Imeet Thompson in the LGBTQ+ community space in the housing co-op in Brixton, south London, where he lives with Travis, his parson russell terrier. Rotimi Fani-Kayode, the Nigerian-British photographer who was known for his explorations of race and sexuality before he died of Aids in 1989, used to live in this building, Thompson says proudly. Indeed, it has been home to a lot of campaign “plotting” over the years.

His work as a campaigner began in 1992, when he started going to a support centre for people with HIV and Aids at the Landmark Aids Centre in nearby Tulse Hill. In the early years of his diagnosis, “I wasn’t big on going to social support groups, because invariably I was the only black person there, invariably the youngest, and more often than not the only person who wasn’t unwell. I felt really isolated.”

However, an opportunity came up to run workshops on safer sex for black gay men. “This was a new concept at the time, you know: how are we getting people to use condoms properly? So I jumped on board. It was fun. And I realised that by telling my own story and talking about my diagnosis and how I came to terms with my sexuality, I was giving people permission to tell theirs, too.”

In 1995, he joined Big Up, a group set up to address inadequacies in the HIV prevention services available to black gay men. At the time, services were either aimed at white gay men or straight black communities. “Neither of them were doing work for black gay men. So we fell through the cracks.” It is an area he has stayed in for the simple reason that the work is necessary. Despite a dramatic reduction in HIV transmission rates in recent years – new diagnoses among gay and bisexual men in the UK decreased by 47% between 2014 and 2019 – black gay men are 15 times more likely, globally, to get the virus.

“If we look at the drop in the rates of HIV diagnoses in men in the past few years, they’ve been incredible, but we haven’t seen the same drops for men whose first language isn’t English, men who are migrants to this country or men who aren’t white,” says Thompson.

“I fight for all communities, but I make no apologies for putting black gay men at the top, because we’re so often on the bottom rung of the ladder,” he says. “I have no doubt that if the Aids epidemic had hit young, white, straight people at that time, the response would have been different. The government and the health service would have acted a lot more quickly.

“You see the same with Covid today; we’re still asking why black and brown people have poorer health outcomes.”

Thompson was born and raised in Brixton. His father was a demolition worker, instrumental in clearing London of the postwar rubble that gave way to a vibrant new city. His mother was a probation officer, working with south London’s young offenders.

“I’d love to say my activism was inspired by Martin Luther King or Bayard Rustin, but it wasn’t,” he says. “It was inspired by the regular people that were around me – my dad, my mum and my grandparents.” Both sets of Thompson’s grandparents migrated to the UK from Jamaica. “It was that typical story,” he says. “My maternal grandfather came here in 57, then sent for my mum. My paternal grandparents settled here and then went back to Jamaica in the mid 70s, but their children stayed here.

“Observing my dad and uncle’s experience of police brutality, stop and search, and the unfairness my mum faced as a black woman in the 70s gave me an early sense that there was injustice against black people in this country,” he says. “My dad was a really proud man who told me to stand up straight and walk strong in this world. Hearing those things throughout my childhood made me acutely aware of my position in this country.”

Thompson came out to his mother when he was 15, who was “brilliant”. “There’s a narrative of black families not always accepting gay children,” he says. “My family accepted my sexuality, they accepted my HIV.”

Navigating the homophobia and racism of London in the 80s was more difficult. “I was out to my family, but I wasn’t out in my barbershop,” he says. Meeting other gay people locally helped. “I was lucky. So many gay men come out and they don’t know where to go. That was especially true for black people, because those spaces either didn’t exist or they were underground.”

Going to black queer club nights, such as Queer Nation in Vauxhall, was a “political act” he says. “We fell in love in those spaces and expressed ourselves, and that became so important as the Aids epidemic started to take root. The club became our salvation.”

The importance of that salvation was brought to life vividly this year by the Russell T Davies drama It’s a Sin, which spans the often too-short lives of a group of friends in London during the Aids epidemic. The show, which is Channel 4’s most-watched drama ever, has been “fantastic in reigniting the conversation around the epidemic in our communities,” says Thompson.

“I’m encouraged when I think about all the young people who have been inspired to find out a bit more about their history. But I don’t want young queer people to worry about HIV like we did.

I know people who’ve been diagnosed recently, who are young. They’re just as devastated as I was 35 years ago. What’s different is there’s so many more options to prevent HIV [transmission].”

There is still no cure for Aids, but there are treatments for HIV-positive people that enable them to live long and healthy lives. Antiretroviral therapy (ART), which stops the virus from reproducing, did not arrive in the UK until 1997. Thompson began his in 2001 – 15 years after he was diagnosed.

As an HIV-positive man, Thompson will never take PrEP, but it is a key part of his holistic approach to preventing further transmission: “I now have two new ways to help people prevent HIV transmission. One is prEP, one is U=U.” The latter, “undetectable = untransmittable”, refers to HIV-positive men with a viral load so low, thanks to ART, that they won’t be able to pass on the virus through sex.

“When we started the PrEP conversation, it was very similar to the HIV conversation in the early 80s. ‘If you don’t want HIV, don’t have sex,’ became: ‘If you don’t want HIV, you should just wear a condom,” he says. “As a man who’s already been diagnosed with HIV, I don’t necessarily need to spend energy promoting prEP; I could just promote U=U,” he says. “But I see the two as going hand in hand, because I want negative and positive people to be safe and liberated.”

“The fact that PrEP is available in sexual health clinics is great. It means that, if you’re an urban, gay man, you can get it. The challenge we’ve got is for those communities who are still at risk: women, black African communities and trans people,” he says. “We need to raise awareness, but also put it in places where they can access it – so how we can get PrEP into GP clinics and pharmacies? That won’t just help black African women; it will improve access for everyone, including young gay men.”

The UN Aids target, which has been adopted in Britain, is to reach no new HIV transmissions by 2030. “We’re doing a good job of testing our way out of it in this country, but the issue is that it is a global pandemic, not a UK pandemic, and if we keep cutting foreign aid, we are never going to end HIV,” he says.

Thompson says he hopes that, in 35 years’ time, “we’re no longer talking about HIV”. Given that, in 2016, 438 children were infected with HIV every day, this is an ambitious aim.

Still, he will keep going. “HIV opened my eyes to so much,” he says. “It’s given me a career and introduced me to some of the most amazing, inspirational people from all over the world, but above all it’s taught me that, whatever life throws at us, we all deserve to be loved for who we are.”

The United Kingdom was always a fragile illusion – but what will replace it?

There’s an astonishing lack of thinking about how to address the radical implications of Britain’s disintegration

03 June 2021

There is a famous quote from the Italian writer Antonio Gramsci: “The old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.”

His argument could equally apply to the United Kingdom. Many think the UK in its current form is probably doomed, and that the break up of the union is inevitable. But outside the various nationalist causes, few people seem to have a clear idea about what should replace the dying dream of unionism.

With a pro-independence majority installed in the Holyrood parliament, it seems almost certain that Scotland will achieve independence in the near-ish future. Meanwhile, spurred on by Brexit and the destabilising impact of Covid-19, Northern Ireland’s place in the union looks increasingly precarious — with a majority of its citizens expecting Irish reunification in the next 25 years. Even in Wales, where opposition to the UK is modest by comparison, calls for independence are growing louder by the year.

In stark contrast, the unionist cause is beleaguered. While Scottish, Irish and Welsh nationalist movements have gained in strength, underlined by the SNP’s decisive breakthrough in the May elections, the union has become a hazy, marginal idea that is rarely articulated with much confidence or sense of belief.

Part of the problem is that British unionism has always been a fragile concept, underpinned by confused, overly broad notions of Englishness. The series of conquests and treaties that paved the way for the formation of the UK were almost all led by England (even if, as with the 1707 Act of Union that joined Scotland with England and Wales, there was often the pretence of an equal partnership). Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the rise of an “Anglo-British” state benefited English interests enormously, while more partial gains were awarded to its fellow nations.

But in the longer term, England’s ambiguous role within the union and its empire was a problem when it came to more fundamental questions of identity. In order to absorb the surrounding nations of the British Isles, and then other territories throughout the world as the empire grew, England had to sacrifice its sense of self to the much vaguer notion of Britishness – an identity so wide and loose it could be applied to almost the entire world.

Underneath it all, instead of a coherent nation state with a written constitution lay the United Kingdom – a pragmatic trade venture held together for three centuries by the astonishing material success of the British empire (not to mention, of course, the often brutal actions of its armed forces).

Fast forward to the 21st century, when the empire is a distant memory, and most people find it difficult to make a case for the union without resorting to vague cliches about tradition and togetherness (sometimes joined, at the liberal end of the spectrum, by well-meaning, but equally vague, talk of multiculturalism).

While more coherent Scottish, Welsh and Irish identities have developed in opposition to the hollowed-out, post-imperial UK, confusion reigns in England about our constitutional future and the union’s place within it. Many in the liberal centre – like some of the celebrities who signed a letter in 2014 opposing Scottish independence – are affluent English people who simply like the idea of being on the same geopolitical team as Scotland and Wales (often, it would seem, because of distant family ties or fond memories of holidays in picturesque parts of these countries).

A more nuanced approach is taken by older unionist establishment figures across the British Isles. The former prime minister Gordon Brown has talked recently about the “everyday benefits” of the union – making a strong case for constitutional reforms to the UK that would prevent it from breaking apart entirely. Yet this latter-day New Labour strategy, whose support is strongest among the sorts of free-market voices Brown indulged when he was running the millennial economy, seems unlikely to succeed at a time when the ideals of the Blair years are widely seen as yesterday’s news.

Meanwhile, ironically, the electorally dominant Conservative and Unionist party seems to have accepted deep down that the union is a busted flush, and adapted to this new political reality. While some in the Johnson government, such as Michael Gove, have made token attempts to bang the drum for unionism, the Tory grandee Chris Patten was probably right to claim recently that the Conservatives are now an “English nationalist” party in all but name. With a large majority based almost entirely in English seats, and mindful of the SNP’s continuing stranglehold on Scotland, it makes sense for the Tories to consolidate their power base in England.

Like that other failed unionism of recent times – the campaign for Britain to remain in the European Union – support for the United Kingdom is hampered by association with a status quo that many people in the British Isles feel has not worked for them. And when arguments for unionism have cut through, as in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, they have tended to rely on anxieties about the alternative (“project fear”) rather than deep-seated optimism about the UK itself.

As the union limps on – for a while – with the aid of such small-c conservatism, there is an astonishing lack of thinking, especially in England, about how to respond to the rising tide of nationalism in the British Isles. While the Conservatives seem likely to retain unionism’s traditional symbols (monarchy, patriotism, imperial nostalgia) in a rump UK encompassing England and perhaps Wales, far too many people on the English left simply haven’t stopped to consider the radical implications of the imminent break-up of Britain – namely, the risk of an eternally conservative Greater England rushing into the gap. In progressive circles, a sort of somnolent unionism founded in distaste for nationalism is still too often a default stance.

Those on the radical left are sometimes fond of invoking the dream of a world with “no borders”. There is much to be said for this idea in the abstract, but it will not be much help as we look for a workable future for the British Isles beyond the UK. Should that future be based on a reimagining of England on federal lines, or even actual independence for its constituent parts? Should we start to plan for a more modern, informal version of unionism in the event of Scottish independence and Irish reunification? The time to answer these urgent questions is now, because the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is heading for the history books.

New calls to replace ‘empire’ with ‘excellence’ in UK honours system

Campaign has backing of honours-holders including health chief Victor Adebowale and NBA’s John Amaechi

11 June 2021

A new push to strip the word “empire” from the British honours system has been launched by dozens of community activists who have accepted gongs but object to them being named after imperialism that caused “harm and trauma”.

They include Victor Adebowale, the chair of the NHS Confederation who accepted a CBE in 2000; John Amaechi, a British-American former NBA player and Dame Elizabeth Nneka Anionwu, a pioneering nurse born to Irish and Nigerian parents.

Last December the Cabinet Office said the names of medals such as the MBE, OBE and CBE would not change, but nearly 100 honours-holders have founded a campaign to replace the word empire with “excellence”.

The campaign is backed mostly by people from community and voluntary organisations, and says “the presence of colonial links within the honours system stands directly in the way of some people participating in it”.

The Order of the British Empire was founded by King George V in 1917 as a way to recognise the service of non-combatants during the first world war.

The “excellence not empire” campaign said: “As modern Britain learns to confront the true nature of colonialism, and now that this debate has finally begun, we can no longer dismiss the subjugation, segregation and extermination of colonialised people as a neutral or even benevolent period in our history.”

Previous attempts to change the name of the system have failed. In 2004 Tony Blair resisted calls from MPs on the public accounts committee to end appointments to the Order of the British Empire and instead found a new Order of British Excellence.

The latest push comes amid heightened tensions over how Britain reckons with its colonial past. Some Oxford academics have refused to carry out extra duties for Oriel College after it decided to keep its statue of the colonialist Cecil Rhodes. Meanwhile a row over the display in a Bristol museum of the toppled statue of the slave trader Edward Colston has been rumbling on.

One of the campaign founders, Poppy Jaman, a Bangladesh-born mental health campaigner who received an OBE from the Queen three years ago, said: “The word ‘empire’ does not resonate with my sense of integrity. Colonial policies during the British Raj of my birth country ensured communities turned on each other for almost 200 years, its legacy still playing out in our homes today.”

Simon Blake, an LGBT campaigner honoured in 2011, said: “Our colonial past is a shameful one. We have to face into that with honesty and integrity. That is why the honours system – if it exists – must break any connection to the empire. A simple switch from empire to excellence can and must happen so people can accept the honour with pride.”

Others have rejected honours because of their association with the empire and its history of slavery, including the poet Benjamin Zephaniah, the spoken-word artist George the Poet and Liverpool FC’s first black player, Howard Gayle.

After Zephaniah, the Birmingham-born son of parents from the Caribbean, turned down an OBE in 2003, he wrote in the Guardian that the word empire “reminds of thousands of years of brutality”.

This year Tony Sewell, the author of a controversial government-commissioned race report, said a new story about colonialism should be told that reflects “the good and the evil of empire that their legacy has given us”.

Johnson wants to be Biden’s buddy. But thanks to Brexit he can never be a true ally

The US president believes in global cooperation. Britain’s prime minister has always pushed in the opposite direction

11 June 2021

Optics, meet reality. The visuals emanating from Cornwall are just what Boris Johnson wanted: a warm encounter with the new US president, followed by a summit of world leaders with himself in the chair. The “special relationship” renewed, “Global Britain” in action, him at the centre: job done. Trouble is, the photo-ops and reality don’t match.

I’m not referring to the gulf that separates the personal styles of Joe Biden and the British prime minister. One former diplomat with experience of both men notes that, while Biden “asks for briefing folders and does his homework, Boris’s instinct is to wing it and play the clown”.

They’re chalk and cheese, but that need not matter. Opposites can connect, especially when it suits their mutual self-interest. Witness the renewed Atlantic charter the pair signed on Thursday – a reprise of the wartime pledge by the US and UK to make common cause that saw Biden casting himself as the latter-day Franklin Roosevelt, and Johnson equally happy to be a Churchill tribute act.

Nor do I mean the gap between G7 pledges on vaccinating the world’s poorer countries, and what’s actually needed. Of course, it’s welcome that the US will give away 500m surplus doses and that Britain will chip in with 100m more, so that the G7 collectively hands over 1bn. But even that apparently generous gesture is less than a tenth of the number required. If Biden and the others truly want to make good on their talk of vaccinating the world, they need to pay towards the manufacture and distribution of a further 10bn doses, an effort that would cost up to $66bn (£47bn).

No, the chasm I have in mind is between the worldview that Biden is urging upon his western allies, and the ethos embodied by Johnson. The US president is not an ideological figure, but he has a firm creed, and central to it is international cooperation. He believes in multilateralism, in the system of alliances constructed at the end of the second world war. You could show him Gordon Brown’s new book – which argues that the severest problems confronting our world – from the pandemic to poverty to the climate crisis – can only be solved through global cooperation, and he would scarcely disagree with a word of it. It’s one reason Biden recoiled from Donald Trump’s revival of the historically bleak slogan “America first”. The same sentiment animates the rest of the G7 leaders now in Carbis Bay – with one exception.

Johnson may talk the multilateralist talk, but his record points in the opposite direction. Whether he likes it or not he is defined, abroad especially, by Brexit (and one suspects he does not like it, telling the Atlantic magazine the topic is a lemon that’s been sucked dry). Johnson’s signature deed, the one that will be his enduring legacy, is aimed at reducing the cooperation between nations, about doing more alone. It is a mission to put “Britain first”.

Sure, he and the other Brexiters have always shied away from that reality, telling themselves that leaving the EU would see Britain become a leader not merely in Europe but across the world. But the Global Britain fantasy forgets something basic about geopolitics. “If you want to be a global player, you start by being a player in your neighbourhood,” says the former Downing Street chief of staff Jonathan Powell. “That’s difficult when you’ve pulled out.”

Or as the former British ambassador in Washington, Peter Westmacott, puts it: “We’re no longer in the room where it happens; we’re listening in the corridor outside.”

Perhaps there was a way to leave the European Union while minimising the damage to the world of alliances and Britain’s place in it – deploying what Westmacott calls “the right blend of expertise, strategic thinking, effectiveness and humility”. But that is not the path Johnson has chosen.

The slashing of Britain’s aid budget, breaking a manifesto promise to keep spending 0.7% of gross national income to help the world’s poorest, makes a mockery of Johnson’s expressed desire to play an international “convening” role: you can’t expect to sit in the chair if you’re not pulling your weight. Nor, say those in the know, has Johnson shown much interest in the painstaking, diligent work of investing in bilateral relationships, hoping that a flash of Etonian charm will do the trick instead.

The result is that there’s a disconnect between the bloc Johnson wants to be in and the one where, thanks to his decisions, he belongs. The new Atlantic Charter demands, for example, that the US and Britain adhere to “the rules-based international order”. But nine months ago, Johnson’s government cheerfully announced that it intended to break international law over the Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. Johnson might want to sit with the wholesome kids at the multilateralist table, but his actions constantly send him round the back of the bike shed for a smoke with the rule-breakers – the likes of Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, who was given the red-carpet treatment at No 10 just last month.

This is the logic of Brexit. It’s the same logic responsible for the sharpest tension between Johnson and Biden, and several others in Cornwall: the current standoff over that Northern Ireland protocol. The government signed up to it, but now demands that the EU be “less purist” in its application. Johnson is effectively telling Brussels what he has doubtless told so many others before: “Sure, I made a promise. But you weren’t meant to take that literally.”

Now Johnson faces a choice. Either he caves in – as he did in late 2019 by agreeing to put a border down the Irish Sea – and betrays again an already restless unionist population. Or he refuses to buckle, so risking an all-out trade war with the EU, the chances of which are serious, according to the Eurasia Group.

Not for the first time, Boris Johnson wants to have his cake and eat it. He wants to stand next to a US president mouthing the catechism of cooperation between nations, even as he is forever associated with pulling Britain away from cooperation among the nations of Europe – in the process imperilling the union that enshrines cooperation among the four nations of the UK. He wants to pose with Biden and the G7, even as he remains a poster boy for the populist unilateralism of his old pal Trump. A photo-op might hide that contradiction for a while, but it cannot hide it for ever.

Was Joe Biden trolling Britain with his choice of poetry – or choosing his words perfectly?

You can tell a lot about a leader from the poems they quote, as the president’s speech to US air force personnel proved this week, writes Zoe Williams

13 June 2021

Iwoke up the other day to a load of Americans arguing in my Twitter feed about Joe Biden’s speech to US air force personnel. The president, landing in Suffolk for the G7 summit being held in Cornwall, addressed the troops and their families stationed at RAF Mildenhall with a large number of thoughts. In precis: “Hey, everyone, America is normal again.” And a quote from WB Yeats: “The world has changed, changed utterly / A terrible beauty has been born.”

The crux of the debate: was this poem going to wind up the British, and if so, did Potus choose it on purpose?

Let’s recap: Yeats’s poem Easter, 1916 is about the Easter rising and the violence that followed, starting with the execution of the Irish republican leaders for treason. One social media view was that the poem was about a load of things – there are also many animals in it, horses and moorhens and whatnot – so you couldn’t call it explicitly anti-British. There was a cluster of opinions along the lines of: “You know poets – they’re slippery fellows, never saying just one thing. And Yeats was the worst! He was a republican, but also very anti-bloodshed. Comme ci, comme ça.” Some people pointed out that Biden, with his proud Irish heritage, just liked its poetic tradition and the noises it made.

And then, the counterpoint: Biden is nothing like his UK counterpart, who famously reached for the most insensitive lines imaginable on a foreign trip, reciting Kipling’s paean to imperialism in a Myanmar temple. There is actual footage of Boris Johnson being told off by the British ambassador. It’s hard to imagine Biden being told off even when he was at school.

Another image that is hard to conjure: Biden just randomly Googling “cool lines from Irish poems” and picking his favourite. We probably have to assume that, in a break with the recent political tradition of his nation, he chooses his phrases judiciously, and with a purpose. So yes, world-class trolling.

Britain is a parasite on poor countries by poaching their doctors and nurses

The best aid to the poor of the world would be to stop relying on their expensively trained health workers and produce enough of our own

11 June 2021

The British government pretends that, despite the drastic cut to its foreign aid budget, subsidies flow in one direction only, which is from the UK to poor countries. At the G7 summit, Boris Johnson is making much of Britain’s generosity in donating surplus vaccines to places where health systems are collapsing under the impact of the pandemic.

But the nasty secret about British aid is that, in reality, the subsidies are often going in the opposite direction because Britain deliberately trains far fewer doctors and nurses than it needs. It makes up the difference by recruiting great numbers of trained medical staff from impoverished countries where they are already in critically short supply.

In Kenya, for instance, where 20 million people live in extreme poverty, on less than $1.25 (89p) a day, the country loses $518,000 for every doctor and $339,000 for every nurse who emigrates to the UK. Britain gives substantial aid to Ghana to fight malaria and reduce infant mortality, but these sums are exceeded by the £65m Britain saves by employing 293 doctors trained in Ghana and a further £38m saved on 1,021 Ghanaian nurses who work here.

“The situation will never be turned around until we train more doctors here,” says Rachel Jenkins, professor emeritus of epidemiology and international mental health policy at King’s College London, who has long campaigned on the issue.

What makes the government’s position so culpable is that the Treasury is well aware of the financial advantages of training too few doctors and filling the gap by recruiting doctors and nurses who have already been trained at some other country’s expense.

A precise figure for the shortfall is difficult to calculate, but the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told the Health Select Committee in 2017: “It is interesting that Health Education England estimates that we were training about 6,500 doctors a year and we needed to train about 8,000 a year to be self-sufficient.” Hunt’s expressed concern was not about the damage to poor countries of losing scarce doctors, but that there might not be enough of them to recruit.

Prof Jenkins says that Hunt’s figure is an underestimate of the number of doctors needed in Britain, particularly of GPs, psychiatrists and in emergency care. There is no shortage of people in the UK who want to become doctors and nurses, but the government has been unwilling to spend the money to train them. “Loads of people are disappointed because they cannot get into medical schools,” she says. “They should double the number of places for medical students.”

The reason this has not happened is the high cost of medical training, which in 2005 was already £220,000 for a doctor and £125,000 for a nurse, and has greatly increased since then. Medical schools are expensive and the training period is long. Even with what amounts to the poaching of trained medical staff from abroad, the number of doctors in the UK per capita is still one of the lowest in Europe, second only to Poland. A study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) shows that the UK has 2.8 doctors for every 1,000 people compared with an average of 3.5 doctors in the OECD’s member countries as a whole.

For all the self-congratulatory talk about Britain donating vaccines to the world’s poor, it is in practice knowingly parasitic on their ill-funded health systems. Of the 289,000 licensed doctors in the UK in 2021, two-thirds were trained in this country and one-third trained elsewhere. The losers are overwhelmingly poor and middle-income countries in southeast Asia and the Middle East, with the largest number of doctors coming from India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Sudan, South Africa and Ghana.

Because of the desperate need for more medical staff during the Covid-19 pandemic, Britain – along with other rich countries – has eased visa restrictions and stepped up active recruitment by the NHS, so doctors in the Philippines are retraining as nurses in order to emigrate. The country is now so short of nurses that hospital wards are shutting down.

Ways of mitigating this drainage of health professionals from poor countries to the rich include discouraging recruitment in countries where there is a critical shortage of health workers, and a ban on any recruitment at all in the 57 poorest. This is something that Britain long ago pledged to do under the World Health Organisation code of practice, which says that countries should create an adequate health workforce of their own through long-term planning, education, training and retention, so they will not rely on raiding the healthcare systems of others.

“The UK has failed massively on all these counts,” says Prof Jenkins. She suggests that Britain should pay compensation to countries that lose the benefits of expensive and ill-afforded investment in medical training and then suffer the consequences of having an understaffed health system in a time of crisis.

The NHS – and the health services of other well-off countries – can claim that doctors and nurses emigrate voluntarily, but this argument is disingenuous. Impoverished governments unable to pay decent salaries or provide modern working and living conditions are never going to be as attractive to medical staff as places able to provide these advantages.

The poaching of doctors and nurses has grown worse since the 1980s, but the outflow from poor countries has become a flood since the start of the pandemic. In the last 18 months, the number of doctors trained abroad but licensed to practice in the UK has risen from 66,000 to 80,000.

This is bad news for everybody. It has become a cliche to say that in dealing with a disease as infectious as Covid-19, nobody is safe until everybody is safe. The idea is to discourage rich countries from monopolising vaccine supplies and to make sure the poorer ones get enough to inoculate their populations. But this saying applies equally to rich nations ensuring that they have sufficient trained doctors and nurses at the expense of others. This hidden subsidy from the poor to the rich means that countries in the former category will become strongholds for Covid-19, where it can develop variants with which to renew the attack on the rest of the world.

A gain for an importer of medical expertise such as Britain is a loss for an exporter where already-inadequate healthcare provision is disproportionately degraded by the loss of skills. When one psychiatrist emigrated from Nepal to Britain some years ago, Nepal lost a quarter of all its trained psychiatrists.

Cutting foreign aid is popular among voters who feel that charity should begin at home and suspect its utility abroad. But training more British doctors and nurses, even though vastly expensive, would get far greater public backing and would provide an effective way of aiding poorer countries instead of covertly leeching off their overstrained healthcare systems.

How COVID-19 exposed the systemic ageism at the heart of Britain

11 June 2021

The UK public cares deeply about injustices. In the first few months of 2021, thousands of people took to the streets demanding much-needed social changes, from Black Lives Matter to Kill the Bill protests against the government’s proposed new crime legislation, the vigil for Sarah Everard and massive demonstrations against Israel’s bombing of Gaza. Why then, haven’t the deaths of 138,163 people from coronavirus resulted in the same kind of outpouring of public anger?

A look at the data provides a significant clue: 88% of COVID deaths have been people aged 65 and over. To understand why older people have died en masse, and why there has been no sustained public outcry, requires close examination of the deep-seated ageism that permeates British society.

As a researcher studying the representation of older people in mainstream media, I have found that ageism has been commonplace in the UK for decades – from the increasingly unrealistic cultural portayals of older people as evergreen, healthy and non-dependent, to high rates of pension poverty (especially among women) and the dismantling of a welfare system designed to care for the elderly. But during the coronavirus pandemic this creeping ageism became pronounced.

This is clear from the way the media have portrayed older people over the last 15 months. When the pandemic erupted, articles published in the British right- and left-wing media reiterated that older people were at increased risk of dying from the virus. In this way, the public came to anticipate older people’s deaths and consider them a natural outcome of the disease.

The elderly, on average, are more susceptible to the virus, but it was stressed time and time again in order to alleviate public fears. As one newspaper report put it: “Providing you aren’t elderly or suffering from an existing illness, you needn’t panic.”

At the same time older people were being portrayed as vulnerable and cast as more likely to die, they also disappeared from the news cycle.

In fact, well before older people began to die from COVID-19, their lives were considered already lost by some. On 12 March 2020, before the first lockdown, Boris Johnson told families that many were going to lose loved ones. It was clear who the prime minister was referring to when he spoke of these loved ones. Shockingly, even as he seemed to intimate that the lives of the elderly were not worth safeguarding, Johnson was subsequently commended by many for being “frank”.

The depiction of older people as extremely vulnerable, coupled with their existing invisibility prepared the ground for things to come. Their deaths were rendered acceptable.

Negligence and carelessness

As mortality rates among the elderly rose to the thousands in April-May 2020, particularly within care homes, media outlets began to count the dead. Yet older people occupied headlines only as abstract statistics, while their names, voices, faces and testimonies rarely appeared.

While the elderly themselves remained anonymous, their predicament was represented through gloomy stock images or mentioned in passing as they were described lying on their deathbed without anyone holding their hand. The portrayal of their helplessness framed these deaths as tragic but also inevitable. The focus fixed on family relatives who told of their traumas, alongside the accounts of care home providers. The voices of the elderly were simply not heard.

Slowly, the arguably criminal negligence and carelessness with which Johnson’s administration dealt with the elderly, was exposed. Evidence began emerging about how care homes were instructed by the Department of Health and Social Care to admit patients discharged from hospitals without undergoing a COVID-19 test, while elderly “do not resuscitate” patients also made the headlines.

This set the stage for media coverage on the dire state of elderly care in the UK. Some stressed the fact that 84% of care homes are poorly run by mainly for-profit private providers.

Encouragingly, for a few weeks the media debated key issues regarding elderly care. Those included the high turnover of care workers (primarily due to inadequate working conditions), the lack of proper regulation of care homes, and the high rates of older people living in poverty and isolation. For a moment it seemed that change was possible.

But news comes and goes, and the government deflected the criticism. Even though the media has exposed the extraordinary neglect leading to a huge number of deaths among over-65s in the UK, the structural ageism that enabled it has yet to be acknowledged. On the contrary, it continues to be reproduced in the media, where the elderly are still portrayed as faceless, voiceless and ultimately expendable.

The deafening silence over the unnecessary deaths of Britain’s elderly underscores that the illness endangering our society is not simply a virus, but a careless and systematic ageism. It will carry on spreading and killing the elderly so long as the silence persists.

At least 130,000 households in England made homeless in pandemic

While ban on evictions protected some people, domestic abuse and loss of temporary accommodation were common triggers for homelessness

13 June 2021

At least 130,000 households in England were made homeless during the first year of the pandemic, despite the government’s ban on evictions, according to data sourced by the Observer. With the ban now over, fears are rising that a surge of evictions may be imminent. But the Observer’s figures show that even while the ban was in place, households were being forced from their homes.

“The ban didn’t stop tens of thousands from facing homelessness,” said Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter. “During the pandemic, the most common triggers for homelessness were no longer being able to stay with friends or family, losing a private tenancy, and domestic abuse.”

Analysis of published government homelessness statistics and figures collected under the Freedom of Information Act from around 70% of local authorities in England show that 132,362 households were assessed by councils as being owed the “relief duty”, where a household is deemed to already be homeless. The number of homeless households rose slightly in 2020-21 compared with the previous year.

Overall, councils in England were approached 274,000 times for homelessness assistance during 2020-21, with around 106,000 owed the “prevention duty” as they were at risk of homelessness but not yet legally homeless.

The number of households applying for support rose sharply during the final quarter of 2020-21. In Cornwall, 44% of applications for support were made in that three-month period, and 64% in Bath and North East Somerset. Among the worst affected councils is Manchester, although this is partly due to the sheer size of the city. In 2020-21, 3,660 households were initially assessed as homeless by Manchester council, up from 2,906 in 2019-20. A spokesperson for the council said: “The pandemic has been a huge source of hardship for many, and in some cases that has led to people losing their homes.

“​The eviction suspension which has now come to an end did protect most people from losing their homes, but not all. The people who became homeless during the pandemic were mainly those fleeing domestic abuse or households asked to leave by family or friends.​ The end of the eviction ban in England will undoubtedly have an impact on the number of people turning to the council for help, but we are yet to see the end result of this change in policy.”

A spokesperson for the tenants’ union Acorn said: “The sheer number of people made homeless in the last year is extremely upsetting but entirely unsurprising. The government’s commitment to tackling the crisis of homelessness has repeatedly been shown to exist only in word and not in action.

“The government needs to finally take this seriously. Homelessness isn’t an unavoidable natural phenomenon: it can be solved if the political will exists to do so.”

A government spokesperson said the figures were “entirely speculative” and said: “We have taken unprecedented action to protect renters and support those at risk of homelessness and rough sleeping during the pandemic with the ongoing Everyone In scheme supporting around 37,000 vulnerable people. We’re providing over £750m this year alone to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping.”

US and Europe to forge tech alliance amid China’s rise

The joint initiative aims to push back against China’s dominance of the tech sector.

09 June 2021

The European Union and the United States will announce a wide-ranging partnership around technology and trade next week in an attempt to push back against China and promote democratic values, according to two EU officials and draft conclusions for the upcoming EU-U.S. summit seen by POLITICO.

While negotiations on the new body are still ongoing, U.S. President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen plan to announce details of the project when they meet in Brussels on June 15. The EU proposed the initiative in December, and U.S. officials have been eager to show that Washington is willing to work with its allies after a rocky period in the transatlantic relationship during Donald Trump’s presidency.

China’s rise as a tech superpower also explains why the U.S. and EU are motivated to team up on tech and digital trade. Beijing has set its sights on becoming a global leader and standard setter for next-generation industries like artificial intelligence, robotics and semiconductors — and plans to get there through aggressive investments, acquisitions and regulations favoring domestic companies like Alibaba and Huawei.

Officials hope the new transatlantic body will give the EU and U.S. a stronger footing to keep pace. As part of the so-called EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council (TTC), Washington and Brussels are expected to detail how they will work together to promote joint standards around emerging technologies, and to make commitments to better police the digital world now dominated by a few Silicon Valley tech giants.

The alliance could tackle everything from the intricate tech supply chains — which often run through China — to making collective investments in digital projects. And it will be designed to work with other like-minded countries, including Australia and Japan, and at international bodies like the World Trade Organization.

“The point, of course, is to push for real global standards, standards that build on privacy, on the integrity of digital and the dignity of the individual as the starting point,” Margrethe Vestager, the Commission executive vice president in charge of digital policy, told EU politicians last week.

Biden and his EU counterparts “will focus on aligning our approaches to trade and technology so that democracies and not anyone else, not China or other autocracies, are writing the rules for trade and technology for the 21st century,” Jake Sullivan, the White House’s national security adviser, told reporters this week.

Still, the renewed cooperation between Brussels and Washington is by no means a slam dunk.

U.S. officials have routinely criticized European countries for unfairly targeting American tech firms in a range of antitrust investigations and regulatory proposals. Many in the EU feel those policies are central in the 27-country bloc’s efforts to regain its place at the top digital table alongside the U.S. and China.

Some EU leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel have also been less keen at singling out China because of significant economic ties to Beijing that they do not want to jeopardize in a potential trade war.

The new EU-U.S. body must also avoid the fate of previous efforts like the Transatlantic Economic Council, a George W. Bush era-initiative to reignite economic and trade ties between the U.S. and Europe, which eventually fizzled into obscurity.

Chips, regulation and investment

To avoid those pitfalls, Washington and Brussels plan to focus on three core areas in next week’s announcement, according to two EU officials who spoke on th",https://blogsalao.wordpress.com/

Oui, les médias sont partisans. Particulièrement contre la haine, le sexisme, le racisme, l’incompétence, la belligérance, l’inégalité, et j’en passe. Jim Roberts (New York Times, 2016

If you’re a working journalist and you believe that Donald J. Trump is a demagogue playing to the nation’s worst racist and nationalistic tendencies, that he cozies up to anti-American dictators and that he would be dangerous with control of the United States nuclear codes, how the heck are you supposed to cover him? Because if you believe all of those things, you have to throw out the textbook American journalism has been using for the better part of the past half-century, if not longer, and approach it in a way you’ve never approached anything in your career. If you view a Trump presidency as something that’s potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that. You would move closer than you’ve ever been to being oppositional. That’s uncomfortable and uncharted territory for every mainstream, nonopinion journalist I’ve ever known, and by normal standards, untenable. But the question that everyone is grappling with is: Do normal standards apply? And if they don’t, what should take their place? Covering Mr. Trump as an abnormal and potentially dangerous candidate is more than just a shock to the journalistic system. It threatens to throw the advantage to his news conference-averse opponent, Hillary Clinton, who should draw plenty more tough-minded coverage herself. She proved that again last week with her assertion on “Fox News Sunday” that James Comey, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had declared her to be truthful in her answers about her decision to use a private email server for official State Department business — a grossly misleading interpretation of an F.B.I. report that pointed up various falsehoods in her public explanations. And, most broadly, it upsets balance, that idealistic form of journalism with a capital “J” we’ve been trained to always strive for. But let’s face it: Balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto his golden Trump Tower escalator last year to announce his candidacy. For the primaries and caucuses, the imbalance played to his advantage, captured by the killer statistic of the season: His nearly $2 billion in free media was more than six times as much as that of his closest Republican rival. Now that he is the Republican nominee for president, the imbalance is cutting against him. Journalists and commentators are analyzing his policy pronouncements and temperament with an eye toward what it would all look like in the Oval Office — something so many of them viewed as an impossibility for so long. (…) there was Mr. Scarborough on Wednesday asking the former Central Intelligence Agency director Michael V. Hayden whether there were safeguards in place to ensure that if Mr. Trump “gets angry, he can’t launch a nuclear weapon,” given the perception that he might not be “the most stable guy.” Then Mr. Scarborough shared an alarming conversation he said he had with a “foreign policy expert” who had given Mr. Trump a national security briefing. “Three times he asked about the use of nuclear weapons,” Mr. Scarborough said, describing one of the questions as “If we have them, why can’t we use them?” Speaking with me later, Mr. Scarborough, a Republican, said he had not contemplated sharing the anecdote with the audience until just before he did “When that discussion came up, I really didn’t have a choice,” Mr. Scarborough said. “That was something I thought Americans needed to know.” Mr. Trump has denied Mr. Scarborough’s account. (He told The New York Times in March he would use nuclear weapons as “an absolutely last step.” But when the MSNBC host Chris Matthews challenged him for raising the possibility he would use them, Mr. Trump asked, “Then why are we making them?”) Mr. Scarborough, a frequent critic of liberal media bias, said he was concerned that Mr. Trump was becoming increasingly erratic, and asked rhetorically, “How balanced do you have to be when one side is just irrational?” Mr. Scarborough is on the opinion side of the news business. It’s much dodgier for conventional news reporters to treat this year’s political debate as one between “normal” and “abnormal,” as the Vox editor in chief Ezra Klein put it recently. In a sense, that’s just what reporters are doing. And it’s unavoidable. Because Mr. Trump is conducting his campaign in ways we’ve not normally seen. No living journalist has ever seen a major party nominee put financial conditions on the United States defense of NATO allies, openly fight with the family of a fallen American soldier, or entice Russia to meddle in a United States presidential election by hacking his opponent (a joke, Mr. Trump later said, that the news media failed to get). And while coded appeals to racism or nationalism aren’t new — two words: Southern strategy — overt calls to temporarily bar Muslims from entry to the United States or questioning a federal judge’s impartiality based on his Mexican heritage are new. (…) “When controversy is being stoked, it’s our obligation to report that,” said the Washington Post managing editor Cameron Barr. “If one candidate is doing that more aggressively and consistently than the other, that is an imbalance for sure.” But, he added, “it’s not one that we create, it’s one that the candidate is creating. » (…) The media reaction to it all has been striking, what The Columbia Journalism Review called “a Murrow moment.” It’s not unusual to see news stories describe him as “erratic” without attribution to an opponent. The “fact checks” of his falsehoods continue to pile up in staggering numbers, far outpacing those of Mrs. Clinton. And, on Sunday, the CNN “Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter called upon journalists and opinion makers to challenge Mr. Trump’s “dangerous” claims that the electoral system is rigged against him. Failure to do so would be unpatriotic, Mr. Stelter said. While there are several examples of conservative media criticism of Mr. Trump this year, the candidate and his supporters are reprising longstanding accusations of liberal bias. “The media is trying to take Donald Trump out,” Rush Limbaugh declared last week. A lot of core Trump supporters certainly view it that way. That will only serve to worsen their already dim view of the news media, which initially failed to recognize the power of their grievances, and therefore failed to recognize the seriousness of Mr. Trump’s candidacy. (…) It would also be an abdication of political journalism’s most solemn duty: to ferret out what the candidates will be like in the most powerful office in the world. It may not always seem fair to Mr. Trump or his supporters. But journalism shouldn’t measure itself against any one campaign’s definition of fairness. It is journalism’s job to be true to the readers and viewers, and true to the facts, in a way that will stand up to history’s judgment. To do anything less would be untenable. Jim Rutenberg (NYT, Aug. 7, 2016)

Le scénario le plus probable pour que des troubles civils se produisent est une victoire de Trump. Il y a des millions de personnes dans ce pays qui ont été poussées par le Parti démocrate à croire que Trump ne méritait pas d’être élu en 2016. Qu’il a été introduit clandestinement à la Maison Blanche par des agents russes. Ils vont encore le penser en 2020. Il y a de grandes villes dans ce pays qui n’attendent que ça pour s’enflammer. Il y a beaucoup de gens ches les BLM, les Antifa, sur la gauche radicale qui ont hâte de brûler leurs villes. C’est la plus grande menace à laquelle ce pays est confronté. Elle est lancée tous les soirs ces derniers temps et je pense qu’une victoire de Trump pourrait se faire dans la douleur dans un premier temps pour ce pays. Douglas Murray

Rien de plus que cela parce que je n’ai jamais parlé de mon entreprise ou de leur entreprise, celle de mes fils ou de ma fille. Et je n’en ai jamais discuté car ils savent où je dois faire mon travail et c’est tout et ils doivent se faire leur propre jugement. Joe Biden

Je ne pense pas qu’il y ait beaucoup de choses qui se seraient passées dans ma vie si mon nom de famille n’était pas Biden. Parce que mon père était vice-président des États-Unis. Hunter Biden

Une photo obtenue par « Tucker Carlson Tonight » de Fox News montre l’ancien vice-président Joe Biden et son fils Hunter jouant au golf dans les Hamptons avec Devon Archer, qui a siégé au conseil d’administration de la société ukrainienne de gaz naturel Burisma Holdings avec Hunter. Plus tôt ce mois-ci, Joe Biden a déclaré à Fox News dans l’Iowa qu’il n’avait jamais discuté des relations commerciales de son fils avec lui. «Je n’ai jamais parlé à mon fils de ses relations commerciales à l’étranger», a déclaré Biden, pointant du doigt le président Trump. «Je sais que Trump mérite une enquête. Il viole toutes les normes fondamentales d’un président. Vous devriez lui demander pourquoi il est au téléphone avec un dirigeant étranger, essayant d’intimider un dirigeant étranger. Vous devriez regarder Trump. Hunter Biden a déclaré au New Yorker précédemment que lui et son père avaient parlé ‘une seule fois’ du travail de Hunter Biden en Ukraine. Une source proche d’Archer a déclaré à Fox News que la photo avait été prise en août 2014. Des informations contemporaines indiquent que le vice-président était aux Hamptons à l’époque.

La présence de Hunter Biden au conseil d’administration de Burisma était très gênante pour tous les responsables américains qui poussaient à la création d’un programme de lutte contre la corruption en Ukraine. George Kent (ancien chef de mission adjoint par intérim à l’ambassade des États-Unis à Kiev, Ukraine)

Trump is the perfect man for these times, not all times, perhaps not most times, but these times. (…) Republicans are not doing a good job explaining the stakes in this election. They must explain (…) that the Democratic Party, which has been taken by its radical wing, is leading a revolution. This makes the coming election the most important one since the election of 1860. (…) Unlike most elections, this one is much more than a contest over particular policies—like health care or taxes. Rather, like the election of 1860, this election is a contest between two competing regimes, or ways of life. Two ways of life that cannot exist peacefully together. One way of life, I’ll call it “the traditional American way of life,” is based on individual rights, the rule of law, and a shared understanding of the common good. This way of life values hard work, self-reliance, volunteerism, patriotism, and so on. In this way of life there are no hyphenated Americans. We are all just Americans. Colorblindness is our aspiration. The other way of life I call multiculturalism. Others call it “identity politics” or “cultural Marxism” or “Intersectionality”. The multicultural movement, which has taken over the Democratic party, is a revolutionary movement. I do not mean a metaphorical revolution. It is not like a revolution; it is a revolution, an attempt to overthrow the American Founding as President Trump said in his excellent Mt. Rushmore speech. Republicans should say the same thing. Republicans everywhere, at every level, and at every opportunity. Multiculturalism conceives of society, not as a community of individuals with equal rights but as a collection of cultural identity groups—defined by race, ethnicity, gender, and so forth. According to the multiculturalists, all these identity groups are oppressed by white males. Their goal is to have each identity group proportionally represented in all institutions of American society. As should be immediately clear, achieving this proportional representation requires a never-ending redistribution of wealth and power from some groups—and not just from whites—to other groups. Such a massive redistribution can only be achieved by a tyrannical government and like in all tyrannies, one where dissenters are silenced. In order to achieve this proportional representation, the Democrats require not just endless affirmative action but genuine socialism, open borders, unrestricted trade, seizing guns, sanctuary cities, and much more. The Black Lives Matter/Democrats understand (which Republicans seem not to), that if they are to achieve this policy agenda they must get Americans to change their values, their principles, and the way they understand themselves. They must get us to believe that national borders and colorblindness are racist; that we are not one culture but many; that the most important thing in our history—the thing around which all else pivots—is slavery. More broadly, the multiculturalists must get us to believe that we are unworthy—not just that we have sinned (which of course we have)—but that we are irredeemably sinful, or, in the language of today, “systemically racist.” And sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic and all the other “ists” and phobias. Simply put, multiculturalism must get us to believe we are bad. This suggests one way to frame the coming election: as a contest between a man, Trump, who believes America is good and a man, Biden, who is controlled by a movement that believes America is bad. I do not think it is any more complicated than that. For the multiculturalist to change traditional values and principles they must destroy, or radically restructure, the institutions that teach those values and principles. The most important of these institutions is family, but also very important is religion, education (which they have mostly destroyed already) and community life, replacing the latter with government bureaucrats. It is here—in these value-teaching institutions—that we see the underpinnings of the Revolution. This is where the real action is. Republicans seem to be missing in action. Republicans need to explain that BLM and their Democratic enablers wish to destroy the traditional mother-father family. To substantiate this claim, Republicans have only to point to the BLM mission statement. The mission statement, written by avowed Marxists, also lets us know that BLM holds transgenderism to be the burning issue of our time. Republicans must also explain that religion, because it teaches American values, is also on the chopping block. Republicans also must make American see that the taking down of statues is not about removing a few confederate generals; it’s about destroying America’s past, as is the New York Times 1619 Project. The rioters, and their BLM-Democrats enablers, are tearing down the statues even of people like Frederick Douglass who fought against slavery. This is not an accident. It is not collateral damage. Frederick Douglass was a great American. He believed that America in her soul was not racist. He believed in hard work and self-reliance. And because of his embrace of American values the BLM-Democrats have to get rid of him. They must also get rid of Abraham Lincoln, for it is he who best explains what we should aspire to. And it is he who is the best defender of the American Founding. In one sense, this election is a referendum on the Founding. Whether America was founded in 1619, as the BLM-Democrats contend, or, in 1776 as Lincoln, and, until recently, all Americans believed. Republicans must make more of political correctness and cancel culture, which, as we have seen so vividly of late, brutally punishes apostates. Who does Twitter think it is, censoring an American president? Republicans simply cannot stand for that. (…) In order to make the case that the Democrats are leading a revolution, Republicans must delegitimize Black Lives Matter—the organization, of course, not the sentiment. To BLM and their Democratic enablers, Republicans must say: “Absolutely, black lives matter. They just don’t matter to you. You don’t care about Mr. Floyd, the black businesses you have destroyed, the blacks who are getting killed because you have forced the police to back off. You’re here for destruction. Not black lives, not any lives.” After delegitimizing Black Lives Matter, the next step for Republicans is to tie BLM’s revolutionary agenda around the necks of Democrats. The BLM wing of the Democratic party has captured the entire party. Run-of-the-mill Democrats may not agree with all of the BLM agenda but they go-along, so they might as well agree. Joe Biden is one of the go-along Democrats. So do not expect all Democrats to sing the BLM tune; even so, most will kneel before them. Listen to Biden. On one occasion Biden said, “Let’s be clear, transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time.” A year ago, Biden may not have even known what transgenderism is. He does not seem to know it, but he has been radicalized. Biden now regularly talks about “systemic” racism. On one occasion Biden said, though without evidence, there is “absolutely systemic racism in law enforcement.” “[But] it’s not just in law enforcement,” he continued, “it’s across the board. It’s in housing, it’s in education . . . It’s in everything we do.” He is wrong on every count, but if indeed he believes that racism is in “everything we do,” that it is systemic, then he believes, whether he admits or not, that the system must be overturned. Biden does not realize it, but he is calling for the overthrow of the American way of life. I presume that is not his intent, but when the words he is reading off his BLM teleprompter get translated into policy, that will be the consequence — the destruction of the American way of life. (…) Republicans must make it clear that these are the “Biden riots.” (…) I know President Trump has many faults. I myself sometimes cringe listening to him. Sometimes he is his own worst enemy. He is a braggart, often misinformed, petty, sometimes even vengeful. And more. And yet, we are very lucky to have him. I am almost prepared to say that having him is Providential. How else to explain that we find ourselves with this most unusual, most unpresidential man who has just the attributes most needed for this moment. At any other time, he might well have been a bad president. But in these times—these revolutionary times—he is the best president we could have had. He has the indispensable attribute of a leader: courage. As a leader must, he goes where others are afraid to go. And he has common sense, which means he generally wants to go to the right place. Above all else, and above anyone else, Trump is committed to America. He is unreservedly, unquestionably pro-America. He feels no guilt for America’s past. He makes no apologies. He concedes nothing. These may not always be the attributes one wants in a President, but in this day of woke guilt they are the most essential things. And Trump has unlimited confidence in America. In this time of national doubt, this too is just what the doctor ordered. He thinks our culture is “incredible” and that’s the way he wants to keep it. Trump not only thinks America is incredible, he knows we are in a fight for our lives. And despite what one hears ad nauseum from the Democrats, Trump is perhaps among the least racist presidents we have ever had. Trump is not defending the white way of life; he is defending the American way of life, a colorblind way of life which is open to anyone who is willing to embrace it. If we want to save our country, then we should support him—unequivocally. (…) I think this election is that important, and I think Trump is that good. (…) Remember, Trump versus Biden is the choice between a man who believes America is good and a man who is controlled by a movement which believes America is bad. Tom Klingenstein



Alors que le 3 novembre approche, les démocrates ne cessent de répéter qu’une réélection du turbulent milliardaire serait une catastrophe pour le pays, sa seule présence à la Maison-Blanche constituant selon eux un danger terrible, qui ouvrirait la voie au chaos et à une dictature rampante. Mais le sentiment d’une apocalypse est aussi très présent sur la droite, où l’on craint que le retour des démocrates aux affaires ne scelle la victoire définitive de la révolution identitariste et multiculturaliste «woke», qui, partie des universités, est en train déborder dans la presse libérale et la gauche du «parti de l’âne». «Nous sommes au bord d’un abîme», affirme le prêtre conservateur catholique Ed Meeks. Depuis la révolution sociétale des années 1960, qui a vu les idées de la gauche libérale triompher et l’emprise de la religion refluer, les conservateurs se sont toujours sentis sur la défensive, jugeant avoir largement perdu la bataille culturelle, notamment après la décision Roe vs Wade de la Cour suprême autorisant l’avortement dans tous les États. Plusieurs auteurs célèbres, Alan Bloom, Christopher Lasch, ont brillamment décrit ce processus. L’arrivée de Ronald Reagan et sa révolution conservatrice avaient certes réarmé la droite, mais ce «retour de flamme» fut très provisoire. En réalité, si les conservateurs ont continué à revendiquer les valeurs chrétiennes, le libéralisme sociétal a poursuivi ses avancées, du mariage gay, plutôt bien accepté, à une approche de plus en plus révolutionnaire du genre, qui remet en cause la famille traditionnelle et les différences biologiques entre les sexes, en passant par la bataille pour la «Justice sociale», qui, au nom de la lutte antiraciste et antisexiste, entend rejeter aujourd’hui tout l’héritage intellectuel et culturel occidental. Certes, avec l’arrivée de Donald Trump à la présidence, les conservateurs se sont sentis requinqués, presque surpris d’avoir trouvé en ce milliardaire divorcé – et incapable de réciter un verset de la Bible -, un allié aussi résolu des «valeurs chrétiennes». L’arrivée de trois nouveaux juges conservateurs à la Cour suprême a galvanisé leurs troupes. Mais le sentiment dominant reste celui d’une planète républicaine sur la défensive. Après la mort tragique, en pleine campagne électorale, de George Floyd, un Afro-Américain tué par un policier, le débat légitime sur les violences policières a tourné à une discussion sur le racisme supposément «systémique» de la police et des institutions américaines, menant au démantèlement de dizaines de statues de personnalités, sur fond d’émeutes et de violences. Même Lincoln et Frederick Douglas, exemples de l’antiracisme, note Kligenstein, n’ont pas été épargnés, suscitant une inquiétude grandissante chez les conservateurs et nombre de libéraux jusqu’ici accommodants. Trump a pris position sur ce sujet brûlant dès le mois de juin, dans son discours de Rushmore. Trois mois plus tard, Joe Biden se rendait à Gettysburg, un haut lieu de la guerre civile américaine, pour appeler à l’apaisement. Mais les républicains disent ne pas se sentir rassurés par son approche très conciliante et soulignent que la gauche «woke», qui tient tous les lieux de pouvoir «gramsciens» – l’université, la presse, Hollywood -, pourrait se sentir pousser des ailes. Même si le phénomène reste peu couvert par la presse américaine, une ambiance révolutionnaire continue d’agiter les campus. Ces derniers jours, l’université de Chicago comme celle de NorthWestern dans l’Illinois, ont notamment été le siège de manifestations violentes et de destructions organisées des groupes d’étudiants de Black Lives Matter, qui revendiquent la dissolution de la police du campus. Dans une lettre ouverte, le président de Northwestern, Morton Schapiro, s’est indigné du vandalisme et des appels à «tuer les cochons» de policiers des manifestants. Il a expliqué avoir été harcelé par des dizaines d’activistes venus chanter «Va te faire enc… Morty» devant sa maison en pleine nuit. «C’est une abomination», a-t-il écrit, tout en disant soutenir les revendications de justice de Black Lives Matter. L’un de ses amis a envoyé sa lettre à des dizaines de collègues à travers le pays, les appelant à exprimer leur soutien. Beaucoup de professeurs conservateurs, qui se sentaient déjà isolés, parfois forcés de participer à des réunions pour s’excuser de leur «blanchité», se demandent où s’arrêtera cette radicalisation. Elle les pousse évidemment vers Trump, qui a annulé de semblables programmes en parlant de propagande antiaméricaine. Laure Mandeville

Today I sent my intention to resign from The Intercept, the news outlet I co-founded in 2013 with Jeremy Scahill and Laura Poitras, as well as from its parent company First Look Media. The final, precipitating cause is that The Intercept’s editors, in violation of my contractual right of editorial freedom, censored an article I wrote this week, refusing to publish it unless I remove all sections critical of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, the candidate vehemently supported by all New-York-based Intercept editors involved in this effort at suppression. The censored article, based on recently revealed emails and witness testimony, raised critical questions about Biden’s conduct. Not content to simply prevent publication of this article at the media outlet I co-founded, these Intercept editors also demanded that I refrain from exercising a separate contractual right to publish this article with any other publication. (…) the pathologies, illiberalism, and repressive mentality that led to the bizarre spectacle of my being censored by my own media outlet are ones that are by no means unique to The Intercept. These are the viruses that have contaminated virtually every mainstream center-left political organization, academic institution, and newsroom. I began writing about politics fifteen years ago with the goal of combatting media propaganda and repression, and — regardless of the risks involved — simply cannot accept any situation, no matter how secure or lucrative, that forces me to submit my journalism and right of free expression to its suffocating constraints and dogmatic dictates. (…) the brute censorship this week of my article — about the Hunter Biden materials and Joe Biden’s conduct regarding Ukraine and China, as well my critique of the media’s rank-closing attempt, in a deeply unholy union with Silicon Valley and the “intelligence community,” to suppress its revelations — eroded the last justification I could cling to for staying. It meant that not only does this media outlet not provide the editorial freedom to other journalists, as I had so hopefully envisioned seven years ago, but now no longer even provides it to me. In the days heading into a presidential election, I am somehow silenced from expressing any views that random editors in New York find disagreeable, and now somehow have to conform my writing and reporting to cater to their partisan desires and eagerness to elect specific candidates. (…) American media is gripped in a polarized culture war that is forcing journalism to conform to tribal, groupthink narratives that are often divorced from the truth and cater to perspectives that are not reflective of the broader public but instead a minority of hyper-partisan elites. The need to conform to highly restrictive, artificial cultural narratives and partisan identities has created a repressive and illiberal environment in which vast swaths of news and reporting either do not happen or are presented through the most skewed and reality-detached lens. With nearly all major media institutions captured to some degree by this dynamic, a deep need exists for media that is untethered and free to transgress the boundaries of this polarized culture war and address a demand from a public that is starved for media that doesn’t play for a side but instead pursues lines of reporting, thought, and inquiry wherever they lead, without fear of violating cultural pieties or elite orthodoxies.

Il est difficile d’éviter de conclure que les employeurs et partenaires étrangers de Hunter cherchaient à tirer parti de la relation de Hunter avec Joe, soit en recherchant une influence inappropriée, soit en en monnayant l’accès. Robert Weissman (Public Citizen)

Au strict minimum, il y a une énorme apparence de conflit, et il y a toutes les raisons de penser que les investisseurs avec lesquels il travaille veulent qu’il s’associe à eux parce qu’il est le fils de l’ancien vice-président et maintenant candidat à la présidentielle. [Joe Biden] aurait dû encourager son fils à ne pas prendre ces positions. Robert Weissman (Public Citizen)



After a year at Georgetown, Hunter transferred to Yale Law, where he completed his degree, in 1996. Then he returned to Wilmington with Kathleen and Naomi. Joe Biden was running for reëlection in the Senate, and he appointed Hunter as his deputy campaign manager. Hunter rented an apartment close to his father’s campaign headquarters, and also got a job as a lawyer with MBNA America, a banking holding company based in Delaware, which was one of the largest donors to his father’s campaigns. At the age of twenty-six, Hunter, who was earning more than a hundred thousand dollars and had received a signing bonus, was making nearly as much money as his father. In January, 1998, the conservative reporter and columnist Byron York wrote, in The American Spectator, “Certainly lots of children of influential parents end up in very good jobs. But the Biden case is troubling. After all, this is a senator who for years has sermonized against what he says is the corrupting influence of money in politics.” (…) Hunter’s name appeared regularly in newspaper stories decrying the cozy relationship between lobbyists and lawmakers. An informal arrangement was established: Biden wouldn’t ask Hunter about his lobbying clients, and Hunter wouldn’t tell his father about them. “It wasn’t like we all sat down and agreed on it,” Hunter told me. “It came naturally.” (…) Hunter had heard that, during the primaries, some of Obama’s advisers had criticized him to reporters for his earmarking work. Hunter said that he wasn’t told by members of the Obama campaign to end his lobbying activities, but that he knew “the writing was on the wall.” Hunter told his lobbying clients that he would no longer represent them, and resigned from an unpaid seat on the board of Amtrak, a role for which, Hunter said, the Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid had tapped him. “I wanted my father to have a clean slate,” Hunter told me. “I didn’t want to limit him in any way.” In September, 2008, Hunter launched a boutique consulting firm, Seneca Global Advisors, named for the largest of the Finger Lakes, in New York State, where his mother had grown up. In pitch meetings with prospective clients, Hunter said that he could help small and mid-sized companies expand into markets in the U.S. and other countries. In June, 2009, five months after Joe Biden became Vice-President, Hunter co-founded a second company, Rosemont Seneca Partners, with Christopher Heinz, Senator John Kerry’s stepson and an heir to the food-company fortune, and Devon Archer, a former Abercrombie & Fitch model who started his finance career at Citibank in Asia and who had been friends with Heinz at Yale. (Heinz and Archer already had a private-equity fund called Rosemont Capital.) Heinz believed that Hunter would share his aversion to entering into business deals that could attract public scrutiny, but over time Hunter and Archer seized opportunities that did not include Heinz, who was less inclined to take risks. In 2012, Archer and Hunter talked to Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund, Bohai Capital, about becoming partners in a new company that would invest Chinese capital—and, potentially, capital from other countries—in companies outside China. In June, 2013, Li, Archer, and other business partners signed a memorandum of understanding to create the fund, which they named BHR Partners, and, in November, they signed contracts related to the deal. Hunter became an unpaid member of BHR’s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House. In December, 2013, Vice-President Biden flew to Beijing to meet with President Xi Jinping. Biden often asked one of his grandchildren to accompany him on his international trips, and he invited Finnegan to come on this one. Hunter told his father that he wanted to join them. According to a Beijing-based BHR representative, Hunter, shortly after arriving in Beijing, on December 4th, helped arrange for Li to shake hands with his father in the lobby of the American delegation’s hotel. Afterward, Hunter and Li had what both parties described as a social meeting. Hunter told me that he didn’t understand why anyone would have been concerned about this. “How do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?” he said. Hunter’s meeting with Li and his relationship with BHR attracted little attention at the time, but some of Biden’s advisers were worried that Hunter, by meeting with a business associate during his father’s visit, would expose the Vice-President to criticism. The former senior White House aide told me that Hunter’s behavior invited questions about whether he “was leveraging access for his benefit, which just wasn’t done in that White House. Optics really mattered, and that seemed to be cutting it pretty close, even if nothing nefarious was going on.” When I asked members of Biden’s staff whether they discussed their concerns with the Vice-President, several of them said that they had been too intimidated to do so. “Everyone who works for him has been screamed at,” a former adviser told me. For another venture, Archer travelled to Kiev to pitch investors on a real-estate fund he managed, Rosemont Realty. There, he met Mykola Zlochevsky, the co-founder of Burisma, one of Ukraine’s largest natural-gas producers. Zlochevsky had served as ecology minister under the pro-Russian government of Viktor Yanukovych. After public protests in 2013 and early 2014, the Ukrainian parliament had voted to remove Yanukovych and called for his arrest. Under the new Ukrainian government, authorities in Kiev, with the encouragement of the Obama Administration, launched an investigation into whether Zlochevsky had used his cabinet position to grant exploration licenses that benefitted Burisma. (The status of the inquiry is unclear, but no proof of criminal activity has been publicly disclosed. Zlochevsky could not be reached for comment, and Burisma did not respond to queries.) In a related investigation, which was ultimately closed owing to a lack of evidence, British authorities temporarily froze U.K. bank accounts tied to Zlochevsky. In early 2014, Zlochevsky sought to assemble a high-profile international board to oversee Burisma, telling prospective members that he wanted the company to adopt Western standards of transparency. Among the board members he recruited was a former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who had a reputation as a dedicated reformer. In early 2014, at Zlochevsky’s suggestion, Kwaśniewski met with Archer in Warsaw and encouraged him to join Burisma’s board, arguing that the company was critical to Ukraine’s independence from Russia. Archer agreed. When Archer told Hunter that the board needed advice on how to improve the company’s corporate governance, Hunter recommended the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was “of counsel.” The firm brought in the investigative agency Nardello & Co. to assess Burisma’s history of corruption. Hunter joined Archer on the Burisma board in April, 2014. Three months later, in a draft report to Boies Schiller, Nardello said that it was “unable to identify any information to date regarding any current government investigation into Zlochevsky or Burisma,” but cited unnamed sources saying that Zlochevsky could be “vulnerable to investigation for financial crimes” and for “perceived abuse of power.” Vice-President Biden was playing a central role in overseeing U.S. policy in Ukraine, and took the lead in calling on Kiev to fight rampant corruption. On May 13, 2014, after Hunter’s role on the Burisma board was reported in the news, Jen Psaki, a State Department spokesperson, said that the State Department was not concerned about perceived conflicts of interest, because Hunter was a “private citizen.” Hunter told Burisma’s management and other board members that he would not be involved in any matters that were connected to the U.S. government or to his father. Kwaśniewski told me, “We never discussed how the Vice-President can help us. Frankly speaking, we didn’t need such help. » Several former officials in the Obama Administration and at the State Department insisted that Hunter’s role at Burisma had no effect on his father’s policies in Ukraine, but said that, nevertheless, Hunter should not have taken the board seat. As the former senior White House aide put it, there was a perception that “Hunter was on the loose, potentially undermining his father’s message.” The same aide said that Hunter should have recognized that at least some of his foreign business partners were motivated to work with him because they wanted “to be able to say that they are affiliated with Biden.” A former business associate said, “The appearance of a conflict of interest is good enough, at this level of politics, to keep you from doing things like that.” In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’ ” (…) When I asked him about it, he told me that he had been given the diamond by the Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming, who was trying to make connections in Washington among prominent Democrats and Republicans, and whom he had met in the middle of the divorce. Hunter told me that two associates accompanied him to his first meeting with Ye, in Miami, and that they surprised him by giving Ye a magnum of rare vintage Scotch worth thousands of dollars. Hunter was on the board of the World Food Program USA, a nonprofit that generates support for the U.N. World Food Programme, and he had hoped that Ye would make a large aid donation. At dinner that night, they discussed the donation, and then the conversation turned to business opportunities. Hunter offered to use his contacts to help identify investment opportunities for Ye’s company, CEFC China Energy, in liquefied-natural-gas projects in the United States. After the dinner, Ye sent a 2.8-carat diamond to Hunter’s hotel room with a card thanking him for their meeting. “I was, like, Oh, my God,” Hunter said. (In Kathleen’s court motion, the diamond is estimated to be worth eighty thousand dollars. Hunter said he believes the value is closer to ten thousand.) When I asked him if he thought the diamond was intended as a bribe, he said no: “What would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn’t in office.” Hunter said that he gave the diamond to his associates, and doesn’t know what they did with it. “I knew it wasn’t a good idea to take it. I just felt like it was weird,” he said. Hunter began negotiating a deal for CEFC to invest forty million dollars in a liquefied-natural-gas project on Monkey Island, in Louisiana, which, he said, was projected to create thousands of jobs. “I was more proud of it than you can imagine,” he told me. In the summer of 2017, Ye talked with Hunter about his concern that U.S. law-enforcement agencies were investigating one of his associates, Patrick Ho. Hunter, who sometimes works as a private lawyer, agreed to represent Ho, and tried to figure out whether Ho was in legal jeopardy in the U.S. That November, just after Ye and Hunter agreed on the Monkey Island deal, U.S. authorities detained Ho at the airport. He was later sentenced to three years in prison for his role in a multiyear, multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe top government officials in Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC. In February, 2018, Ye was detained by Chinese authorities, reportedly as part of an anti-corruption investigation, and the deal with Hunter fell through. Hunter said that he did not consider Ye to be a “shady character at all,” and characterized the outcome as “bad luck.” Joe Biden is hardly the first politician to have faced scrutiny for the business dealings of a family member. In 1973, during the Watergate investigation, the Washington Post reported that Richard Nixon had the phone of his brother Donald tapped for at least a year, because he feared that Donald’s “various financial activities might bring embarrassment to the Nixon administration.” In the late seventies, the F.B.I. investigated President Jimmy Carter’s younger brother, Billy, after it emerged that he was on the payroll of the Libyan government. In an extensive report on the affair issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Biden was a member, Billy was quoted as saying that “he did not need anyone in Washington telling him how to conduct his private business.” Carter said that he had tried, unsuccessfully, to “discourage Billy from making any other trip to Libya” and “to keep him out of the newspapers for a few weeks.” Biden’s approach was to deal with Hunter’s activities by largely ignoring them. This may have temporarily allowed Biden to truthfully inform reporters that his decisions were not affected by Hunter. But, as Robert Weissman, the president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, said, “It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter’s foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter’s relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him. It is clear that Hunter and Biden’s decades-old decision not to discuss business matters has exposed both father and son to attacks. (Biden declined to comment for this article.) In March of last year, Peter Schweizer, a conservative researcher and a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart, published “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.” Schweizer is best known for “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Clinton Rich,” which was released in May, 2015. (…) “Secret Empires,” which details Hunter’s activities in China and Ukraine, focusses on what Schweizer calls “corruption by proxy,” which he defines as a “new corruption” that is “difficult to detect” and that, though often legal, makes “good money for a politician and his family and friends” and leaves “American politicians vulnerable to overseas financial pressure.” Schweizer often relies on innuendo to supplement his reporting. At one point, he describes “one of the few public sightings” of Hunter in Beijing, when Hunter, “dressed in a dark overcoat,” followed Biden into a shop to buy a Magnum ice cream. “Intentionally or not,” Schweizer writes, “Hunter Biden was showing the Chinese that he had guanxi”—connections. Schweizer asserts that “Rosemont Seneca Partners had been negotiating an exclusive deal with Chinese officials, which they signed approximately ten days after Hunter visited China with his father.” In fact, the deal had been signed before the trip—according to the BHR representative, it was a business license that came through shortly afterward—and Hunter was not a signatory. Hunter and Archer said that they never met with any Chinese officials about the fund. And the deal wasn’t with Rosemont Seneca Partners but with a new holding company, established solely by Archer; Christopher Heinz was not part of the BHR transaction. Schweizer also asserts that the Chinese fund was “lucrative” for Hunter, but Hunter and his business partners told me that he has yet to receive a payment from the company. In October, 2017, the special counsel Robert Mueller, investigating Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, indicted Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, on twelve counts, including committing conspiracy against the United States by failing to register as a foreign agent of Ukraine. (Manafort pleaded guilty to that charge in September, 2018.) Making a case that Hunter had his own Ukrainian scandal, Schweizer implies that Joe Biden had been consulted in advance about Hunter and Archer’s work with Burisma. On April 16, 2014, he notes, shortly before the announcement that Hunter and Archer had taken seats on the company’s board, Archer made a “private visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice-President Biden.” Hunter, Archer, and Archer’s son Lukas, who is now twelve, told me that the visit was arranged by Hunter for Lukas, who was working on a model of the White House for a grade-school assignment. Afterward, Lukas posted a picture on Instagram of himself shaking the Vice-President’s hand. Hunter and Archer said that Burisma was never discussed. Rudolph Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, has also aggressively promoted what he has called the “alleged Ukraine conspiracy” in interviews and on social media. Giuliani told me that, in the fall of 2018, he spoke to Viktor Shokin, Ukraine’s former prosecutor general. Shokin told him that Vice-President Biden had him fired in 2016 because he was investigating Burisma and the company’s payments to Hunter and Archer. Giuliani said that, in January, 2019, he met with Yurii Lutsenko, Ukraine’s current prosecutor general, in New York, and Lutsenko confirmed Shokin’s version of events. On April 1, 2019, John Solomon, an opinion contributor to The Hill, wrote about Shokin’s claim that he had been conducting a corruption probe into Burisma and Hunter when he was dismissed. A month later, the Times reported that Hunter “was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.” The story, by Kenneth P. Vogel and Iuliia Mendel, provoked some Democrats to express concern that the Times was again lending credence to allegations made by Schweizer and other Trump allies. Giuliani retweeted the article, and Trump called for the Justice Department to investigate. (…) There is no credible evidence that Biden sought Shokin’s removal in order to protect Hunter. According to Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, Shokin was removed because of concerns by the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, and the U.S. government that he wasn’t pursuing corruption investigations. Contrary to the assertions that Shokin was fired because he was investigating Burisma and Zlochevsky, Hochstein said, “many of us in the U.S. government believed that Shokin was the one protecting Zlochevsky.” In May, Giuliani scheduled a visit to Ukraine, and told the Times that he would look into Hunter’s involvement with Burisma, “because that information will be very, very helpful to my client,” but then abruptly cancelled the trip, amid reports that Ukraine’s President-elect was unwilling to meet with him. A week later, on May 16th, Lutsenko appeared to shift his position on Burisma, telling Bloomberg News that he saw no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son, and that “a company can pay however much it wants to its board.” The reasons for his reversal were unclear, but Daria Kaleniuk, the head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, in Kiev, speculated that Lutsenko, in talking with Giuliani, had been trying to “pump his political muscle,” a strategy that had proved ineffective in the new political climate. That month, Hunter declined Burisma’s offer to serve another term on the board, believing that the controversy had become a distraction. But he said that he was proud of his work there, and that he thought the criticism was misplaced. “I feel the decisions that I made were the right decisions for my family and for me,” he told me. “Was it worth it? Was it worth the pain? No. It certainly wasn’t worth the grief.” He went on, “I would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against the one person they believe can beat them.” And yet, to many voters, the controversy over Hunter’s business dealings will appear to have been avoidable, a product of Biden’s resistance to having difficult conversations, particularly those involving his family. Hunter said that, in his talks with his father, “I’m saying sorry to him, and he says, ‘I’m the one who’s sorry,’ and we have an ongoing debate about who should be more sorry. And we both realize that the only true antidote to any of this is winning. He says, ‘Look, it’s going to go away.’ There is truly a higher purpose here, and this will go away. So can you survive the assault?” Adam Entous

Count Sen. Ron Johnson among those not surprised that the press is ignoring a New York Post report about emails said to be from Hunter Biden’s laptop that suggest he introduced his father the Vice President to a representative of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings. Or that Twitter and Facebook would run interference for the Bidens by banishing the Post dispatch from their platforms. Something similar happened last month when Mr. Johnson’s Homeland Security Committee and Chuck Grassley’s Finance Committee dropped a joint report on Hunter Biden’s financial dealings overseas. The committees tracked the heartburn the younger Mr. Biden’s involvement with Burisma caused the Obama Administration and dug up intriguing tidbits—such as a $3.5 million wire transfer from a Russian billionaire who had been married to the former mayor of Moscow. Most news accounts dismissed the Senate findings as offering no proof that either Biden did anything criminal. What a low bar. The report mentions, for example, a $100,000 spending spree for Hunter Biden, James Biden (the Vice President’s brother) and Sara Biden (the Vice President’s sister-in-law) financed by Gongwen Dong, a Chinese businessman with ties to China’s largest private oil and gas company. Hunter Biden’s position on the Burisma board was concerning enough within the Obama Administration that two U.S. officials, George Kent and Amos Hochstein, complained about it. Mr. Kent had been Acting Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. In 2016 he emailed colleagues that “the presence of Hunter Biden on the Burisma board was very awkward for all U.S. officials pushing an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine.” At the least, the Senate report notes, Mr. Biden’s financial dealings raised “criminal financial, counterintelligence and extortion concerns. There’s also whether it affected U.S. policy. In a September 2015 speech in Odessa, U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt specifically named Mykola Zlochevsky, a former Ukraine official who is also owner of Burisma Holdings, as involved in Ukraine’s corruption. But three months later, Joe Biden advisers told him to avoid mentioning Zlochevsky in a speech. The question is whether his son’s presence on Mr. Zlochevsky’s board affected that decision. The Biden campaign says there was no meeting with the Ukrainian in question on Joe Biden’s official schedule. That doesn’t mean much: The January 2017 Oval Office meeting with Barack Obama and James Comey wasn’t on his official schedule either. Even so, the information unearthed by the committee suggests that Mr. Biden knew much more about his son’s involvement with Burisma than what he let on. Though he says he never discussed Hunter’s overseas business deals with his son, he certainly discussed them with Mr. Hochstein, who came to the Vice President in October 2015 with his concerns. At best Joe Biden had a see-nothing-wrong approach to his son; less generously, it was a wink and a nod of tacit approval. The Senate report further suggests that John Kerry, who served as Secretary of State at the time and whose stepson Chris Heinz was a business partner of Hunter Biden’s, was also not truthful when he said he knew nothing about it. Assuming the emails turned up by the New York Post are real, they provide significant detail about Hunter Biden’s way of doing business. Even if it wasn’t illegal, it was a classic example of Beltway influence-peddling for profit off his father’s name and position. This is a legitimate story with important information for voters who are being asked to trust Joe Biden for a return to normalcy. We doubt this is the kind of Washington self-interest and dishonesty as usual that most Americans have in mind. The Wall Street Journal

Si la question de savoir si Joe Biden a permis à son fils de profiter de l’influence du vice-président est pertinente pour la campagne présidentielle, des questions d’équilibre et de proportionnalité entrent également en jeu. NBC

Le FBI a été averti que des sections du dossier controversé Steele auraient pu faire partie d’une « campagne de désinformation russe visant à dénigrer les relations extérieures des États-Unis », selon des notes de bas de page récemment déclassifiées d’un rapport du gouvernement. CBS (Apr. 2020)

In April of 2014, the then-vice president led a U.S. delegation to Kiev tasked with rooting out corruption and advocating for Ukraine to diminish its reliance on Russian oil. The Obama administration had pledged aid money to support a fledgling Ukrainian administration recovering from a revolution that ousted the country’s previous leader. « You have to fight the cancer of corruption that is endemic in your system right now, » Biden told the Ukrainian parliament during the first of several post-revolution visits to the country. « And with the right investments and the right choices, Ukraine can reduce its energy dependence and increase its energy security. » Within weeks of his visit, Ukraine’s largest energy producer, Burisma Energy, appointed Hunter Biden to a paid directorship on the firm’s board. Just months before, in December of 2013, there was a similar episode when the then-vice president led an Obama administration effort to tamp down tensions in the Far East. Hunter Biden disembarked from Air Force Two in Beijing alongside his father, ahead of a series of meetings between the vice president and several high-ranking members of China’s ruling party. Upon his departure, Joe Biden called Chinese President Xi Jinping a « good friend. » Within weeks of that visit, Hunter Biden was doing business there, as a participant in a firm called Bohai Harvest RST. The corporation formed a novel Chinese-American investment partnership that involved such Chinese state-owned firms as the Bank of China. Reports at the time said they sought to raise $1.5 billion. In response to questions from ABC News, Hunter Biden maintained that he and his father never talked about his overseas ventures. « At no time have I discussed with my father the company’s business, or my board service, » Hunter Biden said in statement forwarded to ABC News by his attorney. « Any suggestion to the contrary is just plain wrong. » An attorney for Hunter Biden told ABC News the vice president’s son merely accompanied his daughter, Finnegan Biden, on the Air Force Two trip to Beijing and conducted no business during the visit. obert Weissman, the president of progressive watchdog group Public Citizen and a frequent critic of business dealings by President Donald Trump’s children — including the Trump Organization’s ongoing development projects overseas — told ABC News that it can be challenging for the adult children of well-known political figures to carve out careers that don’t pose ethics concerns, but he considers Hunter Biden’s decisions concerning. (…) The Ukrainian energy firm Burisma tapped Hunter Biden — a Yale-trained attorney who worked at the Manhattan-based law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP — to lead its legal unit and « provide support for the company among international organizations, » according to the company’s announcement at the time. Hunter Biden and his associate at a business entity called Rosemont Seneca Partners — where Hunter Biden was a managing partner — both obtained board seats, and according to banking records reviewed by ABC News, the firm began collecting $166,666 payments each month. In a statement to ABC News, Biden said « at no time » was he « in charge of the company’s legal affairs » and said he « earned [his] qualifications for such a role based on [his] extensive prior board service. » Hunter Biden had served on other corporate boards, including as vice chairman of the board overseeing Amtrak. He had no known experience in Ukraine or the highly competitive energy field, but said in his statement that he joined the board « to help reform Burisma’s practices of transparency, corporate governance and responsibility. » But questions were raised at the time. Asked about the appointment in May of 2014 by ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl, then-press secretary Jay Carney responded that « Hunter Biden and other members of the Biden family are obviously private citizens, and where they work does not reflect an endorsement by the administration or by the vice president or president. » Ukraine is not the only foreign territory in which there are lingering questions about business conducted by Hunter Biden. His exact role in the Chinese investment fund Bohai Harvest RST remains unclear. The firm’s website described the venture as being « sponsored » by the government-controlled Bank of China, and securities filings in the U.S. say the fund was « to focus on mergers and acquisitions, and investment in and reforms of state-owned enterprise. » A source familiar with Hunter Biden’s involvement said he served as an unpaid director and has not yet received any returns on his investments from the fund, adding that he only became a minority stake-holder in the company in October 2017, with his current investment estimated at approximately $430,000. He continues to play an active role, according to his attorney. And that presents a problem for ethics experts. ABC news

Pour l’heure, rien ne laisse présumer, dans le cas de Hunter Biden, de quelconques irrégularités. Sa présence au conseil d’administration d’une société gazière ukrainienne, entre 2014 et 2019, alors même que son père avait la haute main sur le dossier ukrainien au sein de l’administration Obama (2008-2016), relève toutefois d’un mélange des genres douteux. C’est d’abord la personnalité de l’employeur de Hunter Biden qui interroge. Quoique apparu sur le tard sur la scène oligarchique ukrainienne, Mykola Zlotchevski en est un parfait représentant. L’homme, connu pour ses costumes de couleur et sa carrure de lutteur, a su jouer de son entregent politique pour faire prospérer ses affaires. Relativement modeste pendant des années, sa société d’exploitation d’hydrocarbures, Burisma, est devenue le numéro un privé du secteur… lorsque son patron était à la tête du comité parlementaire aux ressources naturelles, et plus encore ministre de l’écologie, sous la présidence de Viktor Ianoukovitch (2010-2015). Entre 2010 et 2012, la société Burisma a obtenu du ministère de l’écologie six nouvelles licences d’exploration gazière et quatre d’exploitation, principalement dans les Carpathes et dans la région de Dnipro, le hissant à la onzième place du classement des Ukrainiens les plus riches. « Son problème aujourd’hui n’est plus de s’enrichir, puisque tous ses actifs ont été obtenus avant 2014, mais de laver son image », souligne Kristina Berdynskikh, journaliste d’investigation au magazine Novoe Vremya. La période suivant la révolution de Maïdan, en 2014, est en effet riche de menaces, avec ses promesses d’assainissement de l’économie et de mise au pas des oligarques. M. Zlotchevski voit ainsi une partie de ses avoirs gelés au Royaume-Uni, et diverses enquêtes sont ouvertes contre lui en Ukraine. C’est à cette époque-là que l’oligarque se préoccupe de « relations publiques ». Début 2014, Burisma s’attache les services de l’ancien président polonais Aleksander Kwasniewski (1995-2005), intégré au conseil d’administration. Six mois plus tard, Hunter Biden le suit, pour un salaire atteignant, selon une source citée par le Wall Street Journal, 50 000 dollars (45 500 euros) mensuels. Les affaires du second fils de Joe Biden, ancien lobbyiste et ex-financier, ont déjà un parfum de soufre : Hunter est suspecté d’avoir mis en avant sa position familiale lors d’un voyage présidentiel fin 2013 à Pékin pour doper son business en Chine.

En regardant le rapport de plus près, on lit qu’Elena Batourina a versé 3,5 millions de dollars non pas sur le compte en banque de Hunter Biden, mais sur celui de Rosemont Seneca Thornton, une entreprise de conseil en investissements, dont les sénateurs disent qu’elle a été cofondée par le fils cadet de Joe Biden. Le paiement, survenu en février 2014, aurait rémunéré un contrat de consultant. Les sénateurs glissent au passage qu’Elena Batourina semblait avoir bénéficié des pratiques corrompues de son mari. Mais rien n’y dit que Hunter Biden ait touché ne serait-ce qu’une partie de cet argent. Comme la précédente, cette accusation repose sur des documents que les sénateurs ne dévoilent pas. Impossible à vérifier donc. Mais les membres démocrates des commissions ayant examiné ces documents assurent à Politifact que rien ne relie Hunter Biden à cette transaction ni à l’entreprise bénéficiaire. L’avocat de Hunter Biden affirme également que son client n’a jamais touché cet argent et qu’il n’a jamais cofondé l’entreprise en question. Le cadet de Joe Biden a bien cocréé une société baptisée Rosemont Seneca en 2009, mais rien ne permet de dire, d’après Politifact, que les deux entreprises sont les mêmes. France info

Durant le second mandat de l’administration Obama, Hunter Biden conclut des accords commerciaux lucratifs avec un fonds d’investissement lié au gouvernement chinois, après que Hunter Biden a accompagné en 2013 son père lors d’un voyage à Pékin. Lors de ce voyage officiel, dans le hall d’un hôtel, Hunter Biden met son père en relation avec Jonathan Li, un partenaire d’affaires chinois. Des conseillers de Joe Biden s’inquiètent des apparences d’une telle présentation au pays des « guanxi » (réseaux de relations). Hunter Biden était un membre bénévole du conseil de BHR Partners, nouveau fonds d’investissement que Jonathan Li était sur le point de diriger. Plusieurs jours après le voyage des Biden en Chine, BHR Partners a obtenu du gouvernement chinois une licence d’exploitation. Trois ans plus tard, Hunter Biden prend une participation de 10 % dans BHR Partners grâce à un investissement de 420 000 $. En décembre 2013, Rosemont Seneca Partners, la petite société de conseil financier de Hunter Biden, participe à une opération de capital-investissement de 1,5 milliard $, impliquant une filiale de la Bank of China, la société de gestion de fonds Bohai Industrial Investment, et l’un des plus importants gestionnaires d’actifs de Chine, Harvest Fundation Management Co. Les sociétés ont utilisé du capital-risque appartenant à l’État chinois pour lever les fonds. Le Wall Street Journal qualifie de « l’une des plus grandes collaborations sino-étrangères en capital-investissement » pour tirer parti de la nouvelle zone de libre-échange de Shanghai et de la libéralisation de la politique chinoise visant à convertir le yuan en devises. Les conversions ont aidé le gouvernement chinois à investir dans des sociétés étrangères. En 2019, le New Yorker écrit un article dans lequel il indique comment Hunter Biden s’est vu offrir un diamant de 2,8 carats par le magnat de l’énergie chinois Ye Jianming. En octobre 2019, pour faire baisser la tension sur la campagne électorale de son père, Hunter Biden annonce qu’il quittera à la fin du mois le conseil d’administration de BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company. Toutefois, le 15 avril 2020, le New York Post révèle que Hunter Biden semble toujours faire partie du conseil d’administration de la société de capital-investissement chinoise qu’il a cofondée. Après une visite officielle du vice président Joe Biden en Ukraine, Hunter Biden rejoint, en juin 2014, le directoire d’une des plus importantes compagnies pétrolières et gazières ukrainienne, Burisma, dont le dirigeant, l’oligarque Mykola Zlochevsky, est ex-ministre de l’Écologie de l’ex-président Viktor Ianoukovytch. A partir de 2014, Zlochevsky est poursuivi par la justice ukrainienne et britannique pour blanchiment d’argent à travers Burisma. Hunter Biden, qui n’a alors aucune expérience en Ukraine ou dans le secteur de l’énergie, affirme dans un communiqué de presse : « Je crois que mon aide en tant que consultant d’une compagnie sur les questions de la transparence, de la gestion d’entreprise et de l’expansion internationale aidera l’économie de l’Ukraine et la prospérité de son peuple. En décembre 2015, peu avant la visite de Joe Biden à Kiev, l’ambassadeur américain, Geoffrey R. Pyatt, accuse les procureurs de protéger Mykola Zlochevsky, poursuivi par les autorités britanniques. Des chercheurs estiment à ce moment que la position de Hunter Biden peut nuire au message anticorruption porté par Joe Biden. Selon le Washington Post, Hunter Biden quitte en 2019 son poste au sein de Burisma, après cinq années de service, alors que Joe Biden a annoncé en avril sa candidature à la présidence. Selon le New York Times, « Hunter Biden et ses partenaires américains ont pris part au vaste effort de Burisma visant à rassembler des démocrates bien connectés à une époque où la société faisait face à des enquêtes soutenues non seulement par les forces ukrainiennes mais également par des responsables de l’administration Obama ». D’autres commentateurs soulèvent des problèmes de népotisme ou de conflit d’intérêts. Sur FoxBusiness, proche des partisans de Donald Trump, l’humoriste Bill Maher déclare que « ce gamin » a été payé 600 000 $ juste parce qu’il s’appelait Biden dans ce pays extrêmement corrompu qui venait d’avoir une révolution pour se débarrasser de la corruption. Le site Vox, proche de la gauche libérale, assimile Hunter Biden à ces personnes gravitant autour de la politique américaine, telles que Billy Carter, Tony Rodham et Neil Bush, tentant de capitaliser financièrement sur leurs proches à la Maison-Blanche et parviennent ainsi à s’enrichir sans réaliser d’actions d’envergure, mais affirme aussi que Joe Biden n’est pas intervenu pour aider son fils en Ukraine. Début 2016, l’administration Obama et les autorités européennes sont convaincus que le procureur général ukrainien Viktor Shokin ne fait pas assez pour lutter contre la corruption. Joe Biden décide en mars 2016 de menacer le président ukrainien Petro Porochenko de ne pas accorder un milliard de dollars si Viktor Shokin n’est pas renvoyé dans les six heures. Shokin est remplacé par « quelqu’un de solide ». Joe Biden rend public cette intervention en janvier 2018. De son côté, Viktor Shokin affirme qu’il a été licencié pour l’empêcher d’enquêter sur Hunter Biden. Iouri Loutsenko, procureur à partir de mai 2016, affirme avoir rencontré l’avocat de Donald Trump, Rudolph Giuliani, selon lui « obsédé par les possibles fautes commises par Joe Biden et son fils », mais avoir finalement décidé qu’il n’y avait pas de raison d’ouvrir une enquête contre Hunter Biden. Il considère en septembre 2018 que, si une enquête est ouverte sur Joe Biden et son fils, elle doit l’être aux États-Unis et non en Ukraine. En juillet 2019, le président Donald Trump demande par téléphone à son homologue, le président nouvellement élu Volodymyr Zelensky, de se renseigner pour savoir si l’ancien vice-président Biden a mis fin à une enquête sur une entreprise ukrainienne pour laquelle travaillait son fils. Iouri Loutsenko est à son tour limogé au mois d’août 2019 par le président Volodymyr Zelensky. Le 1er octobre 2019, une enquête est ouverte contre Iouri Loutsenko pour abus de pouvoir. Il est suspecté d’avoir « autorisé un business de paris illégaux ». Aux Etats-Unis, la Chambre des représentants, dominée par les démocrates, lance le 24 septembre 2019 une enquête en vue d’une procédure d’impeachment pour déterminer si le gel par Donald Trump d’une importante aide militaire à l’Ukraine est le résultat d’une volonté de faire pression sur l’exécutif ukrainien, afin que celui-ci lance une enquête sur Joe Biden, dans le but de mettre en difficulté sa campagne pour l’élection présidentielle de 2020. En mars 2020, le comité sénatorial de la Sécurité Intérieure (Homeland Security), dirigé par le républicain Ron Johnson, affirme vouloir poursuivre son enquête sur Hunter Biden, malgré les critiques des sénateurs démocrates, et malgré la priorité donnée à la lutte contre la pandémie de coronavirus.

Trump and his allies alleged that means Joe Biden has lied when he said he never discussed his son’s business roles. (…) The allegation that Hunter Biden has traded on his family name has been thoroughly explored in previous news stories, including a lengthy New Yorker investigation last year in which Robert Weissman, the president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, said, “It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter’s foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter’s relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him.” Reports published while the elder Biden was still vice president raised ethical questions about the Burisma deal. While the question of whether Joe Biden enabled his son to profit from the vice president’s influence is relevant to the presidential campaign, issues of balance and proportionality also come into play. (…) An NBC News correspondent asked Bobulinski for an interview and for copies of documents in his possession, but he declined. “All of your questions will be answered on Tucker Carlson tonight,” Bobulinski wrote on Oct. 27. (…) At a meeting in May 2017 in Los Angeles, Bobulinski says Hunter Biden introduced him to the former vice president, saying: “This is Tony, dad, the individual I told you about that’s helping us with the business we are working and the Chinese.” Even if that statement was made, it says very little about how much Joe Biden knew, and nothing about whether he was involved. The Biden campaign has denied that Biden knew about the venture or stood to profit from it. NBC News has sought to obtain the documents on the alleged Hunter Biden laptop, but has been rebuffed. An NBC News correspondent sent a letter two weeks ago to Giuliani, seeking copies of the materials. His lawyer, Robert Costello, granted the correspondent the opportunity to review some Hunter Biden emails and other materials in person. The materials included copies of Hunter Biden identification documents that appeared to be genuine. But without taking possession of the copies, it was not possible to conduct the sort of forensic analysis that might help authenticate the emails and documents. It was Giuliani who ultimately told NBC News he would not be providing a copy of the hard drive. NBC News responded by asking if, instead of a full copy of the hard drive, he could just provide copies of the full set of emails. Giuliani did not agree to that proposal. NBC News then declined an offer of copies of a small group of emails. NBC News has also requested the documents from Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, but has not received a response. (…) The owner of a computer repair shop in Wilmington, Delaware, John Paul Mac Isaac, has said a man he believes was Hunter Biden left a water-damaged Apple computer at his shop in April 2019 for repairs and data recovery. But Biden never retrieved the machine, Mac Isaac has said, and at some point he began to examine the data. He said he found material that disturbed him, though he has never publicly explained what that was. His lawyer said he contacted the FBI, which ultimately served a grand jury subpoena for the laptop and a hard drive. After hearing nothing from the FBI for months, Mac Isaac said he grew frustrated and turned a copy of the laptop’s contents over to Giuliani’s lawy. (…) According to the representative, Mac Isaac said he wrote to Giuliani’s team after trying to reach out to Republican members of Congress without success. (…) U.S. officials have refused to explain why they seized the laptops and what, if anything, they are investigating. NBC News attempted to speak to Mac Isaac, but he did not respond to requests for comment. NBC News published an article quoting responses he had given to The Daily Beast. His lawyer then sent NBC News a letter that said, “Your network and affiliates should cease any further discussion of Mr. Mac Isaac as much of the information you are presenting is false.” James Rosen, a reporter for the conservative-leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group, the nation’s largest operator of local television stations, reported this week that a Justice Department official told him the FBI had opened a criminal investigation into Hunter Biden and his associates last year focused on allegations of money-laundering — and that the probe remains active. NBC News has not confirmed any such investigation. Rosen also reported that the FBI interviewed former Biden associate Bobulinski last week. A senior law enforcement official told NBC News that Bobulinski initiated the interview. Bobulinski said the FBI told him he’s “listed as a material witness,” but law enforcement officials say the FBI does not use that term in this context. Hunter Biden’s lawyer, George Mesires, did not respond to a request for comment by NBC News. He has not asserted — nor has the Biden campaign — that the laptop did not belong to Hunter Biden. If he did leave the machine in Delaware, it would have marked at least the second time he has left behind a laptop. According to two people familiar with the matter, a different Hunter Biden laptop landed in the custody of the DEA in February when they executed a search warrant on the Massachusetts office of a psychiatrist accused of professional misconduct. The psychiatrist has not been charged with a crime. NBC

Il y a cinq jours, le reporter d’investigation Glen Greenwald claquait la porte du site américain d’information The Intercept, l’accusant d’avoir censuré un article sur Joe Biden et son fils en retirant «tous les passages critiques». Un développement non sans ironie, soulignait ce journaliste libertarien de gauche, détenteur du prix Pulitzer, notant qu’il avait cofondé ce média en 2014 précisément «pour défendre un journalisme indépendant». L’article de Greenwald, qui a depuis été publié sur son site personnel, se penche sur l’affaire des courriers électroniques de Hunter Biden, fils du candidat démocrate, accusé par la campagne de Trump d’avoir monnayé l’accès à son père auprès de compagnies privées en Ukraine et en Chine pour s’enrichir, lorsque ce dernier était vice-président des États-Unis. Sans préjuger de la véracité des accusations portées et de l’implication personnelle du candidat démocrate, le journaliste y explique qu’il est absolument nécessaire d’enquêter, vu que l’authenticité des e-mails en question, confirmés par plusieurs destinataires, dont l’un des ex-collaborateurs de Hunter Biden, n’a jamais été démentie, ni par la campagne démocrate ni par la famille. Son article décrit surtout le silence assourdissant de la plupart des médias sur cette affaire lancée dans la mêlée électorale par le tabloïd conservateur New York Post, le premier à publier ces e-mails, qui auraient été récupérés sur un ordinateur portable de Hunter déposé chez un réparateur. «L’union des entités les plus puissantes de la nation, y compris ses médias, a pris des mesures extraordinaires pour enterrer les questions», parce qu’elle est farouchement pro-Biden, dénonce Greenwald, soulignant notamment «la campagne de censure inhabituelle» lancée aussi par Facebook et Twitter contre le New York Post, dont le compte a été provisoirement gelé par Twitter en invoquant la nécessité de «vérifier les faits». Le journaliste critique aussi avec sévérité la manière dont les médias libéraux «mainstream» auraient accepté l’argument de la campagne de Biden selon lequel cette affaire serait une «opération russe». Il cite notamment l’étonnante publication par le Washington Post d’un avis d’expert qui expédie l’affaire en affirmant que «nous devons traiter les fuites (sur) Hunter Biden comme si elles étaient une opération d’agents extérieurs – même si elles ne le sont pas». Greenwald, dans son article, note aussi que les quelques membres de la presse généraliste qui ont essayé de discuter ces matériels ont été «vilipendés», comme par exemple la reporter du New York Times Maggie Haberman, affublée sur les réseaux sociaux du nom de «Maga Haberman» («Maga» étant l’acronyme du slogan de campagne de Donald Trump, « Make American Great Again »). «Le journalisme est en crise», alerte-t-il, et «les mêmes tendances à la répression, à la censure et à l’homogénéité idéologique qui empoisonnent la presse nationale en général ont atteint le média que j’ai cofondé». La rédaction de The Intercept a rétorqué qu’il n’y avait eu aucune censure, juste l’édition d’un papier afin de faire en sorte qu’il soit «juste et exact». La crise qu’évoque Glen Greenwald et la dérive partisane qui s’est emparée de la presse américaine ne datent pas d’hier. Si en 1974, juste après l’affaire du Watergate, les médias jouissaient d’une opinion favorable chez 70 % des citoyens, selon l’institut Gallup, ce chiffre tourne à peine autour de 30 % aujourd’hui, traduisant une dégringolade. «Nous n’écoutons plus», nous confiait la semaine dernière un pasteur lors d’un rassemblement du président, jugeant que ce dernier avait «raison d’utiliser son compte Twitter pour contourner le mur des médias». L’écrasante majorité des journaux et télévisions américains – près de 95 % – avaient déjà pris fait et cause pour Hillary Clinton en 2016. Depuis, rapporte le Centre d’études des médias de Harvard, la couverture de la présidence a été à plus de 90 % négative, l’idée de faire partir Trump avant terme tournant parfois à l’obsession. En 2020, après l’échec de la procédure de destitution du président et les résultats peu concluants de l’enquête sur sa supposée collusion avec la Russie, ces mêmes médias ont tous pris position pour Joe Biden, afin de «renvoyer le pire président des temps modernes», selon le Washington Post. On estime que sur les 13.000 journalistes en activité aux États-Unis, 80 % se situent dans l’opposition à Trump.

Attention: une censure peut en cacher une autre !

A l’heure où à quelques jours de l’une des élections américaines les plus importantes et les plus disputées de l’histoire récente …

Et où avec la massive campagne de votes anticipés et par correspondance orchestrée par les Démocrates …

Plus de 80 millions d’électeurs ont déjà voté …

Et entre délais de comptage et recours pour fraudes …

La décision finale pourrait, entre deux menaces de violence d’extrême-gauche, prendre des jours, voire des semaines ou des mois …

Cherchez l’erreur ..

Quand les médias qui dénoncent la perturbation de meetings de Joe Biden par des partisans de Trump …

Et ont sorti depuis trois ans les rumeurs les plus infondées sur le président américain …

Dont le tristement célèbre faux dossier Steele, base de l’enquête de la CIA et du FBI sur la campagne 2016 de Trump …

Concocté à partir de ouï-dire et de potins de tiers provenant de sources de bas niveau par un chercheur britannique payé par l’équipe d’Hillary Clinton pour déterrer des boules puantes contre Trump …

Sont les mêmes qui pour protéger « leur candidat » avec l’aide des réseaux sociaux comme Tweeter ou Facebook …

Voire la démission forcée ou les pressions sur leurs propres journalistes …

Refusent depuis des semaines de couvrir sérieusement l’enquête du NY Post …

Sur les mensonges répétés d’un candidat qui face au soi-disant corrompu Trump se présente comme l’ultime Mr Propre …

Concernant sa prétendue ignorance de l’évident trafic d’influence de son fils en Ukraine, Russie ou Chine …

La presse, reflet partisan et accélérateur des divisions américaines

Les médias américains jouissaient d’une opinion favorable chez la majorité des citoyens après l’affaire du Watergate. Mais depuis, leur popularité a fortement dégringolé.

1er novembre 2020

Il y a cinq jours, le reporter d’investigation Glen Greenwald claquait la porte du site américain d’information The Intercept, l’accusant d’avoir censuré un article sur Joe Biden et son fils en retirant «tous les passages critiques». Un développement non sans ironie, soulignait ce journaliste libertarien de gauche, détenteur du prix Pulitzer, notant qu’il avait cofondé ce média en 2014 précisément «pour défendre un journalisme indépendant».

L’article de Greenwald, qui a depuis été publié sur son site personnel, se penche sur l’affaire des courriers électroniques de Hunter Biden, fils du candidat démocrate, accusé par la campagne de Trump d’avoir monnayé l’accès à son père auprès de compagnies privées en Ukraine et en Chine pour s’enrichir, lorsque ce dernier était vice-président des États-Unis. Sans préjuger de la véracité des accusations portées et de l’implication personnelle du candidat démocrate, le journaliste y explique qu’il est absolument nécessaire d’enquêter, vu que l’authenticité des e-mails en question, confirmés par plusieurs destinataires, dont l’un des ex-collaborateurs de Hunter Biden, n’a jamais été démentie, ni par la campagne démocrate ni par la famille.

Accusation de censure

Son article décrit surtout le silence assourdissant de la plupart des médias sur cette affaire lancée dans la mêlée électorale par le tabloïd conservateur New York Post, le premier à publier ces e-mails, qui auraient été récupérés sur un ordinateur portable de Hunter déposé chez un réparateur. «L’union des entités les plus puissantes de la nation, y compris ses médias, a pris des mesures extraordinaires pour enterrer les questions», parce qu’elle est farouchement pro-Biden, dénonce Greenwald, soulignant notamment «la campagne de censure inhabituelle» lancée aussi par Facebook et Twitter contre le New York Post, dont le compte a été provisoirement gelé par Twitter en invoquant la nécessité de «vérifier les faits».

Le journaliste critique aussi avec sévérité la manière dont les médias libéraux «mainstream» auraient accepté l’argument de la campagne de Biden selon lequel cette affaire serait une «opération russe». Il cite notamment l’étonnante publication par le Washington Post d’un avis d’expert qui expédie l’affaire en affirmant que «nous devons traiter les fuites (sur) Hunter Biden comme si elles étaient une opération d’agents extérieurs – même si elles ne le sont pas».

Greenwald, dans son article, note aussi que les quelques membres de la presse généraliste qui ont essayé de discuter ces matériels ont été «vilipendés», comme par exemple la reporter du New York Times Maggie Haberman, affublée sur les réseaux sociaux du nom de «Maga Haberman» («Maga» étant l’acronyme du slogan de campagne de Donald Trump, « Make American Great Again »). «Le journalisme est en crise», alerte-t-il, et «les mêmes tendances à la répression, à la censure et à l’homogénéité idéologique qui empoisonnent la presse nationale en général ont atteint le média que j’ai cofondé». La rédaction de The Intercept a rétorqué qu’il n’y avait eu aucune censure, juste l’édition d’un papier afin de faire en sorte qu’il soit «juste et exact».

La crise qu’évoque Glen Greenwald et la dérive partisane qui s’est emparée de la presse américaine ne datent pas d’hier. Si en 1974, juste après l’affaire du Watergate, les médias jouissaient d’une opinion favorable chez 70 % des citoyens, selon l’institut Gallup, ce chiffre tourne à peine autour de 30 % aujourd’hui, traduisant une dégringolade. «Nous n’écoutons plus», nous confiait la semaine dernière un pasteur lors d’un rassemblement du président, jugeant que ce dernier avait «raison d’utiliser son compte Twitter pour contourner le mur des médias».

Le fer de lance de cette nébuleuse est évidemment la chaîne Fox News, aussi partiale pour Trump que les autres médias le sont contre lui

L’écrasante majorité des journaux et télévisions américains – près de 95 % – avaient déjà pris fait et cause pour Hillary Clinton en 2016. Depuis, rapporte le Centre d’études des médias de Harvard, la couverture de la présidence a été à plus de 90 % négative, l’idée de faire partir Trump avant terme tournant parfois à l’obsession. En 2020, après l’échec de la procédure de destitution du président et les résultats peu concluants de l’enquête sur sa supposée collusion avec la Russie, ces mêmes médias ont tous pris position pour Joe Biden, afin de «renvoyer le pire président des temps modernes», selon le Washington Post.

On estime que sur les 13.000 journalistes en activité aux États-Unis, 80 % se situent dans l’opposition à Trump. Une disproportion qui explique le décalage entre la virulence de la couverture anti-Trump et la «complaisance» du corps journalistique à l’égard de Joe Biden. À la mi-septembre, le site Politico reconnaissait qu’une émission d’ABC avec Donald Trump comme invité avait tourné à l’«interrogatoire hostile», alors que Joe Biden avait droit, sur CNN à «des retrouvailles entre vieux amis».

Pour justifier ce parti pris, la plupart des journalistes invoquent une situation «anormale», qui cessera avec le départ de Trump, principale source de «fausses nouvelles», estiment-ils. «Face à un candidat qui qualifie la presse d’ennemie du peuple, la disparité de traitement est hors sujet», veut croire Gabriel Kahn, professeur de journalisme.

Trump est d’ailleurs loin d’être complètement isolé médiatiquement, puisqu’il bénéficie de la virulence de l’aile conservatrice du paysage médiatique, qui roule pour lui sans complexe. Le fer de lance de cette nébuleuse est évidemment la chaîne Fox News, aussi partiale pour Trump que les autres médias le sont contre lui, avec une mention spéciale pour le show du journaliste vedette Tucker Carlson, qui bat des records d’audience. Derrière Fox se dresse aussi un univers de radios privées conservatrices chrétiennes, qui défendent activement le président.

Ce face-à-face médiatique, qui reflète la division béante de l’Amérique, mais contribue aussi à l’aggraver, existait déjà sous Obama, avec l’opposition systématique de Fox et souvent de la chaîne progressiste MSNBC. Mais la nouveauté des années Trump vient de ce que les médias de la grande presse, jusqu’ici plus distanciés, même s’ils avaient déjà une coloration politique, ont dérivé eux aussi vers le combat, d’une manière plus subtile mais qui n’en reste pas moins problématique. La crise qui traverse le New York Times, «grande dame» du journalisme qui faisait naguère figure de référence incontournable, est à cet égard un résumé du glissement idéologique vers la gauche, au-delà du débat sur Trump.

La question clé de l’histoire

Comme l’ont montré plusieurs épisodes successifs, dont le départ de la journaliste Bari Weiss, accusée de ne pas avoir défendu les canons de «justice sociale», une guerre idéologique gronde en interne entre l’ancienne génération libérale, essentiellement préoccupée de journalisme et de faits, et une jeune génération «woke», qui considère que les préoccupations antiracistes ou antisexistes doivent colorer la couverture. La raison pour laquelle l’ancienne génération, toujours aux commandes mais désireuse d’apparaître inclusive, peine à maintenir l’étalon journalistique est la question clé de l’histoire.

La manière choquante dont le New York Times a par exemple rendu compte de la décapitation du professeur d’histoire Samuel Paty, annonçant que la police avait «tiré et abattu un homme, à la suite d’une attaque au couteau», au lieu de titrer sur le fait majeur de la décapitation de l’enseignant par un islamiste, illustre avec éclat à quel point le prisme antiraciste obsessionnel qui domine le débat aux États-Unis déteint sur sa couverture.

Peu de journaux semblent épargnés. Un journaliste nous confie qu’au Christian Science Monitor, journal plutôt situé à droite, les jeunes reporters exigent désormais des anciens qu’ils fassent des statistiques sur les sources qu’ils citent: femmes, hommes, Noirs, Blancs, Latinos… afin de maintenir une «juste» proportion dans la couverture… La question n’est désormais plus seulement la fiabilité des sources, mais leur origine raciale ou leur genre.

Guerre culturelle en Amérique: la dernière chance des conservateurs

DÉCRYPTAGE – Avec l’arrivée de Trump à la présidence, les conservateurs se sont sentis requinqués, presque surpris d’avoir trouvé en ce milliardaire divorcé et incapable de réciter un verset de la Bible, un allié aussi résolu des valeurs chrétiennes.

30 octobre 2020

Il y a quelques jours, Thomas Kligenstein, président de l’Institut Claremont, influent think-tank conservateur californien, prenait solennellement la parole dans une vidéo pour appeler ses compatriotes républicains à comprendre l’enjeu de «l’élection la plus importante que l’Amérique ait connue depuis 1860». «Le parti démocrate chevauche une révolution» qui vise à changer «le projet américain des Pères fondateurs», mettait-il en garde. La bataille présidentielle de 2020 n’est pas «une compétition entre des programmes sur la santé ou la fiscalité, mais une bataille pour deux modes de vie qui ne peuvent coexister pacifiquement», ajoutait-il.

Dans sa vidéo au ton assez dramatique, l’intellectuel conservateur oppose l’approche républicaine, universaliste, mettant en avant les droits individuels des citoyens sans prise en compte de leur couleur de peau, au projet multiculturaliste de la gauche américaine, qui considère la société «non pas comme une communauté d’individus mais comme une collection de groupes culturels communautaires définis par leur race, leur ethnicité ou leur genre». Pour les progressistes, «toutes ces identités sont opprimées par les mâles blancs et leur but est de représenter de manière proportionnelle tous les groupes dans toutes les institutions américaines», affirme Kligenstein, qui avertit que cette obsession d’une représentation proportionnelle «amènerait à une redistribution sans fin de la richesse, qui ne pourrait être réalisée que par un gouvernement tyrannique et omniprésent».

«Les multiculturalistes veulent nous convaincre que l’Amérique se définit par l’esclavage, qu’elle est mauvaise et systémiquement raciste et qu’il faut donc tout changer», ajoute Kligenstein dans sa vidéo. Un constat qui l’amène à plaider pour un vote clair en faveur du président sortant.

L’intellectuel est persuadé qu’un président Biden serait impuissant à arrêter la vague révolutionnaire qui a pris racine dans son parti. Trump, à l’inverse, «ne se sent pas coupable et considère que l’Amérique est bonne» intrinsèquement. Pour cette seule raison, «c’est l’homme providentiel» de la droite, note Kligenstein, reprenant une idée que beaucoup de conservateurs expriment désormais ouvertement, après l’avoir beaucoup critiqué. «Trump n’est pas un président pour tous les temps… Mais pour les temps révolutionnaires que nous vivons, c’est exactement l’homme qu’il nous faut», car il a du «courage, et est capable d’aller là où personne n’ose aller», dit encore le président de l’Institut Claremont, tout en reconnaissant que «ses paroles», «sa mesquinerie», «son esprit de rancune» le font parfois «grincer des dents».

Les multiculturalistes veulent nous convaincre que l’Amérique se définit par l’esclavage, qu’elle est mauvaise et systémiquement raciste et qu’il faut donc tout changer. Thomas Kligenstein, président de l’Institut Claremont.

Dans la bataille qui se joue en Amérique, on a parfois l’impression que la pandémie du Covid-19 est le thème qui a écrasé tout le reste. Mais cette impression est trompeuse. Les guerres culturelles et la question plus générale de la direction existentielle que prendra le pays sont dans tous les esprits, comme l’exprime la sortie de Kligenstein.

Alors que le 3 novembre approche, les démocrates ne cessent de répéter qu’une réélection du turbulent milliardaire serait une catastrophe pour le pays, sa seule présence à la Maison-Blanche constituant selon eux un danger terrible, qui ouvrirait la voie au chaos et à une dictature rampante. Mais le sentiment d’une apocalypse est aussi très présent sur la droite, où l’on craint que le retour des démocrates aux affaires ne scelle la victoire définitive de la révolution identitariste et multiculturaliste «woke», qui, partie des universités, est en train déborder dans la presse libérale et la gauche du «parti de l’âne». «Nous sommes au bord d’un abîme», affirme le prêtre conservateur catholique Ed Meeks.

La victoire du libéralisme sociétal

Depuis la révolution sociétale des années 1960, qui a vu les idées de la gauche libérale triompher et l’emprise de la religion refluer, les conservateurs se sont toujours sentis sur la défensive, jugeant avoir largement perdu la bataille culturelle, notamment après la décision Roe vs Wade de la Cour suprême autorisant l’avortement dans tous les États. Plusieurs auteurs célèbres, Alan Bloom, Christopher Lasch, ont brillamment décrit ce processus. L’arrivée de Ronald Reagan et sa révolution conservatrice avaient certes réarmé la droite, mais ce «retour de flamme» fut très provisoire.

En réalité, si les conservateurs ont continué à revendiquer les valeurs chrétiennes, le libéralisme sociétal a poursuivi ses avancées, du mariage gay, plutôt bien accepté, à une approche de plus en plus révolutionnaire du genre, qui remet en cause la famille traditionnelle et les différences biologiques entre les sexes, en passant par la bataille pour la «Justice sociale», qui, au nom de la lutte antiraciste et antisexiste, entend rejeter aujourd’hui tout l’héritage intellectuel et culturel occidental.

Certes, avec l’arrivée de Donald Trump à la présidence, les conservateurs se sont sentis requinqués, presque surpris d’avoir trouvé en ce milliardaire divorcé – et incapable de réciter un verset de la Bible -, un allié aussi résolu des «valeurs chrétiennes». L’arrivée de trois nouveaux juges conservateurs à la Cour suprême a galvanisé leurs troupes. Mais le sentiment dominant reste celui d’une planète républicaine sur la défensive.

Trump n’est pas un président pour tous les temps… mais, pour les temps révolutionnaires que nous vivons, c’est exactement l’homme qu’il nous faut. Thomas Kligenstein, président de l’Institut Claremont.

Après la mort tragique, en pleine campagne électorale, de George Floyd, un Afro-Américain tué par un policier, le débat légitime sur les violences policières a tourné à une discussion sur le racisme supposément «systémique» de la police et des institutions américaines, menant au démantèlement de dizaines de statues de personnalités, sur fond d’émeutes et de violences. Même Lincoln et Frederick Douglas, exemples de l’antiracisme, note Kligenstein, n’ont pas été épargnés, suscitant une inquiétude grandissante chez les conservateurs et nombre de libéraux jusqu’ici accommodants.

Trump a pris position sur ce sujet brûlant dès le mois de juin, dans son discours de Rushmore. Trois mois plus tard, Joe Biden se rendait à Gettysburg, un haut lieu de la guerre civile américaine, pour appeler à l’apaisement. Mais les républicains disent ne pas se sentir rassurés par son approche très conciliante et soulignent que la gauche «woke», qui tient tous les lieux de pouvoir «gramsciens» – l’université, la presse, Hollywood -, pourrait se sentir pousser des ailes.

Même si le phénomène reste peu couvert par la presse américaine, une ambiance révolutionnaire continue d’agiter les campus. Ces derniers jours, l’université de Chicago comme celle de NorthWestern dans l’Illinois, ont notamment été le siège de manifestations violentes et de destructions organisées des groupes d’étudiants de Black Lives Matter, qui revendiquent la dissolution de la police du campus.

Dans une lettre ouverte, le président de Northwestern, Morton Schapiro, s’est indigné du vandalisme et des appels à «tuer les cochons» de policiers des manifestants. Il a expliqué avoir été harcelé par des dizaines d’activistes venus chanter «Va te faire enc… Morty» devant sa",https://jcdurbant.wordpress.com/category/elections/
