0,08e269f0-2499-48ce-a398-e978b2e96ecb,['Catie Edmondson'],2022-03-09 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON — The $1.5 trillion spending bill that passed the House on Wednesday was fueled in large part by bipartisan support for an emergency aid package for Ukraine, which would steer $13.6 billion in military and humanitarian assistance to the war-torn country under assault by Russia.

The emergency funds, details of which were released only hours ahead of Wednesday night’s vote, are evenly split between military and humanitarian aid, with money earmarked to cover the costs of American troops deployed to Europe and to provide emergency assistance to both Ukrainians still living in the country and those who have fled.

The price tag of the package has ballooned from $6.4 billion, the initial request from the White House, reflecting the furious backlash in Congress to Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine — and how, struggling to unite behind meaningful assistance for Kyiv, Republicans and Democrats have resorted to one of the few substantive tools available to them: sending money and weapons.

“The brave, freedom-loving people of Ukraine and our allies in the region will receive urgently needed investments to fight Vladimir Putin and the Russians’ illegal and immoral invasion,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said in a joint statement detailing the spending.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/us/politics/house-emergency-aid-ukraine.html
1,08e269f0-2499-48ce-a398-e978b2e96ecb,"['Staff Writer', 'Matt Pearce Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Covering Internet Culture']",2022-03-08 00:00:00,"It was one of the more unusual online crowdfunding efforts in recent years: When Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, many internet users and some mainstream American news outlets shared links for donating to Ukraine’s outmatched military.

One of the crowdfunding supporters was Emmy Gengler, chief executive of Softjourn, whose California-based technology services company has posted information on platforms including Twitter and LinkedIn about how to donate to humanitarian efforts as well as a National Bank of Ukraine fund to help finance the Ukrainian armed forces.

Softjourn “has been supporting the Ukrainian army for the last eight years,” since Russian-backed separatists took over part of eastern Ukraine and Crimea, said Gengler; company support has included medical equipment such as ambulances. Softjourn has employees on multiple continents, including about 200 employees based in Ukraine, some of whom have left the country and some of whom are staying and working through the conflict, Gengler said. Calls and meetings are sometimes interrupted by air-raid sirens. In addition to the war hitting close to home for Softjourn, “we also have to look at the bigger picture, which is that I do not believe Putin will stop with Ukraine,” Gengler said.

As the U.S. government and other NATO powers send weapons to Ukraine and impose economic sanctions on Russia, many private citizens, companies and others sympathetic to Ukraine have been waging a parallel effort online to directly and indirectly contribute to the country’s resistance and humanitarian efforts.

Like many global crises in the 21st century — like the recent “digital Dunkirk” to help some Afghans flee Taliban rule — a smartphone and an internet connection are sometimes all that’s needed for civilians in liberal democracies to pitch in, at least within the geopolitical boundaries drawn by their own governments. The U.S. government, at least so far, has not seemed to try to restrain American citizens from providing aid to Ukraine’s armed resistance.

Crowdfunding brings internet users “into the intimate proximity to the conflict,” said Olga Boichak, a Ukrainian-born lecturer in digital cultures and a digital war expert at the University of Sydney in Australia, who has studied the military crowdfunding efforts that had already been underway in Ukraine since 2014. “It unsettles the boundary between the military logistics and the civilian logistics.”

In the days since the Russian invasion began, cryptocurrency users have sent more than $59 million in crypto assets to the National Bank of Ukraine account for the military and to a popular Ukrainian nonprofit, Come Back Alive, that helps provide resources to frontline fighters, according to Elliptic, a crypto analytics company. The National Bank of Ukraine has reported receiving the equivalent of nearly $100,000 in donations in foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, Polish zloty, and the Australian dollar.

“I’ve had several folks reach out and say, ‘Hey, I want to donate to the Ukrainian military,” said Lindy Kyzer, director of content for ClearanceJobs.com, which Kyzer described as “the CNN of the security clearance process” to get jobs working with classified U.S. government information. “I haven’t found anything that said that’s illegal, but if you have an active clearance, you shouldn’t be donating to a foreign military.”

World & Nation Full coverage of the war in Ukraine Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

Kyzer said she had also been contacted by U.S. National Guard members wanting to directly sign up to fight with the Ukrainian military, which she advised against, given their official duties. “Welcome to the crowdfunded military effort,” Kyzer said. “It’s fueled by internet and web-savvy [people] and cryptocurrency and the ubiquitousness of the spread of information.”

Western private support for Ukraine in the digital arena goes beyond crowdfunding. Since the Russian invasion began, Microsoft has directly advised Ukraine’s government on how to counter cyberattacks against Ukrainian military institutions, manufacturers and government agencies. Entrepreneur Elon Musk sent satellite-supported Starlink terminals to Ukraine to help maintain internet access.

Longtime fears over Russian “disinformation” campaigns to mislead public opinion in other countries have also cooled as many social-media users have instead been won over by the PR offensive by Ukraine’s entertainer-turned-president Volodymyr Zelensky, whose defiant speeches against the invasion have been retweeted tens of thousands of times on Twitter.

U.S.-based tech giants like Google and Meta have played their own role in the opinion wars by restricting access to Russian-backed media channels such as RT, which have refused to call the invasion a “war” in accordance with Kremlin policy. Platforms have also been cracking down on social media users engaged in “coordinated” deceptive posting.

Many of these efforts have often come at the explicit request of Ukrainian leaders reaching for every tool available to help fight off a vastly larger military on the physical battlefield, while also hoping to economically and politically isolate the Russian government in the international arena to make peace more appealing.

“No more @Apple product sales in Russia!” Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wrote on Twitter, in one of his many messages tagging companies and officials demanding Russian boycotts. “Now @tim_cook let’s finish the job and block @AppStore access in Russia. They kill our children, now kill their access!” he implored, calling out the Apple CEO.

Not every boycott request is granted, and there are limits to how far some outsiders are able — or willing — to go in helping erect a new, digital Iron Curtain around Russia, which itself has been criminalizing media and digital content that strays from the government’s tightly controlled propaganda about the scope and bloodiness of the war.

Some cryptocurrency supporters also rejected Ukrainian calls for cryptocurrency exchanges to block Russian users, arguing in part that citizens shouldn’t be punished for the actions of their government. After a request from Ukraine officials to effectively kick Russian websites off the internet, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which helps manage web addresses, said it had neither the technical ability nor unilateral authority to take such steps.

“Your desire is to help users seek reliable information in alternative domain zones and prevent propaganda and disinformation,” the organization’s president, Göran Marby, argued in part in an otherwise sympathetic letter. “It is only through broad and unimpeded access to the Internet that citizens can receive reliable information and a diversity of viewpoints.”

Some U.S. digital platforms have been squeamish about allowing crowdfunding for Ukrainian nonprofits that provide equipment to the Ukrainian military.

Patreon blocked fundraising for one of the most popular such groups, Come Back Alive, as a violation of its platform policies restricting “anything that facilitates harmful or illegal activities.” (Come Back Alive had said its efforts included training “350 snipers, more than 2,000 sappers and more than 3,000 gunners, and training is being conducted to train UAV [drone] operators.”) GoFundMe has blocked any fundraiser that supports “any war effort support, regardless of the country, which can include funding weapons, any supplies to soldiers, and propaganda.”

A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to specifically address Americans’ donations to Ukrainian military efforts but emphasized there are many humanitarian relief efforts that can also be supported.

While the digital component of the story might be novel, there’s nothing new about American civilians picking sides in foreign conflicts and wanting to help, even if their government doesn’t. Direct aid from U.S. civilians for fighters has often been explicitly forbidden in other conflicts, depending on whether the U.S. government has sanctioned the combatants or designated them as terrorist groups.

“If there’s been one thing I’ve learned, it’s that supporting violence abroad is something done only in the most like tightly controlled of situations, in that the government sets the agenda, and deviating from its line to support violence abroad is done at your peril,” said Wadie Said, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and a former federal public defender who has written about terrorism prosecutions in the U.S.

Martin Galvin, a New York attorney and former national publicity director of Irish Northern Aid, recalled how U.S. officials accused the group of acting as a front for the Irish Republican Army during the Troubles, which Galvin denied. (Galvin said he a saw “a lot of parallels” with the Ukrainian resistance against Russia and that he was “very sympathetic”: “You’re dealing with overwhelming force from someone you view as foreign occupier.”) During the 1970s and ’80s, U.S. officials clamped down on Americans, including Galvin, who wanted to support Irish republicans opposing British rule.

“They tried to use the Foreign [Agents] Registrations Act. They would visit people, say you’re involved with a group; they tried to say we were agents of the Irish Republican Army, which we said we were not,” Galvin said. “We were Americans who were concerned and wanted to help Ireland the way many people want to help Ukraine today.”

Galvin expressed amazement at the ways Ukrainians and their supporters could use digital tools to rally support today compared to decades past.

“You could not do that sort of fundraising. You’d have people having events where they’d do a speaker or events or a gathering where they’d have protests and take a collection,” Galvin said. “We couldn’t go on Facebook and organize an event. We couldn’t go on Zoom and organize a conference.”

When it comes to U.S. neutrality laws, Jason Blazakis, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center and a former director of the Counterterrorism Terrorism Finance and Designations Office, at the U.S. Department of State, said he thought it seemed unlikely U.S. officials would legally crack down on pro-Ukraine crowdfunders given its own support of Zelensky’s government.

“It’s very clear that the United States has picked a side, right?” Blazakis said. “It would be hard for the U.S. to do much about it, because the U.S. is providing direct support too.”",https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-03-08/la-ent-ukraine-digital-resistance

For two weeks our liberation war has been going on. For two weeks we have been resisting the russian invasion.

We are forming new reserves and accumulating resources so that our army is provided with everything necessary for both defense and further liberation of the occupied territories.

Yesterday another auction for the sale of military government bonds to the tune of UAH 6.6 billion took place.

The National Bank of Ukraine decided to buy out the Government's war bonds for UAH 20 billion as well.

Thanks to the efforts of the President of Ukraine, the Government, and diplomats, more and more countries are joining the pro-Ukrainian coalition. Dozens of countries and organizations are providing us financial, humanitarian, military support.

Yesterday, the United States increased the potential aid package for Ukraine from USD 10 billion to USD 12 billion, which will shortly be considered by Congress.

The World Bank has approved a USD 700 million additional support package for Ukraine.

Today, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced the resilience package worth EUR 2 billion to back Ukraine.

In a few hours, the International Monetary Fund is to consider providing EUR 1.4 billion in emergency funding to Ukraine.

Next week, we expect the first tranche of EUR 300 million in macro-financial support from the European Union, which has earmarked a new emergenchy assistance of € 1.2 billions. In a week - the second tranche is to be allotted.

I want to thank those entrepreneurs and companies that today, in wartime, pay taxes, pay salaries to their employees and support the army in every possible way. Your contribution to the victory is invaluable! Thank you!

What critical steps are taken by the Government?

Approximately within a week in the Diia application we commence to register information about damaged and destroyed property of citizens of Ukraine.

Anyone left homeless. Anyone whose house or apartment was destroyed by the occupier will be able to submit an application for compensation in the Diia.

We have already established the Destroyed Property and Infrastructure Restoration Fund. And as soon as the war is over, we will begin to rebuild everything ruined by the enemy.

The war caught Ukrainians in surprise, leaving many people without documents. Therefore, in the Diia there will also be available a new temporary digital certificate eDocument.

It will be flexible: it will contain passport data, Individual Tax Identification Number, as well as photos if possible. It will be recognized by state authorities, the National Police, and the military at checkpoints. The eDocument will be automatically available to all users of the Diia.

We are also creating a food reserve.

The state will purchase grain and other stocks in the amount of annual consumption throughout the country at the expense of the state budget. This will allow us to provide the country with sufficient amount of food.

We continue to expand the list of critical imports. We support the work of critical infrastructure. We are doing everything to ensure that our army and home front are as well provided for as possible.

And we will win.

And aftermath we will build a new, free and happy Ukraine.

Our cities in the North, East and South will flourish again.

Our people will return. They will return to their new, rebuilt homes.

…And on the renovated land

There’ll be no enemy, no rival,

There will be son and will be mother,

There will be people on the land!

Glory to Ukrainian people! Glory to Ukraine!",https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/zvernennya-premyer-ministra-denisa-shmigalya9032022

After encountering unexpectedly tough resistance from Ukrainian forces in the initial days of the invasion, the Russian military has since focused its efforts on the indiscriminate bombing of Ukrainian towns and cities.

These terror tactics have resulted in countless atrocities and a rapidly rising civilian death toll. Russia’s attack has also destroyed Ukrainian infrastructure and decimated the country’s economy. In order to prevent a complete economic collapse, the international community must now urgently provide Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in emergency funding.

Even greater sums will be required for the rebuilding of Ukraine. Assuming the majority of today’s Ukraine emerges from the current conflict unoccupied, this reconstruction program promises to be the biggest undertaking in modern European history. Entire new cities will eventually rise from the rubble, transforming the country and helping to guarantee the European future Ukrainians are fighting for.

How much will all this cost? Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki recently stated that the European Union should establish a EUR 100 billion fund to rebuild Ukraine. This may be a conservative estimate. If Russia continues to bomb Ukraine at the current rate, we can expect the costs of the war to be much higher, perhaps even reaching over USD 1 trillion.

The international community’s immediate priority must be to prop up the Ukrainian economy. Ukraine needs its allies to launch a fund that will pump billions of dollars into its economy on a monthly basis in order to counter the catastrophic losses incurred due to Putin’s war.

The West has so far contributed some financial aid packages to Ukraine, but these have mainly consisted of low-interest debt. For example, the US has recently contributed an additional USD 1 billion in financial support in the form of a loan. This needs to change immediately. We all know that the reason the Marshall Plan was so successful in rebuilding war-torn European countries after World War II was because it provided predominantly grant money.

A country fighting off a military superpower cannot accept regular financing in the form of ordinary loans from the IMF and other international financial institutions. Ukraine is not Greece. It did not bring on an economic crisis due to financial mismanagement. Instead, Ukraine is the innocent victim of Europe’s first full-scale military invasion since the days of Adolf Hitler.

Crucially, loans do not provide assurance to the average Ukrainian that their economy is holding up. As they fight Russia alone, should Ukrainians also be worried about mounting debts that will eventually have to be repaid?

Above all, the international community must recognize that Ukraine is not simply fighting for itself; it is defending the entire post-World War II international order. The very least the West can do is help Ukrainians stay financially afloat and provide funds for the reconstruction of their shattered country.

A multi-billion dollar fund would have both symbolic and organizational significance. It would help the world to understand the scale of Ukraine’s losses as a result of Russian aggression. Ukrainians would also be reassured that their economy is backed by the entire democratic world. This would underline the extent of international support for Ukraine and strengthen the country’s resolve to resist the Russian invasion.

There are various ways this can be done.

For example, much as the US implemented a stimulus package for its citizens during the Covid pandemic, Ukraine could also adopt a stimulus package with Western financial backing and distribute payments direct into the personal bank accounts of Ukrainian citizens. Instead of international financial aid going through non-transparent government structures, ordinary Ukrainians would directly benefit.

One of the problems with such initiatives would be the accessibility of funds. Indeed, much will depend on how the war unfolds. For example, will Ukrainians even be able to use their bank cards? Will there be products in Ukrainian stores to purchase? To minimize this risk, money could potentially be stored for distribution once the war is over.

According to some estimates, Ukraine needs a minimum of USD 10 billion per month to make up for its losses due to Russia’s invasion. This might seem like too much at first glance but it is doable, especially if a broad coalition of nations is mobilized.

Ukraine’s economy is bleeding out quickly and needs major financial assistance without delay. A global fund would be as important as tanks, javelins, and sanctions in the battle to defend Ukraine against Russian aggression. This must be viewed as both a strategic priority and a moral obligation for the entire democratic world.

He added: “I hope we will find out in due course who did this and hold them to account.”

US weighs sanctions on Russian nuclear power supplier

The US was weighing sanctions on Russian nuclear power supplier Rosatom, Bloomberg has reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

No final decision has been made and the White House is consulting with the nuclear power industry about the potential effects of imposing sanctions on Russia’s state-owned atomic energy company, which is a major supplier of fuel and technology to power plants around the world, the report added.

Russia’s uranium production is controlled by Rosatom, which was formed by Putin in 2007. The company is an important source of revenue for Moscow.

Pentagon does not support more jets for Ukraine

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has informed his Polish counterpart that Washington does not back Warsaw’s plans to transfer its Russian-made MiG-29 jets to Ukraine, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby has said.

He said the effectiveness of Russia’s “significant” air force has already been limited by Ukraine’s air defences.

“Polish generosity is clearly on display for the whole world to see,” Kirby said. “But at this time, we believe that provision of additional fighter aircraft provides little increased capabilities at high risk.”

He added that transferring the jets to Ukraine would risk an escalation with Russia.

IAEA chief to join Russia-Ukraine meeting in Turkey

The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, will fly to Turkey later today, as the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers are set to meet.

“In meetings there I hope to make progress on the urgent issue of ensuring the safety and security of #Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. We need to act now!” Grossi wrote on Twitter.

Russia has seized a nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia and radioactive waste facilities near the defunct nuclear power plant at Chernobyl. Ukrainian staff are still operating both but in conditions Grossi has said put the facilities’ safety at risk.

At the invitation of #Turkey’s Foreign Minister @MevlutCavusoglu I will travel tomorrow to Antalya.

Nearly two weeks into Putin’s devastating and costly invasion, that fear has turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy: The once-remote possibility of Ukraine joining the European Union and NATO now seems more plausible, and even in historically neutral countries such as Finland and Sweden (both of which are already EU members), public support for joining NATO has surged to record levels.

Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has primarily succeeded in materializing his worst fears: a unified West, a more militarized Europe, and a stronger, more attractive NATO. No matter how the invasion ends, this will be one of its legacies. Putin has demonstrated his willingness to violate the sovereignty of Russia’s neighbors, in full view of the world, with little regard for the consequences. Several of those neighbors are now justifiably asking themselves, Could we be next?

Read our ongoing coverage of the Russian invasion in Ukraine

This dramatic change has been particularly pronounced in Finland, where recent polls have found that, for the first time in the Nordic country’s history, a majority—albeit a narrow one, at 53 percent—supports joining NATO. This shift was sudden: In January, only 30 percent supported NATO accession. In addition to an 830-mile border, Finland and Russia share a long history and important economic ties. Although relations between the two haven’t always been perfect (Finland repelled a Soviet invasion in 1939), Finns didn’t consider themselves to be particularly threatened by their eastern neighbor—until now.

Moscow had already proved its willingness to violate the sovereignty of its neighbors when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then when it illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014. But this time, Putin “has gone full monty,” Alexander Stubb, the former Finnish prime minister, told me. As Finland’s foreign minister and prime minister during those respective periods, Stubb said he and other Western leaders failed to heed the warnings: “We set sanctions but, with hindsight, they were not enough. I’ll be fully honest with you, I never thought he would go this far.”

In Sweden, which like Finland has historically been seen as a neutral buffer between Russia and the West, public opinion has also swung in favor of NATO membership, the prospects of which seemed pretty marginal a couple of months ago. Meanwhile, Russia’s neighbors in Georgia and Moldova recently followed Ukraine’s lead in submitting applications for EU membership, in a clear effort to position themselves closer to the West. (Brussels announced on Monday that it would begin the process of examining the bids.)

Graeme Wood: How the Finns deter Russian invasion

The expansion of NATO and the EU aren’t necessarily imminent. But the fact that they are being discussed at all shows the extent to which the invasion of Ukraine has altered Moscow’s relationship with its neighbors in a way that its previous invasions hadn’t. While neither the Finnish nor Swedish government has announced any plans to change its security arrangements, both acknowledged the impact that the invasion has had on public opinion and vowed to strengthen bilateral security cooperation between them. They also pledged to send military aid to Ukraine, in a clear deviation from their usual neutral stance. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who earlier this year said that Sweden and Finland could join the alliance “very quickly” if they decided to apply, announced last week that both countries will take part in all NATO consultations about the crisis.

Finland and Sweden’s NATO accession would undoubtedly elicit a strong reaction from Moscow, which already warned that any effort to draw the Nordic countries into the military alliance would result in Russian retaliation. But the way experts I spoke with see it, these kinds of threats only stand to push Finland and Sweden even closer to NATO. “Everything has changed,” Zebulon Carlander, a Stockholm-based defense analyst and co-author of Strategic Choices: The Future of Swedish Security, told me.

The path forward is considerably less clear for Moldova, which, like Ukraine and Georgia, has a Russian-backed breakaway region within its territory. Although the Moldovan government has long sought to join the EU, its decision to apply now was precipitated by this “dramatic situation,” Nicu Popescu, the country’s deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs and European integration, told me and other foreign journalists Saturday at a press conference. It was also indicative of just how vulnerable countries such as Moldova have become. If Russian forces were to seize control of the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, as Ukraine’s government has warned they could try, then they would have a clear path to Transnistria, the separatist region along the Moldovan-Ukranian border, where Russia already has some 1,500 troops. When I asked Popescu whether his country is concerned about Russian aggression reaching Moldova, he said that the government is obliged to be “prepared for all of the scenarios that are possible, including the negative ones.”

Although seeking to join the EU isn’t the same as joining NATO (which Popescu said is a nonstarter for Moldova, owing to the country’s constitutionally enshrined neutrality), it does serve a similar purpose. The EU has become much more assertive in its own military capabilities, even going so far as to supply Ukraine with half a billion dollars’ worth of arms and other military aid. (Two EU member states, Germany and Denmark, are also increasing their military spending.) “The difference between being a member of the EU and being a member of NATO in terms of what the response would be to Russian aggression will be very marginal,” Stefan Wolff, an international-security expert at Britain’s University of Birmingham, told me. “It will exist on paper, but probably not in reality.”

The distinction likely matters little to Putin as well. His decision to invade Crimea stemmed in part from Ukraine’s desire to draw closer to the EU. In negotiations to end the hostilities, he has demanded a constitutional guarantee that Ukraine not join the EU. For him, the risk of Russia’s post-Soviet neighbors integrating with European democracies is that Russians may one day aspire to do the same.

Luckily for the Russian president, the enlargement of NATO or the EU is not going to happen overnight. The accession process for both blocs can take years; each requires the unanimous support of its existing members. Still, the way observers such as Stubb see it, the timeline hardly matters. “There is no point of return,” he said. “What is happening is exactly what Putin did not want to happen.”",https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/03/putin-nato-finland-sweden-support-ukraine/626965/
