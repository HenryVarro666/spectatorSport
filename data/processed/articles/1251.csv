A statement from the White House, released for publication moments ago, states: “The United States, in coordination with allies and partners, is targeting additional Russian elites and family members who continue supporting President Putin despite his brutal invasion of Ukraine.” It continued that the individuals concerned had enriched themselves “at the expense of the Russian people, and some have elevated their family members into high-ranking positions. Others sit atop Russia’s largest companies and are responsible for providing the resources necessary to support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “These individuals and their family members will be cut off from the U.S. financial system, their assets in the United States will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use. Today, the United States will sanction an expansive list of Putin’s cronies and their family members.” The first individual mentioned is Alisher Usmanov, a metals magnate with ties to Britain’s Everton soccer club. When the European Union imposed sanctions on him, the bloc described him as “one of Vladmir Putin’s favourite oligarchs”. “His property will be blocked from use in the United States and by U.S. persons – including his super yacht, one of the world’s largest, and just seized by our ally Germany, and his private jet, one of Russia’s largest privately-owned aircraft,” the White House announcement said. Next on the list is multi-millionaire Dmitry Peskov, “who as Putin’s spokesman is a top purveyor of Putin’s propaganda”, the White House said. The US also imposed visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates. Full sanctions were announced on: Nikolai Tokarev and his two luxury real estate companies, Boris Rotenber, Arkady Rotenberg, Sergei Chemezo, Yevgeniy Prigozhin and his three companies, and members of their families. Also on Igor Shuvalov and his five companies, his wife Olga, his son Evgeny and his company and jet, and his daughter Maria and her company. In my State of the Union Address, I said the United States is going after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.



Today, we’re adding dozens of names to the list — and banning travel to America by more than 50 Russian oligarchs, their families, and close associates. — President Biden (@POTUS) March 3, 2022

3 Mar 2022 16.59 Given the situation in Ukraine, the US politics live blog is closing down earlier than usual at the moment, to provide more resources to our round-the-clock, round-the-world Ukraine crisis live blog covering developments in the war perpetrated by Russia. So we won’t have live coverage of Joe Biden signing a new law that will provide greater justice for victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment. The Washington Post has the goods on this, however. Here are the details. President Biden is poised to sign into law Thursday a bill that ends forced arbitration in workplace sexual assault and harassment cases, allowing survivors to file lawsuits in court against perpetrators. The new law would nullify agreements between employees and their employers in which the employees waive their rights to sue in the case of sexual assault or harassment and instead are required to settle their disputes by arbitration. A bill-signing ceremony is scheduled for 5 p.m. Thursday at the White House. “President Biden has long spoken against forced-arbitration clauses in employment contracts, and today marks an important milestone in empowering survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment and protecting employee rights,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday afternoon. Critics of forced arbitration say that the practice has served only to further cultures of abuse in workplaces and that the new law would be critical for holding perpetrators of sexual misconduct accountable. About 60 million Americans are subject to arbitration clauses, and many of them do not know it because the provisions are buried in the fine print of their employment contracts. “We can’t ignore a basic reality of these clauses: They deprive victims of sexual harassment and assault of their basic rights by mandating that they seek remedy only behind the closed doors of private arbitration, with no other alternative,” Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Thursday morning. The Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, which was first introduced in 2017 by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), was a rare product of bipartisan congressional support. The #MeToo movement helped spur momentum for the bill after more victims spoke out about how they could not sue perpetrators because they had unwittingly signed such clauses. Last month, the House passed the bill, 335-97; the Senate passed it on a voice vote. Gillibrand touted it then as “one of the most significant workplace reforms in American history,” while Graham defended the bill against some Republican criticism that it would be bad for businesses. “It does not hurt business to make sure that people who are harassed in the workplace get treated fairly,” Graham said then. Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, who was a key proponent of the bill, said in advocating for it that she had been shocked to learn that her employment contract included a forced arbitration clause. Her lawyers initially said the clause meant she could not sue then-Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, whom she accused of sexual harassment. The full report is here.



3 Mar 2022 16.52 Kimberly Guilfoyle, a prominent pro-Donald Trump Republican figure, who also happens to be engaged to Don Trump Jr, has been subpoenaed to provide evidence to the House select committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6 last year and attempts by the-then US president to overturn his election defeat. Kimberly Guilfoyle speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC22) in Orlando, Florida last month. Photograph: Joe Marino/UPI/REX/Shutterstock The committee issued the subpoena this afternoon, Reuters reports. Guilfoyle is also a television personality. The agency writes: Guilfoyle, who worked on the elder Trump’s presidential campaign, abruptly ended an interview with the select committee on February 25, criticizing House of Representatives members who were present. Her attorney issued a statement afterward saying Guilfoyle had agreed to meet only with attorneys for the Democratic-led House committee, not members of Congress. As a result, the committee said it would issue a subpoena to compel Guilfoyle’s cooperation. The panel asked Guilfoyle to appear for a deposition on March 15. “Guilfoyle met with (former President) Donald Trump inside the White House, spoke at the rally that took place before the riot on January 6th, and apparently played a key role organizing and raising funds for that event,” Representative Bennie Thompson, committee chairman, said in a statement. Her attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Select Committee is trying to establish the actions of Trump and associates before and during the assault on the Capitol by thousands of his supporters. The mobs attacked police, vandalized the building and sent members of Congress and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for their lives as they gathered to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential election victory over Trump. The Select Committee has so far interviewed more than 560 witnesses and issued more than 80 subpoenas as it probes the causes of the attack and the role played by Trump, who continues to push false claims that his election defeat by Biden was the result of fraud. Earlier on Thursday, the panel interviewed Judd Deere, a former White House spokesman who is now a Republican congressional aide.



3 Mar 2022 16.42 Hugo Lowell The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is hoping to show through public hearings in April how it believes Donald Trump came to violate federal laws in his efforts to overturn the 2020 US election results, the panel has indicated in court documents. Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., of the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection, testify before the House Rules Committee at the Capitol in December. Lawmakers on the committee said for the first time last night that they have enough evidence to suggest Trump committed crimes. Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP The hearings are set to be a major and historical political event in America as the panel seeks to publicly show the extent of its investigations so far into the shocking events that saw a pro-Trump mob invade the Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election of Joe Biden by Congress. The panel alleged in a court filing on Wednesday that Trump and his associates obstructed Congress and conspired to defraud the United States on 6 January, arguing it meant the former Trump lawyer John Eastman could not shield thousands of emails from the inquiry. But the public hearings – which are likely to come late next month, the chair of the select committee, Bennie Thompson, told the Guardian – will address just how Trump came to interfere with the joint session of Congress through rhetoric he knew to be false or unlawful. “The president’s rhetoric persuaded thousands of Americans to travel to Washington for January 6, some of whom marched on the Capitol, breached security, and took other illegal actions. The select committee’s hearings will address those issues in detail,” the filing said. The panel also said in its court submission that the public hearings would address how Trump appeared to lay the groundwork for his rhetoric inciting the Capitol attack by promoting claims of election fraud in the 2020 election that he had been told were without merit. “Despite being repeatedly told his allegations of campaign fraud were false, the President continued to feature those same false allegations in ads seen by millions,” the filing said. “The select committee will address these issues in detail in hearings this year.” The select committee indicated the public hearings would serve as the opportunity to cast a light on Trump’s secret efforts to overturn the election, from his attempts to pressure the then vice-president, Mike Pence, to return him to office, to abuse of the justice department. “We want to paint a picture as clear as possible as to what occurred,” Thompson told reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday. “The public needs to know what to think. We just have to show clearly what happened on January 6.” Read the full report here.



3 Mar 2022 16.16 Donald Trump will turn over some documents to New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, for her civil probe into his business practices, but need not answer questions under oath while he appeals a judge’s order that he testify. The developments are part of an agreement struck today between the former US Republican president, his oldest children Don Jr. and Ivanka Trump, and AG James. NY State Governor Kathy Hochul (left) and Attorney General of New York Letitia James (right) seen at New Year Parade and Festival in Chinatown of New York City last month. Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Reuters reports that these developments: Followed a February 17 ruling by Justice Arthur Engoron of a state court in Manhattan that James could enforce subpoenas for the Trumps’ testimony and documents from Donald Trump, after having found “copious” evidence of possible financial fraud. The Trumps appealed on February 28. James’ three-year probe and a parallel criminal probe led by Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg have focused on whether the Trump Organization misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax benefits. The Trumps have denied wrongdoing, and none has been accused of criminal wrongdoing. Today’s agreement, which Engoron approved, requires Donald Trump to comply “in full” with James’ subpoena for documents and information by March 31. It also requires the Trumps to submit for questioning within 14 days if the state appellate division rejects their appeal, unless that court or the state’s highest court puts the case on hold. Both sides will speed up the appeals process, with briefing completed by March 31. In their appeal, the Trumps have said testifying in James’ probe would violate their constitutional rights because their words could be used against them in Bragg’s criminal probe.

3 Mar 2022 16.04 Joan E Greve Congressman Tom Malinowski, a Democrat of New Jersey, is calling for the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to be sold to benefit the Ukrainian people.

Malinowski, a former assistant secretary of state under Barack Obama, has introduced a bill with Congressman Joe Wilson, a Republican of South Carolina, to sell the oligarchs’ luxury assets like yachts. A $600 million yacht can help pay for rebuilding Ukraine.



So today, I'm introducing a bipartisan bill with @RepJoeWilson to give the administration a new authority to dispose of sanctioned Russian oligarchs' frozen assets, and to use the proceeds to help Ukrainians. pic.twitter.com/dE0EyHA6ae — Tom Malinowski (@Malinowski) March 3, 2022 “A $600 million yacht can help pay for rebuilding Ukraine,” Malinowski said on Twitter. “So today, I’m introducing a bipartisan bill with @RepJoeWilson to give the administration a new authority to dispose of sanctioned Russian oligarchs’ frozen assets, and to use the proceeds to help Ukrainians.”



The introduction of Malinowski’s bill comes as Joe Biden announced a new round of sanctions on Russian oligarchs and their families, restricting their access to American banks and banning them from traveling to the US.

“Our interest is in maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all of history, and I think we’re well on the way to doing that,” Biden said in his cabinet meeting this afternoon. Business Insider has more details on the bill from Malinowski and Wilson calling on the federal government to sell seized Russian assets to benefit the Ukrainian people:

“Funds from such sales could be used on post-conflict reconstruction in Ukraine, humanitarian support, weapons for Ukraine’s armed forces, provisions for refugees, and technology goods. Cash could also be diverted to humanitarian assistance for Russians, ‘including democracy and human rights programming and monitoring,’ according to the bill.

Authority provided by the bill would last for two years after its passage, giving President Joe Biden prolonged power over Russian oligarchs parking their wealth in the US.



The idea could gain further bipartisan traction in Congress. Democratic representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington said she was ‘absolutely’ on board.

3 Mar 2022 15.50 Possible nuclear deal with Iran near but issues remain - US State Dept American diplomacy is on hold with Russia right now but alive and well with Iran. There has been significant progress in nuclear talks with Iran and world powers may be close to reaching a deal with Tehran, Reuters reports, while quoting the US government saying a number of difficult issues still remain unresolved. There will not be an Iran nuclear deal unless those issues are quickly resolved, State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter told reporters. Marathon talks recently hit a roadblock. It’s not clear yet what might have cleared along the way for a deal to be closer to fruition, but there are reports of “significant progress”. Talks had been going on in Vienna between the west, Russia, Iran and China. Iran is pushing for all sanctions in place against it to be lifted, but the US says some sanctions are linked to human rights and terrorists abuses, and are not linked to the nuclear deal. The Guardian’s Patrick Wintour previously noted that an agreement is designed to bring the US, and subsequently Iran, back into the original nuclear deal signed in 2015 from which the US withdrew in 2018. The talks have been held against a backdrop of repeated warnings from the west stretching back months that the talks can continue only for a few more weeks because Iran is coming ever closer to obtaining irreversibly the material and knowledge required to make a nuclear weapon.



3 Mar 2022 15.33 The American version of RT, the Russia-controlled TV network that pumps out Putin propaganda and has now been banned in Europe and dropped by platforms around the world, is apparently seeing an impact in the US of the invasion of Ukraine. The production company behind the RT operation in the US laid off most of its staff today, CNN has reported. The cable network promises more reporting, but for now writes on its website that: Misha Solodovnikov, the general manager of the production company, T&R Productions, told staff that it will be “ceasing production” at all of its locations “as a result of unforeseen business interruption events.””Unfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&R employees at all locations,” Solodovnikov wrote in his memo to employees. The layoffs would mean an effective end to RT America. The network, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s main mouthpieces in the US, was dropped earlier this week by DirecTV. The satellite carrier was one of the two major television providers in the US to carry the network.

3 Mar 2022 15.13 Biden: 'Strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all history' Joe Biden made remarks a little earlier at the top of a meeting of his cabinet about the new sanctions announced by the US against oligarchs close to Russian president Vladimir Putin, over the invasion of Ukraine. The US president did not take questions from the pool reporters gathered to see the top of the meeting. But Biden talked from prepared remarks of his latest announced measures against Russian oligarchs as: “Severe economic sanctions on Putin and all of those folks around him, choking off access to technology as well as cutting off access to the global financial system.” He added: “It’s had a profound impact already. The goal was to maximize the impact on Putin and Russia and minimize the harm on us and our allies and friends around the world. “Our interest is in maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all history and I think we’re well on the way to doing that.” Biden referred to his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, his first, in which he vowed that Putin would pay for his “unprovoked” attack on Russia’s southern, democratic neighbor. He said: “I announced that the Department of Justice is going after the crimes of Russian oligarchs…who line their pockets with Russian peoples’ money while Ukraine and the people are hiding in the subway from Russian missiles that are being fired indiscriminately... “Today I’m announcing that we’re adding dozens of names to the list including one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires and I’m banning travel to America by more than 50 Russian oligarchs, their families and their close associates. And we’re going to continue to support Ukrainian people with direct assistance.” Joe Biden speaks during a cabinet meeting in the White House this afternoon.

3 Mar 2022 14.05 'We want him to feel the squeeze' – White House on extra sanctions on Russian oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin Joan E Greve The White House will shortly issue new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and their families, as Vladimir Putin showed no sign of deescalating Russia’s devastating military attacks on Ukraine. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, confirmed the forthcoming sanctions and said the move was meant to put more pressure on Putin by targeting his inner circle of allies. “We want him to feel the squeeze. We want the people around him to feel the squeeze,” Psaki said. “I don’t believe this is going to be the last set of oligarchs.” Psaki did not provide many details on the sanctions, although she did indicate they would include a US travel ban on the oligarchs. Joe Biden is expected to provide more details on the sanctions at his cabinet meeting on Thursday afternoon. The announcement marks an escalation by the Biden administration, which had already imposed sanctions on Putin, his foreign minister and some of the top executives of Russia’s largest companies following the invasion of Ukraine. Biden indicated in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday that his administration would crack down on oligarchs’ assets as part of the West’s efforts to further isolate Putin. “I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who’ve bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: no more,” Biden said Tuesday. “We’re joining with European Allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains.” The new sanctions came as the White House asked Congress for another $10bn in aid to Ukraine. Shalanda Young, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the money would be used to provide Ukraine with more defense equipment and emergency food assistance, as well as bolster enforcement of the sanctions against Russia. “Given the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine, additional needs may arise over time,” Young said. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that she supports including the funding for Ukraine in the omnibus spending package currently being debated in Congress. Pelosi also echoed demands to ban US imports of Russian oil, telling reporters, “I’m all for that. Ban it. Ban the oil coming from Russia.” But the White House has voiced a more skeptical opinion of sanctioning Russian oil companies, amid concerns that the crisis in Ukraine could drive gas prices higher. “We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy,” Psaki said. “That would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people.” Any sanctions imposed by the White House may be coming too late for millions of Ukrainians. More than 1 million people have already fled the country because of the Russian invasion, and the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has begged for more assistance from Western allies to end Putin’s airstrikes. “If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes!” he said Thursday. “If we are no more, then, God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next.” Expectations are low for the second round of peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Belarus. A phone call between Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday yielded no major breakthroughs, and concerns are mounting over a massive Russian convoy of tanks and artillery outside the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The French Élysée palace said after the call, “We expect the worst is yet to come.”

3 Mar 2022 13.56 US not planning to engineer Russian no-fly zone over Ukraine - White House White House press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated moments ago that the US has no plans to take action to impose a no-fly zone for Russian military aircraft over Ukraine. A reporter pointed out to Psaki that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked for the west to create a no-fly zone over his imperiled nation. Psaki said: “The reason why that has not been a step the president [Joe Biden] is willing to take because it requires implementation. It requires essentially the US military shooting down Russian planes and causing a potential direct war with Russia - the exact step that we want to avoid.” She added that Biden has increased support to Ukraine, including military equipment and weapons “but we are not taking steps that would prompt a war between the US and Russia.” Today’s ongoing press briefing at the White House with Jen Psaki.

3 Mar 2022 13.24 The US believes that Russian forces have not, in fact, yet taken over the southern Ukrainian port city of Kherson, known for its shipbuilding industry, a senior US defense official has said. This is in contrast to most media reports so far, including the Guardian’s, which say that the Black Sea port on Wednesday became the first major Ukrainian city to fall under the de facto control of Russia forces. This was after Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said in a Facebook post that Russian troops were in control of the city hall and that residents should obey a curfew imposed by “armed visitors”. But the Reuters news agency is now reporting that the Russian military offensive on Kherson could be part of a strategy for potentially moving to the much larger port of Mykolaiv a little to the west of Kherson on that southern coast of Ukraine. And then on to the city of Odesa on the Black Sea, which has a population close to a million. Children look out from a carriage window as a train prepares to depart from a station in Lviv, western Ukraine, enroute to the town of Uzhhorod near the border with Slovakia, today. Photograph: Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images Reuters is citing an unnamed senior US defense officia. The agency further reports: Tanks entered the port town of Kherson, a provincial capital of around 250,000 people, and Russian forces occupied the regional administration building, regional governor Hennadiy Laguta said in an online post on Thursday.

“There’s still fighting there, so we’re not ready to call it one way or another,” the U.S. official told reporters, adding that the situation on the ground was changing quickly. If Kherson were to be captured, it would be the first significant urban center to fall into the hands of Russian troops. “What they may want to do is move on (Mykolaiv) so that they can then position themselves to the northeast of Odessa in case, in fact, they want to move on Odessa, not just from the sea, but from the ground,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The invasion, which started eight days ago, has not seen Russian aircraft control Ukraine’s airspace. Russian troops are still stalled about 16 miles outside Kyiv’s city center. The official said that Russia had moved about 90% of its pre-staged combat power into Ukraine so far and about 480 missiles had been fired by Russian forces at Ukrainian targets. British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace earlier on Thursday said Putin had deployed thermobaric weapons systems in Ukraine. The U.S. official said: “We know that they have the launching systems available to them in Ukraine that could be used for rockets that have a thermobaric warhead on them. But we cannot confirm that those weapons are in Ukraine and we cannot confirm any examples of use.” Meanwhile, a massive Russian military convoy outside the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv is stalled for a third day.

3 Mar 2022 12.34 Martin Pengelly Bad news for Republicans not wholly on the Trump Train, it seems, from Arizona. Doug Ducey. Photograph: Kirby Lee/USA Today Sports The governor, Doug Ducey, has decided not to run for Senate against Mark Kelly, a former astronaut and one of two Democrats who currently represent Arizona in Washington. Ducey* notified donors of his decision in a letter reported by the Arizona Republic. “Right now I have the job I want,” Ducey wrote, adding that he was “fully committed to helping elect a Republican US senator from Arizona”. The other current senator in Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, is unpopular with Democrats in her state and nationally but is up for re-election in 2024. Some fear she could drag down votes for Kelly. The Senate is split 50-50 and controlled by the vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, has now seen three popular Republican governors decline to run for Senate: Larry Hogan, in Maryland, and Chris Sununu in New Hampshire are the others. There’s also the question of what effect the Trump Train itself might have. In Missouri, for instance, Trump has not yet bestowed his endorsement in the race for the Republican nomination to replace a retiring Republican senator, Roy Blunt. There are some rather extreme candidates about, including Eric Greitens, a former governor who resigned in 2018 over allegations of sexual assault. As in the House, some think too-extreme candidates could jeopardise Republicans’ chances of taking control, by turning off the sort of independent or “moderate” voters who notably swung Republican in last year’s gubernatorial election in Virginia. *Note on Doug Ducey: he’s the Republican governor of a state key to Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election through lies about electoral fraud who was certifying results when Trump called him … and who let the call go through to voicemail**. **Note to the note about Doug Ducey: he’s also the governor who recently said he needed the support of a far-right state senator who associates with white nationalists and muses about building gallows for her enemies, because at least she isn’t a Democrat.

3 Mar 2022 12.17 Sam Levine In the late summer of 2020, Bruce Bartman went to Pennsylvania’s voter registration website and signed up his mother and mother-in-law to vote. Both were dead. A few months later, Bartman, who is white, requested a mail-in ballot for his late mother and cast her vote for Donald Trump. Bartman was arrested that December and charged with perjury and unlawful voting. Months later, he pleaded guilty, admitted he made a “stupid mistake”, was sentenced to five years of probation and barred from serving on a jury or voting for four years. “There’s not public benefit to him being incarcerated,” Jack Stollsteimer, the local district attorney said at the time. “This defendant from the beginning has accepted responsibility for his actions, and he has paid the price for them.” When Bartman pleaded guilty, nearly 1,000 miles away, in Memphis, a Black Lives Matter activist named Pamela Moses was facing her own election-related criminal charges. A few years previously, Moses, who is Black, permanently lost the right to vote after committing a felony. But no one had actually removed Moses from the voter rolls or told her she couldn’t vote. And in 2019, when state officials began looking into her eligibility, a probation officer signed a certificate saying Moses had completed her sentence and was eligible to vote. So she applied to do so. Even though corrections officials conceded they made an error, Moses was indicted anyway. Moses was convicted by a jury in November. In late January, she was sentenced to six years and one day in prison. Full story:

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has criticized NATO for not imposing a no-fly zone, which the Western alliance says could escalate the conflict with Russia.

U.S. President Joe Biden spoke Saturday night with the Ukrainian president. They talked about the work the United States, its allies, partners and private industry are doing to raise the cost of the war for Russia.

Biden said his administration is ramping up security, economic and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and is working with Congress for more funding.

Zelenskyy himself met virtually earlier Saturday with more than 300 people, including senators, some House members and aides, delivering a “desperate plea” to send more planes to help the country fight the Russian invasion, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken conferred Saturday with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau in Rzeszow, on the border with Ukraine.

Blinken crossed into Ukraine briefly to meet Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba, who asked for more military assistance to defeat Russia.

After the meeting with his Polish counterpart, Blinken reiterated at a news conference that the United States “will defend every inch of NATO territory"" and announced the Biden administration is preparing to allocate an additional $2.75 billion in humanitarian aid for Ukrainian refugees.

Blinken also praised Poland for assisting hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have fled their home country, saying, “The people of Poland know how important it is to defend freedom.”

Rau said, “Poland will never recognize territorial changes brought about by unprovoked, unlawful aggression.""

While Zelenskyy has criticized NATO for not imposing a no-fly zone, Putin said during a meeting Saturday with Aeroflot workers that such a zone would have “colossal and catastrophic consequences not only for Europe but also for the whole world.”

Additionally, Putin said he currently has no plans to declare martial law in Russia because “martial law should be only introduced in cases where there is external aggression,” adding, “we are not experiencing that at the moment, and I hope we won’t.”

Blinken flew on to Moldova Saturday night to show support to the small country, which has its own breakaway region, as it takes in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.

On the ground

The Russians are dropping large bombs on the city of Chernihiv, north of the capital, Kyiv, a regional official said.

“Usually, this weapon is used against military-industrial facilities and fortified structures,” regional head Vyacheslav Chaus told The Associated Press. “But in Chernihiv, against residential areas.”

He posted a photo of what he said was an undetonated, a Soviet-designed 500-kilogram bomb.

Ukraine says Russian forces are shelling evacuation routes from Mariupol, as well as the city itself, breaking a cease-fire that was to have gone into effect Saturday at 7 a.m. UTC, as the southern coastal city continued to endure days of relentless aerial attacks.

“We are simply being destroyed,” Mayor Vadym Boichenko said of his city of nearly 450,000 people on his Telegram channel.

Volnovakha, a southern city of about 21,000, also was targeted with Russian “heavy artillery” attacks during the temporary cease-fire, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Saturday in a broadcast video.

Russia’s Defense Ministry, however, accused Ukrainian “nationalists” of preventing civilians from fleeing Mariupol, according to RIA, Russia’s state-owned news agency. It cited no evidence to substantiate these claims.

Despite its heavy shelling of Mariupol and Volnovakha, there were fewer Russian aerial and artillery attacks in Ukraine over the past 24 hours compared with previous days, the British Defense Ministry tweeted Saturday on day 10 of Russia’s attack on its western neighbor.

The ministry said Ukraine continued to control the northern cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, as well as Mariupol in the southeast. The ministry cited reports of street fighting in the northeastern city of Sumy and said “it is highly likely that all four cities are encircled by Russian forces” as they advance toward the southwestern city of Odesa.

President Zelenskyy urged Ukrainians in areas occupied by Russian forces to take the battle to the invaders in a televised address Saturday night. ""We must go outside and drive this evil out of our cities,"" he said.

A shipment of satellite-internet equipment arrived Saturday in Kyiv, from Starlink. Mayor Vitali Klitschko showed off the equipment, which will help Ukrainian cities whose internet has been knocked out by Russian shelling.

The number of Ukrainians seeking refuge in other countries could reach 1.5 million by the end of the weekend, the head of the U.N. Refugee Agency said Saturday, an increase from the 1.3 million who have fled.

Amin Awad, U.N. crisis coordinator for Ukraine, who is meeting in Ukraine with local and international officials, said in a statement Saturday that efforts are underway “to urgently find operational modalities to scale up operations across lines and from outside into areas impacted by the conflict.”

Arestovich said that such tactics are already being used in Konotop in northeast Ukraine and Melitopol near the Azov Sea, which were captured by Russian troops.

He called on the civilian population to build barricades in cities, hold rallies with Ukrainian flags, and create online networking groups. “Total resistance ... this is our Ukrainian trump card and this is what we can do best in the world,” Arestovich said, recalling guerrilla actions in Nazi-occupied Ukraine during World War II.

4,84d004ad-1de7-4281-959f-ddc850c1e240,[],2022-03-03 00:00:00,"In his first State of the Union, the President spoke directly to the American people about his vision to build a better America. He reminded the country that our best days lie ahead, and that his Presidency is about giving everyone a fair shot – because when given half a shot, ordinary people can do extraordinary things. The Biden-Harris Administration’s domestic agenda represents an historic shift from the old, outdated trickle-down approach to one that puts workers, families, and small businesses first.

The President also announced his unity agenda, consisting of four areas where we have historically been able to come together and find agreement regardless of party. He has called on Congress to send bills to his desk to deliver progress for the American people: to beat the opioid crisis, address mental health, support our veterans, and end cancer as we know it.

Over the next year, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue working to make communities safer, combat COVID, and create good-paying jobs through revitalized domestic manufacturing.

A wide range of constituencies and community leaders championed the President’s remarks.

Here’s what they are saying:

Asian Americans and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders

Sung Yeon Choimorrow, Executive Director, National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum (NAPAWF): “We applaud President Biden for bringing visibility and support to the Asian American and Pacific Islander community during a time of heightened anti-Asian violence and rhetoric. We have been advocating for the President and other elected officials to acknowledge hate crimes against the AAPI community and it’s disproportionate impact on Asian American and Pacific Islander women. The recent tragic deaths in New York City and Albuquerque, nearly one year after the Atlanta Spa shootings, is yet another sobering reminder of the current state of safety for AAPI women.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Christine Chen, Executive Director, Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote (APIA Vote): “Tonight, President Biden made two things clear: ending violence against Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, and fighting for voting rights remain high priorities for this administration. Despite the several challenges presented to the United States since he took office, we are pleased that our communities’ livelihood and our freedom to vote are at the forefront of his agenda. Anti-Asian hate has existed long before COVID-19, but the ongoing pandemic has exacerbated discrimination and violence towards AAPIs to dangerous levels. We were pleased when President Biden signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law last year, and reauthorized the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. We look forward to continuing to work with the White House on the issues that impact AAPIs’ everyday lives.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Juliet K. Choi, President and CEO, Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum (APIAHF): “President Biden’s State of the Union highlighted historic firsts that his Administration has achieved, including the enactment of the bipartisan law to address anti-Asian hate. We applaud and echo the President’s calls on Congress to reform our country, making it affordable, safe and healthy for all Americans. This includes permanently reducing the cost of health insurance premiums, prescription drug prices and investing in mental health. The Biden-Harris administration has continuously put racial equity at the forefront of its policies, and we are encouraged to see the investments to ensure every community has access to the resources and tools to address our collective challenges, from COVID-19 to hate incidents to the cancer moonshot. We are inspired by President Biden’s vision for a better, healthier America, and look forward to continuing progress toward equity and justice.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Southeast Asia Resource Center (SEARAC): “President Biden’s vision for America is in stark contrast to the previous Administration, which actively undermined the health and wellbeing of Southeast Asian Americans. In particular, the President’s emphasis on parity between physical and mental health would help Southeast Asians who continue to struggle with trauma from the war, the ensuing generational trauma that lingers in our communities, and mental harm from increased anti-Asian violence. Holistic, well-funded health resources for Southeast Asian Americans that address the concerns of all community members – from increased access to mental health services for students, to support for older adults and those who are care for them – are essential to our community’s success in society, especially as we navigate the twin pandemics of COVID-19 and anti-Asian hate.” [Statement, 3/2/22]

Japanese American Citizens League (JACL): “Yesterday, President Joe Biden delivered his first State of the Union address, in which he called for bipartisanship and support for Ukraine. We applaud President Biden and his team for signing 80 bipartisan bills into law last year, including the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act introduced by Representative Grace Meng and Senator Mazie Hirono. We extend our appreciation for his commitment to “protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes,” and we look forward to continuing our work to monitor and ensure that elements of the Hate Crimes Act are implemented to best support and protect our Asian Pacific American communities. Japanese Americans have a long tradition of service to our country, most notably during WWII when Japanese American men served while their families remained incarcerated in American concentration camps. We praise President Biden’s pledge to provide comprehensive health care and benefits to veterans. Every veteran deserves the highest quality care, and we as a nation have too long neglected fulfilling this promise. Just as so many veterans struggle with mental health, so too have many more Americans due to the COVID pandemic, particularly children. We join the Biden Administration in their efforts to address the mental health pandemic that has accompanied COVID and affected our most vulnerable populations disproportionately.” [Statement, 3/2/22]

Seema Agnani, Executive Director, National CAPACD: “There has been a seismic shift in our country, which has presented the opportunity for real change and strong leadership; we have witnessed the Administration step into this role through unprecedented appointments to key agencies and boards, bold action against hate and racism, and advocacy on climate change. We commend the President for the spirit of hope and promise in the State of the Union, and we will continue to work closely with the Administration to deliver on the promise of opportunity, access, and inclusion for all Americans, as well as the commitment to advance racial justice.” [Statement, 3/2/22]

OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates: “Since day one, the Biden-Harris administration has worked to earn the trust of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander families, and their support is especially meaningful as our communities continue to combat tragic violence and pandemic health disparities. In less than a year, the president appointed a senior White House AANHPI community liaison, expanded the White House Initiative on AANHPIs, and signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law. Tonight’s brief but historic nod to our communities is important, and we look forward to engaging with the administration on the racial profiling of scholars of Asian descent and the work that lays ahead to truly protect AANHPI women, elders, and children.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum (NAPAWF): “1/ BREAKING: Tonight, President Joe Biden took the unprecedented step of including the surge and escalation of violence and hate towards the AAPI community in his first #StateOfTheUnion address.” [Tweet thread, 3/1/22]

John C. Yang, Executive Director, Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC: “As you can tell, I care deeply about what is being said right now. I very much appreciate @POTUS recognizing that anti-Asian violence is “still too common.” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC: “Thank you @POTUS for turning a spotlight during #SOTU22 on the continued hate and violence against Asian Americans, and recognizing that what our community has been experiencing is “still-too-common.” #StateOfTheUnionAddress” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

Southeast Asia Resource Action Center (SEARAC): “Parity between physical and mental health care? Yes, @POTUS! 👏 We support President Biden’s vision for a country where our diverse communities get the mental health care they desperately need.” [Tweet thread, 3/1/22]

Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum (APIAHF): “Let’s close the coverage gap and make these savings permanent.” – @potus #SOTU #SOTU2022” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

Indian American Impact: “Less than half of Americans with mental health conditions receive treatment, and South Asian Americans are disproportionately undertreated. We’re thrilled to hear @POTUS share his national strategy for addressing the national mental health crisis. #SOTU.” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

The Asian American Foundation: “TAAF thanks President Biden for his leadership on lifting up the importance of protecting 23 million Asian Americans in his State of the Union address.” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates: “Since day one, the Biden-Harris administration has worked to earn the trust of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander families, and their support is especially meaningful as our communities continue to combat tragic violence and pandemic health disparities. #SOTU” [Tweet thread, 3/1/22]

AAPI Victory Alliance: “Our right to vote is under attack. More than a dozen states have passed laws making it hard for people to vote. So We echo @POUTS in calling on Congress to do everything in their power to pass reformative #votingrights legislation. #sotu” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

Black Leaders

African American Mayors Association: “@OurMayors support the Biden administration’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and we stand united with @POTUS and our allies in holding president Vladimir Putin accountable for this unprovoked war. #StateOfTheUnion #SOTU2022” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

“@OurMayors encourage the Biden-Harris administration and Congress to lean into Biden’s Unity Agenda that calls on our country to take on seismic challenges. #SOTU2022” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

“@OurMayors remain committed to working with the Biden-Harris administration to better serve our constituents and ensure that no community gets left behind.#SOTU2022” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

Billy Mitchell, President, National Black Caucus of State Legislators: “President’s Biden speech last night regarding the state of our union offered hope, stability, and a plan we can count on to help all Americans now and in the future. His vision for rebuilding our economy so that it helps our middle and low-income families aligns with the goals of NBCSL. As state legislators, we work every day in our state houses to ensure affordability for African American families and other minority families across this nation. We applaud President Biden for the promises he has kept in his first year of office, such as providing critical COVID-19 relief to Americans. We support the President fully in getting Americans vaccinated to combat COVID-19 and end this pandemic. Furthermore, we look forward to the continued work on our nation’s infrastructure. We support the bipartisan effort to invest in our roads, bridges, affordable broadband, and clean water in all our communities—including rural communities. We must rebuild America—a task that NBCSL has been committed to over the years and will remain committed. Many of our constituents are suffering from high drug prices and cannot afford their medication that is essential to them living a healthy life. We applaud President Biden’s efforts to lower the drug prices and encourage permanent savings through the American Rescue Plan and Affordable Care Act. NBCSL stands with this nation and stand up for democracy across the world. We are against Russian aggression and stand with Ukraine. Lastly, after the failed attempt to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, NBCSL is still committed to ensuring everyone has the right to vote. We continue to put the pressure on President Biden and his administration to make sure that these two pieces of legislation pass the Senate or some form of voter protection legislation will pass and put into law. We look forward to President Biden’s continued leadership in this nation and NBCSL looks forward to continuing to work with this administration to help our constituents and achieve the mission and goals of NBCSL.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Dr. Michael Lomax, President & CEO, United Negro College Fund: “The Biden administration will push for a $2,000 increase to the maximum for a Pell Grant, which is the nation’s effort to assist students coming from lower socio-economic backgrounds to fund their higher education pursuits. Increasing HBCU funding is a priority on which the Biden-Harris White House and UNCF have long collaborated. This is a continuation of our shared goals. We have worked with this White House, even before they moved in, to formulate these asks. I applaud the president for including both HBCUs and a Pell Grant increase in his State of the Union address, and I hope both items will be championed by both sides of the aisle.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Lodriguez V. Murray, Senior Vice President for Public Policy and Government Affairs, United Negro College Fund: “This is historic. For the president of the United States to not only mention HBCUs in his State of the Union address, but to call for increased funding along with joining our effort to increase, and hopefully soon double the Pell Grant, is something we cannot help but be excited about. “It is rare in Washington for a leader to stand by priorities. It is rarer for HBCUs to be that priority. President Biden is really showing that he stands with students from vulnerable backgrounds and the institutions that best serve their needs, and those are HBCUs. UNCF hopes Congress will pass the FY 2022 appropriations bills at the highest levels for HBCUs and the Pell Grant, and then let’s do even better in FY 2023.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Spencer Overton, President, The Joint Center: “.@POTUS to US Senate: Confirm my @federalreserve nominees. Yes, please confirm @drlisadcook! #SOTU” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

NAACP: “Tonight, we witnessed the President deliver a State of the Union that spoke to policing in America, healthcare, the cost of education, geopolitical warfare, inflation, childcare, and more. In addition, he offered up firm ideals of what he envisions for the future of our country when it comes to leveling the playing field for low to middle-income families.

Business

Mary Barra, CEO, General Motors and Chair, Business Roundtable: “We face unprecedented challenges that require bold solutions. Business Roundtable is committed to working with the Biden Administration and both parties in Congress to preserve U.S. economic strength and global leadership and to expand opportunity for all Americans. We will continue to work to address pandemic-related challenges, including labor market and supply chain disruptions, and to advocate for sound economic policies that position the United States to compete and thrive over the long term. We believe there are many opportunities to work with policymakers of both parties to advance policy solutions that meet the needs of our country, U.S. businesses, workers and families over the year to come.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Liz Fairchild, Executive Director, Business Forward: “Since President Biden took office last year, America’s 32.5 million small businesses have made it clear what issues matter to their business, their employees, and their communities. Last night, the President spoke directly to these key issues, including rising costs, attacks on our democracy, and upholding America’s rule of law. President Biden highlighted the urgent need to confirm his nominees to the Federal Reserve, which he emphasized would play a “critical role” in fighting inflation and explained how a timely confirmation process will advance his plan to bring costs down for working families and lower the deficit. Local business leaders know that a responsive government is essential to a strong economy, and amid a critical moment for democracies around the world, the President reiterated the importance of prioritizing transparency in democracy. He called on the Senate to pass both the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Less than a week since Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court, small businesses have already vocalized widespread support, including within our network. President Biden used last night’s address to describe Judge Jackson as a “consensus builder” who has immediately received broad support from across the aisle. I urge our elected officials to take these critical measures in support of the small business community, the backbone of our nation’s economy.” [Statement, 3/2/22]

Rhett Buttle, Founder, Public Private Strategies: “In tonight’s State of the Union address, the President laid out a plan to build upon the economic progress made over the last year and continue America’s leadership for democracy, at home and abroad. The American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal have contributed to the fastest economic growth our country has experienced in 40 years, including the creation of nearly 6 million jobs, the lowest rate of unemployment claims since 1969, and a $90 billion increase in retail sales. This is crucial progress we’ve made in overcoming the economic challenges presented by the pandemic, but there is more work to do. Small businesses across the country need policies that will continue to give them a fighting chance, like lowering the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, increasing access to capital, and modernizing our economy to support small business employees. This includes delivering paid leave programs and affordable childcare for owners and employees, which will help build a stronger, more resilient workforce.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Cristina Morales Heaney, Board Chair, National Association of Women Business Owners: “NAWBO is pleased to see the President putting the need for workforce training in the forefront of his economic policy agenda,” said “In a recent survey of NAWBO’s women business owners, 40% of NAWBO’s women business owners reported difficulty hiring last fall. We truly believe our nation must provide training to close the skills gap or reskill our workforce to ensure that women business owners have access to talent and can compete to build sustainable businesses. We hope bipartisan efforts will work to bring this idea to fruition.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Steve Croley, Chief Policy Officer and General Counsel, Ford: “Exactly right, @POTUS. @Ford is making the largest investment in our nearly 120-year history to build #EVs & batteries to power them.

Anne Zimmerman, C0-Chair, Small Business for America’s Future: “During his first State of the Union address, President Biden rightfully highlighted the strong economic progress we have been made, but we were most heartened that he did not shrink from the need to do more to help Main Street small businesses recover from the biggest shock they’ve experienced in a century … We also support President Biden’s call on Congress to provide the resources needed to expand prosecutions of egregious pandemic fraud. PPP loans were meant for small businesses facing layoffs and closures due to the pandemic—individuals who fraudulently obtained loans meant for struggling entrepreneurs should be held accountable. As we look ahead, we are optimistic about the work the Biden-Harris Administration is doing to help entrepreneurs and urge Congress to take up the policies the president proposed to help our small business community. To maximize our economic recovery, we must seize opportunities to enact policies that help our small business community, which creates two-thirds of all new jobs and employs half of all workers, succeed. With the proper policies—addressing the cost of childcare, creating paid leave programs and bringing down healthcare and drug costs chief among them— in place, America’s small businesses will flourish and lead our economy to prosperity.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Climate Advocates

Manish Bapna, President & CEO, Natural Resources Defense Council: “Tonight, @POTUS Biden will address the nation and lay out his vision for the future. The United States has an unprecedented economic opportunity – and moral responsibility – to ACT NOW. We call on the President to put climate action at the forefront. #SOTU” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

Collin O’Mara, President & CEO, National Wildlife Federation: “President Biden’s first State of the Union Address offers an opportunity to highlight his Administration’s record of achievement and call upon Congress to enact impactful and inclusive solutions that benefit people and wildlife alike. From the climate provisions in reconciliation to the bipartisan Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, the president should make it clear that his Administration can meet the moment we face and bridge Washington’s partisan divide. President Biden should speak to this notable recent history and challenge Congress to join with him to pass solutions as big as the problems facing people and wildlife today.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Elizabeth Gore, Senior Vice President for Political Affairs, Environmental Defense Fund: “President Biden sent a clear signal tonight that he will continue to deliver on his promise to prioritize America’s clean energy economy. We join him in his call for Congress to pass his bold and transformative climate and energy agenda that will deliver good-paying jobs, lower costs for families, provide cleaner air and water, and fight climate change. The Biden Administration has already demonstrated its commitment to a ‘whole of government’ approach to climate action. Under the president’s leadership, America has rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, federal agencies are implementing ambitious climate strategies, and the federal government is implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including investments that will help drive meaningful climate progress. Now Congress needs to act. Congress has the power to enact the bold, transformative legislation laid out by the president. For the sake of America’s families, communities and future, Congress must get this done.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Nat Kreamer, CEO, Advanced Energy Economy: “I returned from a tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2006 determined to help the United States free itself from fossil fuels. Now, with Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, we have even more reason to accelerate our country’s transition to clean energy. Our national security is linked directly to our energy security. The more we wean ourselves off oil as well as gas and use more advanced energy, the safer we will be. Global conflict in recent decades has revolved around fossil fuels. The way to put an end to the power of those who use these fuels as a weapon is to stop buying their products. We need a transition to clean energy for our economy too. Continued dependence on oil and gas puts our households and businesses at risk of energy price spikes like the ones now hitting Americans in their heating bills and at the gas pump right now. That’s because these fuels are commodities traded in global markets, making them volatile by nature.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Gene Karpinski, President, League of Conservation Voters: “As we heard from President Biden tonight, we can strengthen the state of our union by making transformative investments in clean energy, climate, justice and jobs at home in the United States. We couldn’t agree more with the President that Congress needs to meet the moment on climate by enacting the House-passed $555 billion investments in climate, clean energy and environmental justice into law. These investments will save families $500 a year on energy bills, provide greater economic stability, and protect our national and climate security. We must break our dependence on dirty, dangerous and unreliable fossil fuels.

“Equally important is President Biden’s commitment to rallying the nation and world to protect democracy. We condemn Vladimir Putin’s unlawful, unprovoked assault on Ukrainians trying to live in peace as a sovereign nation with a democratically elected government. Whether abroad or here at home, we cannot have a just, equitable society without a functioning democracy. LCV is fully committed to building a stronger democracy in the United States that can serve as a model for the world.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Lori Lodes, Executive Director, Climate Power: “Tonight, President Biden laid out his plan to provide relief for American families that have been living in a world in flux – a plan that will grow the economy, lower household costs, create jobs and address environmental injustices by investing in clean energy and tackling the climate crisis. Clean energy is the future of our economy.

“We can and must take these steps now to lower energy costs, provide energy independence and secure our nation. Instead of keeping the American economy tethered to fossil fuels that makes us dependent on the ambitions of authoritarian leaders and the greed of oil and gas CEOs, let’s invest in a clean energy economy built right here in America.

“Tackling climate action is a huge opportunity for our nation – cutting household energy costs by $500 and saving families another $80 a month at the pump. We can speed up the production of cheap, clean and reliable energy that’s made in America. We’ll create millions of new good-paying jobs by investing in wind, solar and other clean energy sources that won’t run out.

As President Biden said, ‘What are we waiting for? Let’s get this done.’” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Lisa Frank, Washington Legislative Office Executive Director, Environment America: “Our union’s infrastructure is on the mend, thanks to new funding for safer roads and bridges, cleaner transportation options and cleaner water coming out of our taps. Our union’s future could be even brighter—or it could be hotter, more polluted and more disrupted by natural disasters. Congress has at its fingertips a package of clean energy and environmental investments that would go a long way toward addressing climate change, including tax credits to make it easier and cheaper for Americans to go solar or buy the electric vehicles that dominated this year’s Super Bowl TV ads. It’s time for Congress to vote for a brighter, better future.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Andrew Reagan, Executive Director, Clean Energy for America: “The president was right on the money: Congress must power American clean energy to new heights, so we can lead the global transition to renewables with made-in-America clean energy that’s powered by American workers.

“It’s never been more important to cut monthly utility costs for families, cut pollution for communities, or strengthen American energy independence. Congress must heed the president’s charge: Don’t quit on clean energy.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Matt Casale, Environment Campaigns Director, U.S. PIRG: “The latest IPCC report rings the warning bells loud and clear: It is time to act on climate. President Biden has laid out a commonsense, impactful and achievable agenda to reduce emissions. In addition to the billions of dollars for electric buses, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and carbon reduction programs included in the bipartisan infrastructure law, the president called for Congress to make it easier and more affordable to switch to an electric vehicle, reduce the amount of energy they use in their homes, and get their power from wind and solar. Congress should rally around the president’s call for action and swiftly pass legislation that puts us on the path to a healthy and safe future for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Manish Bapna, President and CEO, Natural Resources Defense Council: “The state of the environment is imperiled. Tonight, the president laid out a plan to confront the climate crisis – and he called on the nation to act.

“We can’t stand idle while rising seas, withering drought, blistering heat and raging wildfires, storms and floods inflict a widening toll on the nation and around the world. It’s time to invest in cleaner, smarter ways to power our future, cut costs for our families and create jobs.

“Biden laid out a plan to do all that in a way that will make our economy stronger, our society more equitable and our nation more secure. It’s time for the Senate to pass it.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Ramon Cruz, President, Sierra Club: “Investing in clean energy, climate action, and our democracy are investments in the people. Investing in a livable future for everyone, that works for everyone and supports everyone, is investing in a stronger state of the union. President Biden has taken significant steps this year, but now it’s time Congress does its job by passing a historic suite of investments in communities and families struggling with the interlocking crises of climate change, health, and racial, economic, and environmental injustice. Investing in clean energy, in clean air and water, and in a safe, livable climate will create millions of jobs, help address inflation, and build a better America. The House of Representatives has taken action; it’s past time the Senate passes legislation investing in climate, jobs, and justice too. But the work cannot end there – Washington must invest in our democracy. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act are more important than ever. And the Senate must confirm President Biden’s nominee to the Supreme Court: Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. It’s time Washington addresses the interlocking crises we face and invests in the people, our democracy, and the country. We cannot waste a minute longer.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Jill Cook, Executive Director, American School Counselor Association: “The American School Counselor Association (ASCA) commends President Biden for his commitment to expand access to mental health for students. In his March 1, 2022, State of the Union address, President Biden announced a strategy to address our national mental health crisis as part of his Unity Agenda. The president’s FY23 budget will propose $1 billion to help schools hire additional school counselors, school psychologists and other mental health professionals.

“School counselors play a critical role in supporting student mental health and well-being. Meeting all students’ needs is impossible when school counselors are responsible for supporting an excessively large number of students. Every student deserves a school counselor,” Cook said. “ASCA commends President Biden for working to make that a reality.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

AnnMaura Connolly, President, Voices for National Service: “Tonight, President Biden laid out his plan to address student mental health and wellness, including efforts to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student learning. As part of this effort, he called for an investment in strategies to help our students recover and asked Americans across the country to take on roles as tutors and mentors. This is precisely the role AmeriCorps members currently fulfill in nearly 12,000 schools in systemically under-resourced communities across the country. Schools and districts are collaborating with AmeriCorps members to help address the impacts of the pandemic, from supporting physical health and safety, to building school communities, to supporting the students’ social, emotional, and academic development … President Biden has called on Americans to serve our students and their recovery and I encourage those who are interested in answering his call to action to consider joining AmeriCorps. If there was ever a time to lean into AmeriCorps, it’s now.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Shannon Watts, Founder, Moms Demand Action: “President Biden showed the leadership we need to unify our country and save lives. As a candidate, Joe Biden ran on the strongest gun safety platform in history and his Administration continues to follow through on that promise.

Kris Brown, President, Brady: “We are heartened by President Biden’s words tonight, but we need continued and increased action and attention to ending America’s gun violence crisis. President Biden has already taken extensive and historic action, but he cannot let up. He also cannot solve this problem alone. His calls for legislative fixes such as universal background checks, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and repealing PLCAA, the liability shield for gun manufacturers, are common-sense and will save lives. Congress must also pass the $200 million for community violence interventions the President has asked for in Fiscal Year 2022 appropriations, and the proposed investment of $5 billion over eight years that was included in the Build Back Better Act, arguably the largest investment in gun violence prevention ever. Over 81 million Americans voted for President Biden because of his ability to handle the many problems facing our nation. He and Congress must not let the crisis that kills over 100 Americans every day fall to the wayside. His speech tonight reiterated his commitment to this issue tonight. We need him to remain steadfast and to make gun violence an even greater priority in the year ahead.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Jo Ann Jenkins, CEO, AARP: “AARP is encouraged that President Biden continues to urge Congress to act on our nation’s skyrocketing prescription drug prices. If the prices for household goods grew as fast as drug prices over the last 15 years, gas would now cost $12.20 a gallon and milk would be $13 a gallon. For all those years, politicians made promises to lower drug prices, but they just kept going up. Allowing Medicare to negotiate the price it pays for prescription drugs will help protect seniors from inflation by lowering their drug prices and putting money back in their pockets. This policy proposal is strongly supported by vast majorities of Democratic, Independent and Republican voters.

“How much longer will older Americans be forced to wait for the Senate to lower drug prices? Now is the time to get the job done. We urge the Senate to keep their promises to voters and lower drug prices, reduce seniors’ drug costs, and save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.

“We were also encouraged to hear the President describe new actions to ensure that residents in nursing homes will receive the safe, high-quality care they deserve. For years, AARP and AARP Foundation have sounded the alarm about problems in America’s nursing homes. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the chronic, ongoing issues with our long-term care system and emphasized the need for reform. It is a national disgrace that more than 200,000 residents and staff in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities died. AARP urges the federal government to act swiftly to ensure minimum staffing standards, increase transparency, and hold nursing homes accountable when they do not provide quality care.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Leslie Dach, Chair, Protect Our Care: “One year in, President Biden has already made remarkable progress by expanding affordable health care coverage and lowering premiums. And tonight he reiterated his commitment to lowering the cost of drugs and making quality health care affordable for every American. For far too long, drug companies and corporate greed have gone unchecked, shamelessly forcing families to make impossible choices between putting food on the table and paying for essential drugs like insulin. As costs continue to rise, it’s more important than ever that Congress prioritize lowering health care prices to reduce everyday expenses for working families and ensure everyone has access to the care they need.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Nicole Haley, Coronavirus War Room Director: “President Biden and his administration are getting Americans the tools they need to lead their lives while protecting themselves from COVID-19. Since President Biden took office, more than three in four Americans have received a vaccine, schools are open, and our economy has added more than six million jobs. Thanks to President Biden’s leadership, Americans can feel safe moving in their normal routines knowing the administration is focused on combating COVID-19 using common sense and reason.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

David Mitchell, Founder, Patients For Affordable Drugs Now: “Tonight, President Biden once again called for legislation to lower prescription drug prices, including Medicare negotiation. For two decades, Americans have been targeted by drug companies that established a system that prevents our government from negotiating on our behalf. It is imperative that the Senate pass a package of reforms that will couple copay and out-of-pocket caps with provisions that drive down prices by empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prices and limiting year-to-year price increases to truly lower costs — not just shift them around. Otherwise, Americans will wind up paying more through higher premiums and taxes.

“With inflation at record levels and Americans facing rising costs, Big Pharma’s price gouging forces Americans to pay almost four times what people in other nations pay for the same brand-name drugs. The drug price reforms from the House-passed Build Back Better package allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices, curb Big Pharma’s price gouging, cap out-of-pocket costs, and deliver long overdue relief to millions of Americans. The reforms have the support of all 50 Democratic senators, offering a clear path to passage through reconciliation. The provisions are the most popular element of the original package, and more than 90 percent of voters list drug pricing reform as a top issue for the midterms.

“It is time for the Senate to advance a reconciliation package with these drug price reforms. Americans need help now.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Vivian Pender, M.D., President, American Psychiatric Association (APA): “To see the mental health crisis elevated to this level by the President is truly an encouraging sign,” said APA President Vivian Pender, M.D. “The mental health crisis is, indeed, something that affects us all, regardless of politics, geography, race or ethnicity: there is no health without mental health. Now we need action to put new measures and funding into place, while also ensuring that we are implementing any policies in a way that decreases inequity in the provision of care.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

American Psychological Association: “We are gratified that President Biden has outlined a solid plan, with a focus on youth mental health and increased access for all,” said APA President Frank C. Worrell, PhD. “This plan addresses many of the key elements we have been asking for, including programs to increase the mental health provider workforce, expansion of evidence-based community mental health services, support for telemental health care, and investment in research into promising models for treating mental health conditions. This blueprint could not come at a more auspicious time, as our nation and our young people in particular are experiencing a mental health crisis. This plan is transformative and we urge Congress to get behind all the elements in this plan, invest substantially in critical research, and enact the measures needed to make it a reality. We must also remember the tireless work of mental health practitioners during the pandemic and the need to remove the administrative obstacles that can prevent them from providing services to people who most need their help.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Immigration Advocates

Sergio Gonzales, Executive Director, Immigration Hub: “The Biden administration entered their first year facing countless obstacles to reforming an almost unrecognizable American immigration system. They made notable advancements in rolling back harmful Trump policies and implementing new ones that are more fair, orderly and humane. We applaud that tonight, in spite of a crowded field of priorities ranging from foreign policy to COVID-19 recovery, the president re-committed himself to addressing this key issue of immigration and upholding the core values of liberty and justice as he does it. He laid out some key areas where he and Vice President Harris are taking action to improve our legal immigration system, keep families together and work with our neighboring countries to address the root causes of migration.He reiterated the urgency to pass legislation creating a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, farmworkers and TPS holders.”[Statement, 3/1/22]

Labor Leaders

Ray Curry, President, United Auto Workers: “Under President Biden’s leadership, we have seen unprecedented job growth and rising wages. The President has directly confronted the coronavirus pandemic that has taken lives of almost nine hundred and fifty thousand of our fellow citizens. Through his leadership, we are now better protected, and the number of infections is declining. Of course, challenges remain and there is more work to do. Congress must act on the President’s priorities. For starters, the Senate should pass the PRO Act and Confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the highest court in the land. Together with the Biden Administration, we are working to ensure that the transition to electric vehicles supports good union jobs by passing the Stabenow/Kildee electric vehicle tax credit and complementary policies into law. We are working together to strengthen our supply chain, so we no longer face a crippling chip shortage that has hurt our members who build consumer vehicles, Heavy Truck vehicles and Agricultural and Construction Equipment. By laying out this agenda, President Biden offers a clear path forward that builds America back better than ever. UAW and working families need lower prescription drug costs and more affordable quality healthcare, so no one is forced to choose between putting food on the table and affording life-saving drugs or going to the doctor. We must make childcare affordable, so parents can work knowing their children are safe. Equally important to UAW members and working families are the attacks on our democracy occurring across our country as falsehoods about the 2020 election continue to spread, and dozens of states enact restrictive voting laws that threaten to disenfranchise lawful citizens from the ballot. It is troubling that legislation to protect our most fundamental democratic rights as voters was filibustered in the Senate. Make no mistake – these attacks do more than threaten an idea of democracy; they cripple the foundation that grants our members their right to organize and secure higher standards of living for themselves and their families. Finally, President Biden addressed the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which is an affront to all democratic forms of government and all people of goodwill. We stand with President Biden and our allies in defending the hardworking families of Ukraine and their democracy. It is long past time we unite to address these issues as a country. The UAW is prepared to work with Congress and the Biden Administration to meet this moment as we have throughout our history.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Jimmy Williams, President, IUPAT: “President Biden continued his strong advocacy for the working class tonight during his State of the Union Address. The President’s focus on bread and butter issues for the IUPAT member, such as passing the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act), expanding registered apprenticeship programs, and creating a comprehensive paid family and medical leave program are a breath of fresh air. And our union stands ready from coast to coast to work on projects which are funded by the historic infrastructure package recently signed into law by President Biden, the largest infrastructure bill passed in our nation’s history. His determination to lower inflation, raise working standards, and give every worker the opportunity to join or form a union shows his strong commitment to creating an economy that works for all. Now is the time for the US Congress to do their job and get these bills to his desk. The President is echoing what IUPAT members have known for a long time: when we have an economy that works for working people, our nation thrives.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Randi Weingarten, President, American Federation of Teachers: “Tonight, Joe Biden proved why Americans were right to elect him as president. He met a moment in history with gravity and empathy. He urged unity to recover from the immense economic challenges of the pandemic, with a laser focus on boosting wages and cutting costs to help American families recover and thrive. And he made the case against the threat posed by autocrats and those who excuse them, both here and abroad. Democracy and freedom are worth fighting for—as the Ukrainian people are showing us every day.The president laid out just how far we’ve come in a year—from closed schools, millions of COVID-19 cases and soaring unemployment, to record growth, jobs, vaccines and the return of reliable and safe in-person learning. But we are still dealing with the pandemic’s terrible effects, and the president outlined a plan to curb prices, increase pay and create a better economy that puts American workmanship and creativity front and center and American workers first. We commend his specific, practical measures that would reduce costs for families right now, including child care, pre-K and prescription drugs. And we echo the need to take rapid action on climate change after yesterday’s U.N. warning that the world is at a tipping point. Our members are on the frontlines of the pandemic, and we were honored to have progressive care unit nurse Refynd Duro of Ohio in the audience with the first lady tonight. Our healthcare heroes know what it will take to emerge stronger and healthier. The health, well-being and academic recovery of students is every teacher’s priority, and the pandemic has multiplied the stresses and strains on us all. We share the president’s concerns over the mental health crisis facing our young people, including the negative effects of unbridled social media because we live with the fallout every day. Our journey will be difficult, but our direction is clear. And with the president’s leadership, now is the time to broaden the tent—to unify and organize for a better life for all Americans and to fight for and defend democracy, at home and around the world.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Chris Shelton, President, CWA: In his first State of the Union address, President Biden made it clear that creating jobs through investment in our country’s infrastructure and empowering workers has been the foundation of his agenda to strengthen our country. CWA commends President Biden for presenting a clear plan to improve the lives of working families, boost our economy and address rising costs. We agree that Congress must pass legislation to reduce prescription drug, health care and child care costs and to make higher education more affordable and that this can be done by making sure that corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share. As union members, we know that overcoming the relentless and coordinated corporate attack on workers’ rights is a difficult task and there is much left to be done. President Biden left no doubt that he believes that every worker in every state must have a free and fair choice to organize or join a union, and the right to bargain collectively with their employer, without fear of intimidation, coercion, threats, and anti-union propaganda. He also pointed out the insufficiency of our current labor laws, calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. CWA applauds President Biden’s focus on worker empowerment and we will continue to support the Administration in its effort to create more good union jobs, support workers’ organizing for better pay and working conditions and reform weak and outdated labor laws.

Marc McManus, President, United Association: “During this first year in office, President Biden has kept his promise of creating good-paying union jobs and helping more families succeed as we work to build back better. In his speech tonight, President Biden vowed to expand workers’ rights by passing the PRO Act and to ensure all Americans can earn fair wages and benefits.From replacing lead lines to modernizing our energy infrastructure, President Biden is committed to creating good-paying UA jobs. Tonight, he charted a clear path forward to continue to provide clean drinking water, to deliver efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to American consumers, and to strengthen our registered apprenticeship system.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Marc Perrone, President, UFCW: “Working Americans are rightly concerned about the state of the world. While the country is thankfully emerging from the latest wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, it now faces another global crisis with Russia’s invasion into Ukraine. Tonight, President Biden laid out a clear plan to provide relief to hard-working Americans and their families by reducing costs and eliminating barriers to good jobs. Currently, the U.S. is seeing one of the strongest labor markets in recent history but many workers still face hurdles when it comes to accessing good-paying jobs that can support a family. As the nation’s largest private sector union, UFCW strongly endorses President Biden’s initiatives to increase access to apprenticeships and training, support paycheck fairness, provide paid family and medical leave, and protect workers’ rights to join a union. We believe this – along with plans to protect consumers and reduce the cost of everyday expenses – will provide working families with the ability to build better lives they have earned and deserve. UFCW calls on Congress to take immediate action to move these crucial initiatives forward.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Greg Regan, President, TTD: “From the passage of the American Rescue Plan to the biggest investment in infrastructure in our nation’s history, the first year of the Biden Administration was a capstone year of legislative victories for transportation labor unions and working people. Chief among these legislative victories is the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), a once-in-a-generation investment across every sector of our transportation network — and an unprecedented investment in workers. We proudly represent 36 labor unions whose members will be put to work during the implementation of this historic legislation, ushering in a new era of manufacturing, construction, and transportation job creation. We applaud President Biden for putting union job creation and worker empowerment at the center of his governing agenda. We welcome the progress of the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, which recently released a report outlining 70 recommendations to empower workers, including an initiative to increase worker awareness of their federally protected rights to organize and establish a resource center for information on unions and collective bargaining. We urge Congress to heed the President’s call to pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would help workers collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. We look forward to continuing to work with President Biden and the Administration to create good union jobs, invest in America’s transportation infrastructure, and expand collective bargaining for every transportation worker in the nation.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Lee Saunders, President, AFSCME: “When President Joe Biden took office, COVID cases were soaring. Millions of Americans had lost their jobs. The unemployment rate was well above 6%, and states and local governing bodies were on the brink of budget crises. America has seen a dramatic reversal. Today, we are diminishing COVID’s impact on our lives through science. America is hiring again. And best of all, working people have more power than ever, bolstered by an administration that supports their right to organize and strike to demand better pay, benefits and working conditions. How did President Biden get America back on track? He listened to working people and then he delivered. When public service workers — the everyday heroes who have kept our communities running throughout the pandemic — had their jobs threatened by budget cuts, President Biden showed leadership. By signing the American Rescue Plan, he brought our public services back from the brink, saving jobs and preventing waves of layoffs. He signed an infrastructure bill that is making historic investments in our roads, bridges, water systems and broadband. He has chosen Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, a jurist with an indisputable record of standing with working people, as the first African American woman ever nominated to the Supreme Court. He has rebuilt the federal judiciary with a diversity never seen before, whether measured by professional background or by race and gender. And with a revamped and empowered National Labor Relations Board, workers can finally be confident that their rights will be safeguarded, following four years in which they were gutted or just ignored. But the State of the Union can’t just be about achievements so far; tonight’s speech must answer the question of what comes next. We must advance the rights and freedoms of both public and private sector workers by passing the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act. We must finally allow Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, invest in child care to support working families and providers alike, curb climate change before it’s too late and ensure that the ultra-wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share in taxes so we can make investments in strong communities. And finally, our democracy is under attack. We must respond in kind by protecting the right of every citizen to cast a ballot and make it easier to vote. The foundation of our nation depends on it. Working people want this administration to level the playing field and deliver more fundamental change. Now is the time to get it done.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Tom Conway, President, USW: ““Tonight, President Joe Biden articulated a vision for the United States that puts working families at the forefront of our nation’s economic future. After two years of a global pandemic and economic crisis in which we have seen the rich get richer and too many workers continue to fall behind, the USW supports President Biden’s agenda and looks forward to working with him and others in Washington to put pro-worker, pro-family policies into action. The president’s first year in office has already resulted in major victories, including the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the creation of the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment. These initiatives will help ensure good-paying union jobs for millions of American workers in the years to come. While the recent events in Ukraine clearly highlight our need to focus on foreign as well as domestic priorities, we must remember that to be strong around the world, we must first be strong at home. That means bolstering domestic supply chains for vital goods, providing education and job training to ensure that manufacturers have the skilled workers they need, building up our health care system, passing labor protections like the PRO Act and extending benefits like paid family and medical leave to all workers. The president today laid out an ambitious agenda that will make our nation more secure, provide good-paying jobs to millions of workers, support struggling families, keep rising prices under control and ensure that communities will continue to thrive for generations to come. We are eager to do everything we can to help him achieve these goals.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Communication Workers of America: “Biden’s address highlighted the many ways that his administration has addressed the needs of working families in the first year of his presidency. When he says that we need to strengthen our supply chains by making more things in America it is not just empty rhetoric. He has already taken executive action to close loopholes in existing Made in America requirements. Funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will facilitate economic development by improving our transportation capacity and bringing high-speed internet connections to communities across the country while creating good jobs in the industry.

CWA commends President Biden for presenting a clear plan to improve the lives of working families, boost our economy and address rising costs.

For the first time in generations, we are witnessing an all-of-government approach to putting the interests of working families first. We are emerging from the pandemic with historic job growth. Working people are finally able to tip the scales in their favor, demanding higher wages and better benefits from their employers. The President promised to rebuild America and expand Buy American—and he is delivering for the best workers in the world. American manufacturing is back, and the IAM and our allies in the labor movement are just getting started. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will create even more good jobs, while investing in our aging airports, public transit systems and more. But as the President said tonight, there is far more work to be done. As the Russian invasion of Ukraine makes even more clear, we must immediately strengthen our domestic supply chains, especially in the defense industry. We must take measures to lower consumer prices, broaden access to apprenticeship programs, create a national paid family and medical leave program, and protect our sacred right to vote. For the millions of Americans who want to join a union today, we also must pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. These should not be partisan issues. This is about a better life for working families. We stand with the Biden administration and all allies of working people to create a brighter future for the generations to come.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

LABOR: Eric Dean, President, Ironworkers: In his speech, President Biden did not shy away from the challenges and uncertainty that many Americans are living with. But his words remind us that America has overcome challenges before through unity and determination. The president highlighted his administration’s initiatives that meet the country’s challenges head-on and bring us together. The American Rescue Plan offered a lifeline to working people during the middle of the pandemic. The ARP kept state governments afloat and their infrastructure funds full, preserving and creating thousands of ironworker jobs. The Rescue Plan’s investments powered the recovery that has kept unemployment low all the way to today.The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a historic investment that will transform America’s transportation, water and energy systems for the better. The ongoing rollout promises good union jobs and opportunity for every community in America. The bipartisan majorities that passed the law in both houses of Congress are proof that we can still work together. President Biden emphasized his administration’s substantial focus on domestic manufacturing as an important tool to create jobs, secure supply chains and lower costs. Since Biden entered office, the Iron Workers have seen an explosion of investment in factories for semiconductors, electric vehicles and other manufactured goods. The administration’s policies will foster and expand this manufacturing renaissance. The Iron Workers support these and other policies to help working-class Americans and will continue to work with the administration to help them succeed. This is an opportunity to reflect on the past year’s achievements and plan to meet the challenges of the present. If we are united, as a union and as Americans, there is nothing we cannot accomplish.” [Statement, 3/2/22]

Latinos

Jacqueline Martinez Garcel, CEO, Latino Community Foundation: “Under the #AmericanRescuePlan, Latino families across this nation got their vaccines, received emergency rental assistance, and more importantly, saw hope on the horizon. Thank you @POTUS for signing this historic piece of legislation. #SOTU” [Tweet, 3/1/22]

Janet Murguía, CEO and President, UnidosUS: “After appropriately expressing our nation’s solidarity with the people of Ukraine, the president gave a forceful speech for his agenda in his State of the Union remarks. We applaud President Biden’s leadership and the accomplishments he highlighted that have helped Hispanics, and all Americans, weather the health and economic challenges brought on by the global pandemic, rebuild our infrastructure, and create jobs to move our communities toward a better and stronger future. We appreciate that the president also articulated his commitment to a stronger recovery, despite the obstacles and challenges in Congress. Latinos and our country cannot afford to return to the pre-pandemic status quo of entrenched social and economic disparities. Our nation’s 62 million Latinos need continuing support from the president and from Congress to improve the lives and futures of their children and families, including—among other things—the expanded Child Tax Credit, targeted mental health services, improved health care, nutrition services, quality education, affordable housing, and access to better jobs. And the Senate should heed the president’s call to immediately pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. Finally, we commend the president for making the moral and economic case for a path to citizenship for Dreamers, farmworkers, TPS holders, essential workers and many other immigrants who have stood up for America during the pandemic, which will only make America stronger. The vast majority of Americans agree. These workers play a key role in fueling our economic recovery, and legalizing immigrant workers with deep family and economic ties to the United States will reduce labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. The proof of the president’s commitment, though, will be in his actions following these remarks, including using his own executive authority to act on behalf of immigrant essential workers, should Congress fail to act.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Felipe Benitez, Executive Director of Corazón Latino: “Over the past year, Americans have overcome extraordinary challenges. However, with President Biden at the helm, we have begun to build a compelling future for our country through courage, resilience, and a shared vision for a better tomorrow. The Biden administration has spent much of the past year rebuilding the country alongside the American people. We have much more work to do to heal the damage wrought by the pandemic and the hate in our country. And, with Russia’s incursion into Ukraine, the president has his work cut out for him. Our hearts go out to the Ukrainian people.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Latino Forward: “Tonight Forward Latino applauds the message of unity and urgency shared by President Biden in tonight’s State of the Union Address. From defending freedom and democracy against dictators and autocrats around the world, to making sure every person and business has a fair opportunity to succeed and prosper, Forward Latino supports a number of the President’s stated priorities. We look forward to working with the President and Congressional leadership to: 1. Reform our broken immigration system and to provide a pathway for Dreamers, essential workers and TPS holders to adjust their status, helping accelerate U.S. innovation and competitiveness. 2. Approve workforce development and training programs so that all can rise into the middle class and beyond. 3. Make sure lifesaving medicines are affordable for all and not just some as good health should not come at a price Americans cannot afford. 4. Implement commonsense gun violence prevention solutions and community-oriented policing strategies to improve safety in our streets and in our homes across urban and rural America. 5. Pass voting rights protection legislation to ensure that every eligible voter can vote and that every vote counts. Lastly, Forward Latino supports the courageous people of Ukraine who remind us what it truly means to fight for freedom. Glory to Ukraine, and Glory to its Heroes.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Frankie Miranda, President and CEO, Hispanic Federation: “Hispanic Federation applauds President Biden’s accomplishments in his first year as President. We recognize that he is leading the nation through one of the most challenging foreign and domestic policy moments in decades. In the last year, his accomplishments have been significant. More American jobs have been created in one year than at any time in U.S. history. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is rebuilding America’s roads, bridges, and rails and increasing access to clean drinking water and high-speed internet. The American Rescue Plan provided pandemic and economic relief by lowering taxes on the middle class and expanding social infrastructures through programs like the expanded Child Tax Credit, Unemployment Insurance, and SNAP. The Biden administration also began unraveling the destructive Trump-era laws targeting immigrants and refugees and rebuilding America’s reputation abroad. Most recently, the choice of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court, signals the continued priority of inclusiveness in his administration and his judicial nominees.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Arturo Vargas, CEO, National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO): “Over the past few years, the world has lived through a series of unprecedented historic events that have affected us globally, as a nation, as comunidades, and as individuals. Understandably, these events have brought us together in some ways but further divided us in others. Just when we were beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel on COVID-19, Russia started an unprovoked war in Ukraine. Tonight, as the president said, our hearts are with the Ukrainian people. While this war is being waged overseas, its fundamental implications for human rights and access to a fair and representative democracy ring close to home. During President Biden’s first year in office, NALEO was thrilled to see the instances where Republicans and Democrats came together to make life better for all Americans. We encourage the White House to continue its people-before-politics work, particularly in the areas of immigration reform and naturalization, voting rights, and continued COVID-19 health and safety precautions. Our leaders must put American values, the common good, and humanity before hubris, crafting legislation that extends beyond party lines. We commend the president for reiterating the critical importance of the right to vote and the invaluable contributions that immigrants make to our society — from our economy to our global status as a nation that advances liberty and justice for all.” [Statement, 3/1/22]

Update 3:55 p.m. EST March 3: French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin “refuses to stop his attacks on Ukraine at this point” after speaking with the Russian leader earlier in the day.

“We must avoid the worst,” he wrote.

Maintaining dialogue to protect the people, obtaining measures that will avoid human tragedy, putting an end to this war: this is the purpose of my commitment alongside President Zelensky and the international community.

Since the beginning of what Russian President Vladimir Putin has called ""a special military operation"", Russian and Belarusian teams and athletes have been frozen out of international events by many sporting bodies.

Belarus has been a key staging area for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""I'm proud of the world's unity and seeing sporting communities standing together - the International Olympic Committee, boxing federations, UEFA, FIFA, Formula One,"" Wladimir Klitschko told Sky Sports.

""Ban Russian teams from participating. I have nothing against the athletes but they are presenting the regime and in some way the connection with this war,"" Klitschko said.

""It's never enough until the war is going to be stopped but it's important to show the world is not okay with this war, that the sporting world is not okay with it.""

Leaders of the Quad grouping of countries - the United States, India, Australia and Japan - agreed on Thursday that what is happening to Ukraine should not be allowed to happen in the Indo-Pacific, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said.

A virtual meeting of the four-country grouping was held at a time of increased concern about Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by China, which has stepped up its alert level, wary of China taking advantage of a distracted West to move against it.

""We've agreed that unilateral changes to the status quo with force like this should not be allowed in the Indo-Pacific region,"" Kishida said, referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""We've also agreed this development makes it even more important to work toward realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" Kishida told reporters after the meeting with US President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

A joint statement issued after the call by the White House said the Quad leaders met to ""reaffirm their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, in which the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states is respected and countries are free from military, economic, and political coercion"".

It said they also ""reaffirmed their dedication to the Quad as a mechanism to promote regional stability and prosperity"".

unacceptable in the Indo-Pacific region. It is critically important for us to bring about a free and open Indo-Pacific. We agreed we will work in close cooperation to ensure the success of our next face-to-face Quad summit, which will be held in Tokyo in the coming months. (2/2) — PM's Office of Japan (@JPN_PMO) March 3, 2022

The statement made no specific mention of Taiwan, but said the leaders discussed the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.

""They agreed to stand up a new humanitarian assistance and disaster relief mechanism which will enable the Quad to meet future humanitarian challenges in the Indo-Pacific and provide a channel for communication as they each address and respond to the crisis in Ukraine,"" it said.

Biden tweeted that the meeting with the Quad leaders covered ""our commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity around the world, including in the Indo-Pacific.""

White House coordinator for Indo-Pacific, Kurt Campbell, said on Monday the United States would keep its focus on the Indo-Pacific despite the Ukraine crisis, although this would be difficult and expensive. He said Washington had been deeply engaged in two theatres simultaneously before, including during World War II and the Cold War.

The US sees the Quad and its growing relations with India as essential to its efforts to push back against China in the Pacific, but it is in a delicate balancing act with New Delhi, given the latter's long-standing ties with Russia.

Of the four Quad countries, only India has not condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia is the main supplier of arms to the Indian military and India faces the possibility of US sanctions for its purchase of the Russian S-400 air defence system.

Participated in a productive virtual Quad Leaders’ meeting today with @POTUS @JoeBiden, PM @ScottMorrisonMP and @JPN_PMO Kishida. Reaffirmed our shared commitment to ensuring security, safety and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 3, 2022

Analysts say any moves by Russian hawks in the Biden administration to impose sanctions on India for working with Moscow could backfire and set back cooperation in the Quad.

US assistant secretary of state for South Asia, Donald Lu, told a Senate subcommittee hearing on Wednesday that the US has been fighting a ""pitched battle"" with India in diplomatic channels to urge it to take a clear position opposed to Russian actions in Ukraine.

He also said it was looking ""very closely"" at whether to apply sanctions on India over its Russian arms deals under the Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), or to waive those.

Campbell said on Monday Washington remained ""bullish"" about its relationship with India.

""We have a deep dialogue with them on issues underway now,"" he told a Washington think tank.

""We understand ... India's historic, long-standing relationship with Russia, but at the same time, ultimately, we believe that India will be moving in our direction.""

India's foreign ministry said before Thursday's meeting that it would follow a September summit of the Quad leaders in Washington and they would ""exchange views and assessments about important developments in the Indo-Pacific.""

It was not immediately clear on whose request the meeting was called. None of the Quad countries had flagged it earlier.

Quad foreign ministers met in Australia early last month and pledged to deepen cooperation to ensure the Indo-Pacific region was free from ""coercion,"" a veiled reference to China's economic and military activities, and their leaders are set to hold a summit in Japan in May.
