People walking through a park forced to rush to safety as shells explode around them.

These were some of the attacks that residents of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, endured in recent days as Russian forces targeted residential areas, hitting civilian infrastructure such as schools, shops, hospitals, apartment blocks and churches.

CNN has geolocated and verified 13 incidents involving civilians over the past three days, as attacks intensified on Kharkiv, a city of about 1.5 million people. following Ukraine's resistance.

Most of the attacks took place in the northeastern part of Kharkiv in the residential area of Saltivka. But other districts in the northwest, southeast and southwest of the city were also affected. The city's Freedom Square, the center of public life in Kharkiv, was hit with was believed to be a cruise missile, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister said.

In 24 hours, 34 civilians were killed and 285 injured -- including 10 children -- in the Kharkiv region, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service said on Thursday morning.

As the Kharkiv offensive ramped up, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague announced on Wednesday that he had launched an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referred to Russia's relentless bombardment of Kharkiv, including the deliberate targeting of residential areas with ""jet artillery,"" as a ""war crime"" in a late-night address on Monday.

CNN has analyzed and verified digital evidence, including videos and photos, of several indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv.

Three schools hit by shelling in one day

A giant hole is seen at School #17 in Kharkiv's Saltivka neighborhood after a Russian military strike on Tuesday.

At least three schools in Kharkiv were hit by Russian military strikes on Tuesday, according to videos and photos posted to social media.

In one clip, a school in the northern Saltivka neighborhood is pictured with a gaping hole in the wall, rubble and broken glass strewn across the courtyard.

""School number 17 of Kharkiv city,"" someone can be heard saying in the video. ""It flew right here, everything is in ruins, everything is fallen out, shell fragments everywhere, everything is in smoke.""

The other two schools hit in shelling were just over a kilometer (around 0.6 miles) apart, in an industrial district in Kharkiv's southeastern area.

Schools have not been in session since the Russian invasion began.

Other schools were indirectly affected during the bombing of the center of Kharkiv on Tuesday. Viktor Kruglov, the founder of Ranok, a private school, said they managed to evacuate about 54 orphans from a boarding school for blind and visually impaired children just 15 minutes before the explosion.

However, 65 people are still holed up in the basement of the school -- with no electricity or water due to the shelling. They're relying on food and water brought by volunteers, according to Valentyna Butenko, head of the non-governmental organization ""Right to Choose"" (Pravo Vyboru).

The school is located 300 meters (approximately 985 feet) from the epicenter of the explosion in Freedom Square.

Apartment blocks directly hit

First responders fight a fire at an apartment complex hit by Russian military strikes in Kharkiv on Tuesday.

On Tuesday, two apartment buildings were directly hit, just outside City Kharkiv municipal hospital No 3. The strikes also hit an office building.

In one video, a fire rages at a damaged apartment complex just across the street from the hospital.

""The building is gone,"" someone in the video says.

Another video shows children and family fleeing the apartment complex, and at least two bodies on the ground.

""...animals, simply animals,"" someone said, appearing to refer to those responsible for the military strikes. ""People were driving here.""

""A house,"" another person said, adding, ""Look at what they've done.""

CNN could not identify any military targets in the area.

Other footage from the Saltivka neighborhood, which was shared on local media, showed a row of shops in front of an apartment building destroyed by strikes. A nearby building was also seen on fire.

Security camera catches dramatic incident

Five residential neighborhoods of Kharkiv were hit on Monday, according to a CNN analysis.

What appeared to be surveillance-style footage of an apartment complex on Velyka Kil'tseva Street captured panicked residents rushing for safety as rockets exploded around them.

The intense shelling -- at least eight explosions are seen but there are more heard -- lasts for 20 seconds. As the munitions rain down, people are seen running away. One individual is seen falling to the ground as explosions dot the ground around. A parked car explodes after taking a direct hit. After the hail of strikes stop, the individual that fell appears to crawl away, but then stops moving. Their condition is unknown to CNN.

Apartment complexes on Klochkivska Street in northwestern Kharkiv, and on Vasylia Stusa Street in eastern Kharkiv were also hit on Monday.

Multiple-launch rocket system attack near supermarket

The Saltivka neighborhood was also hit by a multiple-launch rocket system, or MLRS, attack on Monday.

Videos geolocated by CNN show multiple rockets exploding closely together near the Equator supermarket, while shoppers scramble to safety.

One video shows a rocket booster lodged in the street pavement, as some people look at it.

A missile is seen lodged in the ground outside a small grocery store in Kharkiv on Monday.

According to the Kharkiv City Council, that shelling left one female civilian dead, and 31 wounded. The wounded are made up of 15 servicemen and 16 civilians, says the city council in a press statement. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers.

Dan Kaszeta, a defense specialist and an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank in London, said the images were consistent with a multiple rocket launch system attack.

""The appearance of at least one image of a rocket booster section lends credence to this having been a rocket attack,"" he said.

Commenting on that attack, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, said: ""Kharkiv has just been subjected to massive Grad shelling! Dozens of victims.""

He described the situation as ""a nightmare.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-civilian-strikes-intl-cmd/index.html

(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)

As Russia trends closer toward pariah status in many countries worldwide, it appears that it can still count on the support of a small group of countries in the West — Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela — and perhaps the burgeoning backing of another central American country.

The latest proof of such support came at Wednesday’s emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Bolivia joined several dozen other countries in abstaining during a vote to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and to demand Moscow withdraw its troops “immediately, completely and unconditionally.”

While Venezuela could not formally vote at the session because it has not paid its dues to the UN for several years, it almost assuredly would have voted against the resolution or abstained if given the chance.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week and has said multiple times that Putin has his “total support.” After the phone call, Maduro tweeted an old photo of himself and Putin shaking hands, and has blamed the conflict on “destabilizing actions of NATO.”

While the countries did not vote against the resolution, the abstention votes were notable. It meant each country chose not to declare illegal — and immoral — an invasion that the vast majority of the rest of the world agrees is a flagrant violation of international norms and laws.

Cuba and Nicaragua are long-time allies of Russias, with the bond between Cuba and Russia going back decades. Cuba’s government has blamed the current conflict on the United States and NATO’s “increasingly offensive military doctrine that threatens peace.”

Meanwhile, Nicaragua was one of the first countries in the world to formally recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine — two pro-Russian areas that Russia formally recognized shortly before it invaded Ukraine.

El Salvador’s abstention was telling, as well, mirroring the silence from the country’s leadership about the conflict since it began.

The country’s president, Nayib Bukele, was extremely vocal in the days leading up to Russia’s invasion, mocking US assertions that an invasion was imminent.

“The boy who cried wolf,” Bukele tweeted on Feb. 18, responding to US President Joe Biden, who said he believed Russia would invade in the next several days.

Since Russia has invaded, however, Bukele has remained silent on the matter.

Meanwhile, Latin America’s heavyweights, including Mexico and Brazil, have drawn fire from critics who have accused the two countries of giving Russia a free pass.

Although both countries’ UN delegations voted in favor to condemn Russian invasion and for a military withdrawal, Mexican President López Obrador and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro have stopped short of criticizing Putin or imposing any sanctions.

“We’re not going to take any kind of economic reprisal because we want to have good relations with all the governments in the world,” said López Obrador. “We do not consider that [the war] concerns us, and we think that the best thing is to promote dialogue to achieve peace.”

Bolsonaro, who visited Moscow a few weeks ago, has said that his country was, “not going to take sides.”

“We are going to continue to be neutral and help however possible to find a solution,” said the president currently up for reelection later this year.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-02-22/h_1418c6e0078e2fa51d27412f27294b2a

On February 28, 2022, Russia indiscriminately shelled Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, in an attack that claimed at least eleven civilian lives, wounding many more, and destroying homes. This incident was not isolated; as previously reported by the Digital Forensic Research Lab, Russia has shelled the city since the beginning of the war.

Compared to attacks during previous days, though, the February 28 attack was significantly more violent and brazen in its targeting of highly populated civilian population areas. The DFRLab analyzed and geolocated available imagery of the attack, identifying three main neighborhoods affected by shelling. While other areas were also affected, the Saltivka, 6th Mikrorayon, and Horizont neighborhoods appeared the worst hit.

The DFRLab is mapping out areas of Kharkiv hit by artillery on Google Maps.

Geolocations

At 10:42 a.m. local time on February 28 in the eastern Kharkiv suburb of Horizont, a security camera at 128 Velika Kiltseva Street captured the moment when several explosions went off in rapid succession in the building’s adjacent parking lot and nearby pedestrian path.

At least four pedestrians were visible on the footpath behind the parking lot, all appearing to have sustained injury from the nearby explosions. In another video shot in Horizont, a dead body can be seen lying on the ground behind a Velmart supermarket, two hundred meters away from the security camera footage.

Horizont suffered at least two rounds of shelling, eventually causing serious damage to buildings in the southwestern part of the neighborhood.

Along August 23rd Street near school number 135, in the district known as the 6th Mikrorayon, one of the grimmest scenes of the war up until then unfolded. In one spot, four people laid dead at a drinking water dispenser. By referencing Google Street View imagery, the DFRLab was able to pinpoint the location of the footage to where Ozerniy Pereulok meets August 23rd Street.

As with the attack on Horizont, the shelling of the 6th Mikrorayon affected a large area, destroying cars and damaging homes in addition to the human toll.

In the northern residential neighborhood of Saltivka, shelling hit a large garage area bordering on Buchmy Street. Given the large area that rocket artillery covers, nearby homes were also damaged. Dashcam footage and residents of the area captured the attack as it unfolded.

In other parts of Kharkiv, boosters the size of telephone poles from BM-30 300mm multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) rained over the city, along with parts used to hold submunitions, also known as cluster bombs. Submunitions from BM-30 Smerch rockets were likely to blame for the carnage.

Following the debris patterns from Kharkiv city back into the Russian-Ukrainian border area, several potential burn marks were visible in Planet Labs imagery from February 27. In the above graphic, each number by the yellow pins on the right corresponds to the amount of burn marks identified at each site. Other tracks in the snow indicated likely howitzer firing positions, but these were far outnumbered by rocket launch sites.

While these may not all be rocket artillery launch sites, some of them verifiably are, since Planet Labs imagery showed an MLRS launch site where the smoke plume from recently fired rockets was still visible. The effects of the wind on the smoke cloud made it difficult to track the exact destination of the rockets, but it appeared to point in the general direction of Kharkiv.

Quote: ""The night was hard and the day isn’t any easier. We are under constant shelling. We are being shelled, residential areas of the city are being shelled. Northern Saltivka, the Industrial Quarter and the Kharkiv Tractor Plan District are under fire.

The situation is very difficult. I have asked people to hide in bomb shelters, basements and subway stations. We are organising food supplies and distributing food, medicine and basic necessities.

Today it snowed in Kharkiv. We expect a significant drop in temperature, and we are very worried. All the windows in the houses are broken, and it is impossible to repair them now. Where possible, our utility companies are stretching cling film over the window frames.""

Details: Despite everything, all utilities in the city are working, the mayor said: ""We are working. We are supplying heat and water to people’s homes. We are taking away garbage and cleaning the streets.""

Terekhov said that the evacuation of civilians is now possible: people can travel by car and the railway is providing trains.

He is confident that ""Kharkiv will definitely win.""

However, the city now needs so-called ""green corridors"" to receive humanitarian aid.

Terekhov said: ""Today we have a lot of humanitarian aid. All the cities of Ukraine, all the mayors are collecting aid and sending it to Kharkiv.

In addition, I have appealed to the mayors of foreign cities and cities twinned with Kharkiv. We are in touch with everyone. We are waiting for significant deliveries from Poland, Italy, and Israel. We have serious support. But humanitarian corridors are needed for the unhindered transport of goods.""",https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2022/03/4/7328205/
