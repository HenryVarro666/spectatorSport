""Russia is committing genocide of Ukrainians, killing thousands of civilians, while the Israeli Government inspects each and every refugee from Ukraine with a fine-toothed comb,"" the Ukrainian Embassy in Israel posted in a statement on Facebook. ""We urge those who takes decision to cancel policy of quotas and other artificial obstacles towards women and children fleeing war-torn Ukraine.

Israeli officials have defended their policy. Israeli Population and Immigration Authority Director Tomer Moskowitz told Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper ""[T]he world is full of trouble. Terrible things happen all the time, and I’m not being cynical. But does that mean that we have to take in people indiscriminately? I am the guard at the country’s gate and I can’t open it to everyone.”

Under Israel's ""Law of Return,"" any Jew, or anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent, is eligible for Israeli citizenship along with their families. There is no limit to the number of Ukrainians who can enter under the ""Law of Return,"" and Israeli officials say they are preparing for a wave of up to 100,000 Ukrainian and Russian citizens eligible to enter the country.

Israeli citizens are also eligible to apply for entry permits for their non-Jewish Ukrainian family members with no quota.

Aside from those two groups, Israel has instituted a 5,000 person quota of Ukrainians without family connection but must apply for permission first.

Refugee family members of Israeli citizens and those with no connections will initially be issued three-month tourist visas, which may be changed to work permits if the war lasts longer.

The Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk told CNN that on Wednesday night 12 Ukrainian citizens were turned away at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport and sent back to Poland for not having entry permits.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak wrote in a Facebook post that “The recent decisions of the Israeli leadership aimed at restricting the admission of Ukrainians, to put it mildly, are surprising. We consider the suspension of visa-free travel and the introduction of the system of electronic permits of the [Interior Ministry] to enter Israel to be an unfriendly step for the citizens of Ukraine, which needs to be corrected immediately.”

The Ukrainian Embassy in Israel wrote on Facebook that they've asked Israeli authorities to allow Ukrainians with Israeli relatives to invite them in without prior approval, and an alternate mechanism that will allow Ukrainians with friends in Israel who can host them to enter as well.

Source: Ukrainian State Emergency Service update at 07:00

Details: Different parts of the market caught on fire on 17 March in the wake of the shelling. Around 14:00, emergency and rescue services received the first reports of the fire. The Ukrainian State Emergency Service currently has 21 fire appliances and around 100 personnel deployed at the scene.

Trading pavilions are still on fire, and two residential buildings have been damaged.

The emergency services are directing all their efforts towards containing the fire and preventing its spread to the residential area and other facilities. In total, more than 10 residential buildings have been saved.

As the firefighters worked on the scene, the Russian troops fired again, inflicting numerous shrapnel wounds on two emergency service workers. They were immediately hospitalised. One of these emergency service workers died in hospital.

At 17:30, the fire caused by the shelling of a school in the town of Merefa, in the Kharkiv region, was extinguished.

Over the course of the day, emergency service personnel attended 42 fires and worked to clear the rubble of collapsed buildings.

Search and rescue operations and debris removal also took place in the Kyivsky, Shevchenkivsky, and Nemyshlyansky neighbourhoods of Kharkiv, and in the Kharkiv district of the region.

State Emergency Service units attended fires throughout the day at high-rise apartment buildings and private houses, commercial and other facilities. Fires broke out in the Shevchenkivsky, Kyivsky, Nemyshlyansky, and Moscovsky neighbourhoods of Kharkiv, as well as in the Kharkiv and the Izium districts of the region.

Russia denied striking the theater. But Ukraine's capital Kyiv came under renewed Russian shelling on Thursday as the war entered its fourth week. Western sources and Ukrainian officials said Russia's assault had stalled.

Officials from both sides meanwhile met again for peace talks, but they said their positions remained far apart.

Mariupol, a southern port city, has suffered the worst humanitarian catastrophe of the war, with hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in basements with no food, water or power as Russian forces pound it with artillery fire and airstrikes.

City authorities said they were still not able to estimate the number of possible casualties from Wednesday's alleged airstrike on the theater.

""Yesterday and today, despite continuous shelling, rubble is being cleared as much as is possible and people are being rescued. Information about victims is still being clarified,"" the city council said in a statement. It provided no figures on the numbers rescued.

Commercial satellite pictures showed the word ""children"" had been marked out on the ground in front of the building before it was hit.

Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the allegation that Russia had bombed the theater was a ""lie"".

""Russia's armed forces don't bomb towns and cities,"" she told a briefing.

Mariupol city council later said more than 350,000 people were still sheltering in the city and 30,000 had left.

The assault on Ukraine started with troops crossing the border or landing by sea and air on Feb. 24. But Western countries say their expectations of a swift victory and the removal of President Volodymyr Zelensky's government have been dashed and its invasion force has got bogged down.

The Ukrainian armed forces said on Thursday Russian forces had ""lost their offensive potential and were stopped in all directions"".

""The enemy has significant problems with logistics and continues to suffer losses,"" it said.

Sides far apart

The war has settled into a grinding pattern of sieges of cities.

The United Nations human rights office in Geneva said it had recorded 2,032 civilian casualties so far - 780 killed and 1,252 injured. Some 3.2 million civilians, mostly women and children, have now fled Ukraine to neighboring countries, the United Nations said.

But the Russians have failed to capture a major city in the face of spirited resistance from Ukrainian forces.

A fourth straight day of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators took place by videolink, but the Kremlin said an agreement had yet to be reached.

""Our delegation is putting in colossal effort,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""Our delegation... is ready to work around the clock - but unfortunately we don't see such zeal from the Ukrainian side.""

Moscow has previously said it was close to agreeing to a formula that would keep Ukraine neutral, one of its demands.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the negotiations were complicated.

""The positions of the parties are different. For us, fundamental issues are inviolable,"" he said.

Ukraine has said it is willing to negotiate an end to the war but will not surrender or accept Russian ultimatums. It is sticking to its core position that it retains sovereignty over areas occupied since 2014 by Russian and pro-Russian forces.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown little sign of relenting, even though punitive Western sanctions are damaging his country's economy.

Kyiv and its Western allies say Russia launched the war to subjugate a neighbor Putin calls an artificial state. Moscow says it is carrying out a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine.

The White House said U.S. President Joe Biden would hold a call on Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as Washington tries to persuade Beijing not to provide support to Russia.

""And now we see that these words are simply worthless. In Europe a people is being destroyed, they are trying to destroy everything that is dear to us, what we live for.""

Bloody sheet

Northeastern and northwestern suburbs of Kyiv have suffered heavy damage but the capital itself has held firm, under a curfew and subjected to deadly nightly rocket attacks.

Ukrainian defense ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Russian forces had made no significant advances around Kyiv in the past 24-48 hours and had resorted to ""chaotic"" shelling.

4,5454d56f-3b9e-42f3-946e-dbbb28c0e086,[],,"The United States says that Ukraine will be given long-range missile defense and Switchblade armed drones, enabling Kyiv’s forces to better defend against Russian aircraft and armor from a distance.

The new arms and equipment that US President Biden announced for Ukraine include:

S-300 long-range missile defense

Ukraine has had the ability to shoot down Russian aircraft and cruise missiles at relatively close quarters. Washington is arranging for it to acquire systems that can strike attacking aircraft from much farther away.

According to a military source, the systems are the Soviet/Russian-made S-300, which like the US-made Patriot system, is a fully automated, ground-based radar-and-missile launcher unit that can detect, track and fire at multiple incoming aerial threats at long distances.

Ukrainians already know how to operate the S-300, and the United States and a number of NATO countries possess the systems or components of them to supply Ukraine.

‘Kamikaze drones’

Washington will send Ukraine 100 Switchblade drones, essentially camera-equipped, remote-controlled flying bombs that can be directed by an operator to find and then, when ready, plunge onto a target, exploding on contact.

Dubbed “kamikaze drones,” Switchblades can extend the range of attack on Russian vehicles and units to beyond the sight of the user. That gives them an advantage over the guided heat-seeking missiles that Ukrainians have used against Russian tanks.

Anti-aircraft Stingers

The United States is also giving 800 more Stingers, which are shoulder-mounted infrared anti-aircraft missiles. The US provided Stingers to Afghan fighters in the 1990s to shoot down Russian helicopters; Ukrainians have used them effectively against Russian helicopters and slower, lower-flying fixed-wing attack aircraft.

‘Saint Javelin’

Western allies have already provided the Ukrainian army with some 17,000 lightweight, shoulder-launched, self-guided missiles which have become the weapon of choice in the ground war. These are being used with great effect to destroy armored vehicles at close quarters.

Among those, the US-made Javelin, with dual charges designed to defeat Russian tanks’ anti-missile defenses, has become legendary in its effectiveness. A popular Ukrainian song extols it and there is now even a viral depiction of “Saint Javelin,” an Eastern iconography-style image of a woman cradling the weapon. Biden said Washington will send 2,000 more javelin missiles to Ukraine.

Guns, ammunition, body armor

The new US arms provisions also include 7,000 other anti-armor weapons, thousands of machine guns, rifles, and grenade launchers, 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition fitting both Russian and NATO standards, and 25,000 sets of body armor and helmets.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-17-2022/

These are the key events so far on Friday, March 18. Get the latest updates here.

Fighting

At least three explosions have been heard in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv this morning. Mayor Andriy Sadovyi says Russian missiles have struck an area near the airport.

The invasion has largely stalled on all fronts in recent days amid heavy losses, British military intelligence and the Ukrainian armed forces say.

Authorities in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol say Russian forces are dropping 50-100 bombs on the city daily, causing “enormous destruction”.

Russian shelling has caused a fire at Kharkiv’s Barabashovo market, among the largest in Eastern Europe, Ukraine’s public broadcaster, Suspilne, says.

Civilian toll

More than 350,000 people are sheltering in Mariupol, officials says.

Rescuers are combing the rubble of a theatre in the city that was bombed on Wednesday for survivors. Russia denies striking it. Italy says it will rebuild it.

The governor of the northern Chernihiv region says 53 civilians had been killed in the past 24 hours. The dead included a United States citizen as he waited in a bread line, according to his family. Russia denies targeting civilians.

The United Nations says it has recorded 780 confirmed civilian deaths since the invasion began, and 3.2 million people have fled. The World Health Organization says it has verified 43 attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine that have killed 12 people and injured dozens more, including health workers.

Diplomacy

A “very, very big gap” remains between Ukraine and Russia, Western officials say after another day of peace talks.

Russian President Vladimir Putin shows little desire to compromise, they added, while Ukraine wants to retain sovereignty over areas occupied since 2014 by Russia and pro-Russian forces.

Russia has accused the US of stoking “Russophobia” and says it has the power to put its “brash enemies into place”.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has asked Turkey to be a guarantor of any future deal with Russia, along with the UN Security Council’s five permanent members and Germany, Ankara’s top diplomat says.

Sanctions

Japan and Australia have imposed new sanctions on Russian entities as punishment for the invasion of Ukraine.

Washington says US President Joe Biden will warn his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in talks on Friday of the “costs” if Beijing helps Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. The two leaders are scheduled to talk at 13:00 GMT, their first summit since a video call in November.

A Russian-European mission to land a rover on Mars has been suspended due to the sanctions over the invasion and its “tragic consequences”, the European Space Agency says.

Economy and markets

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates the war could knock more than one percentage point off global growth this year.

Some creditors have received payment of Russian bond coupons which fell due this week, market sources say, meaning Russia may for now have averted a debt default.

Germany-based Scope Ratings becomes the first ratings agency in the European Union to withdraw its Russian sovereign credit score after a move by the bloc to ban their provision. S&P, meanwhile, has lowered Russia’s rating.

Seven thousand Russian soldiers killed, according to U.S. and British estimates. Four generals among them. Large numbers of Russian tanks and other planes destroyed. A few planes shot down.

More than 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers killed and more than 700 civilians killed — but that is without question an undercount as it does not include the battered cities of Kharkiv and Mariupol in eastern Ukraine.

Devastation, particularly in the south and east. One city — Kherson — captured by the Russians. Several other cities surrounded, supplies of food and water running low. The capital, Kyiv, increasingly a city under siege — but still functioning.

More than 3 million refugees.

A steady flow of heavy weaponry pouring into Ukraine from NATO and other Western nations.

One president — the one who ordered the invasion — in that large room at the Kremlin, increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. Another working from a bunker — taking occasionally to the streets of Kyiv, sending selfies and video messages to the world and speaking regularly to the world’s parliaments and other seats of power.

Thursday’s photos capture some of these stories. But we begin with a view from the air. Of a theater in Mariupol that was housing more than 1,000 civilians — many of them children. The locals had written “CHILDREN” in large block letters on either side of the theater, in Russian and Ukrainian both. The Russians bombed it anyway. As we write, there are reports of survivors emerging from the shelter beneath the theater. It is not clear how many people died.
