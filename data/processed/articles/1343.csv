3,97494ffe-5396-4eab-8615-8b386310154b,[],,"PARIS, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- Due to the closure of European Union airspace to Russia, French Foreign Affairs Ministry asked on Sunday its nationals to leave immediately Russia.

""Due to the increasing restrictions on air traffic between Russia and Europe, it is strongly recommended that non-resident French nationals in Russia make arrangements to leave the country without delay by existing air links,"" the French ministry said in the latest travelling notice.

According to the ministry, most European companies, including Air France, have suspended from this Sunday evening flights in and out of Russia after the European Union has decided to close its airspace to Russia.

In a second travelling notice concerning Belarus, the ministry also asked its nationals to leave immediately Belarus though land borders.

""The French in Belarus are invited to leave the country without delay by road, via the border crossing points with Lithuania, Poland or Latvia,"" it said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Sunday that the EU would shut its airspace to Russian airlines in response to Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine since early Thursday. ■",http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/europe/20220228/50b788785cc64393a1bbf91faa8fd427/c.html

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, has been the target of frequent Russian military strikes since the invasion began early Thursday morning. Now it's the site of intense street battles as the Russian military attempts to win control of the city.

One sequence of videos uploaded to social media show an attempt by a Russian unit to advance towards an important airfield and arms factory in the northeast of Kharkiv. The airfield at the Kharkiv State Aircraft Manufacturing Company is small — just a single runway — but might be a useful bridgehead for the Russians.

CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the videos.

The first video, taken by a resident, shows a convoy of Russian troops surrounding military vehicles, creeping along a roadway that ends near the airfield.

""There are two [military vehicles] as far as I can see,"" someone says in the video. ""A third one is crawling through with infantry who are wielding automatic rifles.""

Suddenly, gunfire is heard and seen.

A Russian soldier is seen quickly kneeling and firing a shoulder-fired rocket towards the area where the gunfire appears to be coming from.

A second video, taken after the firefight, shows the military vehicles driving in reverse in an apparent retreat. The Russian troops are seen huddled behind their vehicles.

A Reuters journalist was at the location after the firefight and took video that showed one of the Russian military convoy vehicles abandoned and a significant amount of blood staining the snow on the ground. The Reuters journalist spoke with a resident, identified as Yevgeniy, who told them that at least one Russian soldier was killed.

""After we've killed this one, the others run away,"" Yevgeniy told Reuters, pointing to a bloody stain in the snow. ""They were some 12-15 people. That's it...They won't take Kharkiv. They have run back to where they came from. They don't have good navigation you see. Nothing works for them. They came and were hiding behind the houses,"" Yevgeniy said.

Their efforts to retreat appear to have been stopped by another attack. A convoy of vehicles — the same type — is seen on fire in another video.

""And that's how we meet the b**** Russian army,"" someone is heard shouting in the video. ""That's how it's going to be for each of them who come to our Kharkiv land.""

It's not possible to be absolutely sure that the Russian trucks on fire are the same as those trying to reach the airport, but they are in the same location, are the same type, and bear the same markings.

Another video taken at the site of the abandoned military convoy — the vehicles are no longer on fire — shows Ukrainian troops engaging.

""Give it all to them,"" a voice yells repeatedly in the video.

Amid the firefight, a Ukrainian soldier steps out from the wall and is seen firing a shoulder-fired rocket.

Later, another video shows Ukrainian troops around the convoy, appearing to rummage through the abandoned vehicles. Sporadic gunfire is heard and some Ukrainian forces move along a wall in the background.

""Slava Ukraini,"" someone says in the video — ""Glory to Ukraine.""

""That's how we meet Russian world,"" another person said. ""This will be the same with everyone who will come to stomp on our Kharkiv's lands! There you go with your Russian-Russian letters 'Z!' Everyone will get the same.""",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-27-22/h_9e1647363f6d7ea4b911ec15e5cb20e0

We also condemn the involvement of Belarus in this aggression against Ukraine and call on Minsk to abide by its international obligations.

Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is the most serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades. We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction caused by Russia’s actions.

We demand Russian authorities to cease military operations immediately and unconditionally withdraw all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine.

We reiterate our steadfast support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.

We welcome the swift, united and determined reaction of the European Union and all its Member States through the adoption of new and wide-ranging restrictive measures. These unprecedented sanctions, coordinated with our partners and allies, commensurate with the scale of the violations of international law and the founding principles of European security, will have profound and long-lasting consequences for Russia.

Poland, France and Germany welcomed unity and trust demonstrated by the Transatlantic community in the past weeks in seeking a diplomatic outcome. Our countries, together with other Allies, stand united to defend one another in accordance with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Poland, France and Germany will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the security and defence of all Allies. We have taken measures to strengthen our contribution to deterrence and defense posture in the eastern part of the Alliance and are prepared to respond to any contingencies. Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.

We remain gravely concerned that Russian military aggression may endanger lives of Ukrainian people and our nationals who remain in Ukraine as well as the safety and security of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission’s personnel some of whom remain in Ukraine. We hold Russia responsible for their safety.

We acknowledge the European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine. We express our readiness to support Ukraine, its government and its people in this existentially difficult moment, be it financially, economically, by providing military equipment and in the humanitarian dimension, , as well as by sending strong political signals at all possible levels bilaterally and in international organizations. In this regard we commend the adoption on 27 of February by the Council of the European Union of a decisions establishing a €500 million assistance measures under the European Peace Facility in support of Ukraine that will contribute to strengthening the capabilities and resilience of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

We reaffirm the commitment of Poland, France and Germany to strengthening the political association and economic integration of Ukraine with the European Union and its internal market. We express our support for NATO’s open door policy as well as its political and practical cooperation with Ukraine in defense area in order to assist Ukraine in developing its capabilities and resilience. Our countries stand by the people of Ukraine and its democratically elected institutions and representatives.

France, Poland, and Germany, as countries currently playing the leading role respectively as the EU Presidency, OSCE Chairmanship, and G7 Presidency, share a special responsibility in maintaining peace, stability, and prosperity on the European continent. We underscore that diplomacy is still an appropriate way forward in the current security situation. We deplore Russia’s denial and rejection of all diplomatic efforts including in the OSCE. We re-affirm our position that the principles enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act and subsequent OSCE documents remain the fundament of the security architecture in Europe. In the OSCE area as elsewhere, nothing can justify resorting to armed violence and aggression against sovereign States to address geopolitical tensions.",https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/ukraine/news/article/ukraine-joint-declaration-by-the-ministers-for-foreign-affairs-of-france

Several governments have issued travel advisories recommending citizens depart Russia as international sanctions against the Kremlin for its recent invasion of Ukraine significantly reduce available transport options out of the country. Additionally, Russia's Federal Air Transportation Agency (Rosaviatsiya) announced the closure of Russian airspace to airlines operated by 36 countries including all European Union (EU) members, the UK, and Canada Feb. 28. Flights from these countries can only be conducted with a special permit issued by Rosaviatsiya or the Russian Foreign Ministry.

The US Embassy in Moscow advised its citizens to consider leaving Russia immediately using currently available commercial means Feb. 27. The French Ministry for Foreign Affairs recommended that French visitors to Russia and all French citizens in Belarus leave without delay Feb. 27. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs advised all citizens to leave Russia immediately Feb. 28. Several countries also advise against all nonessential travel to Russia as of Feb. 28 including the UK, Ireland, Germany, and several others. Further travel advisories are likely from additional governments are likely in the coming days.

Additionally, US authorities announced the suspension of operations at the embassy in Minsk and authorized the voluntary departure of non-emergency employees and family members working at the embassy in Moscow.

Russia's airspace ban is in response to several countries having previously banned Russian carriers from their own airspace as part of sanctions packages. The EU-imposed ban prohibits all Russian-owned, -registered, or -controlled aircraft, including private and charter flights, from landing in, taking off from, or transiting any EU nation. Airspace closures will lead to significant disruptions to air travel including scheduling changes and lengthier flight times as carriers are forced to change routes.

Aside from national airspace closures, a number of Western airlines have either partially or fully suspended services using Russian airspace. Air France (AF) has suspended services to and overflights via Russia until further notice. As a consequence, flights to and from China, South Korea, and Japan will be temporarily suspended. Lufthansa (LH), Wizz Air (W6), and KLM (KL) have also halted flights to Russia temporarily; British Airways (BA) has stopped its service to Moscow. US carrier Delta (DL) has suspended its code-share arrangement with Russian flag carrier Aeroflot (SU).

Aeroflot has canceled all of its flights serving Europe through at least late May; the measure also applies to flights operated by the company's subsidiary Rossiya Airlines (FV). S7 Airlines (S7) has taken similar steps, suspending all of its service to Europe until further notice as of Feb. 26. Additional Russian carriers will almost certainly be forced to cancel their European services over the coming days.

Further sanctions and countersanctions, including flight bans, are likely in the coming days.

Russian Domestic Air Restrictions

Russia has suspended commercial flight operations at several southern airports through at least March 2. Impacted airports include Rostov-on-Don Airport (RVI), Krasnodar International Airport (KRR), Anapa Airport (AAQ), Gelendzhik Airport (GDZ), Elista Airport (ESL), Stavropol Shpakovskoye Airport (STW), Belgorod International Airport (EGO), Bryansk International Airport (BZK), Oryol Yuzhny Airport (OEL), Kursk Vostochny Airport (URS), Voronezh International Airport (VOZ), and Simferopol International Airport (SIP).

European Air Travel Restrictions

Belarus has partially closed its airspace, including the southern Brest Region and areas south of Asipovichy and Krichev in the Mogilev Region. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has also issued a warning for Ukraine and surrounding regions, including an advisory to avoid using the airspace within 100 nautical miles (185 km/115 miles) of the Belarus-Ukraine and Russia-Ukraine borders. The full warning is available by clicking here. Moldova, on the other hand, has fully closed its airspace.



Heightened Security and General Disruptions

Several countries sharing borders with Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia have implemented heightened security measures. Multiple NATO members in the region have invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty. They could increase the readiness of their militaries as a result, though this is not an indication that they expect to become engaged in the conflict.

Moldova, Lithuania, and Slovakia have enacted states of emergency. Slovakia has suspended international rail services with Ukraine. Moldova, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland are all keeping their respective borders with Ukraine open and are making preparations to receive refugees; these countries are also likely to maintain heightened troop deployments near their borders with Ukraine over at least the short term. Enhanced security measures and a sharp increase in individuals attempting to leave Ukraine will likely result in border crossing delays.

Ukraine has closed its border checkpoints with Belarus, Russia, and the Transnistria region of Moldova to foreign nationals; Ukrainian citizens are permitted to return, however.



Sanctions

Authorities in the US, UK, and the EU have agreed to block certain Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial messaging system and impose sanctions on the Russian Central Bank. Authorities have not specified which banks will be affected by this decision; it also remains unclear as to when the decision will come into force.

The US Embassy in Russia issued a statement Feb. 26 noting that it had received multiple reports of non-Russian credit and debit cards being declined in Russia.

Potential sanctions and countersanctions could also limit the ability of some foreign nationals to operate in Russia and Belarus, and of Russian and Belarusian nationals to operate in Europe. Still, foreign nationals seeking to leave Russia or Belarus, or Russians and Belarusians seeking to leave European nations, are unlikely to face administrative obstacles although flight availability will be significantly reduced. Foreign diplomatic missions in Russia or Belarus could be forced to limit consular services if sanctions prompt expulsions or withdrawals of embassy and consulate staff. While there may be an elevated threat of arbitrary politically-motivated detentions until tensions ease, the likelihood of such actions remains low.

Generalized public fear over the potential impact of strong economic sanctions could prompt shortages of cash at ATMs as citizens attempt to withdraw large quantities of funds, as well as shortages of essential goods due to panic buying.

Anti-Western Sentiment

In the coming days, heightened anti-Western sentiment is possible in Russia and Belarus in reaction to the international response to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. While there is currently no increased direct security threat to Western or other foreign nationals in Russia or Belarus, isolated incidents of low-level harassment are possible. The frequency of such incidents could increase depending on the severity of any Western economic sanctions.

Advice

Confirm flight status with carriers; do not check out of accommodations until onward travel is confirmed. Avoid nonessential travel to affected border regions; defer travel to Ukraine. Exercise heightened vigilance at public gathering places in major urban areas. Heed authorities' instructions; remain calm and cooperative if questioned by law enforcement officers. Carry proper identification, including a passport with a current Russian or Belarusian visa if one is required. Prepare for disruption to card payments in Russia. Ensure alternative payment methods are available. Avoid all demonstrations as a routine security precaution and leave the area at the first sign of a confrontation. Refrain from discussing the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, or other politically sensitive topics.

France’s approach to Russia had always been a big part of the campaign – which, unlike previous campaigns, has prioritised foreign policy, creating a clear divide between candidates. After the escalating conflict forced all candidates to clarify their positions, they now unanimously condemn the invasion – albeit while disagreeing on who is responsible for it. Their initial declarations on the issue indicate how the debate may evolve in the coming weeks.

Nathalie Arthaud – Lutte ouvrière (far left)

Arthaud has condemned the invasion but said that the West has significant responsibility for what is happening in Ukraine. She has accused NATO, the United States, and Western powers generally of “surrounding Russia with military bases for 30 years”. She opposes economic sanctions on Russia and lethal military assistance for Ukraine.

Anne Hidalgo – Parti Socialiste (left)

Hidalgo, whose campaign seems to lack momentum, has tried to distance herself from the ambiguous attitudes towards Russian President Vladimir Putin of candidates such as Jean-Luc Mélenchon, Marine Le Pen, and Eric Zemmour. She called for greater European unity and efforts to reinforce Europe’s defence capabilities. Since the early stages of the crisis in Ukraine, she has put energy sovereignty at the centre of the debate.

Hidalgo has firmly condemned the Russian invasion, calling it an “unjustified and criminal act”. Addressing a rally in Bordeaux on 26 February that she dedicated to Ukraine, Hidalgo advocated massive sanctions on Russia that would also hit Putin directly, Russia’s removal from the SWIFT financial messaging system, and arms deliveries to Ukraine – an initiative that, she said, should accompany the reinforcement of Common Security and Defence Policy and the French presence in NATO.

Yannick Jadot – Europe Ecologie Les Verts (greens)

Before the invasion, Jadot advocated sanctions on the “corrupted Russian oligarchy” and a halt to Nord Stream 2. After the invasion, he also called for sanctions on Putin, Russia’s removal from SWIFT, and arms deliveries to Ukraine. He argues that Putin is a dictator who is fighting not against NATO but against democracy.

Jean Lassalle – Résistons! (centre-right)

While tensions were rising on the Ukrainian border, Lassalle said that neither France nor Europe had enough influence on Putin to change his behaviour, and that the US was leading the Western response to the crisis. Lassalle has condemned the Russian attack, calling it “a violation of international law” and asking for immediate de-escalation. He has reiterated his views that NATO and the US are “subjecting the European continent”. He asks for swift action at the United Nations to reach a ceasefire.

Marine Le Pen – Rassemblement National (far right)

Le Pen’s party has long had a special connection to Russia and Putin’s regime: in 2017 it received a Russian loan for its presidential campaign (which it failed to repay) and she met the Russian president in Moscow. At that time, other French parties were experiencing hacks and other forms of interference from the Russian regime. As the crisis intensified, Le Pen initially parroted Kremlin propaganda. But she has since condemned the Russian invasion, calling for a UN meeting on the crisis and urging neighbours of Ukraine such as Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia to help stop the conflict. She opposes any French direct military intervention in Ukraine, asking French leaders to continue on the diplomatic path – despite having criticised President Emmanuel Macron’s diplomatic efforts in the weeks leading up to the invasion.

After the escalating conflict forced all candidates to clarify their positions, they now unanimously condemn the invasion – albeit while disagreeing on who is responsible for it

Emmanuel Macron – La République en Marche (center-right)

In recent weeks, Macron has continued his diplomatic efforts. He has consulted with his European partners in an attempt to reinforce European sovereignty, and has maintained diplomatic channels with Putin.

Since the invasion, the soon-to-be-announced candidate for re-election has capitalised on his international profile by strongly condemning Russian military attacks in Ukraine. He has also spoken with Putin at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but, with the election approaching, will soon focus on domestic politics.

Jean-Luc Mélenchon – La France Insoumise (far left)

Mélenchon has long had an ambiguous position on Russia and its military interventions, notably in Syria in 2015. He has called for de-escalation of the crisis since early 2022 – but has also said that he understands why Russia would feel threatened by NATO moving closer to its border, and why this would result in an increase in the Russian military presence near Ukraine. While Mélenchon acknowledged that the invasion was entirely Russia’s responsibility, he warned against “annexing Ukraine into NATO”.

In a complete turnaround, Mélenchon condemned the invasion as a demonstration of “pure violence” and asked for France to call a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe – in the hope that this would create the conditions for a ceasefire and the start of negotiations. He also claimed that there was a need to organise a conference on border security. Having long engaged in anti-American rhetoric, Mélenchon calls on France to adopt a position of non-alignment.

Valérie Pécresse – Les Républicains (right)

Since the beginning of the crisis, Pécresse has condemned Putin’s actions and supported “really strong sanctions” on Russia. After the invasion, she called for a meeting of the UN Security Council to ask for a ceasefire. She also said that the European Union should plan how to provide humanitarian aid and defence equipment to Ukraine (as it subsequently has done).

On 27 February, she supported Zemmour’s proposition to appoint former president Nicolas Sarkozy as a “peace emissary”, building on his role in the crisis around the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008. (She did not credit the idea to Zemmour.)

Fabien Roussel – Parti Communiste Français (far left)

Roussel said that he wants a “diplomatic way out” of the conflict. He also proposed the seizure of Russian oligarchs’ houses in France as shelters for Ukrainian refugees. Roussel describes Putin as an “authoritarian, nationalist, the travel companion of the French far right” who should be treated with firmness. Roussel calls for a ceasefire in the conflict and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.

Eric Zemmour – Reconquête (far right)

Zemmour has always been heavily pro-Russia. He claims that Russia is a more reliable ally than Germany, the United Kingdom, or the US. He says that he dreams of a “French Putin”. Zemmour denied that Russia would invade Ukraine – until it did so – and argued that Putin’s claims were “fully legitimate”, claiming that he would lift all sanctions on Russia if he was president. While Zemmour condemned the invasion on 24 February, he also said that Putin has had a normal reaction to decades of humiliation by the US and the West – and that, “while Putin was guilty, NATO is responsible”. He is now advocating a peace treaty that would halt NATO’s expansion to the east. Zemmour argues that, if Ukraine had agreed not to join NATO, this would have prevented the invasion. As discussed, he recently sent a public letter to Macron asking for former president Sarkozy to act as a peace emissary.",https://ecfr.eu/article/how-russias-war-on-ukraine-is-shaping-the-french-presidential-race/
