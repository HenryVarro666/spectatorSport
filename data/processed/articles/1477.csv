Not intending to ban Russian seafood imports - media

TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Japan will impose sanctions on 15 Russian individuals and nine organisations, it said on Friday, among them defence officials and the state-owned arms exporter, Rosoboronexport.

The sanctions, which include the freezing of assets, are Japan's latest measures since Russia's invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24. They now cover 76 individuals, seven banks and 12 other bodies in Russia, the finance ministry said.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova and several makers of military equipment, such as United Aircraft Corp, which manufactures fighter jets, are among those sanctioned in Friday's measures.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will address Japan's parliament next week, said former minister Taro Kono, who now heads public relations for Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

Russia calls its action in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, who praised Japan's action as ""hitting at the heart of Russia's war machine"", has offered to host Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war in his residence until they find permanent housing in Japan.

Long refugee-shy, Japan is preparing to take in Ukrainian evacuees, with 47 having arrived since the outbreak of the war. read more

""We would like to do our part, too, by assisting the evacuees until they are able to move into more permanent housing,"" Ambassador Emanuel, the grandson of Ukrainian immigrants, said in a statement.

This week, a U.S. Air Force cargo jet flew to Ukraine helmets and other non-lethal military equipment donated by Japan. read more

A main U.S. security ally in Asia, Japan still has stakes in gas and oil projects in Russia's Sakhalin island, after energy majors Shell (SHEL.L) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) pulled out of them.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has given no clear indication of the fate of Japan's investment in the projects, underscoring both their importance for its energy security and his intention to keep step with G7 peers' sanctions against Russia.

The Russian ambassador to Japan has said it was logical to maintain ""mutually beneficial"" energy projects in Sakhalin. read more

Japan does also not intend to ban Russian seafood, the Jiji Press news agency said.

Seafood comprises 9% of Japan's total imports from Russia, on which it relies heavily for items such as sea urchin and frozen crab, the non-profit think tank Japan Forum on International Relations says.

Japan spots 4 Russian warfare ships sailing close to northern islands

The Japanese government, on Thursday, said that it had spotted four large Russian amphibious warfare ships sailing close to its islands as they travelled west, possibly towards Europe. According to the Russian news agency, TASS, the four Russian assault ships were seen through the Sangar Strait (Tsugaru Strait) between the Japanese Islands of Honshu and Hokkaido, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno stated.

LONDON: A British journalist captured by Daesh, John Cantlie, used his final letter to beg Western governments to pay a $100 million ransom for his release from captivity in Syria.

Cantlie told his family that he feared execution if it was not paid, telling loved ones that Britian and the US were “the most hated” by the terror group.

The letter has been released by US prosecutors following the conviction on Thursday of El Shafee Elsheikh, the final member of the so-called “Beatles” group to face justice or be killed on the battlefield. Cantlie was a known held by the group, made up of British terrorists in Syria.

Cantlie wrote: “The amount is extremely high, but it is the only way the rest of us here will ever be released. If the money is not found we will remain prisoners here until we die, either by natural causes or executions.”

His note was smuggled to his London-based girlfriend by Federico Motka, an Italian aid worker who was released by the Beatles in May 2014 just weeks before they started beheading hostages on camera.

The letter is part of a trove of evidence exposing the evil of the group, with images of tiny cells, chains, shackles and weapons.

Cantlie was moved regularly, being held in at least eight different prisons held by Daesh terrorists. One was nicknamed “the box,” another “the dungeon.”

Unlike British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines, who were decapitated by Mohammed Emwazi, also known as Jihadi John, Cantlie was not executed on camera, and was last seen in December 2016 in Mosul, Iraq.

In April 2014, Didier François and three other French journalists under Daesh capture, were set to be released after the French governments appeared to pay a ransom.

Cantlie attempted to smuggle a letter to his girlfriend Charlie and family members in Britain.

“Dearest Charlie and family,” he wrote in capital letters. “The group holding us has just released four French journalists. And Didier François is carrying this letter.

“The group continues to release prisoners whose countries have paid their ransom demands.

“For the six British and American prisoners, the group are demanding a total of $100 million.”

He added that an American Daesh prisoner, Kayla Mueller, could be released if an infamous Pakistani terrorist known as “Lady Al-Qaeda,” Aafia Siddiqui, was free in a prisoner swap.

“The British and American governments are the most hated by this group and therefore they are demanding the most for us,” Cantlie continued.

“The amount is extremely high but it is the only way the rest of us here will ever be released.”

He added: “Didier François knows all about the situation here. Liaise with him on the matter.

“We are all so sorry to put you in this very difficult situation. We love all our families and pray you are all holding up in this situation.”

François did not manage to take the note from jail after the French paid for his freedom. Motka is thought to have smuggled the letter out of Syria one month later after the government in Rome paid what is believed to be a $6.5 million ransom for the journalist.",https://www.arabnews.com/node/2044921/world

As per the latest reports, Russia has attacked Lviv's airport and also destroyed an aircraft repair plant. Amid tightening sanctions against Russia, Japan has come up with more sanctions on 15 Russian individuals and nine organisations. One person was killed and 4 wounded after parts of a Russian missile fell on a residential building in the northern part of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

1) Russia strikes near Lviv airport:-

Russian missiles struck near Lviv's airport in the far west of Ukraine early Friday, as Moscow expanded a countrywide aerial bombardment campaign that has intensified allegations of war crimes and deliberate targeting of civilians.

Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said Russian forces had destroyed an aircraft repair plant -- which sits near the Polish border. Ambulance and police vehicles raced to the scene, while motorists were turned away at checkpoints. An AFP reporter saw a thick pall of smoke billowing over the airport. ""Several missiles hit an aircraft repair plant,"" the mayor said on the messaging app Telegram, adding that the plant had been destroyed.

2) Japan imposes more sanctions on Russia:-

Japan said on Friday it will impose sanctions on 15 Russian individuals and nine organisations, including defence officials and the state-owned arms exporter Rosoboronexport.

The services said in a statement that 12 people were rescued and 98 were evacuated from the 5-storey building.

5) Putin likens opponents to ‘gnats’:-

Putin's ominous speech on Wednesday likened opponents to “gnats"" who try to weaken the country at the behest of the West — crude remarks that set the stage for sweeping repressions against those who dare to speak out against the war in Ukraine.

6) Saudi Arabia extends Ukrainians' visas:-

Saudi Arabia issued a royal directive extending tourist and business visas of Ukrainian citizens without fees or fines for humanitarian considerations, state news agency SPA said on Friday. The extension will be automatic without the need to visit the migration authorities.

More than 350,000 people are sheltering in the besieged southern port of Mariupol, officials said. Rescuers are combing the rubble of a theatre in Mariupol bombed on Wednesday for survivors. Russia denies striking it. Italy said it will rebuild it.

The governor of the northern Chernihiv region said 53 civilians had been killed in the past 24 hours. The dead included a U.S. citizen as he waited in a bread line, his family said. Russia denies targeting civilians. The U.N. said it had recorded 780 confirmed civilian deaths since the invasion began, and 3.2 million have fled.

9) Big gap between Ukraine and Russia:-

A ""very, very big gap"" remains between Ukraine and Russia, Western officials said after another day of peace talks. * Russian President Vladimir Putin shows little desire to compromise, they said, while Ukraine wants to retain sovereignty over areas occupied since 2014 by Russia and pro-Russian forces.

10.) Putin's power must be destroyed: Germany:-

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck called on Friday for Russian President Vladimir Putin's power to be reduced and ultimately destroyed. ""We should do everything we can to reduce Putin's power and, in the end, to destroy it,"" Habeck, who is also German vice-chancellor, told ARD television. Habeck resisted calls for an immediate stop to energy imports from Russia, adding: ""When we can say with oil and gas ... we have secured supply chains, then we can take the next step.""

Missile strikes and artillery attacks have intensified in recent days and, according to the United Nations (UN), there have been at least 691 civilian deaths and 1,143 injuries in Ukraine as of 15 March, but the real total could be considerably higher.

Attempts at evacuation for Ukrainian residents desperate to flee have so far been hampered by broken ceasefires, with Russian troops relentlessly shelling the north, centre and south of the country and leaving people dead on the streets. Over 3m have meanwhile fled to the West as refugees.

Bomb shelters in Ukraine have had to double up as hospital bunkers and maternity wards, as women become mothers amid trembling buildings weakened by Russian artillery bombardments.

The UK has joined 37 other countries in referring Moscow to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as Boris Johnson said Mr Putin “cannot commit these horrific acts with impunity”.

Economic boycotts have been implemented worldwide by countries and institutions to restrict Mr Putin and place financial pressure on the Kremlin to end their invasion.

Here is an ever-growing list of sanctions that have been imposed by countries, businesses and the sporting, arts and music world to date.

UK

The UK has imposed financial restrictions on 386 members of the Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, after they voted to recognise the independence of Ukraine’s breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, the prelude to the invasion and much of Russia’s financial system has now been hit by British sanctions.

London will prevent Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, from clearing payments in pounds sterling.

The Russian Direct Investment Fund – the country’s sovereign wealth fund – and its chief executive, Kirill Dmitriev, have also been sanctioned.

Full asset freezes have also been imposed on several other Russian banks and the UK has set a £50,000 limit on bank accounts held by Russian nationals in the UK.

The country’s national airline, Aeroflot, has also been blocked in the UK, as well as a multitude of Russian companies involved in defence and technology.

Shipbuilder company United Shipbuilding Corporation, the largest in Russia, has also been targeted, while Russian ships have been banned from UK ports.

Britain is also planning to ban the export of certain technologies to Russia.

Mr Johnson said: “We will continue on a remorseless mission to squeeze Russia, from the global economy, piece by piece. Day by day, and week by week.”

The government announced a full asset freeze and travel ban on two of Russia’s leading oligarchs, Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov, who officials said had “significant UK interests and close links to the Kremlin”.

Since the invasion, the UK has sanctioned 13 of Russia’s oligarchs in total and more than 220 individuals and entities have been caught up in the sanctions.

In total, more than 500 Russian individuals, entities and their subsidiaries now sit on the UK’s sanctions list.

Britain will also ban Russian companies from the London insurance market, the world’s largest commercial and specialty insurance centre.

Alongside UK and US, the European Commission has pledged to remove Russia from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift).

Swift is used by over 11,000 financial institutions to send secure messages and payment orders.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen (EPA)

The EU will also employ restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian central bank from using its international reserves and assets to undermine the economic sanctions.

Additionally, the EU has banned the Russian company, Internet Research Agency, which is engaged win online influence operations on behalf of Russia.

EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said: “We will stop Putin from using his war chest.”

The EU has further banned Russian airlines from entering its airspace or using its airports, brought in individual sanctions against Mr Putin, his foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and other members of the Duma and curbed transactions with the Russian central bank.

Brussels has also suspended the broadcasting of state-owned media Russia Today and Sputnik within the bloc.

US

Along with the EU, UK and G7, the US have moved to revoke Russia’s “most favoured nation” status, which will block Russia from trade benefits the country previously enjoyed.

Additional sanctions against Russia’s central bank have prohibited Americans from doing any business with the institution as well as freezing its assets within the US.

The country also blocked the import of Russian technology, including “semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime technologies”, the White House said in a statement.

Like the UK, America cut off the state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund, which was seen as a piggy bank for Mr Putin and his inner circle.

Prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced sanctions that would give the country the ability to freeze Russian assets in New Zealand, prevent people and companies from moving their money and assets to the country to escape sanctions imposed by other countries, and stop superyachts, ships and aircraft from entering New Zealand waters and airspace.

The PM has also banned exports to Russia’s military and security forces and has blocked more than 100 people from traveling to New Zealand in a list that was made public.

Japan

Aligning with G7, prime minister Fumio Kishida said Japan will limit transactions with Russia’s central bank and cut Russia from the Swift network.

Like Australia, Japan will also impose sanctions on Belarusian organisations and limit exports there due to the country’s part in the invasion of Ukraine.

Ukrainian historian: 'People just don't believe Kyiv will fall'

A historian with the Canadian Institute for Ukrainian studies at the University of Alberta has explained the determination of so many people in Kyiv to remain, despite the ongoing conflict.

Olha Klymenko is currently in Kyiv, having returned to be with her father, who neither wants to leave the city nor is in good enough health to do so. ""He refuses to leave. And this is the case with a lot of people, a lot of my friends,"" she told DW.

She said there were a number of reasons for this, perhaps they had children fighting with Ukrainian forces, or perhaps they simply refused to abandon their homes.

""There are people who just say: We're going to stay. This is our land. This is our home. We're not leaving. And people just do not believe that Kyiv is going to fall. They believe that Kyiv is going to stand. So I'm staying.""

Klymenko spoke from a darkened room on Thursday evening, as authorities had asked residents to keep their lights off to make targeting more difficult for Russian forces.

""Such deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure are shameful, reprehensible and totally unacceptable. They constitute serious violations of international humanitarian law,"" Borrell said.

""The perpetrators of these serious violations and war crimes, as well as the responsible government officials and military leaders will be held accountable,"" he said.

Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov urged EU lawmakers to recognize Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""war criminal"" and step up the bloc's arms supplies to fight Moscow's forces.

US lawmakers vote to suspend normal trade ties with Russia

The US House of Representatives has voted to remove Moscow from the list of ""most favored nations"" for trade. The Senate is expected to quickly approve the measure, paving the way for President Joe Biden to raise tariffs on Russian imports.

The legislation, which had broad support from Democrats and Republicans, also includes Russian ally Belarus. The two countries will join Cuba and North Korea as the only countries that the US do not have regular trade relationships with.

""Both parties… remain united in sending Putin a clear message: his inhumane violence against the Ukrainian people will come at a crippling price,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

The sanction, which follows the announcement of a US ban on Russian energy imports, as well as extensive sanctions on banks, businesses and oligarchs. The IMF has predicted that the penalties will see Russia fall into a ""deep recession"" this year.

G7 demands aid should enter stricken cities

Members of the G7 group of industrialized nations have demanded that Russia allow humanitarian aid into the besieged port city of Mariupol and other places surrounded by Moscow's forces.

""The Russian leadership has to immediately provide for humanitarian access as well as humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and other besieged cities,"" read the statement by the foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan Japan and the United States.

The group's members said they would commit themselves to stockpiling and distributing humanitarian aid, as well as making sure that Ukraine's neighbors receive the assistance they need.

Japan and Australia announce additional sanctions against Russia

Australia and Japan on Friday increased the pressure on Russia by placing sanctions on individuals, banks and government organizations.

Canberra imposed sanctions on Moscow's Finance Ministry while adding 11 banks and government organizations, including the central bank, covering the majority of Russia's banking assets along with all entities that handle its sovereign debt.

""With our recent inclusion of the Central Bank of Russia, Australia has now targeted all Russian government entities responsible for issuing and managing Russia's sovereign debt,"" Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne said in a statement.

Japan, meanwhile, said it would impose sanctions against 15 individuals and nine organizations, including defense officials and state-owned arms and dual-use technologies exporter Rosoboronexport.

The sanctions, which include asset freezing, are the latest in a series of measures by Tokyo since Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine.

Russia won't call for UN council vote on its Ukraine resolution

Russia announced it will not call for the UN Security Council to vote Friday on its draft resolution on humanitarian relief for Ukraine, which has been criticized for making no mention of the Kremlin's invasion of its neighbor.

The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, announced the change of plans in a separate session on Thursday called by western countries.

It will instead use the scheduled council session to repeat allegations that the United States has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine.

Washington has denied these claims, in turn alleging that they are part of a potential ""false-flag operation"" by Moscow.

American soldiers alive, despite Russia claims, says US

Three current and previous members of the Tennessee National Guard were falsely identified as being killed in a Russian media report.

They are in fact alive and well, the Tennessee National Guard said on Thursday.

US President Joe Biden ordered the withdrawal of American troops from Ukraine ahead of Russia's invasion of the country.

But a report published in Russia's Pravda newspaper identified three Americans as being dead and gave military ranks for each of them, citing information from pro-Russian militia in Ukraine's Donetsk.

The story even offered a detailed explanation for how the three were identified, using items from a backpack ""near the remains of one of the militants."" Among the items was a Tennessee state flag, the report claimed.

""The Tennessee Guard is aware of the fake news coming out of Russia,"" said Tracy O'Grady, a spokesperson for the larger US National Guard.

The Tennessee Guard said in a statement: ""They are accounted for, safe and not, as the article headline erroneously states, US mercenaries killed in Donetsk People's Republic.""

Zelensky: Russia surprised by our determination

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had been surprised by the resistance it has been met with since it began its invasion.

""This is our defense,"" he said in his nighttime video address to the nation. ""When the enemy doesn't know what to expect from us. As they didn't know what awaited them after February 24,"" the day Russia invaded. ""They didn't know what we had for defense or how we prepared to meet the blow.""

He said Russia expected to find Ukraine much as it did in 2014, when it seized Crimea without a fight and backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region. But Ukraine is now a different country, with much stronger defenses, he said.

Summary of Thursday's events in Ukraine-Russia crisis

The EU said that potential ""war crimes"" in Ukraine would be investigated and prosecuted, joining top US figures in labeling Moscow's actions thus.

The search for survivors continued at the Mariupol theater, which was bombed on Wednesday, with Ukrainian lawmaker Dmytro Gurin telling DW that the attack was ""deliberate.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the Bundestag, telling the German parliament that ""help came too late to stop war."" He also criticized the German government over its economic ties with Russia.

Local officials said shelling of the town of Merefa, outside the city of Kharkiv, killed at least 21 people and injured 25.

These are the key events so far on Friday, March 18. Get the latest updates here.

Fighting

At least three explosions have been heard in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv this morning. Mayor Andriy Sadovyi says Russian missiles have struck an area near the airport.

The invasion has largely stalled on all fronts in recent days amid heavy losses, British military intelligence and the Ukrainian armed forces say.

Authorities in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol say Russian forces are dropping 50-100 bombs on the city daily, causing “enormous destruction”.

Russian shelling has caused a fire at Kharkiv’s Barabashovo market, among the largest in Eastern Europe, Ukraine’s public broadcaster, Suspilne, says.

Civilian toll

More than 350,000 people are sheltering in Mariupol, officials says.

Rescuers are combing the rubble of a theatre in the city that was bombed on Wednesday for survivors. Russia denies striking it. Italy says it will rebuild it.

The governor of the northern Chernihiv region says 53 civilians had been killed in the past 24 hours. The dead included a United States citizen as he waited in a bread line, according to his family. Russia denies targeting civilians.

The United Nations says it has recorded 780 confirmed civilian deaths since the invasion began, and 3.2 million people have fled. The World Health Organization says it has verified 43 attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine that have killed 12 people and injured dozens more, including health workers.

Diplomacy

A “very, very big gap” remains between Ukraine and Russia, Western officials say after another day of peace talks.

Russian President Vladimir Putin shows little desire to compromise, they added, while Ukraine wants to retain sovereignty over areas occupied since 2014 by Russia and pro-Russian forces.

Russia has accused the US of stoking “Russophobia” and says it has the power to put its “brash enemies into place”.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has asked Turkey to be a guarantor of any future deal with Russia, along with the UN Security Council’s five permanent members and Germany, Ankara’s top diplomat says.

Sanctions

Japan and Australia have imposed new sanctions on Russian entities as punishment for the invasion of Ukraine.

Washington says US President Joe Biden will warn his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in talks on Friday of the “costs” if Beijing helps Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. The two leaders are scheduled to talk at 13:00 GMT, their first summit since a video call in November.

A Russian-European mission to land a rover on Mars has been suspended due to the sanctions over the invasion and its “tragic consequences”, the European Space Agency says.

Economy and markets

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates the war could knock more than one percentage point off global growth this year.

Some creditors have received payment of Russian bond coupons which fell due this week, market sources say, meaning Russia may for now have averted a debt default.

Germany-based Scope Ratings becomes the first ratings agency in the European Union to withdraw its Russian sovereign credit score after a move by the bloc to ban their provision. S&P, meanwhile, has lowered Russia’s rating.

Joe Biden speaks with Xi Jinping about Russia support

US President Joe Biden spoke with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Friday by video call and warned China against giving Russia military and economic assistance.

According to the White House, Biden laid out the ""implications and consequences"" of Chinese assistance to Russia. An administration official said that Biden pointed to the economic isolation Russia has faced as a result of Western sanctions in his discussion with Xi.

Xi urged the US and Russia to negotiate and accused the US of provoking Russia by shipping arms to Ukraine.

Scholz and Spanish PM urge solidarity

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said the Russian invasion of Ukraine should be a turning point for the European Union.

Speaking alongside Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Berlin, Scholz said it was vital for the EU to strengthen its defense capability and take decisions in the energy sector.

""The war in Ukraine means a turning point for the EU as well,"" Scholz said as the pair met in Berlin.

""We call on President Putin to immediately stop the to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw his invading forces from the country.""

""As before, we will continue to support Ukraine, which so courageously opposes the aggressor,"" said Scholz.

He said this also meant ""that we will take care of the humanitarian plight of the people there.""

Sanchez said that Putin was the sole author of the war. He also underlined the need to keep energy prices from spiraling out of control ahead of a meeting of European leaders next week.

""For Spain, it is very important that the EU summit take urgent action,"" said Sanchez.

World Food Program: Situation in Mariupol is dire

World Food Program Director Martin Frick spoke to DW about the deteriorating situation for civilians in Ukrainian cities like Mariupol, which are being besieged by Russian forces, as well as the consequences for the global food supply without Ukrainian wheat.

""The situation is Mariupol is particularly bad. We are trying to get access to bring food in,"" said Frick, saying the need for humanitarian aid was ""urgent"" but that ""there hasn't been a possibility to bring food in with a humanitarian convoy"" due to constant Russian shelling.

Asked about supposed humanitarian corridors that Moscow promised it would respect, Frick said ""we have yet to see them.""

""We are delivering food to cities that are not entirely encircled. We have now built up food stocks for more than 3 million people for 30 days. But we are still waiting and pressing for humanitarian corridors, particularly for Mariupol.""

Ukraine: Scenes of destruction and despair The longer the war the greater the poverty An old woman in her damaged home in Kyiv: The serious consequences of the war are already being felt by the people of Ukraine. According to UN estimates, around 90% of the country's population could be hit by poverty if the invasion lasts 12 months. This could set the country back economically by almost two decades.

Ukraine: Scenes of destruction and despair Anything but starving to death In Ukraine's second largest city, Kharkiv, the starving population looted a shopping center in the Saltivka district. The situation in Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and in Ochtyrka in the northeast and east of the country is precarious. Local populations there have been the victims of constant missile attacks and aerial bombardments.

Ukraine: Scenes of destruction and despair Offering solace in the rubble In the capital Kyiv, a firefighter consoles a local resident whose apartment building was destroyed in a Russian bombing. She shares this sad fate with many other Ukrainians as Russia contends it is only hitting military targets. Civilian casualties are a daily occurrence, along wih the destruction of residential buildings.

Ukraine: Scenes of destruction and despair Born in darkness A mother and her newborn baby in the basement of a maternity ward in Kharkiv. Anyone giving birth in Ukraine these days may be doing so in makeshift basements. Numerous hospitals were bombed by the Russian army, including a children's and maternity hospital a week ago in Mariupol, which sent shockwaves around the world.

Ukraine: Scenes of destruction and despair Corridor of dispair People injured by shelling in Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine lie in the corridor of a hospital. The situation in the port city, which has been besieged for days, is catastrophic. The situation is similar in Izyum in the northeast, which is besieged by the Russian army. The Ukrainian government is looking for ways to deliver food and medicine to the captured cities.

Ukraine: Scenes of destruction and despair Finally something to eat Residents receive humanitarian aid in the separatist-controlled town of Volnovakha in the Donetsk region. The eastern Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Donetsk remain areas of heavy fighting. Daily reports from both the separatists and the Russian Defense Ministry indicate that they have captured more territory.

Ukraine: Scenes of destruction and despair Silent mourning Family members in mourning at the funeral of fallen Ukrainian soldiers in the western city of Lviv – where there have also been numerous civilian casualties. According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the number of documented civilian deaths since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on February 24 stands at 726, including 42 children and young people.

When will the store be able to reopen? When will everyday life return? This is anyone's guess. Author: Ines Eisele



Frick also spoke about how Ukraine's role as a breadbasket for the world was affecting global food supply and prices: ""While we speak, 20% of the 2021 wheat production is still stuck in Ukraine and more than 40% of the corn production... the global market price for wheat is going through the roof. We have 66% higher prices now than a year ago and 33%...only since the Ukraine war started. So this is directly affecting some of the poorest countries in the world and is pushing families in these countries towards poverty and hunger.""

Some 6.5 million internally displaced in Ukraine

The UN migration agency says nearly 6.5 million people have been displaced inside Ukraine, in addition to the 3.2 million who have already fled the country.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) indicates that, within 3 weeks, Ukraine is on its way to the levels of displacement from Syria's devastating war.

That conflict drove some 13 million people from their homes internally and to other countries.

The findings were presented in a paper issued by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Projections found that ""over 12 million people are estimated to be stranded in affected areas or unable to leave due to heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as a lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation.''

The document cited the IOM figures as ""a good representation of the scale of internal displacement in Ukraine — calculated to stand at 6.48 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine as of March 16.''

Macron asks Putin to allow aid to reach Mariupol in phone call

French President Emmanuel Macron told Russia’s President Putin in a phone call that he had ""extreme concern"" for the civilians in Mariupol, Macron’s office said.

The two leaders spoke for an hour, during which time Macron urged a ""a lifting of the siege and humanitarian access"" to the city.

During the latest of several telephone calls between the two leaders since Russia's invasion began three weeks ago, Macron ""again demanded the immediate respect of a cease-fire"" in Ukraine, the Elysee Palace said.

The Kremlin characterized the call somewhat differently, saying that Putin used it to accuse Ukraine of ""war crimes"" while promising that the Russian leader would do ""everything possible"" to avoid civilian deaths.

""Attention was drawn to the numerous war crimes committed daily by the Ukrainian security forces, in particular massive rocket and artillery attacks on the cities of Donbas,"" the Kremlin said of the call.

The UN has said that at least 780 civilians have already been killed in Ukraine since the invasion began, as Russian bombs have also been dropped on hospitals and shelters.

Russia using UN to spread propaganda, say Western nations

Russia has been using the UN Security Council to spread disinformation over the invasion of Ukraine, according to six Western member states.

The allegation was made at a council meeting called at Russia's request to discuss its allegations that Ukraine is developing biological weapons.

""Russia is once again attempting to use this council to launder its disinformation, spread its propaganda, and justify its unprovoked and brutal attack on Ukraine,"" the six countries with seats on the council said in a statement read out by US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield.

Thomas-Greenfield was accompanied by representatives of France, Norway, Albania, Ireland and Britain.

The council held a meeting on the same issue last week, also at Russia's request. At the time, Western countries accused Russia of spreading conspiracy theories.

Critics say the Russian allegations could be subterfuge to create a pretext for using such weapons themselves.

""We continue to believe it is possible that Russia may be planning to use chemical or biological agents against the Ukrainian people,"" said Thomas-Greenfield.

UNHCR: Number of fleeing Ukrainians could rise exponentially

The UN's refugee agency is warning many more Ukrainians could become refugees.

""In addition to the 3.3 million who have become refugees in neighboring countries, we could be looking at potentials of many more millions becoming refugees,"" Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams, Head of Global Communications at the UNHCR, told DW.

""I think we fear what may happen in the coming days and weeks as we've seen cities that we thought were safe havens, it seems, are not necessarily safe,"" she said.

Her warning comes as the agency said humanitarian needs are increasing exponentially.

""What we're afraid of is are we going to be able to keep up with the numbers of people that are flowing out of the country? And that will be in need of greater and greater support,"" Ghedini-Williams said.

She said refugees need more than food, water, and shelter, ""there's a great deal of trauma that we will have to be able to support.""

So far, more than 3 million people have fled due to Russia’s invasion of the country. At least 200,000 of these have arrived in Germany seeking refuge. According to the UN, around half of all Ukrainian refugees are children.

Dutch, Germans send Patriot missile system east

The Dutch government has said it will send a Patriot missile defense system to Sliac, Slovakia, as NATO moves to strengthen air defenses in Eastern Europe.

""The cabinet considers it of great importance to make an active military contribution to strengthening the deterrence and defense of the NATO alliance,"" Dutch Defense Minister Katja Ollongren said in a statement.

""The deteriorating security situation in Europe because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine makes this contribution necessary.""

Meanwhile, Germany will send two Patriot systems to Slovakia, the same statement said.

The Patriot is a surface-to-air guided weapon system that can be used to take out aircraft, helicopters, and high-speed ballistic and cruise missiles. This is possible up to a height of 20 kilometers (about 12.5 miles) and a distance of 60 kilometers.

Zelenskyy: Hundreds still trapped under Mariupol theater

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said rescue work was ongoing at the site of a bombed theater in Mariupol from where 130 people have so far been recovered alive.

In an online address, Zelenskyy said shelling by Russian forces continued to prevent the authorities from establishing effective humanitarian corridors to the encircled port city in southern Ukraine. He said that hundreds of people are believed to still be trapped.

Officials and observers have noted that people in Mariupol are on their ""last reserves"" of food and water, claiming Russia is using starvation as a tactic of war.

A Ukrainian lawmaker has also said that the theater was clearly marked from above as a shelter for women and children, accusing Moscow of bombing it on purpose.

Putin appears at stadium to praise Russia's war

President Vladimir Putin praised the war waged on Ukraine as a ""heroic"" mission by the Russian army during a patriotic rally at a Moscow stadium on Friday.

Putin spoke before tens of thousands of people at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium, where people waved the Russian national flag and flags bearing the letter Z, a pro-war symbol.

Putin said all of the Kremlin's plans for Ukraine would be implemented. However, Russian state television curiously cut Putin's speech mid-sentence, switching to footage of patriotic music.

He was cut while saying: ""It so happened that the beginning of the operation coincided by chance with the birthday of one of our outstanding military...""

The Kremlin later blamed a technical glitch for the interrupted transmission.

The rally was held to celebrate the 8th anniversary of Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula of Crimea on March 18, 2014.

In an ominous speech on Wednesday, Putin likened opponents to ""gnats'' who try to weaken the country at the behest of the West.

He unleashed a diatribe at those who oppose his course and spoke of the ""necessary self-purification of society.""

Biden and Xi set to talk about China's support for Russia

US President Joe Biden is planning to call his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Friday. While the phone call has been on the agenda since November, relations between Beijing and Moscow in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine are likely to take center stage.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the call offers the chance ""to assess where Xi stands"" on the war. She added that Biden will question Beijing's ""rhetorical support"" and ""absence of denunciation"" over the invasion.

China is trying to walk a fine line between antagonizing its Russian partners and disrupting its economic ties with the west. Xi's government has tried to distance itself from Russia's actions — for example abstaining from a historic UN vote to condemn the invasion — but has not gone as far as condemning Moscow.

Global financial institutions warn of economic fallout

A group of leading financial lenders, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and Council of Europe Development Bank among others, have released a statement warning of the ""extensive"" economic fallout from the war in Ukraine.

""The entire global economy will feel the effects of the crisis through slower growth, trade disruptions, and steeper inflation,"" the statement read, adding that the conflict was hitting energy and food supplies resulting in rising poverty.

Representatives from the global institutions met on Thursday to discuss the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine around the world.

""In addition to the devastating human catastrophe unfolding in Ukraine, the war is disrupting livelihoods throughout the region and beyond,"" they said.

Bulgaria, Baltic states kick out Russian diplomats

The Bulgarian foreign ministry declared 10 Russian diplomats ""persona non grata"" and demanded that they leave the country within 72 hours, accusing them of carrying out activities incompatible with their diplomatic status.

Bulgaria expelled two other Russian diplomats on March 2 amid allegations of espionage. On Monday, Slovakia kicked out three Russian embassy staff based on information from its secret service.

Bulgaria was Moscow's closest ally during the Cold War but has since joined both the EU and NATO.

The Baltic states also expelled a total of 10 Russian diplomats on Friday: three from Latvia and Estonia each and four from Lithuania.

""Latvia expels three Russian Embassy employees in connection with activities that are contrary to their diplomatic status and taking into account ongoing Russian aggression in #Ukraine. The decision has been coordinated with #Lithuania and #Estonia,"" Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics tweeted.

US slams Russian threats over Bosnian NATO membership

The US embassy in Sarajevo has called the ""threats"" made by the Russian ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina regarding the Balkan country's wish to join NATO ""dangerous, irresponsible and unacceptable"" in a Tweet.

Earlier in the week, ambassador Igor Kalabukhov said that if Bosnia ""chooses to be a member of anything, that is its internal business. But there is another thing, our reaction.""

""We have shown what we expect on the example of Ukraine. If there are threats, we will react,"" Kalabukhov added.

Bosnia has been split along ethnic lines since the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 90s and was ravaged by a brutal war with Russia's close ally Serbia.

""We will continue to stand firmly by Bosnia and Herzegovina as it takes the necessary steps to secure its place in the Euro-Atlantic community of nations,"" the US embassy said on Thursday evening.

FIFA ban of Russian World Cup qualifiers upheld by Court of Arbitration

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld FIFA's ban on Russia from taking part in the playoffs for the 2022 World Cup finals over the invasion of Ukraine.

The Russian soccer federation wanted an urgent interim ruling to freeze the ban pending an appeal.

The CAS decision means Russia will not be able to play Poland in World Cup qualifying on Thursday.

FIFA declared Poland winners by walkover — a decision that is made when a team is disqualified — after Russia's suspension.

Poland, Sweden, and the Czech Republic said they would refuse to play against Russia before the suspension.

Earlier in the week CAS also rejected a Russian appeal to stay a suspension of its national teams and clubs by the European

IEA says the world needs to cut oil use urgently

International Energy Agency urged the international community to cut oil use, warning that the world faced a massive supply crisis.

""As a result of Russia's appalling aggression against Ukraine, the world may well be facing its biggest oil supply shock in decades, with huge implications for our economies and societies,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said.

The IEA has announced a 10-point plan to cut oil use, including reducing highway speed limits by 10 kilometers per hour (6 miles per hour).

The IEA also called on the OPEC+ group of oil-producing nations to help ""relieve the strain"" on markets.

Russia is the largest exporter of oil to global markets and the second-largest crude oil exporter behind Saudi Arabia.

Several countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, have banned Russian oil imports.

Scholz tells Putin headway is needed in peace talks

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

According to his spokesman, Scholz pressed Putin to make progress in finding a diplomatic solution and told him the humanitarian situation needed to improve.

Putin blamed Ukraine for stalling the peace talks.

""It was noted that the Kyiv regime is attempting in every possible way to delay the negotiation process, putting forward more and more unrealistic proposals,"" the Kremlin said in a readout of the call.

The Russian leader also told his German counterpart they were doing everything possible to save the lives of civilians.

The call lasted just under an hour.

Lavrov warns West not to donate S-300 to Ukraine

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the state broadcaster RT that Russia wouldn't allow other countries to supply S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine.

He repeated an earlier threat that Russian troops could target supplies of weapons to Ukraine.

S-300 missiles are high on Ukrainian demands from the West because they are designed to hit targets at higher altitudes.

On Thursday, Slovakia's defense minister, Jaroslav Nad, speaking alongside his US counterpart Lloyd Austin, said Bratislava is ready to send long-range surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine.

""The only strategic air defense system that we have in Slovakia is the S-300 system,"" Nad said.

He added Western allies give them a ""proper replacement"" to avoid creating a security gap.

Deadly shelling in several Ukrainian cities

Two million refugees cross into Poland

The Polish border guard has said that more than 2 million people have crossed from Ukraine into Poland since the Russian invasion began on 24 February.

The UN says more than 3.1 million refugees have fled the country in total.

Ofcom revokes RT's broadcast license in the UK

Britain's media regulator, Ofcom, has revoked Russian state broadcaster RT's license to broadcast in the UK with immediate effect.

""Freedom of expression is something we guard fiercely in this country, and the bar for action on broadcasters is rightly set very high,"" Ofcom Chief Executive Melanie Dawes said.

She said the decision was taken because it ""appears impossible for RT to comply with the due impartiality rules"" in its coverage of the war in Ukraine.

Ofcom's decision is largely symbolic as RT has already been taken off air as a result of sanctions imposed in the EU.

Russia says they are fighting inside Mariupol

Russian forces were fighting in the center of Mariupol, the Russian defense ministry said.

""In Mariupol, units of the Donetsk People's Republic, with the support of the Russian armed forces, are squeezing the encirclement and fighting against nationalists in the city center,"" the ministry said in Moscow.

By seizing the strategic port city, Russian President Vladimir Putin could create a corridor between Russia, the Donbas area, and Crimea and take full control of the Sea of Azov.

Mariupol has been besieged for weeks and has endured relentless shelling by the Russians.

On Wednesday, Mariupol's theater was destroyed during a bombardment. Russia denied striking it. Italy said it would rebuild it.

Japan and Australia announce additional sanctions against Russia

Australia and Japan on Friday increased the pressure on Russia by placing sanctions on individuals, banks and government organizations.

Canberra imposed sanctions on Moscow's Finance Ministry while adding 11 banks and government organizations, including the central bank, covering the majority of Russia's banking assets along with all entities that handle its sovereign debt.

""With our recent inclusion of the Central Bank of Russia, Australia has now targeted all Russian government entities responsible for issuing and managing Russia's sovereign debt,"" Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne said in a statement.

Japan, meanwhile, said it would impose sanctions against 15 individuals and nine organizations, including defense officials and state-owned arms and dual-use technologies exporter Rosoboronexport.

The sanctions, which include asset freezing, are the latest in a series of measures by Tokyo since Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine.

Russia won't call for UN council vote on its Ukraine resolution

Russia announced it will not call for the UN Security Council to vote Friday on its draft resolution on humanitarian relief for Ukraine, which has been criticized for making no mention of the Kremlin's invasion of its neighbor.

The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, announced the change of plans in a separate session on Thursday called by western countries.

It will instead use the scheduled council session to repeat allegations that the United States has biological warfare laboratories in Ukraine.

Washington has denied these claims, in turn alleging that they are part of a potential ""false-flag operation"" by Moscow.

American soldiers alive, despite Russia claims, says US

Three current and previous members of the Tennessee National Guard were falsely identified as being killed in a Russian media report.

They are in fact alive and well, the Tennessee National Guard said on Thursday.

US President Joe Biden ordered the withdrawal of American troops from Ukraine ahead of Russia's invasion of the country.

But a report published in Russia's Pravda newspaper identified three Americans as being dead and gave military ranks for each of them, citing information from pro-Russian militia in Ukraine's Donetsk.

The story even offered a detailed explanation for how the three were identified, using items from a backpack ""near the remains of one of the militants."" Among the items was a Tennessee state flag, the report claimed.

""The Tennessee Guard is aware of the fake news coming out of Russia,"" said Tracy O'Grady, a spokesperson for the larger US National Guard.

The Tennessee Guard said in a statement: ""They are accounted for, safe and not, as the article headline erroneously states, US mercenaries killed in Donetsk People's Republic.""

Zelenskyy: Russia surprised by our determination

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had been surprised by the resistance it has been met with since it began its invasion.

""This is our defense,"" he said in his nighttime video address to the nation. ""When the enemy doesn't know what to expect from us. As they didn't know what awaited them after February 24,"" the day Russia invaded. ""They didn't know what we had for defense or how we prepared to meet the blow.""

He said Russia expected to find Ukraine much as it did in 2014, when it seized Crimea without a fight and backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region. But Ukraine is now a different country, with much stronger defenses, he said.

Summary of Thursday's events in Ukraine-Russia crisis

The EU said that potential ""war crimes"" in Ukraine would be investigated and prosecuted, joining top US figures in labeling Moscow's actions thus.

The search for survivors continued at the Mariupol theater, which was bombed on Wednesday, with Ukrainian lawmaker Dmytro Gurin telling DW that the attack was ""deliberate.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the Bundestag, telling the German parliament that ""help came too late to stop war."" He also criticized the German government over its economic ties with Russia.

Local officials said shelling of the town of Merefa, outside the city of Kharkiv, killed at least 21 people and injured 25.

Bilateral talks also continued between Russia and Ukraine, albeit with neither side saying very much publicly on Thursday.
