Russia has received no official notification from Turkey on the closure of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian warships, the Interfax news agency quoted the Russian embassy in Turkey as saying.

On Friday Turkey’s foreign minister said that under the 1936 convention covering the matter, Ankara could not bar warships returning to a home base in the Black Sea from passing through the straits. Russia has a major naval base in the Black Sea.

The strait closures will still allow warships through if they are returning to a home base in the Black Sea, according to reporting from Naval News. This would include Russian ships in the country’s Black Sea Fleet.

However, the decision to restrict warships, a power given to Turkey by the Montreux Convention of 1936, will likely limit Russia’s ability to move ships from its other fleets to the Black Sea.

According to Naval News, Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu told reporters that even though Turkey is not considered a belligerent in this conflict, it has the ability to restrict passage of warships from warring states.

“If the warship is returning to its base in the Black Sea, the passage is not closed. We adhere to the Montreux rules. All governments, riparian and non-riparian, were warned not to send warships across the straits,” Çavuşoğlu said, according to Naval News.

The move by Turkey likely means that two of Russia’s Slava-class cruisers currently operating in the Mediterranean couldn’t enter the Black Sea. The two ships were operating in and around the Aegean Sea last week, with RTS Marshal Ustinov (055) south of Italy and RFS Varyag (011) off the coast of Syria, near Russia’s Tartus naval base, USNI News reported. Marshal Ustinov is from Russia’s Northern Fleet and Varyag is from its Pacific Fleet.

No country has tried to send warships through the Bosphorus or Dardanelles straits since Turkey issued its warning, Naval News reported.

Turkey’s denial of passage to warships comes a day after Çavuşoğlu told CNN Turk the Russian invasion into Ukraine is considered a war.

By declaring it a war, Turkey was able to use the rules of the Montreux Convention that allow it to restrict the passage of the straits, although the foreign minister did not cite which article allowed it to shut off access to warships.

The Montreaux Convention gives Turkey wide latitude to control the straits and includes specific restrictions – like tonnage limitations, notification for passage, and time limitations – for non-Black Sea states.

The move by Turkish officials is a “powerful, sensible, and bold” one, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Adm. James Stavridis told USNI News in an email.

Russia will still be able to sustain its Black Sea ships through shore resupply through Crimea, Stavridis said. However, it will prevent maritime reinforcements from coming into the Black Sea.

“It is also time for NATO, which will continue to have access of course, to send more of its ships into the Black Sea to support Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania, the NATO members whose fleets operate routinely there,” Stavridis said.

Russia has already used some of its amphibious ships to assist with its invasion into Ukraine, landing troops outside of Mariupol on Friday. Those troops then met up with more Russian troops and started toward the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, USNI News previously reported.

The troops were about 30 miles from the southeast of the city center of Mariupol, as of Sunday. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said Monday that there was no new information about Russian maritime operations.

There are still ships in the Black Sea, Kirby said, and sea combat is available to the Russians.

Naval forces were also beginning to assemble in the Black Sea, south of Odesa, but they had not made any moves toward the port city, USNI News reported Sunday.

A Pentagon official said Monday that there was no additional movement toward Odesa from ships in the Black Sea.

Kirby referred any questions about the Black Sea straits to Turkey.",https://news.usni.org/2022/02/28/turkey-closes-bosphorus-dardanelles-straits-to-warships

Russia has acknowledged that the Moskva, its flagship Black Sea missile cruiser, has sunk. It attributes the loss to an unexplained fire, which ignited ammunition, and says it capsized “in choppy seas” while being towed to port. Ukraine says it hit the Moskva with at least one of its Neptune anti-shipping missiles, and that this caused it to sink.

What is the Neptune system?

The subsonic Neptune is based on the old Soviet Kh-35 anti-ship missile with improved range and electronics, and has a range of almost 200 miles. First coming into service in Ukraine last year, the whole system comprises a truck-based mobile launcher, four missiles, a reload vehicle, and a command and control vehicle. It is designed to fly close to the surface of the sea to avoid detection.

If it was a missile, why didn’t Russia detect it?

The Neptune system is designed to be deployed from coastal areas, which in this case would mean it was being operated close to an area of intense Russian military activity. If the damage was caused by a Neptune missile, the Russians appear not to have been aware of it until too late.

During the Falklands war in 1982, the British lost six ships, underlining to navies around the world the vulnerability of ships to missile attack. Slava class ships like the Moskva were designed to be equipped with with S-300F Fort long-range air defence system, a naval version of the S300, which has some utility against ballistic missiles.

Modern naval forces would also be expected to be equipped with some kind of radar warning receiver system to alert it to the presence of enemy radar systems, although both are far from foolproof.

One claim is that the missile or missiles were fired from a hidden battery close to Odesa while the Moskva’s crew was distracted by two Turkish-supplied drones operating nearby.

How big a deal is the loss of the Moskva?

Whatever the cause of the sinking, it is hard to see this as anything short of a pretty catastrophic incident for Russia. Naval vessels are designed to survive attack as much as possible. Bulkhead doors connecting different sections are intended to control the spread of fire and hull breaches can be isolated. Naval vessels also have a higher level of firefighting capability than civilian counterparts.

The sinking of the Black Sea fleet’s flagship is certainly a coup for Ukrainian morale and a symbolic blow to Russia. However it is worth recalling that Ukraine scuttled its own flagship in port earlier in the conflict, and that British naval forces continued to operate effectively in the Falklands despite the loss of ships.

And while significant, the sinking probably does not alter the Russian navy’s continuing and largely uncontested ability to blockade Ukraine’s coastline.

The big question, however, is whether it could affect any future Russian move to land amphibious forces, perhaps as part of an assault on Odesa.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/sinking-moskva-what-we-know-russia-ship-sunk-missile-ukraine

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan did not tell Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Turkey is closing or has closed Turkish straits to Russian warship access.

The statement follows a phone call between the two leaders Saturday.

""The ban on the passage of Russian warships to the Black Sea and significant military and humanitarian support for Ukraine are extremely important today. The people of Ukraine will never forget that!"" Zelenskyy tweeted earlier on Saturday regarding the call with Erdoğan.

Turkey is still assessing the issue and Zelenskyy's remarks ""only reflect his expectations,"" the official added.

Erdoğan told Zelenskyy that Turkey is working to secure an ""immediate ceasefire"" and offered his condolences over deaths in Russian attacks, the Turkish presidency said on Twitter.

The office did not mention any reference to the Black Sea.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits connecting the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. While trade ships may pass the strait freely in peacetime, battleships face certain restrictions.

Russia often uses the Turkish straits to maneuver ships between the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.

On Friday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the Bosporus was not among the topics discussed at a leaders' summit.

Russian ships would still be able to pass the straits even if Turkey closes them, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said earlier this week.

Kyiv's ambassador to Ankara, Vasly Bodnar, on Thursday officially requested that Turkey close the straits to Russian ships.

Turkey has good economic and political relations with both Russia and Ukraine, and Erdoğan earlier said Ankara did not want to alienate either state.

Closing the straits ""would be a first in the post-WWII era,"" but it can not be interpreted as NATO going to war at all, Sinan Ülgen, the chairperson of Istanbul-based think tank EDAM, told dpa on Saturday.

""Because this would not be a decision to sanction Russia. This would be Turkey's commitment and obligation under the treaty, in case of a war in the Black Sea which Turkey is not a party to.""

Russian ships which belong to the Black Sea fleet will nonetheless be able to return to their ports according to Montreux deal, Ülgen said, adding he believes Russia ""will make use of the exception.""",https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/turkey-has-not-closed-black-sea-to-russian-warships-official

“I thank my friend President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the people of Turkey for their strong support. The ban on the passage of Russian warships to the Black Sea and significant military and humanitarian support for Ukraine are extremely important today.

Zelensky has also urged Germany and Hungary to back Russia’s expulsion from the SWIFT banking system as Moscow continues its military operation in Ukraine.

“We have almost full support from EU countries about disconnecting Russia from SWIFT. I hope Germany and Hungary will have the courage to support this decision,” Zelenskyy said in a video address that was posted on his Telegram channel, Sputnik News Agency reported today.

Zelensky also said that Ukraine has a right to EU membership, and achieving this would be a key sign of support for the country.

On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized Ukraine’s breakaway regions – Donetsk and Luhansk – as independent entities. Later, Putin ordered special military operations “to protect” the people in the Donbas region.

Several countries including the UK, the US, Canada, and the European Union have condemned Russia’s military operations and imposed sanctions on Moscow. (ANI)

Turkey has so far made no public statements on closing the straits to Russian warships, although President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke with Zelenskiy by phone earlier on Saturday, stating that Ankara is attempting to push for an immediate ceasefire.

Turkish officials have briefed no decision has been taken and the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Russia has received no official notification from the Turkish side about a closure.

Cutting off the Bosphorus and Dardanelles to Russian warships, preventing them from accessing the Black Sea, would be a significant move, not only in terms of cutting off long-term Russian support to its troops in Ukraine but also as a significant show of support to Ukraine.

A ban would prevent Russian warships normally permanently stationed around the world from sailing into the Black Sea to assist troops in Ukraine. However, Turkey is unable to prevent ships permanently stationed in the Black Sea from returning to their bases.

Shipping industry experts Lloyd’s List on Friday pointed out that commercial traffic through the Bosphorus has already slowed significantly in the past two days.

Turkey’s foreign ministry described the Russian invasion as “unacceptable” but described it as a “military operation” rather than a war, as doing so has implications for the Montreux convention.

The convention defines Turkish control of the straits as well as setting limits on the size, tonnage and duration of warships that can cross the straits, although warships belonging to countries bordering the Black Sea are normally able to pass unrestricted.

Foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Friday laid out Turkey’s position regarding the closure of the straits to the daily newspaper Hürriyet, stating that officials are discussing whether the conflict meets the definition of a war under the Montreux convention.

If officials decide that the definition has been met, this allows them to block warships from both Ukraine and Russia from passing through the straits, although the move is likely to be far more significant for the Russian side.

“Turkey can stop the passage of warships through the straits,” he said, adding that the convention stipulates that “if there is a demand for ships from the warring countries to return to their bases, then it must be allowed”.

“If we accept the state of war legally, this process will begin,” he added. “Secondly, if we accept the state of war we will prohibit the passage of warships... but even if we ban them, the Russians have such a right.”

Turkey maintains alliances with both Russia and Ukraine, and has so far emphasised its neutrality in the conflict despite selling its Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine and condemning Russia’s actions.

Turkey’s own Nato membership was put under pressure by its decision to buy Russia’s S400 missile defence system in 2017, although Erdoğan has recently sought to show how much Turkey values membership of the organisation, telling journalists that “Nato should have taken a more decisive step”.

The conflict in Ukraine and a rebuke from Russia should Turkey choose to close the straits is likely to heavily affect Turkey’s economy, already hobbled from a year where the lira lost half of its value and as rising energy costs spark protests and discontent. Turkey imports roughly a third of its natural gas supply from Russia, as well as much of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/kyiv-piles-pressure-on-ankara-to-close-straits-to-russia-warships-ukraine
