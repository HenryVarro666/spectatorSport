Despite the seafood and burger restaurant’s extensive menu and large fridge advertising its stock of dry-aged meat, the Russian oligarch did not appear to eat during the entire meeting. Less than 24 hours had passed since he was reported to have suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning.

Abramovich has emerged as an unofficial channel to Russian president Vladimir Putin. He was present on Tuesday at both the formal Turkey-hosted morning talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators at Istanbul’s Dolmabahçe Palace and the informal huddle at the adjacent Shangri-La in the afternoon.

At the hotel, the billionaire former Chelsea owner sat and talked with Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov, who was also reported to have suffered symptoms after their previous series of unofficial talks.

Abramovich, who was surrounded by heavy security, leaned in to talk with Umerov, later joined by the Ukrainian parliamentary leader and head of the delegation, David Arakhamia. The rest of the Ukrainian delegation – including the defence minister, Olekseii Reznikov, wearing military green – were seated at the far end of the terrace, and later got up to reveal a forest of half-empty wine glasses.

The restaurant’s long terrace overlooks the Bosphorus and the adjacent bustling Beşiktaş ferry stop, with travellers hurrying past seemingly unaware of their proximity to the group or their furtive negotiations.

Russia has denied any poisoning plot, and the claims remain murky. Umerov himself has since said he was “fine” and called on people not to trust “unverified information”.

However, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told Ukraine’s Channel 24 television before the meeting: “I advise anyone going through negotiations with the Russian Federation not to eat or drink anything, and preferably avoid touching any surface.”

At the earlier official meeting at the palace, some progress appears to have been made. Despite the difficulties of the talks, the results appeared warmer and more productive than previous sessions in Belarus or talks between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers in the southern Turkish city of Antalya.

The delegations conducted delicate negotiations facing one another at a long conference table inside a stone-walled room, with pictures of the meeting showing Abramovich seated at a small nearby table alongside the Turkish presidential spokesman, İbrahim Kalın.

The discussions followed a short opening speech by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who addressed them from a lectern, saying: “The world is waiting for good news, and good news from you.”

The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, told a press conference that “we see with satisfaction that both sides are getting closer at every stage”. He expressed hopes that the foreign ministers and later perhaps even the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Putin would meet.

Later at the hotel, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, resisted further questions from journalists and disappeared from view under the crystal chandeliers in the hotel lobby.

After talking on the terrace, many from the Ukrainian delegation moved into the restaurant’s interior away from public view, to a large table laden with food. Once inside, Abramovich peeled off to sit on a plush sofa alone to make a phone call, accompanied only by his glass of tea.

He later followed Umerov and other members of the Ukrainian delegation, clutching stuffed blue binders, to another area of the restaurant to continue their discussions well into the late afternoon, hours after the official talks had ended.

""The whole world is awaiting good news,"" Erdogan told negotiators. ""You're establishing a foundation for peace with guidance from your leaders.""

The talks come as Russia says it wants to refocus its invasion efforts to consolidate ground held in the east of the country, in the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbas region.

However Ukrainian forces have started to regain ground in several key towns, giving them some possible leverage for diplomatic talks.

“We still have to fight, we have to endure,” Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation. “We can’t express our emotions now. We can’t raise expectations, simply so that we don’t burn out.”

The Russian negotiators arrived on Monday in Istanbul, where a previous round of talks took place on 10 March at foreign minister level but failed to produce any progress. The talks then continued by video conference.

Ahead of the talks, Zelenskyy said his country is prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, in comments that might lend momentum to negotiations.

Zelenskyy said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over “the complex issue of Donbas,” the hotly contested region in the country’s east. It's unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt”.

Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelenskyy, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal.

Zelenskyy has said it would need to put any deal on neutrality to a referendum but only after Russian forces withdraw, but he has also accused Vladimir Putin and his entourage of ""dragging things out"", and had his calls for a face-to-face meeting rebuffed -- at least for the time being.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, tempered expectations on Monday, pointing to the lack of ""significant progress"" in the negotiations so far.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kouleba later said on his ministry's website that Zelensky had ""given very clear instructions to our delegation.

In a speech he delivered at the start of negotiations, Erdogan said progress in the talks could pave the way for a meeting between the leaders of the two countries.

“We believe that there will be no losers in a just peace. Prolonging the conflict is not in anyone’s interest,” he said. “As members of the delegations you have taken on a historic responsibility. The whole world is awaiting the good news that will come from you.”

“The two parties have legitimate concerns, it’s possible to reach a solution acceptable to the international community,” Erdogan said. “It’s up to the two parties to put an end to this tragedy,” he insisted, adding that the “extension of the conflict is in no one’s interest.”

It is the first time that the two countries’ delegations, which arrived in Turkey on Monday, met after several rounds of talks by videoconference.

The delegations are scheduled to hold two days of talks in a government building adjacent to the 19th-century Ottoman palace, Dolmabahce, on the shores of the Bosporus.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was also due to meet the Ukrainian and Russian delegations on Tuesday.

Earlier talks between the sides, held in person in Belarus or by video, failed to make progress on ending the monthlong war that has killed thousands and driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes — including almost 4 million from their country.

Turkey previously hosted on March 10 a first meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Those talks in the southern city of Antalya failed to produce a ceasefire or make any other visible progress.

Turkey, which shares a Black Sea coast with both Russia and Ukraine, is seeking to maintain good relations with both and has offered to mediate since the start of the war.

Ankara is a traditional ally of Kyiv’s and has supplied the country with Bayraktar drones, which Ukraine has deployed in the conflict.

But it is also seeking to stay on good terms with Russia, on which Turkey relies heavily for gas imports and tourism revenues.

Turkey is also working with France and Greece on a “humanitarian operation” to evacuate people from the devastated Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which has been pounded by Russian forces.

Ahead of the current talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country was prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, in comments that might lend momentum to negotiations.

Zelensky said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over “the complex issue of Donbas,” the hotly contested region in the country’s east. It’s unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.”

Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelensky, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal.

As fighting raged throughout the country, the mayor of Irpin, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, said late Monday that the city had been “liberated” from Russian forces.

A senior US defense official said the US believes the Ukrainians have also retaken the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in the east.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss US intelligence assessments, said Russian forces largely remained in defensive positions near the capital, Kyiv, and were making little forward progress elsewhere in the country.

The official said Russia appeared to be deemphasizing ground operations near Kyiv and concentrating more on the Donbas, the predominantly Russian-speaking region where Moscow-backed rebels have been waging a separatist war for eight years.

Late last week, with its forces bogged down in parts of the country, Russia seemed to scale back its war aims, saying its main goal was gaining control of the Donbas.

The possible face-saving exit strategy for Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised Ukrainian fears the Kremlin aims to split the country, forcing it to surrender a swath of its territory.

In recent days, Ukrainian troops have pushed the Russians back in other sectors.

In the city of Makariv, near a strategic highway west of the capital, Associated Press reporters saw the carcass of a Russian rocket launcher, a burned Russian truck, the body of a Russian soldier and a destroyed Ukrainian tank after fighting there a few days ago.

In the nearby village of Yasnohorodka, the AP witnessed positions abandoned by Ukrainian soldiers who had moved farther west, but no sign of Russian troops.

Russia has destroyed more than 60 religious buildings across the country in just over a month of war, with most of the damage concentrated near Kyiv and in the east, Ukraine’s military said in a post on Tuesday.

It said the Orthodox church – the country’s majority religion – was the most affected but that mosques, synagogues, Protestant churches and religious schools were also destroyed.

A cyberattack knocked Ukraine’s national telecommunications provider Ukrtelecom almost completely offline on Monday. The chief of Ukraine’s state service for special communication, Yurii Shchyhol, blamed “the enemy” without specifically naming Russia and said most customers were cut off from telephone, internet and mobile service to ensure coverage for Ukraine’s military.

Also Monday, an oil depot in western Ukraine’s Rivne region was hit by a missile, the governor said, in the second attack on oil facilities in the region near the Polish border.

In other developments, Ukraine’s prosecutor general said at least 144 children have died in the war so far, most in Kyiv. The tally did not give a number for the besieged eastern city of Mariupol.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg News said it has suspended its operations in Russia and Belarus. Customers in both countries won’t be able to access any Bloomberg financial products and trading functions for Russian securities were disabled in line with international sanctions, it said. Bloomberg Philanthropies pledged $40 million, meanwhile, in support of Ukrainians and refugees.

Also, The Group of Seven major economies rejected a Kremlin demand that some countries pay in rubles for Russia’s natural gas. That demand appeared designed to support the Russian currency, which is under pressure from Western sanctions.

Putin’s ground forces have become bogged down because of stronger-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, combined with what Western officials say are Russian tactical missteps, poor morale, shortages of food, fuel and cold weather gear, and other problems. Moscow has resorted to pummeling Ukrainian cities with artillery and airstrikes.

The Pentagon may have to ask Congress for additional money to support Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s invasion, including replenishing America’s arsenal for weapons sent to Kyiv, officials said Monday.

Rolling out the Defense Department’s $773 billion request for fiscal 2023, Pentagon leaders said the budget was finalized before the invasion so it has no specific money for the war. Congress approved a $13.5 billion emergency funding package in early March.

The leaders said it was too early to predict how quickly Ukrainian forces will use up the weapons and ammunition already being provided, and how much the US will need to replace what it sends to Ukraine, such as Stinger and Javelin missiles or body armor and other equipment.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-kick-off-in-istanbul-erdogan-urges-end-to-tragedy/

ISTANBUL, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Russian and Ukrainian delegations have arrived in Turkey's largest city Istanbul on Monday for a fresh round of face-to-face peace talks, aiming to achieve substantial progress to end the crisis.

The Russian delegation has settled in the Ciragan Palace Kempinski hotel while the Ukrainian delegation has checked in the Shangri-La Bosphorus, both very close to each other in the Besiktas district.

Media reports said the arrival of the Ukrainian delegation had been postponed to evening hours due to the closure of Ukrainian airspace and some logistical problems. According to the NTV broadcaster, the Ukrainian delegates had to go to a neighboring country by road to fly to Istanbul.

Tuesday's negotiations will begin at 10:30 a.m. local time (0730 GMT) at the Dolmabahce Presidential Working Office in Besiktas.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to address the delegations at the opening of the meeting.

""We will have a short meeting with the delegations tomorrow morning,"" Erdogan said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting in the Turkish capital Ankara on Monday.

So far, Russia and Ukraine have held three rounds of in-person talks in Belarus, and their fourth session was in a video conference format.

Turkey, meanwhile, has increasingly accelerated its diplomatic efforts on the international arena, reiterating its policy that it is ready to play a mediator role for lasting peace in the region.

In a phone call on Sunday, Erdogan told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that a ceasefire and peace between Moscow and Kiev must be achieved as soon as possible, and the humanitarian situation in the region should be improved.

Erdogan repeated that Turkey would continue to contribute in every possible way during this process.

The ""phone traffic"" that he has been conducting with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is progressing in a positive direction, Erdogan said on Monday.

Turkey has been exerting significant efforts to resolve the crisis through agreement and dialogue, he said. ■

At the beginning of the meeting at the Dolmabahce Palace, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan greeted the delegations and stressed that from the very beginning, Ankara has made “sincere efforts at all levels” to find a political and diplomatic solution to the crisis.

“The talks have given hope to everyone. Prolonging the conflict benefits no one. There are no winners in war. The time has come so that the negotiations yield results. We in Turkey sincerely wish for this and we are ready to help,” the president said.

He stated that the conflict between Moscow and Kiev saddens Turkey and his Government has demonstrated “a fair approach that protects and respects the rights of both sides in all platforms where we have a say.”

Erdogan expressed hope that, if there is a breakthrough at the meeting in Istanbul, negotiations between Russia and Ukraine could reach the next stage, “the contact at the leaders’ level,” for which he said his country is also prepared, TASS news agency reported.

About this issue, in recent statements, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov did not rule out the possibility of a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but clarified that he must be prepared to produce results.

Parallel to Tuesday’s talks, Vladimir Medinsky and David Arajamiya, heads of the negotiation teams of Moscow and Kiev, respectively, are holding a separate round in Istanbul on “the fundamental points of the talks,” Mikhail Podoliak, a member of the Ukrainian mission, reported.

Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine on February 24, after the authorities of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and Lugansk People’s Republic requested help to repel the increase in aggression from Kiev.

They did so over a white tablecloth at a long table inside a 19th-century Ottoman palace on the banks of the Bosporus, welcomed personally by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who greeted them in English with “good morning.”

After more than a month of talks — first in person in Belarus, then in recent weeks by video link — the diplomacy between Ukraine and Russia running in parallel to their war entered a new phase on Tuesday. The fact that the negotiations had become more serious was reflected in the setting, the palace where Mr. Erdogan — who has maintained ties with both Moscow and Kyiv — often holds major government events when in Istanbul.

“As the members of the delegations, you have shouldered a historic responsibility,” Mr. Erdogan told the delegates, addressing them from a podium before an artwork showing birds drifting over Istanbul landmarks. “All the world is expecting good news from you.”

Ukrainian media reported that the Ukrainian delegation has reached for talks and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan delivered the opening remarks.

“Continuing the war will not benefit anyone. Restoring peace will benefit both your two countries and others. You, as a delegation, have a historical responsibility for the decisions that are being made today,” the Turkish president said.

Turkey hosted the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine on the sidelines of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum earlier this month. The talks did not lead to any concrete results barring the agreement on safe evacuation of civilians.

Earlier on Monday, the Kremlin said that at this point talks between Russian president Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky would be counter-productive. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba ahead of the talks in Turkey said that the minimum aim is to solve humanitarian issues while the primary objective will also be to reach a ceasefire and a stable agreement on it. He highlighted that both sides continue to disagree over several issues.

“Ukraine will not give up its sovereignty, territories and people. If Russia again speaks in the language of ultimatums and propaganda clichés, the negotiations will end with nothing,” Kuleba said.

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, however, said that both leaders can meet once both delegations achieve some progress. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov did not open up about what both delegations are expected to discuss in Turkey. He, however, acknowledged that there has been no progress during the talks held previously.

Meanwhile, all eyes are on Turkey who are playing mediator between Russia and Ukraine. Turkey has interest in the war on Ukraine due to Crimean Tatars, who share linguistic and cultural links with Turkey, as well as strong ties with Istabul. The Crimean Tatars opposed the annexation of Crimea back in 2014. The war in Ukraine also allows Erdogan to go closer to the US and the West.

Turkey also bats for Ukraine’s sovereignty and provided Bayraktar drones to the Ukrainian armed forces though now it is reluctant to send more help. Syria also signed the Russian S-400 missile defence system disappointing the US and its allies in 2020. It provides an opportunity to Erdogan to shine at the world stage after being isolated for some time.
