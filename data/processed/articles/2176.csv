Although the Russian military said they didn't attack populated areas in Ukraine, a video shows a missile hitting an airport in Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine.

In the 30-second video shared by a news agency, a missile can be seen falling on the establishment and exploding with a bang. Thick billows of smoke were seen coming out of the building as soon as the missile hit the area.

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, airbases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro. The military, however, said it didn't launch an attack in populated areas.

Explosions were also heard in Ukrainian capital Kyiv. A Kyiv-based journalist told India Today TV that blasts were heard around 5 am on Thursday.

After the initial explosions in Kyiv, people could be heard shouting in the streets. Then a sense of normality returned, with cars circulating and people walking in the streets as a pre-dawn commute appeared to start in relative calm, news agency Associated Press reported.

Ukraine claimed that at least seven people were killed and nine wounded in Russian shelling as of 1:30 pm on Thursday.

The tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine. He said the clashes between Russian and Ukrainian forces are ""inevitable"".

Putin even called on Ukrainian service members to ""lay down their arms and go home"". He said the special military action was ""aimed at demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine"".",https://www.indiatoday.in/world/russia-ukraine-war/story/russia-attacks-ukraine-video-shows-missile-hitting-ivano-frankivsk-airport-1917250-2022-02-24

Smoke can be seen billowing from the building after the strike, which also created a large bang as the missile smashed into its target.

The footage surfaced shortly after Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s military to undertake a ""special operation"" in Ukraine, which has since been described as a ""full-scale invasion"".

In response, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky introduced martial law across the country, urging citizens to remain calm in the face of the attack.
