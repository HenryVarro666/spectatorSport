Russian forces carried out a ""direct strike"" on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday.

""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity!"" the president said, in a tweet that included video footage that he said was from the hospital. ""How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?""

The video posted by Zelenskyy shows a series of brightly painted rooms with their floors littered with broken glass and debris from chunks of drywall that were blown apart. In one room, a tiny pink changing pad still sat atop its table, with supplies tucked underneath. Small mattresses and what looks to be a crib were also splayed on the floor.

The footage did not show anyone who was injured, although a trail of blood was seen in one area. A sequence focusing on the scene outside shows at least one small fire burning, amid several burned-out vehicles. Parts of trees were apparently snapped off. The hospital building's windows were blown out; its facade lay in tatters on the ground.

The Mariupol City Council posted the same video to its Telegram channel, along with other scenes of the devastation — including a massive crater in the hospital's courtyard.

News of the attack in Mariupol emerged after the port city's deputy mayor said Russia's military had violated a temporary cease-fire, firing on evacuation points that were meant to help civilians reach safety.

Deputy Mayor Serhiy Orlov said around 1,200 civilians have died in Mariupol since Russia launched its invasion two weeks ago, forcing the city to use mass graves to dispose of bodies.

Electricity, water and sewage lines have been cut, he said, adding that when construction crews tried to repair power lines, Russian forces fired on them.

""It's like medieval times. The only way to cook food is on an open fire,"" Orlov told reporters on a Zoom call. Residents are melting snow for water, he added. The city's main gas line was bombed two days ago.

Earlier Wednesday, Russian and Ukrainian officials confirmed that Russian forces had agreed to pause attacks to allow civilians to flee through six humanitarian corridors. One of those was supposed to flow out of Mariupol.

Three evacuation points were arranged this morning, Orlov said.

""Within an hour, these sites were fired on,"" he told reporters. ""No humanitarian corridor was allowed today.""

Some 200,000 people want to flee Mariupol, but only a tiny fraction have been able to do so, Orlov said. Civilian vehicles have been unable to leave for five days.

""Every time, they [Russian forces] mine the road, put in a checkpoint or shell the road,"" he said. ""These are the darkest of times.""

And a senior administration official says providing Ukraine with MiG fighter jets remains a priority for the administration, even after the US rejected Poland's proposal to transfer them first to the US, senior administration officials say.

While the White House was caught by surprise when Poland made its offer publicly, officials do not believe the episode precludes coming to some type of agreement that would allow the jets to get to Ukraine.

But at the same time, Tuesday's disagreement underscores the logistical difficulties that have so far prevented Ukraine from securing the jets. And officials indicated that the odds are stacked against finding a solution to provide the jets and that there are no immediate apparent solutions to facilitate the delivery.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday the United States is continuing to consult with Poland and other NATO allies on how to provide fighter jets to Ukraine.

“I think what we're seeing is that Poland’s proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security systems. We have to make sure that we're doing it the right way,” Blinken said at a press conference at the State Department.

There are also a handful of other countries with the jets — including Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria — and officials are not ruling out talks with those nations as they seek a way forward. One official said that Ukraine's initial request was directed at Poland, plus those three countries, but that Poland was the only country initially willing to entertain a possible jet transfer.

Officials describe the issue as two-fold: a logistics problem of getting the jets to Ukraine, and a political problem of avoiding escalation with Russia. US officials described the Polish plan as failing to adequately address both.

One administration official said the US was concerned Russia could interpret jets flying into Ukraine from a NATO base as an attack.

Another official said pressure to get the jets to Ukraine noticeably ramped up after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded with US lawmakers to facilitate a transfer during a Zoom call on Saturday morning.

Prior to the call, US officials had downplayed the prospects of helping with a transfer of the MiG planes, which Ukrainian pilots have been trained to fly. Officials said they were focused mainly on other areas of security assistance, including sending anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. The logistical challenges of getting the aircraft to Ukraine appeared to some officials an unworkable challenge, and they questioned how effective the planes would be.

But Zelensky’s request on the call, which lawmakers described as impassioned, seemed to change the calculus. Immediately after the session ended, both Republicans and Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, came out in support.

That left the administration with little choice but to publicly get behind the idea, even if some officials were skeptical. By Sunday, Blinken said the US was working with Polish officials to transfer the planes to Ukraine and “backfill” with US jets.

An administration official said the bilateral relationship between the two countries remains strong and that the additional US security assistance has continued to flow into Ukraine via Poland, including in the last day.

Ukraine has accused Russia of bombing a children’s hospital and maternity ward in the besieged port city of Mariupol, wounding 17 people and trapping children and others under the rubble in what it called “a war crime without justification”.

Russia had said it would hold fire to let thousands of civilians flee Mariupol and other besieged cities on Wednesday, but Mariupol’s city council said the hospital had been hit several times by an air strike.

“The destruction is colossal,” it said in an online post.

The ground shook more than a mile away when the Mariupol complex was hit by the series of blasts that blew out windows and ripped away much of the front of one building.

Footage from the scene showed police and soldiers rushing to the scene to evacuate victims, carrying out a heavily pregnant and bleeding woman on a stretcher as light snow drifted down on burning and mangled cars and trees shattered by the blast.

Another woman wailed as she clutched her child. In the courtyard, a blast crater extended at least two stories deep.

“Today Russia committed a huge crime,” said Volodymir Nikulin, a top regional police official, standing in the ruins. “It is a war crime without any justification.”

‘Close the sky right now’

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also shared footage on Twitter from the scene of the alleged attack, which appeared to show several wrecked rooms along a corridor in a building that had blown-out windows. Outside of the building, a square carpeted with rubble and debris could be seen.

“How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity,” Zelenskyy said.

Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the footage.

When asked by Reuters news agency for comment, a spokesman for the Kremlin said: “Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets.”

In a televised address later on Wednesday, Zelenskky accused Russia of “genocide”.

He also repeated his call for the West to tighten sanctions on Russia “so that they sit down at the negotiating table and end this brutal war”. The bombing of the children’s hospital, he said, was “proof that a genocide of Ukrainians is taking place”.

The Donetsk region’s governor said 17 people were wounded in the attack, including women in labour. The reports could not immediately be verified.

The United Nations Human Rights body said it was verifying the number of casualties at Mariupol.

“The incident adds to our deep concerns about indiscriminate use of weapons in populated areas and civilians trapped in active hostilities in numerous areas,” said spokesperson Liz Throssell.

‘Barbaric, depraved’

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the attack “horrific”

“Civilians are paying the highest price for a war that has nothing to do with them. This senseless violence must stop,” he said on Twitter. “End the bloodshed now.”

The White House also slammed the “barbaric” use of force after the apparent Russian air strike.

“It is horrifying to see the type of, the barbaric use of military force to go after innocent civilians in a sovereign country,” Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin “to account for his terrible crimes”.

“There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless,” he said in a post on Twitter.

Authorities had announced new ceasefires on Wednesday morning to allow thousands of civilians to escape from towns around Kyiv as well as in Mariupol, Enerhodar and Volnovakha, Izyum in the east and Sumy in the northeast.

Previous attempts to establish safe evacuation corridors largely failed because of what the Ukrainians said were Russian attacks. But Putin, in a telephone call with Germany’s chancellor, accused Ukrainian nationalists of hampering the evacuations.

About 200,000 people in Mariupol are waiting to flee violence as the humanitarian situation is reportedly growing more desperate by the day.

The port city has been without water, heat, functioning sanitation systems or phone connections for the past week, with bodies lying uncollected on the streets and residents relying on streams or melting snow for drinking water. Continued shelling has also prevented repairs to damaged heating and water infrastructure.

Earlier on Wednesday Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia had broken the ceasefire around the southern port, which lies between Russian-backed separatist areas of eastern Ukraine and Crimea, annexed by Moscow from Ukraine in 2014.

“Russia continues holding hostage over 400,000 people in Mariupol, blocks humanitarian aid and evacuation. Indiscriminate shelling continues,” he wrote on Twitter. “Almost 3,000 newborn babies lack medicine and food.”

Ukraine said at least 1,170 civilians had been killed in Mariupol since the start of the invasion, and 47 were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. It was not possible to verify the figures.

The United Nations human rights office in Geneva, just prior to the reports of the hospital attack, said it had verified 516 civilian deaths and 908 people wounded since the conflict began.

Among those towns was Irpin, a once-quiet suburb that has been decimated by Russian artillery.

On Tuesday, BuzzFeed News witnessed residents desperately scrambling to flee from Irpin as shells exploded around them. Volunteers rushed in with ambulances and yellow city buses to evacuate them to central Kyiv and the main railway station, where many caught trains to the west of the country and Poland.

On Wednesday morning, the Chornobyl (often transliterated from Russian as “Chernobyl”) Nuclear Power Plant, which Russia seized along with its expansive and radioactive exclusion zone early in the invasion, lost power, officials said.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Wednesday’s power loss violates a “key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply” but reassured the public that there is “no critical impact on safety.”

Russia’s control of Chornobyl — the site of the 1986 disaster that exposed thousands to dangerous radiation levels — has raised widespread fears over potential nuclear dangers. Since its seizure on Feb. 24, more than 200 of the plant’s staff members have been forced to work under stressful conditions. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi has demanded that the employees be allowed to rest and rotate shifts so as to not put nuclear safety at additional risk.

“I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety,” Grossi said in a statement Tuesday. “I call on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there.”

Russian forces also seized Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest power plant in Europe, on Friday after attacking part of the facility and causing a fire that was eventually contained. The plant’s staff are being “held hostage” and “are physically and psychologically exhausted,” according to Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Hlushchenko.",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/christopherm51/ukraine-maternity-hospital-russia-strike

Kirillo Taimoshenko, deputy head of Zelensky’s office, said officials were trying to determine the number of people killed or injured. The Ministry of External Affairs has also shared the video of the hospital destroyed in the attack.

Regional governor Pavlo Kirilenko said on Wednesday that Russia carried out an airstrike on a children’s hospital in Mariupol during an agreed ceasefire period (which was to allow the evacuation of civilians from the besieged southern city). He said that 17 people were injured in the attack, including labor women.

A maternity hospital in the Ukraine port city of Mariupol was heavily damaged by a Russian airstrike on Wednesday, leaving at least 17 people injured or wounded, Ukrainian officials told The Associated Press.

Video and photos showed scorched vehicles and trees outside the building and people helping the injured leave the area, including a pregnant woman on a stretcher. The Associated Press said the blast created a crater at least two stories deep, blew out windows and ripped away much of the building’s front. No fatalities were immediately reported.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted a video that showed rubble and broken furniture in what appears to be the interior of the hospital.
