He stressed the Russian invasion is a catastrophe for the European continent.

As reported, the head of the aggressor country, Vladimir Putin, announced the start of a special military operation in Donbas. At around 04:00, on February 24, Russia attacked Ukraine and launched a war.

The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved President Volodymyr Zelensky's decree on the imposition of martial law throughout Ukraine.

The Prime Minister tweeted his remarks after chairing an urgent Cobra emergency committee meeting on Thursday morning, as Moscow launched a wide-ranging attack on Ukraine, hitting cities and bases with air strikes or shelling.

Mr Johnson is due to make a televised address to the nation at midday before speaking in the Commons in the evening.

The Prime Minister said: “This is a catastrophe for our continent.

“I will make an address to the nation this morning on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“I will also speak to fellow G7 leaders and I am calling for an urgent meeting of all Nato leaders as soon as possible.”

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss summoned Russian ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin, for the second time this week, to explain the “illegal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”.

Ms Truss said: “We will be imposing severe sanctions and rallying countries in support of Ukraine.”

Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg condemned the invasion as a “blatant violation” of international law and said he is calling a virtual summit of alliance leaders on Friday to discuss the “serious threat” to security in the region.

“This is a grave moment for the security of Europe. Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine is putting countless lives at risk,” he said from Nato’s headquarters in Brussels.

It came as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky declared martial law and urged people to stay indoors, amid reports of missile strikes and explosions across the country.

Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, accused Mr Putin of “bringing war back to Europe”.

Mr Zelensky called on Ukrainian nationals to volunteer for the resistance effort.

He said: “We will give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.

“We will lift sanctions on all citizens of Ukraine who are ready to defend our country as part of territorial defence with weapons in hands.

“We have severed diplomatic relations with Russia. For all those who have not yet lost their conscience in Russia, it is time to go out and protest against the war with Ukraine.”

Russia said it has only targeted Ukrainian air bases and other military assets, not populated areas.

But in a televised address, Mr Putin warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to “consequences they have never seen”.

He said Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine, and claimed responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian “regime”.

Foreign Office minister James Cleverly described the comments as “bully” tactics and said the UK will respond with “unprecedented” sanctions “to punish the appalling decision” by Russia’s leader.

A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Johnson had assured Mr Zelensky during an early-morning telephone call that the West will “not stand by as President Putin waged his campaign against the Ukrainian people”.

Explosions could be heard in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, shortly after Mr Putin’s address, while explosions were also reported in the cities of Odesa and Kharkiv.

Elsewhere, footage appeared to show queues of people fleeing their homes, and Russian military crossing the border into Ukraine.

Mr Putin said the action was a response to threats from Ukraine.

And in a warning to the international community during his address on Russian television, he said: “Whoever tries to impede us, let alone create threats for our country and its people, must know that the Russian response will be immediate and lead to the consequences you have never seen in history.”

Foreign Office minister Mr Cleverly rubbished his explanation.

He told BBC Breakfast: “If Vladimir Putin thinks that he can scare the international community away from supporting Ukrainians in defence of their homeland, he is absolutely wrong on that and should be under absolutely no illusion that we will continue to support the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian people.”

In other developments:

– Transport Secretary Grant Shapps instructed the Civil Aviation Authority to ensure airlines avoid Ukraine airspace “following the horrific events overnight”.

– The UK’s ambassador in Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, repeated a call for Britons to leave the country.

– Leaders of the G7 nations – the UK, US, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan – will have a virtual meeting to consider their response.

– Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, condemned Russia’s “vile act of war” against Ukraine, and also criticised the UK Government for imposing “weak” sanctions on Monday.

– European Commission president Ms von der Leyen said a package of massive and targeted sanctions will be presented to European leaders for approval.

– Airlines have begun suspending flights to and from Ukraine.

Former Cabinet minister David Davis called for Nato allies to provide air support to the Ukrainian army to assist the fight against Russian invaders while imposing the “most ferocious sanctions” against Moscow.

The senior Tory MP tweeted: “If Nato does not act now, Ukraine will be defeated in a matter of days.

“Therefore if we do not provide military support, more than 40 million Ukrainians will go from living in a democracy to living under a brutal dictatorship.

“It is far too late to get boots on the ground but it is not too late to provide air support to the Ukrainian army which may neutralise Putin’s overwhelming armoured superiority.”

Home Secretary Priti Patel said officials are on alert for cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns from Moscow.

“Be in no doubt there is work ongoing across Government 24/7 to maximise our resilience to any such attacks, which would be met with a suitably robust response,” she said.

The UK Foreign Office advised British nationals to leave Ukraine “immediately if you judge it is safe to do so”.

It added: “If you cannot leave safely, you should stay indoors, away from windows, and remain alert to developments that would allow you to leave safely.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/boris-johnson-ukraine-vladimir-putin-ursula-von-der-leyen-volodymyr-zelensky-b2022215.html

PM: 'We cannot and will not just look away'

As he pledged the UK's support for Ukraine, Mr Johnson appeared to dismiss any notion of 1930s-style appeasement in dealing with the crisis.

""This is not, in the infamous phrase, some 'faraway country of which we know little',"" he said, a reference to a speech by Neville Chamberlain in 1938 about the German annexation of the Sudetenland.

""We have Ukrainian friends in this country; neighbours, co-workers. Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy and the right to choose its own destiny.

""We and the world cannot allow that freedom just to be snubbed out. We cannot and will not just look away.""

Johnson's statement to the nation in full

The PM said the mission of the UK and its allies was ""clear"", adding: ""Diplomatically, politically, economically and - eventually - militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.""

He warned that Russian soldiers would ""lose their lives"" in the coming conflict and told the Russian people that Mr Putin's regime would be given ""pariah status"".

Russia intends to seize and control a large section of Ukraine, according to Western officials.

Their current assessment of Russian military movements indicates that Kyiv, Odessa, Mariupol and separatist areas in Ukraine's Donbas region could all be targeted.

They said it was unclear whether taking control of the whole of Ukraine was an immediate objective of the Kremlin.

PM brands Putin 'the Russian dictator'

In a message to Ukraine's 44 million people in his TV address, the PM said: ""If the months ahead are grim and the flame of freedom burns low, I know that it will blaze bright again in Ukraine.

""Because for all his bombs and tanks and missiles, I don't believe that the Russian dictator will ever subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians and their passionate belief that their country should be free.""

Mr Johnson said the UK and its allies will work ""for however long it takes to ensure that the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is restored"".

He also assured Britons that the government will ""do everything to keep our country safe"" after Mr Putin's threats ""against those who stand with Ukraine"".

The Russian president is suggested to have been making reference to nuclear war when, in comments as the attack on Ukraine began, he warned of ""consequences you have never seen in history"" to those who tried to impede him.

The PM described Russia's ""act of wanton and reckless aggression"" as an ""attack not just on Ukraine"" but ""an attack on democracy and freedom in eastern Europe and around the world"".

He added: ""This crisis is about the right of a free sovereign, independent European people to choose their own future. That is a right that the UK will always defend.""

Downing Street later clarified that Mr Johnson's reference to ""militarily"" facing down Russia was an ""expectation that the Ukrainian people will fight, will engage with Russian forces"".

The PM's official spokesman added that Britain was providing ""defensive military capability"" to Ukraine.

PM to unveil 'unprecedented sanctions' as Russian ambassador summoned

Mr Johnson was due to speak with fellow G7 leaders on Thursday and is calling for an urgent meeting of all NATO leaders as soon as possible following Russia's latest aggression against its neighbour.

He held calls with Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Store and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Downing Street said Mr Johnson ""described this morning's scenes as the most horrific act of aggression in his political lifetime"" in his call with Mr Scholz.

At about 5pm, Mr Johnson will also address the Commons where he is expected to give details of more punitive measures on Russia.

Foreign Office minister James Cleverly earlier told Sky News that the UK would bring forward ""an unprecedented level of sanctions"" with the aim it will ""hopefully persuade the people around Vladimir Putin this is completely the wrong thing to do"".

Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay, also the PM's chief of staff, said Mr Johnson would unveil ""overwhelming sanctions"" when he speaks in the Commons.

These are likely to be coordinated with the US and EU, as well as other Western allies.

Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss summoned the Russian ambassador to meet with her on Thursday to ""explain Russia's illegal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine"".

A Foreign Office source said: ""It was a heated meeting. Liz kicked him out early.

""She said he should be ashamed of himself, that Russia has lied repeatedly and lost its last shred of credibility with the international community.""

Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government would be ""especially mindful of the potential for cyber attacks and disinformation emanating from Russia"".

""Be in no doubt there is work ongoing across government 24/7 to maximise our resilience to any such attacks, which would be met with a suitably robust response,"" she posted on Twitter.

Mr Johnson chaired a meeting of the government's emergency COBRA committee at 7.30am on Thursday morning following a 4am call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Putin's ""bandit rule"" must fail, adding: ""This must be a turning point in our history.

""We must look back and say that this terrible day was actually when Putin doomed himself to defeat.

""He seeks division, so we must stay united. He hopes for inaction, so we must take a stand.

""He believes that we are too corrupted to do the right thing, so we must prove him wrong. I believe we can, but only if we stand together.""

Tory MPs calls for NATO air support for Ukraine

The PM previously announced a ""first tranche"" of sanctions against Russia on Tuesday after Mr Putin initially ordered his troops to move into two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.

Those sanctions targeted five Russian banks and three oligarchs, freezing their UK assets and banning travel to Britain.

However, the package was met with a lukewarm response in the Commons with many MPs - including senior Conservatives - calling on the PM to go further and faster in punishing Mr Putin's regime and those close to it.

After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday, a string of Conservative MPs called for NATO countries to provide air support to the Ukrainian army.

""Whether we like it or not Putin has effectively declared war on the West,"" former Cabinet minister David Davis posted on Twitter.

""While we should continue to impose the most ferocious sanctions they are no longer a deterrent. They are a punishment. They will not stop him.

Crispin Blunt, a former chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said the UK ""must give Ukraine any help they need in the air and in cyber space"".
