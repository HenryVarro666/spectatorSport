CNN reported that the citizen was identified as James Whitney Hill, 67, who was born in Minnesota. The outlet cited Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Interior Minister.

Blinken said during a briefing that he had no further details about the incident yet.

The Pentagon would not confirm the death, while the State Department told The Hill no more details could be shared at this time.

Police in the Ukrainian region of Chernihiv said in a Facebook post that an American was among the people killed by a heavy artillery attack but did not detail where in the city the attack occurred.

Chernihiv, located in the northeast of Kyiv, has been under heavy bombardment from Russian forces, with its governor estimating that 53 people were brought to morgues in the past 24 hours, The Associated Press reported.

The news follows the death of U.S. journalist Brent Renaud, an independent filmmaker who had previously contributed to The New York Times.

Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, launching a full-scale assault that has faced stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces heading into the fourth week of the campaign.

The U.S. has said it will not put troops on the grounds and has resisted calls for a no-fly zone over Ukraine over fears it could spark a larger conflict with Russia.

The Department of State issued “do not travel” advisories to U.S. citizens for Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.

WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - A U.S. citizen who had been caring for his partner in a Ukrainian hospital was killed by Russian fire as he waited in a bread line after briefly stepping out to buy food, his family said on Thursday.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed the death of an American, identified by his sisters as Jimmy Hill and mourned as ""the helper that people could find in a crisis"".

One of his sisters, Katya Hill, told CNN he had stayed in the hospital in Chernihiv, the site of heavy Russian bombardment during its invasion, to be alongside his Ukrainian partner as she battled multiple sclerosis.

""As things were deteriorating in the city ... my brother was the one that was going out to the store to bring back what food he could find,"" she told CNN.

Another of his sisters, Cheryl Hill Gordon, wrote on Facebook that her brother was waiting in a bread line with several others on Wednesday when they were gunned down by Russian forces.

Reuters could not independently verify the circumstances of his death. Chernihiv police said an American had been killed by Russian shelling. Blinken did not offer any details.

Hill's own Facebook posts gave a glimpse of the situation on the frontline as he repeatedly wrote about explosions, food shortages and intense bombing during the Russian assault.

""Intense bombing! still alive. Limited food. Room very cold,"" Hill said in his last Facebook post on Tuesday. In another post on the same day, he wrote that ""bombing has intensified"".

Hill's Facebook profile identified him as a teacher at universities in Kyiv and Warsaw. He was a native of Minnesota.

At least 53 civilians have been killed in the frontline city of Chernihiv over the past 24 hours, said Viacheslav Chaus, the region's governor. The toll could not be independently verified. read more

Russia denies targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine.

Food and other basic necessities have been scarce amid Russia's bombardment. Hill's sister, Katya, said her brother had kept a stash of chocolates with him in the hospital.

That allowed Hill to ""hand out chocolates whenever somebody was depressed, or just needed a little encouragement.""

2,0732e76f-0ae4-45d3-9ea5-c2c055b213c0,"['Tucker Reals', 'Tucker Reals Is The Cbsnews.Com Foreign Editor', 'Based At The Cbs News London Bureau.']",,"Russian forces have been blamed for the death of a second U.S. citizen in Ukraine. After the war broke out, Minnesota native James Hill remained in the besieged northeastern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, very near Russia's border, to look after his partner Irina, who was being treated at a local hospital for multiple sclerosis.

An adviser to Ukraine's interior minister identified Hill as one of the victims of a Russian attack on Thursday morning that targeted people lining up for food in Chernihiv. There were conflicting reports as to whether the civilians were hit by gun or artillery fire. The city is among the major population centers in eastern and southern Ukraine that have been decimated by Russian shelling for days as Vladimir Putin's ground forces remain bogged down by logistical problems and fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Hill's sister Katya, in Pennsylvania, told CBS Pittsburgh that her brother had been living in the capital city of Kyiv, but traveled to Chernihiv for his partner's MS treatment.

""When I was warning him about the dangers, he did not feel that the world would let this happen, because my parents raised us to see the good in peoples' hearts, and that's how he lived,"" Katya told CBS Pittsburgh.

Speaking overnight to CBS News, she said the last time she spoke with her brother, she could hear explosions in the background.

""He was going out on a daily basis searching for food. The hospital lost electricity. The hospital lost gas. There was no heat,"" she said. ""My brother was a peacemaker, and he was a giver, and he just felt everybody in the world should love each other.""

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed earlier Thursday that another American had died in Ukraine, though he provide no further detail. A State Department spokesperson confirmed the death had occurred on March 17 and offered ""our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss.""

Hill, who leaves behind two children, was the second U.S. citizen to die in Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion. Filmmaker Brent Renaud, 50, was killed when Russian troops opened fire on him and colleagues in the town of Irpin, just outside Kyiv, as they were traveling to film refugees on March 13. One of his associates was injured in the attack.

Veteran Fox News video journalist Pierre Zakrzewski and his local producer Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova were killed just two days later, on March 15, when their vehicle ""was struck by incoming fire"" near Kyiv. Zakrzewski was a European national based in London for Fox, while Kuvshynova was one of the many native Ukrainians who have joined foreign news crews to help report on the war in their country.

Katya Hill told CBS Pittsburgh that her brother had been sharing updates with her every day since Putin ordered his military to invade Ukraine on February 24. She hadn't spoken to him for a few days, however. She said the family learned of Hill's death from the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine.

""After he said that he had no way to charge his phone, then I knew it was a matter of, are we going to hear he's in Poland safe or are we going to get the news that we didn't want to hear?"" Katya Hill said.

""A good person gone too soon,"" U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a tweet, offering her ""deepest sympathies"" to Hill's family.

Jim Hill grew up in Minnesota. His friends knew Jim as a dreamer and a helper — a good person gone too soon. Putin’s senseless war is resulting in so much needless tragedy. My deepest sympathies go out to Jim’s family and loved ones.https://t.co/zeuOEjK2jC — Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) March 17, 2022

""Putin's senseless war is resulting in so much needless tragedy,"" the lawmaker added.

The United Nations has confirmed at least 816 civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia launched its war, with most of the deaths blamed on shelling and airstrikes. That figure includes 59 children, and the U.N.'s human rights agency acknowledges the ""actual toll is much higher.""

James Whitney Hill, 67, was identified by sister Cheryl Hill Gordon in a post on Facebook.

“My brother Jimmy Hill was killed yesterday in Chernihiv, Ukraine,” Cheryl Gordon wrote.

“He was waiting in a bread line with several other people when they were gunned down by Russian military [snipers]. His body was found in the street by the local police.”

The first American citizen killed in Ukraine was identified as Jimmy Hill.

Earlier Thursday, the US Embassy in Kyiv said Russian forces fatally shot 10 people in the attack, which Russia denied as a hoax.

In a brief phone interview, Gordon said another brother was notified of Hill’s slaying by the State Department.

Hill had been living in Ukraine and working as a teacher for the past 25 years. she said.

He became romantically involved with a former student, Irina, who’s in her 40s and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis about eight years ago, Gordon said.

The couple was in Chernihiv because “after two years of searching,” Hill found a hospital there with a doctor who “knew much more about MS than other doctors in the area,” she said.

“He finally got her into the hospital in January,” his sister said. “Once the war broke out, he made the decision to stay.”

Hill “was actually trying to get her out of there, but Irina was in poor condition,” she said.

“She would have needed an ambulance to get her out and there was no way to get her out,” Gordon said.

“The hospital was running out of food, so he went out to food and that’s how he was killed.”

Hill had to return to the US periodically to satisfy Ukrainian visa requirements and he owned property in Idaho near Yellowstone National Park that his brother rented out as an Airbnb when Hill wasn’t there, Gordon said.

On Tuesday, a friend, Karin Moseley, told Idaho TV station Local News 8 that Hill had been “thrust into literally the middle of hell” after traveling to Ukraine in December.

Gordon said she hadn’t spoken with Hill recently because he had difficulty charging his phone and getting service since the invasion, but was able to communicate with him through Facebook.

In a series of harrowing posts this week, Hill — who is survived by a son, Kai Troje Hill — described the deteriorating situation.

“We are trapped in Chernihiv. They bomb here every night. People discouraged. Food shortages, gas, running water, some electricity..there is a siege here…” he wrote on Sunday.

“We are trying to come up with a plan. We need to get out of here. We want to take a family with children out with us. Its not safe here. But its not safe.”

On Monday, he wrote, “We are hanging in there…very coold inside. food portions are reduced..bombing and explosions most of the night..hard to sleep. People getting depressed.”

“We could try a break out tomorrow but Ira’s mom doesnt want to. Each day people are killed trying to escape. But bombs falling here at night. Risk either way…I only have wifi a few hours a day. We have enough food for a few days..”

His two final posts came Tuesday, when he wrote, “Intense bombing! still alive. Limited food. Room very cold.”

“Not allowed to take photos. Spies throughout city. Bombing has intensified noway out,” he added.

Earlier, he blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for causing the deadly chaos and rued the day he was conceived.

A map shows the areas of Ukraine threatened by Russian forces.

“There is bad luck in this world and it’s falling down all over Ukraine and it’s people now,” he wrote on March 7.

“It’s nobodies fault except the psychos in the Kremlin, one man especially. His miserable existence is bad luck for everyone.”

Hill added: “Of all the millions of his father’s sperm to find his mom’s egg, he made it. Were condoms available in Russia 69 years ago?”",https://nypost.com/2022/03/17/us-citizen-killed-in-ukraine-as-russians-shell-chernihiv/
