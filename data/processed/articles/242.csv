Thousands of others, unable to find safe passage or not sure they want to leave Kharkiv, are living permanently in shelters like the subway station.

Station staff estimate that between 1,000 and 3,000 people stay in the station each day, down from more than 5,000 people a week ago, since many have managed to flee. Some have lived in these conditions since the first day of the war.

“Anything is better than sleeping at home with bombs,” said Ina, one of the involuntary underground residents. (She declined to give her full name out of security concerns.) “The conditions here are very bad. We wouldn’t be here if we weren’t very scared.” Ina is sheltering alone with her two young children.

With few trappings of comfort, people sleep on cold marble floors in every foot of space, from locker rooms to hallways. Entire families have set up tiny temporary homes in stationary train cars. It’s claustrophobic, the air is thick, and it smells of sweat. It feels like a tomb for the thankfully not yet dead.







Hundreds of people use each bathroom, with a table set up on one side to hold their food and toiletries: Milk and cookies sit next to soap and shampoo. People look exhausted, and paranoia is rampant. I am accused of being a Russian saboteur at least three times.

Just over two weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, Western officials are warning that Kharkiv could soon be encircled. Hundreds of people have already been killed out of the city’s pre-war population of 1.4 million, but Russia seems determined to grind on. Russian state media has claimed Ukraine is operating U.S.-backed chemical and biological weapons laboratories in Kharkiv, a claim amplified by Russian diplomats at the United Nations and Chinese diplomats abroad. Western officials warn it could mean Russia is about to use “unconventional weapons.”

Russian attempts to quickly seize the capital and major cities were met with an unexpectedly solid Ukrainian resistance. Russia’s solution appears to be the tactic it already perfected in Chechnya and Syria: raining wholesale destruction on besieged cities. Mariupol, a key export hub in southern Ukraine, has been mauled by deliberate Russian strikes, including attacks on maternity hospitals.

Kharkiv has been hit with particular cruelty. Street after street has been destroyed, pockmarked with craters and covered with rubble and twisted steel. Residential neighborhoods and its historic downtown have been targeted, and at least 48 schools have been destroyed. A residential home for the disabled was hit by an airstrike on Friday while at least 400 high-rise apartment buildings have been hammered. Residents are left with no heating in sub-zero temperatures amid relentless shelling and missile strikes, according to Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov.

In Kharkiv, like much of the eastern Donbass region, most people speak Russian, and many previously had sympathy for Moscow. The cruelty is hard for them to fathom. Moscow denies it has targeted civilians. Instead, Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a special operation to “de-Nazify” the country.







“The other night, Nikolsky shopping mall was destroyed,” said Ivan, a handyman at the subway station who is now volunteering to help people who live there. “There were so many beautiful places in this city, but Russia ruined everything. I drive through the city, and I can’t recognize it anymore. It’s so painful to see.”

“My family wants to leave Kharkiv,” Ivan added, who also asked to withhold his last name out of fear of reprisals. “My girlfriend also tells me to leave. We have relatives in the west of Ukraine, but I don’t want to leave my station.”

With few businesses open and few people going to work, volunteer units have mobilized in the days since the war started. Teams like Volunteer Dnipra—which has already set up a 200-vehicle-strong fleet—shuttle in from relatively safer cities like Dnipro, well to the west of Kharkiv, to bring in supplies and take out evacuees.

Ukrainians cling to hope that the international community can help bring a solution to the war. But diplomatic off-ramps seem hard to find. On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, failed to reach a cease-fire agreement.

For those living in dark, dusty, squalid basements and subways, each day that passes means a little less dignity to their living conditions and a lot more resolve.

“Down here, we try not to talk about outside and instead concentrate on living,” Ina said. “But we can’t help but ask, ‘How can something this bad happen in the modern world?’ We just can’t understand it.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/11/life-underground-kharkiv-ukraine-russia/

The man, a platoon leader in the Russian military, according to Ukrainian authorities, said that Vladimir Putin ordered troops to occupy the city of Kharkiv before advancing and capturing other Ukrainian cities.

The soldier, who has not been named, said they were ordered to “open fire” on civilians in Kharkiv after they landed in Ukraine at the start of the Russian invasion on February 24.

“There was an order to seize the city of Kharkiv, occupy all roads, block the exits of civilians and occupy the city,” the video published by the Security Service of Ukraine says.

When asked what other tasks were assigned to the Russian troops when they entered Ukraine, he said: “We had permission to open fire on the team and on all the inhabitants of the city,” adding that there was an order to shoot at civilians.

The captured Russian commander said he was ordered to shoot civilians and was part of a squad sent to capture Kharkov three days later.

The soldier, who said his platoon arrived in Ukraine on February 24, added that their task was to capture Kharkiv within three days.

But two weeks after Russia launched its barbaric invasion, Kharkiv is still under Ukrainian control. But the city continues to come under heavy shelling from surrounding Russian troops, with local forces reporting artillery fire.

As a result of the shelling in Kharkov, four people died overnight, two of them children, a five-year-old girl was injured and taken to the hospital. Rescuers said that they continue to extract people from under the rubble of houses in Slobozhansky.

The footage shows a destroyed shopping center in Kharkiv after the city came under Russian air strikes. Another video shows the military searching the mall.

The Nikolsky shopping center is destroyed after being shelled during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in Kharkiv, Ukraine.

The captured Russian soldier said he was falsely told he was entering Ukraine as a “peacekeeper” to “liberate Ukraine from the Nazis”.

He was later captured after a firefight between his platoon and Ukrainian soldiers. The man was taken to the nearest forest by another Russian soldier, who was also captured by Ukrainian troops.

The video was released just days after a captured Russian commander begged “for mercy” for Putin’s forces attacking Ukraine, saying they had been tricked into invading into falsely believing the government had been overthrown by the Nazis and needed to be released.

The man, who said he was a lieutenant colonel in the Russian National Guard’s special rapid reaction unit, said his compatriots were brainwashed into supporting the war, but after seeing the situation in Ukraine with his own eyes, he is now “ashamed.” in participating in the “genocide” and says that the Ukrainians are “right” to resist.

Astakhov Dmitry Mikhailovich said his doubts were strengthened when he saw two of his favorite boxers – Alexander Usik and Vasily Lomachenko – agree to fight for the resistance.

And in a scathing message delivered to the Russian troops who are still fighting, he said: “I beg you, stop before it is too late… Russia cannot win here.

“If someone came to my territory, I would do the same as these people, and I would be right. They are right now.

Astakhov Dmitry Mikhailovich (pictured) said: “I beg you, stop before it’s too late … Russia cannot be defeated here”

“Guys, be bold. It’s easier for me, I’m already in this situation. You are in a tense situation, going against your own commander.

“But this is genocide, people are just being killed.”

This echoes statements by other Russian prisoners interviewed by the Ukrainian military, who said that the order to attack was received on short notice, that they were told that the Ukrainian government had been overthrown, and that they were going to the “liberators” who should only wait for the light. resistance. Instead, they ended up in a bloodbath.

None of their stories can be verified, and all statements were probably given under some pressure.

But the sequence with which the same story is told – by soldiers of different units fighting in different parts of the country, who did not have time to align their stories – is amazing.

Analysts and witnesses say it comes as the battle for Kyiv is underway, with Russian tanks only a few miles closer to the outskirts of the city, though initial attacks to the west and east of the capital have been repulsed as Putin’s troops face a long and bloody campaign. to try to take the capital.

Destroyed buildings and cars are seen in Kharkiv on Wednesday after Russian troops bombed the area.

On Wednesday, Kremlin forces launched two attacks on Kyiv – one through the besieged western city of Irpin and another through the eastern district of Brovara, with video showing a column of Russian tanks and armored vehicles being fired upon by artillery in a devastating ambush and forced to turn back.

Colonel Andrey Zakharov, commander of a tank regiment, also died in the ambush, according to the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and intercepted Russian radio communications on the battlefield. The same reports stated that the column had suffered heavy losses, with one tank and one armored vehicle destroyed.

This is the latest Russian commander killed in Ukraine after Kiev troops killed two generals. Colonel Zakharov was awarded the Order of Courage by Vladimir Putin in 2016.

Vadim Denisenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, said Ukrainian forces had also managed to stop the attack in Irpen and had launched a counterattack on Thursday morning, continuing the fighting.

“The night was quite difficult, but in general it can be said that the Ukrainian army counterattacked near Kiev,” he said. “There are no additional details yet.” Fighting was also reported southwest of Kyiv as Putin’s men continued their efforts to encircle the city.

This means a Russian mission to attack the Ukrainian capital is now underway, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War said amid fears that devastating airstrikes on the city of Mariupol that hit a maternity hospital have killed three, including including a six-year-old child. the girl – and the Kharkiv citizen could soon be seen in the capital.

President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is still in Kyiv, said on Thursday that his “heart is breaking at what the occupiers have done to our cities, our country and what they want to do to our people,” whom he said need “urgent help”.

Zelensky said that humanitarian corridors were being urgently organized from the shelled cities to evacuate civilians and deliver aid packages, which had mixed success. Some 35,000 people were able to flee the cities attacked by Russian troops on Wednesday, he said, including from the suburbs of Kyiv and the eastern city of Sumy.

However, there is no food, no water, no electricity for the residents of severely damaged Mariupol, which has been under shelling for more than a week. Today, the column tried to reach the city to deliver supplies, but it is not known if it managed to break through by noon. Four previous attempts to help the city failed after Ukraine said Russia had shelled a route it intended to use.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said today that the city had turned into a fortress before the Russian assault, and about 2 million people – half of the inhabitants of the capital’s metro – fled.

“Every street, every house is being fortified, territorial defense is being activated. Even people who never intended to change clothes in their lives are now in uniform with machine guns in their hands,” he said in a televised address.

The military also warned civilians not to venture outside the city as Russian vehicles were seen only a few miles away. If Putin’s men can surround Kyiv, they will have to bombard it, as they did with other cities such as Mariupol, Kharkov and Chernihiv.",https://olxpraca.com/russian-pow-says-told-shoot-civilians-unit-sent-capture-kharkiv-htmlns_mchannelrssns_campaign1490ito1490/
