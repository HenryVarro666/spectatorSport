Shortly after 4 o’ clock this morning I spoke to president Zelenskyy of Ukraine to offer the continued support of the UK

because our worst fears have now come true and all our warnings have proved tragically accurate

President Putin of Russia has unleashed war in our European continent. He has attacked a friendly country without any provocation and without any credible excuse

Innumerable missiles and bombs have been raining down on an entirely innocent population

A vast invasion is underway by land by sea and by air.

And this is not in the infamous phrase some faraway country of which we know little

We have Ukrainian friends in this country; neighbours, co-workers

Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy and the right to choose its own destiny

We – and the world – cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away.

It is because we have been so alarmed in recent months at the Russian intimidation that the UK became one of the first countries in Europe to send defensive weaponry to help the Ukrainians

Other allies have now done the same and we will do what more we can in the days ahead

Today in concert with our allies we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy

And to that end we must also collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that for too long has given Putin his grip on western politics

Our mission is clear

Diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure

And so I say to the people of Russia, whose president has just authorised a tidal wave of violence against a fellow Slavic people

The parents of Russian soldiers who will lose their lives.

I cannot believe this is being done in your name or that you really want the pariah status it will bring to the Putin regime

and I say to the Ukrainians in this moment of agony

we are with you we are praying for you and your families

and we are on your side

And if the months ahead are grim, and the flame of freedom burns low

I know that it will blaze bright again in Ukraine

because for all his bombs and tanks and missiles I don’t believe that the Russian dictator will ever subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians and their passionate belief that their country should be free

and I say to the British people and all who have heard the threats from Putin against those who stand with Ukraine

we will of course do everything to keep our country safe

We are joined in our outrage by friends and allies around the world

We will work with them – for however long it takes – to ensure that the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is restored

because this act of wanton and reckless aggression is an attack not just on Ukraine

It is an attack on democracy and freedom in East Europe and around the world

This crisis is about the right of a free, sovereign independent European people to choose their own future

and that is a right that the UK will always defend.",https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-address-to-the-nation-on-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-24-february-2022

Russian President Vladimir Putin has “unleashed war” on “entirely innocent population” of a “friendly country” without any provocation or credible excuse, Johnson further stated during his address to the United Kingdom.

“Our worst fears have now come true, and all our warnings have proved tragically accurate,” said.

Strengthening his support for Ukraine amid the crisis, the British prime minister said the east European country has for decades enjoyed freedom, democracy and “the right to choose its own destiny”.

“We, and the world, cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out,” the prime minister said during the address.

Johnson said that owing to the Russian intimidation, the UK was the first nation in Europe to send defensive weapons to Ukraine and in the days ahead - as the crisis deepens, he along with other allies, will do what more they can.

“Today, in consent with our allies, we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy. And to that end, we must also collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that have for long given Putin his grip over western politics,” Johnson said.

The British prime minister said that the UK's mission is “clear”, and it is that politically, economically, diplomatically and militarily the “hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure”.

Speaking about Russian people, and directly referring to mothers whose sons are serving as soldiers in the Putin-led nation, the British prime minister said he cannot believe that this is being done “in your name”.

Further, he urged Ukrainians not to lose hope and reiterated that the UK is “on their side”.

“If the months ahead are grim, and the flame of freedom burns low, I know that it will blaze bright again in Ukraine. For all his (Putin's) bombs, tanks and missiles, I don't believe that the Russian dictator will ever subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians and that their passionate belief of their country should be free,” Johnson said while addressing his nation.

Referring to Putin's message of retaliation to any form of opposition against its operation in Ukraine, the British prime minister said that his country along with its allies will do everything to ensure the freedom of Ukraine is restored.

Johnson's western allies United States President Joe Biden and his French counterpart Emanuel Macron have also condemned the Russian attack in Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Ukraine shut its airspace earlier in the day as Russian troops crossed over the border. Visuals shared by news agencies showed families taking shelter at metro stations in the east European nation. According to latest updates, Ukraine said it has killed as many as 50 Russian occupiers, including shooting down five planes and one helicopter in Luhansk. Russia, on the other hand, said it has destroyed more than 70 military targets so far, including 11 airfields.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hideousdictator-uk-pm-s-all-out-attack-on-putin-as-russia-invades-ukraine-101645710042471.html

The Prime Minister has said the UK and allies will respond to the invasion of Ukraine with a ‘massive’ package of sanctions that will ‘hobble the Russian economy’.

In an address to the nation, Boris Johnson said the world cannot allow Ukraine’s freedom to be ‘snuffed out’ by what he described as a ‘tidal wave of violence’.

Having amassed as many as 190,000 troops along the country’s border, Moscow spent weeks denying plans to invade, dismissing the West’s intelligence as nonsense.

But as Russian troops close in on Kyiv following a second wave of missile strikes, Johnson said: ‘Our worst fears have now come true and all our warnings have proved tragically accurate.’

He added: ‘A vast invasion is under way by land, by sea and by air. And this is not, in the infamous phrase, some faraway country of which we know little.

‘We have Ukrainian friends in this country, neighbours, co-workers. Ukraine is a country that for decades has enjoyed freedom and democracy, and the right to choose its own destiny.

‘We and the world cannot allow that freedom just to be snuffed out. We cannot and will not just look away.’

The PM added: ‘Diplomatically, politically, economically and – eventually – militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.’

Johnson said Moscow regime would be condemned to ‘pariah status’ after unleashing its ‘tidal wave of violence’ against Ukraine.

He added: ‘I say to the Ukrainians in this moment of agony, we are with you. We are praying for you and your families, and we are on your side.

‘If the months ahead are grim and the flame of freedom burns low, I know that it will blaze bright again in Ukraine.

He added: ‘Today in concert with our allies we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy

‘And to that end we must also collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that for too long has given Putin his grip on western politics.’

While some of the alliance’s 30 member countries are supplying arms, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine, the organisation itself is not.

NATO will not launch any military action in support of Ukraine, which is not a member.

But countries closest to the conflict – Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland – are among those to have triggered rare consultations under Article 4 of NATO founding treaty.

This can be launched when ‘the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the (NATO) parties is threatened’.

In a statement, envoys said: ‘We have decided, in line with our defensive planning to protect all allies, to take additional steps to further strengthen deterrence and defence across the alliance.

‘Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.’

The countries added: ‘We would need to urgently provide Ukrainian people with weapons, ammunition and any other kind of military support to defend itself as well as economic, financial and political assistance and support, humanitarian aid’.

Boris Johnson today warned the West must stand up to 'dictator' Vladimir Putin as he vowed to 'hobble' the Russian economy with a 'massive' package of sanctions.

In an address to the nation, the PM said Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to 'snuff out' freedom in Ukraine with an act of 'wanton and reckless aggression'.

He said Mr Putin had 'unleashed war' on the continent and the West must respond to ensure the eventual 'failure' of his offensive 'diplomatically, politically, economically, and eventually, militarily'. In a hard message to Germany and Italy among others, Mr Johnson also called for countries to wean themselves off gas and oil supplies from Moscow.

'Today, in concert with our allies we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy. And to that end, we must also collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that for too long has given Putin his grip on Western politics,' he said.

'Our mission is clear. Diplomatically, politically, economically, and eventually, militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.'

Openly branding Mr Putin a 'dictator', the premier admitted that the months ahead might be 'grim', but the 'flame of freedom' will 'blaze bright again in Ukraine'.

'For all his bombs and tanks and missiles I don't believe that the Russian dictator will ever subdue the national feeling of the Ukrainians and their passionate belief that their country should be free,' he added.

During a flurry of calls with fellow leaders, Mr Johnson said Europe faces a 'dark time' and told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that 'inaction or underreaction' by the West would have 'unthinkable consequences'.

He is holding virtual talks with Joe Biden and G7 leaders before unveiling more sanctions in a Commons statement at 5pm - with Russia's access to the financial markets and oligarchs in the crosshairs.

EU ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss more action after blacklisting 23 individuals the bloc say are involved in military aggression against Ukraine, taking key political decisions, or waging a 'disinformation war'. The US is also expected to announce more steps, after banning trade and investment in 'separatist' regions of Ukraine and cutting off Russian state banks.

In an extraordinary intervention this morning, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly suggested that Russian military commanders should stage a coup to stop Mr Putin's 'catastrophically bad judgement call'.

Hinting at problems with Mr Putin's mental state after a series of rambling speeches littered with Soviet-era rhetoric, he said the president seemed to be acting 'increasingly in isolation' and 'illogically'.

NATO called Russia's invasion of Ukraine 'a grave violation of international law' as war broke out in Europe sparking the greatest threat to security and peace since the Second World War.

Despite Mr Johnson's tough language, he has faced heavy criticism from Tories for only imposing 'weak' sanctions immediately after the crisis escalated on Monday. When Russia recognised 'separatist' areas in eastern Ukraine and sent in 'peacekeepers' the UK targeted three wealthy 'cronies' of Mr Putin and five banks.

Former Cabinet minister David Davis said Mr Putin has 'effectively declared war on the West', and NATO should now 'provide air support to the Ukrainian army which may neutralise Putin's overwhelming armoured superiority'.

However, the government has made clear there is no prospect of a direct military response, stressing that the UK is 'providing military, defensive military capability'.

Labour leader Keir Starmer piled pressure on the PM to ramp up sanctions on Russian businesses and citizens.

'The hardest possible sanctions must be taken against all those linked to Putin. The influence of Russian money must be extricated from the U.K. Those who have for too long turned a blind eye to Russia's actions must reckon with their own consciences.'

However, experts believe Mr Putin will have priced in the damage from sanctions when making his decision to defy the international community.

It came after Russia launched what appears to be a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, sending troops, tanks and artillery into five areas of the country despite the Kremlin claiming it was a 'special military operation' in only the eastern Donbas region.

Addressing the nation from the Kremlin this morning, Mr Putin said his plans 'don't include occupation of Ukrainian territory', insisting he was only trying 'to demilitarise' and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine, and 'protect Donbas', adding: 'We are not going to impose anything on anyone by force'.

In a chilling threat to anyone in the West who may want to help the Ukrainian militarily, he said: 'To anyone who would consider interfering from outside: If you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history. All the relevant decisions have been taken. I hope you hear me'.

Mr Johnson was woken in the early hours of the morning with news of the invasion, and called President Zelenskyy.

A No10 spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister said he was appalled by the unfolding events in Ukraine. The Ukrainian President updated the Prime Minister on the attacks taking place, and the Prime Minister said the West would not stand by as President Putin waged his campaign against the Ukrainian people.

'The Prime Minister said he hoped Ukraine could resist and that Ukraine and its people were in the thoughts of everyone in the United Kingdom people during this dark time.'

In an address to the Ukrainian people, Mr Zelenskyy said: 'We will give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.

'We will lift sanctions on all citizens of Ukraine who are ready to defend our country as part of territorial defence with weapons in hands.

'We have severed diplomatic relations with Russia. For all those who have not yet lost their conscience in Russia, it is time to go out and protest against the war with Ukraine.'

Ms Truss tweeted this morning: 'I have summoned the Russian ambassador to meet me and explain Russia's illegal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

'We will be imposing severe sanctions and rallying countries in support of Ukraine.'

Mr Johnson will join a virtual summit of G7 leaders this afternoon, including Mr Biden, Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Ministers are understood to be drawing up plans to hit Russian energy, defence and chemicals firms; to stop the Kremlin borrowing on the UK financial markets and to block Russia from the Swift payment system, which accounts for about half of all high value international payments.

Mr Johnson yesterday insisted there was 'more to come', with measures that will 'hit Putin where it hurts'.

MPs have called for action against 35 oligarchs identified by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny as 'key enablers' of the 'kleptocracy' run by president Putin.

Only one of the 35 has so far been sanctioned by the UK, with the Foreign Office saying this week that oil baron Gennady Timchenko would have his assets frozen.

Others on the list, which was read out to parliament by Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, include Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, former Arsenal investor Alisher Usmanov, aluminium magnate Oleg Deripaska and Mr Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov.

Ms Truss yesterday declined to say whether Mr Abramovich could be the target of future sanctions.

But she suggested that many more oligarchs with links to the Kremlin would be targeted.

'We have a long list of those complicit in the actions of the Russian leadership,' she said.

Ms Truss 'strongly condemned' what she called an 'appalling, unprovoked attack' on Ukraine, vowing to 'respond to this terrible act of aggression'.

Ms Patel said officials are on watch for 'cyber attacks and disinformation' from Moscow.

She tweeted: 'Russia's unjustified and unjustifiable attack on a democratic sovereign nation makes this a dark day in Europe. The people of Ukraine have our unwavering support.

'As we monitor developments, we will be especially mindful of the potential for cyber attacks and disinformation emanating from Russia.

'Be in no doubt there is work ongoing across government 24/7 to maximise our resilience to any such attacks, which would be met with a suitably robust response.'

Foreign Office minister James Cleverly accused Vladimir Putin of trying to play out a 'fantasy' of 'recreating some kind of tsarist expansionist Russia'.

Ministers urge Russian generals to stage coup against Putin A Foreign Office minister has urged Moscow generals to step in to stop Vladimir Putin's 'Tsarist fantasy'. James Cleverly said the Russian president is trying to 'recreate a Russian Empire in his mind'. Mr Cleverly told Sky News: 'Ukraine is not part of Russia. The fantasy that President Putin is trying to play out – creating some kind of Tsarist expansionist Russia – absolutely has to be stopped. He added: 'The military leaders around Vladimir Putin, they must know that this is a catastrophically bad judgment call by Vadimir Putin. 'Ukraine is a huge country physically. I have no doubt the Ukrainian people will be ferocious in defence of their homelands. 'The military leaders must know that this will come at a huge cost – not just to Ukrainians but to Russians. 'They are in a position, even if Vladimir Putin won't, they are in a position to stop this and we call on them to do so.' Advertisement

He told Sky News: 'Sadly, President Putin has been really clear in what he's trying to achieve. He is trying to recreate a Russian Empire in his mind, claim back places which he defines as Russia. But the international community recognises that these are individual sovereign states.

'Ukraine is not part of Russia and the fantasy that Vladimir Putin is trying to play out in recreating some kind of czarist expansionist Russia absolutely has to be stopped.

'We will continue working. We've been providing financial and military support to Ukraine for a number of years.

'Just yesterday, the Foreign Secretary announced an economic support package.

'There will, of course, be more support and we will be bringing forward, as I say, in close concert with our international friends and allies, an unprecedented sanctions response, co-ordinated sanctions response, to punish this appalling decision.'

Mr Cleverly told Sky News: 'Ukraine is not part of Russia. The fantasy that President Putin is trying to play out – creating some kind of Tsarist expansionist Russia – absolutely has to be stopped.

He added: 'The military leaders around Vladimir Putin, they must know that this is a catastrophically bad judgment call by Vadimir Putin.

'Ukraine is a huge country physically. I have no doubt the Ukrainian people will be ferocious in defence of their homelands.

'The military leaders must know that this will come at a huge cost – not just to Ukrainians but to Russians.

'They are in a position, even if Vladimir Putin won't, they are in a position to stop this and we call on them to do so.'

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Mr Putin is trying to 'secure his legacy', predicting that it would not be the legacy 'that he wishes'.

Mr Wallace described Russia's actions as 'naked aggression against a democratic country' and said no one had been fooled by the Kremlin's 'false flags and fake narratives'.

Tories say 'pathetic' sanctions have 'encouraged' Putin Boris Johnson was accused of 'encouraging' Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine today by imposing 'pathetic sanctions' that the Russian leader completely ignored. The Prime Minister came under withering friendly fire this morning over 'weak' economic measures targeting cronies of the Kremlin autocrat before his tanks crossed the border. Mr Johnson this week unveiled measures targeting just three people and five banks after Putin recognised two breakaway areas in Ukraine's east - and is preparing to introduce more now that a full-scale incursion is underway. But less than a fortnight ago, Russia's ambassador to Sweden said that his boss 'doesn't give a s**t' about economic restrictions being put in place. In an outspoken interview, Viktor Tatarintsev told the country's Aftonbladet newspaper that 'the more the West pushes Russia, the stronger the Russian response will be'. Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, a former soldier and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. told the BBC today: 'I'm afraid weak sanctions like the ones that were imposed on Monday just encourage others to believe we are weak because we're clearly not willing to do anything serious. 'So what that did, I'm afraid on Monday, was it didn't deter, but encouraged, because it gave the suggestion or made clear that we weren't wiling to do anything serious. Advertisement

'The Russian Federation has today further violated Ukrainian Sovereignty,' he said.

'Despite the efforts of the international communities, Russia has chosen conflict. No one has been fooled by the Kremlin's false flags and fake narratives.

'This is naked aggression against a democratic country which had dared to express a different aspiration than being a supine neighbour to Russia.

'No one should forget this day. Putin thinks this land grab is about securing his legacy - it will be, but not the one that he wishes.'

Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said any attack by Russia on an alliance member would be regarded as an attack on all.

Speaking at Nato headquarters in Brussels, Mr Stoltenberg said: 'Nato's core task is to protect and defend all allies. There must be no room for miscalculation or misunderstanding.

'An attack on one will be regarded as an attack on all. This is our collective security guarantee.'

He said Nato ambassadors had agreed to activate the alliance's defence plans, enabling it to deploy forces to where they are needed.

'This is a prudent and defensive step to protect and shield allied nations during this crisis,' he said.

He said there were more than 100 jets at high alert protecting alliance airspace with more than 120 ships at sea, from the High North to the Mediterranean.

'All this shows that our collective defence commitment – Article 5 – is iron clad. We will continue to do everything that is necessary to shield the alliance from aggression,' he said.

Downing Street said the UK is increasing its 'air policing contribution' to Nato.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We are increasing our air policing contribution to Nato from RAF Akrotiri and the UK to help protect our Nato allies.

'So, two typhoons and a voyager for refuelling from the UK will support continuous Nato air policing over Poland's border with Ukraine … two typhoons and a voyager for refuelling from Akrotiri (will) also support continuous Nato air policing over Romania's border with Ukraine.

'So, this is a defensive capability designed to protect the airspace of our Nato allies … they will not operate in Ukrainian or Russian airspace.

'Just to emphasise, this isn't additional air support, this is the air support already committed to Nato doing additional activities.'

Tory MP and Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Tugendhat criticised the UK Government for imposing 'weak' sanctions on Monday when Russia recognised the 'separatist' areas.

The Conservative MP told the BBC's Today programme that Mr Putin's actions could 'not be tolerated' by any party and must be met with 'extremely hard' penalties.

'I'm afraid weak sanctions like the ones that were imposed on Monday just encourage others to believe we are weak because we're clearly not willing to do anything serious,' he said.

'So what that did, I'm afraid on Monday, was it didn't deter, but encouraged, because it gave the suggestion or made clear that we weren't wiling to do anything serious.

'If we are going to do sanctions, as I say, we need to do them extremely hard and extremely early.'

Putin's chilling warning that Western intervention will mean 'consequences greater than any you have faced in history' Russian Su-25 jets fly over Dnipro Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine and gave a chilling warning to its allies in the West in an early Thursday morning address in Moscow. Explosions were heard in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, as Putin announced that Russia was launching a military attack on Ukraine. He has ignored the plea, going on TV to describe the invasion as a 'special military occupation' and said he wants to 'demilitarize' and 'de-Nazify', not occupy, the country. He told Ukrainian service members to 'lay down their arms and go home,' saying Russia could not exist with a 'constant threat emanating from the territory of Ukraine' and clashes between Russian and Ukrainian solders was 'inevitable.' 'The people's republics of Donbass turned to Russia with a request for help … I decided to conduct a special military operation,' he said. 'As for the military sphere, modern Russia, even after the collapse of the USSR and the loss of a significant part of its nuclear potential, is today one of the most powerful nuclear powers. And moreover, it has certain advantages in a number of the latest types of weapons. In this regard, no one should have any doubt that a direct attack on Russia will lead to defeat and dire consequences for a potential aggressor'. Advertisement

He added: 'This is a vile act of war and an aggression which really cannot be tolerated by any party.'

Tory backbenchers also vented fury at Mr Putin, with Simon Hoare posting an image of his rambling speech with the comment: 'A Poundland wannabe Bond villain mumbles to the camera.'

Mr Davis was among a few Conservatives who suggested that Nato should intervene militarily.

The senior Tory MP tweeted: 'While we should continue to impose the most ferocious sanctions they are no longer a deterrent. They are a punishment. They will not stop him.

'If Nato does not act now, Ukraine will be defeated in a matter of days.

'Therefore if we do not provide military support, more than 40 million Ukrainians will go from living in a democracy to living under a brutal dictatorship.

'It is far too late to get boots on the ground but it is not too late to provide air support to the Ukrainian army which may neutralise Putin's overwhelming armoured superiority.

'If this is confined to the airspace over Ukraine, and is based on a request from President Zelenskyy, this should be perfectly legal under almost any interpretation of international law. It will also reduce the risk of escalation.'

Former minister Stephen Hammond said: 'I utterly condemn the unjustified invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin's forces today.

'We must stand with Ukraine at this time of continental crisis & ensure Russian aggression does not go unpunished. We must work with our allies to impose tougher sanctions & a no fly zone.'

General Sir Richard Shirreff gave a stark warning that that Britain could soon be at war with Russia.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the retired Army officer said any incursion into Nato territory would bring Britain into direct involvement in the conflict.

'There is no surprise and there is profound sadness and a sense of appalling horror at what is about to unfold for the people of Ukraine,' he said.

'And I think we have to assume that this is not Russia biting off a chunk of Ukraine – for example, establishing a land corridor in Crimea – but a full-blown military offensive to occupy Ukraine.'

Sir Richard said it is 'entirely plausible' that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be aiming to revive the Soviet Union, adding that if Russia puts 'one bootstep' into Nato territory, the entire alliance will be at war.

Asked whether Britain might be expected to take part directly in the current military confrontation, he said: 'Absolutely there is a possibility that we as a nation could be at war with Russia, because if Russia puts one bootstep across Nato territory, we are all at war with Russia. Every single one, every single member of the Nato alliance.

'Article 5 (of the Nato alliance) says an attack on one is an attack on all, so we need to change our mindset fundamentally, and that is why I say our defence starts in the UK on the frontiers of Nato.'

Tory donor wife of ex-Putin minister condemns Ukraine invasion The Tory donor wife of a former Putin minister has condemned the invasion of Ukraine. Lubov Chernukhin, whose husband Vladimir move to the UK after being sacked, hit out at 'Russian military aggression'. Ms Chernukhin, a dual Russian-British citizen, has given significant sums to the Conservatives. The party has insisted that all donations are checked and properly declared, while ministers have stressed that not all Russian ex-pats are Putin cronies. 'It is truly horrifying to witness the situation unfolding in Ukraine and my heart goes out to the millions of innocent Ukrainians whose lives and freedoms are in danger and those who are forced to flee their homes,' Ms Chernukhin said. 'I would like to condemn all Russian military aggression in Ukraine in the strongest way possible. 'While such flagrant acts of war are shocking, one cannot say that there were no warning signs. Over the last two decades, Putin's despotic regime has degraded to Stalinesque persecution of the Russian people, brutally shutting down any political opposition or independent press and presiding over the catastrophic impoverishment of Russian citizens whilst Putin and his clique continue to enrich themselves at their citizens' expense. 'I support the UK government's decisive response to Russia's actions and I call for the strongest possible sanctions against Putin's regime and its enablers. I remain hopeful that the UK and its global allies will continue to stand up to the Kremlin and to protect Ukraine and its people, now engulfed in the horrors of war.' Advertisement

The invasion came hours after Mr Wallace said Mr Putin had gone 'full tonto' over the Ukraine crisis.

In an extraordinary broadside, Ben Wallace mocked the Kremlin chief's judgment and warned that his former regiment could 'kick the backside' of Russian troops if required.

The Defence Secretary served as an officer in the Scots Guards before his political career and was decorated for gallantry in Northern Ireland in 1992.

Tonto is Spanish for stupid and 'going full tonto' is popular slang for taking stupidity to a higher level.

Speaking to British troops yesterday, Mr Wallace said: 'It is going to be a busy [British] Army. Unfortunately we've got a busy adversary in Putin who has gone full tonto. He is in an illogical and irrational frame of mind. The Scots Guards kicked the backside of Tsar Nicholas I in 1853 in Crimea – we can always do it again. Tsar Nicholas I made the same mistake Putin did... he had no friends, no alliances.'

Mr Wallace's remarks were echoed last night by former Nato Secretary General Anders Rasmussen.

In an interview with ITV's Robert Peston, he said the Kremlin chief may have 'gone crazy' and had seemed 'unhinged' in recent television appearances.

Mr Rasmussen said: 'Russian behaviour right now, it's not rational, so I wouldn't exclude the possibility Putin has gone crazy. And we saw how he humiliated his advisers. So I don't think we are confronted with a man who is thinking along rational lines.

'We should hit him hard economically, much harder than we have done already.

'Russia should be cut off from Western money. We should also reduce our dependence on imported Russian gas and we should step up our delivery of lethal weapons to Ukraine.'

Mr Wallace made his comments in a room at the Horse Guards building in London which is dominated by a painting of the Battle of Inkerman, a major engagement during the Crimean War, which saw British troops fight alongside French soldiers to defeat Russia.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said yesterday that anyone with links to Mr Putin face being hit with sanctions.

She said she was ruling nothing out 'in terms of who we target' over the Ukraine crisis, as she faced calls for her party to hand back donated cash with Russian connections reportedly worth nearly £2million.

She added in an earlier piece for The Times that Britain will 'use every lever at our disposal to stop (Putin) in his tracks'.

Ms Truss said: 'Nothing is off the table.'

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: 'Vladimir Putin's attack on Ukraine is unprovoked and unjustifiable. His actions will have horrendous and tragic consequences that will echo throughout the world and throughout history.

'All those who believe in the triumph of democracy over dictatorship, good over evil, freedom over the jackboot of tyranny must now support the Ukrainian people. They have been cast onto the front line of a war, simply for existing.

'There can be no space for equivocation when faced with the evil that Putin has unleashed. His actions pose a grave threat to the international order on which we all depend.

'There will be dark days ahead. But Putin will learn the same lesson as Europe's tyrants of the last century: that the resolve of the world is harder than he imagines and the desire for liberty burns stronger than ever. The light will prevail.

'I know people in this country will be feeling worried and uncertain. I know that Ukrainians and Russians here in the UK will be worrying for friends and family back home. Our hearts are with them today.

'We must now match our rhetoric with action. We must urgently reinforce our Nato allies. The hardest possible sanctions must be taken against all those linked to Putin. The influence of Russian money must be extricated from the UK. And those who have for too long turned a blind eye to Russia's actions must reckon with their own consciences.'

War returns to Europe: Putin launches all-out invasion of Ukraine from north, south and east as cruise missiles rain down on airports, military bases, and Kiev while troops parachute from the skies and tanks roll in with scores killed

Russia has today launched all-out war on Ukraine with simultaneous attacks coming from south, east and north, by land and by air. Missiles and bombs rained from the sky, tanks rolled across the border, troops parachuted down on eastern regions and explosions were seen across the country after Vladimir Putin gave the order to attack.

'Hundreds' of Ukrainian troops were killed in early clashes, and official said, as the fight came to them on all fronts at a moment's notice. Official figures put the death toll at 40, with 'dozens' wounded. Cruise missiles, guided bombs and GRAD rockets took out targets from east to west - aimed at airfields, military bases, ammo dumps, and command posts including in the capital.

Six Russian jets were shot out of the sky over the eastern Donbass region with 50 Russian troops killed, Ukraine claimed, before Moscow boasted of taking full control of the skies. Ukrainian border guards said they had come under attack by heavy artillery, tanks and troops from Russia and Belarus as Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko threw his forces into the fight - though he denied taking part.

Luhansk, Sumy and Chernihiv in the east of Ukraine all came under attack, while tanks battled on the outskirts of Kharkiv after paratroopers dropped in. Blasts were also reported in the west - in Zhytomyr and Lviv, close to the border with Poland. In Kherson, in the south, Ukrainian units had reportedly been routed by Russian tanks rolling out of Crimea, which had arrived at the Dnieper River by mid-morning.

Extraordinary video footage showed what appeared to be a Kalibur cruise missile slamming into Ivano-Frankivsk airport. An apartment block in Kharkiv was also struck, causing civilian casualties including a young boy. Video also appeared to confirm cruise missiles had been launched by Russian troops stationed in Moldova.

Meanwhile pro-Russian rebel forces pushed out from the occupied Donbass region, capturing two villages and claiming to have shot two Ukrainian jets out of the skies. The port cities of Mariupol and Odessa, where Ukraine's main naval bases are located, were also attacked. Russian tankers appeared to have blockaded the Kerch Strait, leading from the Back Sea to the Sea of Azov, cutting off Mariupol.

Volodymyr Zelensky, in an address to the nation on Thursday morning, said the history of Ukraine has now changed forever and that Russia has 'embarked on a path of evil' - comparing the Russian attack to Hitler's forces in World War Two. But he vowed to fight back, saying the military has already inflicted 'serious losses' on Russia.

He called on all Ukrainian citizens willing to defend their homeland to step forward, saying guns will be issued to everyone who wants one. He also asked for civilians to give blood to help wounded troops. And he asked world leaders to impose the 'harshest sanctions possible' on Putin.

It came after the Russian strongman gave an extraordinary address to the Russian nation - broadcast in the early hours during a UN meeting aimed at avoiding war - in which he declared a 'special military operation' to 'de-militarise' and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine in what amounted to a outright declaration of war. The video appeared to have been pre-recorded, around the same time as Putin's Monday address recognising Donbass as independent.

Putin also issued a chilling warning to any country thinking of coming to Ukraine's aid, vowing 'consequences greater than any you have faced in history'. 'I hope I have been heard,' he said.

The mood on the ground in Ukraine was mixed. Some showed incredible resolve - heading to work via train and road even as the bombs dropped. Elderly women in the city of Kharkiv, under heavy attack, gathered in the street to pray. But for others, the sight of Russian attack was too much. Highways out of Kiev clogged with cars as people fled, while refugees began crossing the borders into Poland and Slovakia.

The invasion - a naked attempt to redraw the map of Europe by force - marks the most concerted attempt to up-end world order since the end of the Cold War, and risks sparking the bloodiest conflict in Europe since the end of the Second World War.

Underlining the gravity of the moment, Ukrainian Interior Ministry advisor Anton Herashchenko said: 'Starting today, the world has a new geopolitical reality. Either Ukraine and the world will stop the new Hitler now, or there will be a Third World War.'

Western leaders lined up to condemn Russia's actions in the early hours, with security councils convened the world over to mount a response. Heavy sanctions are expected to follow, along with more shipments of military equipment to Ukraine - provided they can find a route in.

But NATO and the US have made it clear that no troops will be sent, leaving Ukraine's military - far the inferior of Russia - to hold off the assault alone. Few expect it to emerge victorious from what is almost certain to be a prolonged, bloody, and vicious war.

'An explosion made the ground beneath our feet tremble': NICK CRAVEN reports from Kiev Ukrainians woke to the sound of missiles and air strikes as their worst fears were realised, with explosions in Kiev causing the ground to tremble and windows shake. All across the country people ran to basement bomb shelters as Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade. Shortly after 5am the crumps of explosions shook the windows of my hotel room as myself and MailOnline photographer Simon Ashton donned the body armour and helmets that have weighed us down, unused in their bag for the last month. For an hour the night sky lit up in the distance to the north and east of the city as military targets were pounded by bombs, and we run to the basement for safety. Braver - or perhaps more foolish - souls headed in the other direction to the 11th floor roof bar in the Intercontinental Hotel where many international media have based themselves. At 6.36am there was by far the loudest explosion from our perspective, believed to be an air strike on a military airfield near Kyiv, which made the ground beneath our feet tremble. By dawn there was an eerie calm as an overcast drizzly day began, broken only by the cheerful chimes of the bells of St Michael's golden domed Monastery across the square from the hotel at 7am. At 7.05am the first air raid sirens rang out all across the city, though no blitz followed in the central area at least. Surreally, even as the dreaded noise of the sirens rent the air, a steady stream of headlights could be seen driving into the city as commuters came in to start the day. But the calm wasn't to last long as the full extent of the Russian invasion began to reveal itself, with troops attacking the border on three sides and air strikes right across the country, even as far west as Lviv, near the Polish border. By 8am local time, queues of people were seen at bank ATMs in the city, perhaps the first sign of panic, following the introduction of a state of emergency across the country from midnight last night. Police and soldiers stood on many of the street corners to keep order. Long lines also formed at gas stations around the city, but with so many places being pounded from the air, it wasn't obvious where would be the safest place to flee to. Having said that, although the streets were noticeably quieter than usual as the working day began, people were mostly calmly going about their business, perhaps still coming to terms with what might be next. When I first arrived in this country a month ago, few Ukrainians took Putin's sabre-rattling seriously. Most admitted that it was possible he might move into the Donbas to annexe the pro-Russian breakaway republics of Luhansk and Donetsk, but very few believed Russia would mount a full-scale invasion of their neighbour.

NATO is expected to focus its efforts on stopping the war from spilling over into neighbouring countries. Poland, a member of the alliance, shares an extensive land border with Ukraine. The Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, also NATO members - will now fear a Russian assault.

Moldova, where some Russian ground troops are already based, is also at risk of falling to Putin. From there, he could strike out at Romania - another former Soviet state.

Unconfirmed reports said that Russian forces had destroyed or rendered unusable the Ukrainian navy, and struck Boryspil Airport in Kiev. Access to the Black Sea and Azov Sea was cut off.

President Joe Biden will address the nation at noon on Thursday, and on Wednesday night he condemned Russia's 'unprovoked and unjustified attack.' He was speaking to Ukraine's president.

Biden said in a statement: 'President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.

'Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.'

Biden said he will be monitoring the situation from Washington, DC, and will continue to get regular updates from his national security team.

Putin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine - a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion.

He accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to 'demilitarize' it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.

Biden in a written statement condemned the 'unprovoked and unjustified attack,' and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would 'hold Russia accountable.' The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a 'full-scale invasion' and said Ukraine will 'defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.'

In the capital, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate. An Associated Press photographer in Mariupol reported hearing explosions and seeing dozens of people with suitcases heading for their cars to leave the city.

'We are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?' 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kyiv. She planned to head to the western city of Lviv and then to try to move to Poland to join her daughter. Putin 'will be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him.'

The Russian claims about knocking out Ukrainian air defenses and Ukrainian claims to have shot down several Russian aircraft could not immediately be verified. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia's massive air power and its inventory of precision weapons.

The Russian Defense Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that 'there is no threat to civilian population.'

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.

Biden announced he will join G7 counterparts on Thursday morning, and will address the country later on Thursday to 'announce the further consequences the United States and its Allies and partners will impose on Russia.'

'We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance. Tonight, Jill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of Ukraine,' the statement added.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10545877/Liz-Truss-condemns-Russia-s-appalling-unprovoked-attack-Ukraine.html

Nicola Sturgeon has led unanimous condemnation by Scotland’s political leaders of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the first minister calling for severe consequences against Vladimir Putin through sweeping sanctions and a crack-down on dirty money in the City of London.

“I wanted to condemn in the strongest possible terms the unprovoked imperialist aggression of Vladimir Putin,” she told MSPs in a statement before first minister’s questions. “We must all stand ready to offer refuge and sanctuary where necessary for those who may be displaced.”

Her remarks were endorsed by Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, Anas Sarwar, leader of Scottish Labour, Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens and a junior minister, and Alex Cole-Hamilton, of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The world was now a “far darker and more unstable place”, Ross said.

Sarwar said Russia’s “unprovoked and unjustifiable” attack on Ukraine had to be resisted. “Peace and democracy must prevail and we will not bend to Vladimir Putin’s imperial ambitions.” Urgent humanitarian support for Ukraine was vital, as was military support for the UK’s Nato allies, he said.",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/feb/24/uk-politics-live-boris-johnson-sanctions-russia-invasion-ukraine-latest-updates?page=with:block-621778688f08380538544fe0

There will be some kind of sustained push for energy independence in Europe, I think on a scale we haven’t seen before. There will be a realignment of NATO forces in the East. It’s possible that Finland and Sweden will join NATO. All of this — I think those long-term responses are ultimately going to be more important than the decisions we make about sanctions today. But obviously, those decisions are the ones that are immediate and necessary right now.

Garcia-Navarro: OK, lots to consider there. But fundamentally, what we’re looking at is a sort of reorganization of the post-World War II consensus. Is that the way you see it, Frank?

Frank Bruni: Yes, absolutely. And I’m struck, listening to both Farah and Ross, at this sense of disbelief that all of us seem to feel. And I feel it. I see it all around me. Farah said Americans aren’t ready for this. I think she’s absolutely right. Ross called this “astonishing.” I think that’s absolutely right. This feels like a page from the 20th century. And here we are in the 21st century. And I’m struck by this sense I pick up in everyone around me that the world, we were somehow past this, that war in Europe was something that we wouldn’t see.

And so I don’t think we’re ready for this. I think people don’t know how to process this. I don’t even think they’ve gotten to the point of fear and terror yet because they’re still in that state of shock. And I wanted to also follow up on something Ross said. He talked about the incredible risk Putin is taking here. I think when people mention that, they’re usually thinking of the risk he’s taking internationally. But he has taken an enormous, enormous risk internally, too. The Russian people are going to feel this gravely in their economy. They’re going to feel this in terms of lost lives. And he is betting — and it is fascinating and terrifying — he’s betting that this flexing of might and the stoking of national pride is somehow going to transcend and compensate for all of that. I don’t know that we know that to be the case.

Garcia-Navarro: Farah, what does the very audacity of this act say about Putin’s plans?

Stockman: Well, look, Putin’s been taking bites out of Ukraine since 2014. And before Ukraine, there was Georgia. So we might be in disbelief, but there are people living there who have seen what’s happening. So I think he has nothing to stop him. He is not accountable to a democratically elected congress. He doesn’t have an opposition. His biggest opposition is in prison. And so what’s stopping him from doing this?

A lot of people consider this to be a personal obsession of his. He has a personal obsession with Ukraine. It has a lot of historical meaning to him. But I also see this as a bigger deal. It’s bigger than Ukraine because he’s been watching for the last, I don’t know, 20 years — he’s been watching the United States do things like this, in his mind. He hated what we did in Libya. He was furious. He hated the Iraq war invasion. He has been seeing us throw our might around and call it international law.

And I think he’s just saying, well, I can play that game, too. And this is really about telling the United States that it’s no longer the sole superpower and showing that we are weak. He went to Beijing before this and basically got some kind of agreement from President Xi that somehow China was going to back them up with economic deals so that they could live maybe without Europe for a while. I worry about where this is all going.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/opinion/ukraine-putin-russia-times-opinion-writers.html

The officials said they will bring forward ""severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions"" against the Kremlin.

""This unprovoked and completely unjustified attack on the democratic state of Ukraine was preceded by fabricated claims and unfounded allegations,"" the G-7 leaders said.

The G-7 leading industrial nations are the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, Germany and Japan. A meeting of the leaders of those countries, along with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel concluded before 10:30 a.m. ET.

Read the full statement below:

We the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) are appalled by and condemn the large-scale military aggression by the Russian Federation against the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, directed partly from Belarusian soil.

This unprovoked and completely unjustified attack on the democratic state of Ukraine was preceded by fabricated claims and unfounded allegations. It constitutes a serious violation of international law and a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and all commitments Russia entered in the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris and its commitments in the Budapest Memorandum. We as the G7 are bringing forward severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions. We call on all partners and members of the international community to condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms, to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, and raise their voice against this blatant violation of the fundamental principles of international peace and security.

This crisis is a serious threat to the rules-based international order, with ramifications well beyond Europe. There is no justification for changing internationally recognised borders by force. This has fundamentally changed the Euro-Atlantic security situation. President Putin has re-introduced war to the European continent. He has put himself on the wrong side of history.

We are committed to uphold peace, stability and international law. We are united in our support for the people of Ukraine and its democratically elected government. In this dark hour our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine. We stand ready to support with humanitarian assistance in order to mitigate the suffering, including for refugees and displaced persons from the Russian aggression.

We call on the Russian Federation to stop the bloodshed, to immediately de-escalate and to withdraw its forces from Ukraine. We also call on Russia to ensure the safety of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. We also condemn the involvement of Belarus in this aggression against Ukraine and call on Belarus to abide by its international obligations.

We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russian President Putin's decision on February 21 to recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk self-declared entities in eastern Ukraine as ""independent"" states as well as his decision to send Russian military forces into these regions. We call on other states not to follow Russia's illegal decision to recognise the proclaimed independence of these entities. The decision by President Putin is a grave violation of the basic principles enshrined in the UN Charter, in particular the respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states and also a blatant breach of UN Security Council resolution 2202 – supported by the Russian Federation as a permanent member of the Security Council – as well as of the Minsk agreements, which stipulate the return of the areas concerned to the control of the Ukrainian Government.

We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders and territorial waters as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future and security arrangements. We reaffirm that illegally occupied Crimea and the self-declared ""people's republics"" are an integral part of Ukraine.

We condemn President Putin for his consistent refusal to engage in a diplomatic process to address questions pertaining to European security, despite our repeated offers. We stand united with partners, including NATO, the EU and their member states as well as Ukraine and remain determined to do what is necessary to preserve the integrity of the rules-based international order.
