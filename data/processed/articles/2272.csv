The Security Council meeting came despite the fact that most of the international community’s attention was focused on the opposite end of the building, as the body’s General Assembly took up the Ukraine/Russia crisis.

Meanwhile, at the Security Council meeting, the Palestinian Authority ambassador to the U.N. Riyad Mansour used the occasion to slam Israel, notably wearing a mask printed with the words “End Apartheid.”

Mansour made sure to utter “apartheid” at every opportunity, attempting to capitalize on any anti-Israel momentum generated by a recent Amnesty International report which labeled Israel’s treatment of Arabs, both within the disputed territories and Israel proper. It is a claim, as Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Gilad Erdan noted on Wednesday, that no one has taken up outside of the P.A. and designated terrorist groups.

“You can see the campaign that started here today on the mask of my counterpart. But make no mistake, this is a joint campaign between these organizations and the Palestinians with the mission of delegitimizing Israel as a Jewish democratic state,” said Erdan, adding, “Can anyone honestly look me in the eye and tell me that Israel, a country that protects the social and political equality of all of its citizens, is guilty of systematic injustice? A country in which Arab doctors, Arab members of parliament and Arab ministers serve alongside their Jewish counterparts. “

Erdan went on the offensive against an open-ended Commission of Inquiry (COI) established by the U.N. Human Rights Council that was formed in the aftermath of last May’s Israel-Hamas conflict, in which the terror group that runs the Gaza Strip launched more than 4,000 rockets into Israel. The COI, however, will have the ability to investigate every Israeli government and military decision since the founding of the state, with a budget that is nearly double that of one-time investigations into human rights violations in Syria or Venezuela, Erdan noted. The COI is the first one ever launched by the UNHRC with no end date built into its mandate, and its appointed chair has regularly vilified Israel.

“Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and other so-called ‘human rights organizations’ have chosen to launch a Jihad war against the only vibrant democracy in the Middle East. Some of the very same organizations that could not find the time to write up reports on Syria, Myanmar, Iran or other horrific human-rights abusers, managed to find the time to write up hundreds of pages delegitimizing the existence of Israel. These recent reports have attempted to brand Israel with absurd claims and heinous accusations,” said Erdan.

Mansour countered, “This council might not be ready to use the word, but apartheid is and has been for a while now, our reality. … Israel may be outraged by the word apartheid. Everyone else should be outraged by the policy.”

The debate was originally scheduled to be closed. But the Palestinians requested that it be changed to an open format, and Russia, holding the presidency of the Security Council this month, acceded. Most Security Council ambassadors were at the General Assembly meeting on Ukraine and Russia, taking place at the exact same time, something not lost on Erdan.

“As we sit here debating legal disputes and false allegations, the clouds of unrest, violence, and war cast long shadows across the world. One might wonder what the urgency was to turn a closed monthly debate into an open one while such critical matters to global security are being discussed in the General Assembly as we speak. That being said, if we are here today to discuss the situation in the Middle East, then the real threat to the region must be the focus of this meeting,” said Erdan, turning the focus of the conversation to Iran’s growing nuclear program and other menacing activities by the Islamic Republic and its proxies throughout the region.

‘Good-faith engagement can build confidence and create a path to cooperation’

U.S. Deputy Ambassador to the U.N. Richard Mills was also critical of the diplomatic time and energy the monthly meetings on the Israeli-Palestinian file take up at the Security Council, saying, “The fundamental reality is that any solution must be agreed by the parties themselves. In this context, holding meetings for the sake of meetings is not going to help. But when the parties are ready to move forward, the United States will be here to support them.”

Mills began his remarks by praising the progress afforded by the Abraham Accords, noting Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s recent visit to Bahrain and this month’s Emirati Federal National Council delegation to the Knesset.

“These visits demonstrate that good-faith engagement can build confidence and create a path to cooperation towards greater security, prosperity, and dignity. In addition to these visits, we support the efforts by the signatories of the Abraham Accords to further their relationships through working groups and other initiatives to develop trade, cultural, and people-to-people ties. These deepening relations offer new opportunities for the people of the region,” said Mills.

Jerusalem: More than 20 Israelis and Palestinians were wounded on Sunday in several incidents in and around Jerusalem’s flashpoint Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, two days after major violence at the site.

The latest clashes take the number of wounded since Friday to more than 170, at a tense time when the Jewish Passover festival coincides with Ramadan. They also follow deadly violence in Israel and the occupied West Bank in late March and early this month that has killed 36 people.

Early on Sunday morning, “hundreds” of Palestinian demonstrators inside the mosque compound started gathering piles of stones, shortly before the arrival of Jewish visitors, police said.

Jews are allowed to visit but not to pray at the site, also known as Temple Mount, the holiest place in Judaism and third-holiest in Islam.

The police said its forces had entered the compound in order to “remove” the demonstrators and “re-establish order.”

The Palestinian Red Crescent said 19 Palestinians were wounded, including at least five who were hospitalized. It said some had been wounded with rubber-coated steel bullets.

An AFP team near the entrance to the compound early Sunday morning saw barefoot Jewish worshippers leaving the site, protected by heavily armed police.

Outside the Old City, in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, Palestinian youths threw rocks at passing buses, resulting in seven people being treated for light wounds at Shaare Zedek hospital, the medical facility said.

Video released by the police showed two Israeli buses, their windscreens and side windows smashed in, driving down a road near the Old City as young men showered them with rocks. The police said they had arrested 18 Palestinians.

Senior Palestinian official Hussein Al Sheikh said Sunday that “Israel’s dangerous escalation in the Al-Aqsa compound ... is a blatant attack on our holy places,” and called on the international community to intervene.

The chief of the Hamas Islamist movement which controls the Palestinian enclave of Gaza meanwhile warned Israel that “Al-Aqsa is ours and ours alone.”

“Our people have the right to access it and pray in it, and we will not bow down to (Israeli) repression and terror,” Ismail Haniyeh said in a statement.

Later Sunday morning, mosques in Palestinian neighborhoods of annexed east Jerusalem broadcast calls for people to head toward the Al-Aqsa compound.

Weeks of mounting tensions saw two deadly attacks by Palestinians in or near the Israeli coastal city of Tel Aviv in late March and early April, alongside mass arrests by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.

A total of 14 people have been killed in attacks against Israel since March 22, including a shooting spree in Bnei Brak, an Orthodox Jewish city in greater Tel Aviv.

Twenty-two Palestinians have been killed over the same period, including assailants who targeted Israelis, according to an AFP tally.

On Friday morning, police clashed with Palestinians in the Al-Aqsa compound, including inside the Al-Aqsa mosque, drawing strong condemnation from Muslim countries. Those clashes wounded some 150 people.

The United Nations has called for calm, a year after clashes in and around the mosque compound escalated into an 11-day war between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza.

Pope Francis called Sunday for free access to the holy sites in Jerusalem and prayed for peace in the city.

“May Israelis, Palestinians and all who dwell in the Holy City, together with the pilgrims, experience the beauty of peace, dwell in fraternity and enjoy free access to the Holy Places in mutual respect for the rights of each,” he said in his Easter address.

Despite the tensions, a few streets away from the Al-Aqsa compound hundreds of Christians staged a noisy parade through the alleys of Jerusalem’s Old City to mark Easter at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre where they believe Jesus was crucified.

The area was part of extreme southwestern Syria until 1967, when it came under Israeli military occupation, and in December 1981 Israel unilaterally annexed the part of the Golan it held. The area’s name is from the biblical city of refuge Golan in Bashan (Deuteronomy 4:43; Joshua 20:8).

Geographically, the Golan is bounded by the Jordan River and the Sea of Galilee on the west, Mount Hermon (Arabic: Jabal Al-Shaykh; Hebrew: Har Ḥermon) on the north, the seasonal Wadi Al-Ruqqād (a north-south branch of the Yarmūk River) on the east, and the Yarmūk River on the south. As a political unit the boundaries differ; Israel is the suzerain of almost all of the Golan except for a narrow strip in the east that follows the Israeli-Syrian armistice line of June 10, 1967, which was later modified by the separation of forces agreement of May 31, 1974. The Golan extends about 44 miles (71 km) from north to south and about 27 miles (43 km) from east to west at its widest point. It is roughly boat-shaped and has an area of 444 square miles (1,150 square km). The better agricultural land lies in its southern portion; the stony foothills of Mount Hermon in the north, with patches of woodland and scrub, are a stock-raising area. The Israeli portion of the Golan rises to 7,297 feet (2,224 metres) at its extreme northeast point on the Mount Hermon slopes.

History

In 1894 the French-Jewish banker Baron Edmond de Rothschild bought a large tract of land for Jewish settlement in the Golan; he was followed by other groups in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Jewish colonization was attempted but was frustrated by the hostility of the Arab population and by the Ottoman land laws, which virtually forbade settlement by nonnatives. After World War I the Golan became part of the French mandate of Syria and in 1941 passed to independent Syria. After the Arab-Israeli War of 1948–49, Syria fortified the western crest of the Golan Heights, which commands the Ḥula Valley, the Sea of Galilee, and the upper Jordan River valley, all in Israel. In these sections many Israeli civilians were killed by Syrian artillery and sniper fire; agriculture and fishing were rendered difficult, and at times impossible.

On the last two days (June 9–10, 1967) of the Six-Day War, the Israeli armed forces, after defeating Egypt and Jordan, turned their attention to Syria. Under cover of the Israel Air Force, engineer troops built access roads up the steep Golan Heights, which were then frontally assaulted by armoured vehicles and infantry. The Syrian defenders and most of the Arab inhabitants fled, and Syria asked for an armistice; fighting ceased on June 10. The heights were placed under Israeli military administration, and Golan was integrated into the communications and financial framework of Israel. Five villages of mostly Druze Arabs remained and were offered Israeli citizenship, though most declined and retained Syrian citizenship. By the late 1970s nearly 30 Jewish settlements had been established on the heights, and in 1981 Israel unilaterally annexed the area.

A disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria, signed following the Yom Kippur War of October 1973, established a United Nations buffer zone in the Golan Heights, monitored by a UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). The UNDOF mandate was renewed every six months thereafter.

Negotiations between Syria and Israel, initiated during bilateral talks held in Madrid in 1991, continued intermittently until they broke down in 2000 over Syria’s insistence on Israel’s full withdrawal from the Golan Heights territory. Discussions between the two countries were renewed in 2008 through the mediation of Turkey, which was then a close ally of both countries, but those talks fell apart after the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Meanwhile, developments in both Israel and the region in the 2010s stirred the traditionally quietist Golan Druze to become more vocal about their status: Israel witnessed an uptick in citizenship applications from some in the community, while others began holding public rallies reaffirming loyalty to Syria. In March 2019 the United States became the only country to recognize Israel’s annexation of the region.",https://www.britannica.com/place/Golan-Heights

Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967. To date, the United States is the only other country to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the strategic border region.

Russia is a close ally of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and has gained significant power in that country. This influence has forced Israel to walk a geopolitical tightrope during the Ukraine crisis. Israel needs to maintain a good relationship with Russia, which allows it to carry out regular airstrikes on Iranian-backed militias in Syria. But Israel also has close ties to Ukraine and condemns Moscow’s invasion of its smaller neighbor.

“Israel is engaged in an ongoing air campaign to try to roll back Iranian efforts at consolidation and entrenchment in Syria, nothing can happen over the skies of Syria without tacit Russian permission, which means that the Israeli-Russian relationship is of paramount diplomatic importance to Israel right now,” Middle East expert Jonathan Spyer told CBN News.

Israel has carried out airstrikes on hundreds of targets inside government-controlled parts of Syria, but rarely acknowledges reports about such operations. Israel considers the Golan Heights to be a key territory it needs to defend against threats in Syria.

4,c583c634-d78a-4d51-bd56-a8226ea63cbe,[],,"In an address to the US nation, Biden assails Putin and accuses him of a “flagrant violation of international law.”

Recounting the intelligence his administration has been declassifying and sharing with US allies over the past few weeks, as Russia geared up for war, Biden says, “We’ve been transparent with the world… so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.”

He accuses the Russian leader of planning the invasion for a long time and of lying to create pretexts for his actions in Ukraine.

“Putin is the aggressor, Putin chose this war,” Biden says, predicting that the Russian leader “will be a pariah on the international stage.”

“He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to reestablish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is all about,” he charges.

The US president, whose address comes after a meeting earlier today with leaders of the G7 group of nations, warns that powerful sanctions will exact a “severe cost” from Russia’s economy, “both immediately and over time.”

“We’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well over half of the global economy,” he says. “We’re in full and total agreement. We will limit… Russia’s ability to participate in the global economy.”

He says the steps imposed in coordination with Europe will block top Russian banks from the US financial system and “cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.”

The penalties fall in line with the White House’s insistence that it will look to hit Russia’s financial system and Putin’s inner circle, while also imposing export controls that aim to starve Russia’s industries and military of US semiconductors and other high-tech products.

But Biden, for now, holds off on imposing some of the most severe sanctions, including cutting Russia out of the SWIFT payment system, which allows for the transfers of money from bank to bank around the globe, or Russia’s energy sector.

On the military front, he vows to defend “every inch” of NATO territory, but reaffirms that no American troops will be deployed to Washington’s ally.

“As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with a full force of American power,” Biden says.

The president adds, however: “Our forces will not be engaged in a conflict with Russia in Ukraine.”

6,c583c634-d78a-4d51-bd56-a8226ea63cbe,['Ben Samuels'],,"WASHINGTON – Israel’s first official response Wednesday to Russia’s actions in Ukraine caught the attention of many for its seemingly tepid condemnation of Russian President Vladimir Putin and failure to even mention Russia by name.

On Thursday, after Russia launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine, Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid delivered a short statement denouncing the attack, mentioning Russia by name, and calling for a return to negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv. Even then, however, Lapid devoted only one sentence to the denunciation, and spent most of his statement emphasizing the fact that Israel has strong ties to both Russia and Ukraine, and is mostly concerned with protecting its own citizens and diplomats in those countries.

These statements were very different from the forceful words offered by other key U.S. allies against Russia. But experts and former senior officials who spoke with Haaretz don't expect the Biden administration to express anger or disappointment at Israel, since the country's cautious pragmatism is largely motivated by Russia’s hold over Syria, and its tacit approval of Israeli military operations against Iranian-backed activities within the country.

Officials and experts say the Biden administration understood that Israel had no choice but to traverse this tightrope, even if it would prefer a stronger reaction – something it may now look for given Russia’s military attacks across Ukraine on Thursday morning.

They believe the fact that Israel supported the U.S. position at all, rather than staying on the sidelines, was a notable sign of Israel’s commitment to being aligned with the Biden administration.

“Israel has been doing the same dance for years in terms of sidestepping potential political landmines with how it engages with the U.S. on Russia,” says Dan Arbell, former deputy chief of mission at Israel’s embassy in Washington and scholar-in-residence at Washington’s American University.

Officials highlight previous examples of Israeli passivity concerning Russia, particularly its notable abstention from a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Wednesday’s statement, according to Arbell, “brought it to a new artform. It’s just another manifestation of this policy of not upsetting Russia.”

Walking a fine line

Despite Israel’s apparent fence-sitting, experts stress the Biden administration is aware of Israel’s delicate position due to Russia’s genuine leverage in Syria. Last month, Russian and Syrian jets conducted a joint patrol over the Golan Heights, sending a strong signal to Israel that it could cease Israel’s freedom of movement within Syria’s borders if it chose to strategically align itself against Russia.

“Either Israel has the ability to operate there or it doesn’t. From an Israeli perspective, if the Russians limit their ability to operate there, Israel could face a much more profound strategic threat. So walking a fine line is required of the Israelis,” says Dennis Ross, who served as the Middle East peace envoy in the Clinton administration.

One week after the joint Russian-Syrian patrol, Biden and Bennett discussed “the potential of further Russian aggression against Ukraine,” according to a White House readout. However, it did not contain the language of a shared position akin to other U.S. statements following calls with allies.

“Would the administration like a more definitive posture? Of course. Does it understand the Israeli position? Yes, I think it does,” Ross adds.

Martin Indyk, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and U.S. special Middle East envoy from July 2013 to June 2014, says the United States would like to have Israel on board precisely because it is an example of a liberal democracy threatened by living in a hostile neighborhood.

“They’d like to see Israel stand up, but they understand,” he says. “The interaction at the national security level between the United States and Israel, and between the Biden administration and the Bennett government, is very intense,” he adds, noting that there may be a sort of quid pro quo between their respective public postures.

“Israel is cutting the Biden administration some slack on the Iran [nuclear] deal, even though they oppose it. There’s a feeling in the administration that given the circumstances – particularly in Syria – they should cut Israel some slack too.”

Despite Washington’s seeming acceptance, people familiar with both governments’ thinking understand the situation remains dynamic – particularly in the face of Thursday morning’s full-scale Russian attacks across Ukraine.

“Israel’s reaction to Ukraine, like the [administration’s], is a moving train,” says Carnegie Endowment for International Peace senior fellow Aaron David Miller. “They very much want to fence-sit because of maintaining their interests in Syria, so they’re slow-walking a tough response to Russia, waiting to see how far Putin goes.

“But make no mistake: If Putin moves massively into Ukraine, they won’t – nor will Biden abide without a cost – a middling or tepid response,” Miller adds, speaking before Thursday morning’s developments. “Israel is America’s closet Middle East ally. And Biden will expect Bennett to act like it.”

That warning came days after several senior Israeli officials openly indicated that Israel would be forced to side with the United States should it be forced to make a decision. However, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid attempted to qualify such inevitabilities by stating that “our border with Syria is, for all intents and purposes, a border with Russia.”

When asked about Israel’s Ukraine statement, a State Department spokesperson said that “the United States and many other nations are deeply concerned about the destabilizing role that Russia is playing, and its ongoing threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.”

The spokesperson added that the U.S. engages in “ongoing and regular dialogue with other countries at all levels of our government” concerning positions on Russia and Ukraine, and that “the vast majority of the global community is united in their view – a shared view that invading another country, attempting to take some of their land, terrorizing their people is certainly not aligned with global values.”",https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-offered-a-soft-response-to-putin-s-actions-does-biden-care-1.10631830

Jews In Ukraine City Of Uman Aiding Ukrainian Armed Forces Against Russian Invasion

The Jewish community in the historic Ukrainian city of Uman – site of the tomb of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, the revered founder of the Breslov Hasidim – is actively providing medical and logistical assistance to Ukraine’s armed forces in the face of the ongoing Russian military invasion.

“We love Ukraine and we will defend it,” Haim Hazin, a representative of the community, told the Ukrainian news outlet Telegraf on Wednesday (23rd), as Russian forces attacked targets around the country.

The community has already provided practical assistance to the Ukrainian armed forces. “At the beginning of hostilities, we handed over dozens of bags with Israeli first-aid kits to the army,” Hazin said while partner organizations in Israel also sent specialists who conducted tactical medical courses, and shared Israeli technologies on how to stop wounds from bleeding.”

On Wednesday (23rd), Hazin announced that the community was donating an ambulance that would be deployed with Ukrainian troops in the Donbass region. “It’s equipped with modern Israeli medical supplies and bags with Israeli medicines,” he said.

Hazin added that Jews in Uman, which is located in central Ukraine, “are determined to help in any way we can.”

He continued: “it hurts us, we fear for Ukraine. This is sacred land for us here in Uman, where Rabbi Nachman is buried.”

Uman was once home to a thriving Jewish community that was decimated during the Nazi Holocaust. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, several Orthodox families have moved to the city, mainly concentrated near the Rabbi’s tomb, which attracts thousands of worshipers from Israel, the US and other countries during Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.

In Israel, meanwhile, Jewish immigrants from Ukraine expressed support for the country of their birth on social media after an impassioned message from a Ukrainian citizen to the Israeli people went viral.

“Citizens of Israel! Please support us! We, unlike Russia, do not welcome Hamas delegations,” Sasha Marynich wrote in a message to readers of Vesty, a Russian-language newspaper in Israel.

A resident of the Podil neighborhood in the capital Kiev, Marynich said a section of the Jewish community lived nearby. “Never, never have we had any conflicts or misunderstandings,” he wrote. “Every morning we greet the Jewish children with a smile as they board their school buses.” Tuesday (22nd), however, “was a hard day, no one in town had a smile or a greeting.” He ended his message pledging to “defend ourselves, defend our Kiev, defend Podil, and the church, and the synagogue.”

Several Israeli readers reacted warmly to Marynich’s plea. “Israel is for an independent and free Ukraine! Israel and the entire civilized world is with you! wrote reader Alexander Linsky, while Berta Pinhasov declared, “Hold on, Israel is with you!”

Another reader, Irina Tsybulya, said she would visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem and place a note in its cracks praying for Ukraine’s welfare.

“God take care of Ukraine,” she wrote.

Nuclear Talks Put On Hold Amid Ukraine Incursion

Several days after superpowers said they were close to signing a new Iranian nuclear deal, negotiators announced Thursday (24th) the talks would be put on hold due to the Russian incursion in Ukraine.

A few hours before Russian troops invaded Ukraine early Thursday morning (24th), Iran’s top negotiator Ali Bakri Kani took off from Vienna to Tehran for consultations after various sides indicated the new deal was close although some disagreements remained.

Shortly before takeoff, Kani said, “being close to the finish is not a guarantee that it will be crossed. It requires caution, perseverance and creativity to take the last step. There are certain decisions that our Western interlocutors have to make.”

However, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine has pushed the nuclear negotiations off the global stage, forcing Iran to reassess the situation and perhaps even reconsider its position in the negotiations.

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi told Putin in a telephone call on Thursday (24th) that “NATO expansion is a serious threat to the stability and security of independent countries in different regions.”

Raisi expressed hope that “what was happening” would benefit “the nations and the region,” he said according to a statement.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran was working to evacuate its citizens from Ukraine which closed its airspace early Thursday (24th).

The Ukrainians Are Learning A Lesson That Israel Has Already Learned – Dr. Dan Schueftan

→ The founders of Israel made the strategic choice to build and maintain a defense force capable of dealing independently with even the most dangerous threats. The Ukrainians are learning today what the Czechs learned in 1938, and what the Jews vowed never to forget: Western democracies can not be relied upon in the face of a threat from an authoritarian regime willing to turn to military measures to enforce its will. A country that cannot defend itself will be left to its own devices at a time it needs support the most.

→ Israel’s War of Independence victory was achieved only thanks to the mobilization of full human potential and the massive arms smuggling that took place despite the US embargo. Amid the pan-Arab threat, shaped under Egyptian President Nasser’s leadership, Israel was left to its fate for almost 20 years.

→ In the 1950s, Israel faced a critical threat when the USSR supplied Egypt (and later other Arab countries) with massive quantities of frontline weapons, while Washington refused to supply Jerusalem with defensive weapons. France, which had helped Israel deal with these dangers, betrayed Jerusalem after the Six-Day War and supported its enemies.

→ When Arab countries declared war on Israel again in 1973, the rest of Europe turned its back on Jerusalem by refusing to allow American planes that carried supplies for the IDF to refuel in its territories. Europe continues to support efforts to delegitimize the Jewish state in international organizations, and generously funds groups that undermine it.

→ Israel became a success story not only because of its freedom and innovation, but also because it chose to base its national security on self-defense. Its survival, progress, and prosperity were made possible by its strong military and determination to defend itself on its own.

→ Israel receives assistance due to its determination to survive without it. It prevents war through deterrence, for it has learned that what triggers the aggression of authoritarian regimes is democracies’ hesitance to use their power even if the avenues of diplomacy and economic means have been exhausted.

Report: UK Poised To Outlaw BDS Movement

The British government on Tuesday (22nd) moved to ban the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, the Jewish Chronicle reported.

London’s Parliament passed an amendment stopping local authority pension funds from backing BDS sanctions against British companies doing business with Israel, despite protest from some Labor MPs.

Conservative MP Rob Jenrick introduced the amendment that gives the government new powers to direct local pension funds to not make decisions that conflict with London’s foreign and defense policy.

“BDS against Israel is all too often connected to anti-Semitism here in the UK and does nothing to promote peace and is increasingly out of step with the mood in the Middle East following the Abraham Accords, whereby a number of Gulf states are forging productive links with Israel,” Jenrick told the Chronicle after the vote.

Jenrick continued: “It is unacceptable for local councils to be making divisive foreign policy interventions contrary to the position of the UK government. I am delighted that my amendment has passed and will be the first step in legislation outlawing BDS in the UK. I hope it presages a wider bill in the forthcoming Queen’s Speech tackling BDS throughout the public sector.”

The amendment passed on the same day that the Hertfordshire County Council rejected a bid to divest from Israel-linked companies, saying that it was out of their purview.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews, Hertfordshire Jewish Forum and the Jewish Leadership Council issued a joint statement thanking the Hertfordshire County Council for dismissing the petition.

“We thank Hertfordshire County Council for continuing to focus on the priorities of local government and rejecting the self-indulgent grandstanding of BDS,” the statement said. “The authority has sent a clear signal that the county’s Jewish residents do not have to worry about divisive politics stirring up trouble locally.”

Editorial: We can debate if Mr. Biden’s weakness on Afghanistan caused Mr. Putin to believe he could invade Ukraine, but you fight a new Cold War with the President you have. Mr. Biden now has to rally the world and the American public to understand the stakes in Ukraine and counter the rapidly increasing threats to America. – Wall Street Journal

Editorial: Mr. Biden ducked a question at his Thursday press conference about why the U.S. hasn’t sanctioned Mr. Putin personally but said it’s still possible. The press should keep asking. The only sanctions that will really get Mr. Putin’s attention are those that threaten his control of Russia and the loyalty of his cronies. – Wall Street Journal

Editorial: But Mr. Kerry’s comments aren’t a gaffe. They reveal the Biden Administration’s obsession with climate, and with punishing fossil-fuel production, which has made the U.S. and Europe vulnerable to Mr. Putin’s energy blackmail. The climate lobby has made Mr. Putin more powerful. Every time Mr. Kerry visits Moscow, the boys in the Kremlin must think it’s Christmas. – Wall Street Journal

Editorial: In his two televised addresses this week, Mr. Biden displayed the resolution and calm of a tested leader, and the Western alliance demonstrated a rare unity in the face of Russia’s attack. The West is strongest when it stands together for its shared values and against a common enemy. However difficult it may be, our pain will be nothing compared with the agonies of the Ukrainian people at the hands of an invading army. – New York Times

Editorial: As the leader of the free world, the U.S. must rally its allies in support of the noble ideals of democracy and a rules-based international order. The Ukrainian people must find in Joe Biden unflinching support, and Putin must be made to understand that he is all alone. He has made a most grievous error, and he must rescind his claims on Ukraine. – Washington Examiner

Robert C. O’Brien and Alexander B. Gray write: The U.S. remains the world’s indispensable power and retains global interests. The primacy of the China challenge and justifiable skepticism of U.S. overseas entanglements, born out of the Iraq and Afghanistan interventions, don’t mean we can ignore American interests in other areas of the world, particularly today in Ukraine. – Wall Street Journal

David Ignatius writes: The Ukraine assault, pitting a messianic Russian autocrat against the wishes of every other major nation, perhaps including China, will determine the shape of the new order to come. If Putin loses his battle to subjugate Ukraine, the new order will have a solid and promising foundation. If Putin wins, the new era will be very dangerous indeed. – Washington Post

Eugene Robinson writes: Rather than confuse and weaken NATO, Putin seems to have united its members. Rather than erase the notion of independent Ukrainian nationhood, he seems to have reinforced it. And while roughly 200,000 troops equipped with modern weaponry might be enough to defeat the Ukrainian military, they are not enough to permanently conquer a country of more than 43 million people who don’t want to be occupied. Putin hasn’t made a bold chess move; he has overturned the chessboard. He cannot be sure where the pieces will land. – Washington Post

Peggy Noonan writes: All the West is going to have to play a long, cool, careful game. Leaders and officials should do nothing to provoke. In Europe they should speak in one voice to the extent possible: define, describe, be precise, no histrionics. Don’t taunt. […]Sometimes it’s good to quiet your rousing voices and concentrate on not letting this become World War III. – Wall Street Journal

Kimberley A. Strassel writes: Mr. Biden’s first Thursday response to the Ukrainian invasion offered a mixed bag—tough talk on Russia, but also progressive talking points (such as pre-emptively demagoguing oil and gas producers for any price hikes). Yet he can’t have it both ways, and by Tuesday he’ll have had plenty of time for the choosing. Will it be an emboldened, reset Biden presidency? Or more progressive puerility, as per usual? – Wall Street Journal

Walter Russell Mead writes: Nothing less can be our goal. “My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic,” Reagan told his foreign-policy adviser Richard Allen in 1977. “We win and they lose.” Mr. Putin has sought to return the world to an era of zero-sum international competition under the law of the jungle; he and the acolytes and imitators inspired by his example must be taught why that’s bad. – Wall Street Journal

Nika Melkozerova writes: First Mr. Putin annexed Crimea, then he fomented the war in the Donbas that has killed more than 14,000 people. Now the battle for Ukraine has come to a climax. But it’s about more than Ukraine. It’s a contest between democracy and autocracy, freedom and dictatorship, whose implications will scatter across the world. It’s not our fight alone. So please don’t leave us alone to fight it. – New York Times

Prashant Rao writes: In essence, Ukrainian insurgents would require just about all that the Iraqi and Afghan insurgents and extremists needed, except for suicide bombers, which I assume would not be employed. And the question will again be whether to provide that assistance overtly or just covertly, or at all, I suspect. – The Atlantic

Paula J. Dobriansky writes: The attack on Ukraine is a clear wake-up call to all those who have argued that America is not confronting dangerous great power competition with not only China but also Russia. Russia is destabilizing Europe, seeking to undercut U.S. power and influence globally and to fragment our close alliances and partnerships. And Moscow is threatening implicitly and explicitly to use its massive nuclear arsenal against any who resist. These events will shape the international system and American foreign and security policy for years to come. – Barrons

David Rothkopf writes: In the end, all these factors will contribute to Putin’s decline, will add to his vulnerability to domestic challenges, will isolate him, and will, in the end, destroy him. […]But if history is any guide, his over-reach and his miscalculations, his weaknesses as a strategist, and the flaws in his character will undo him. And, if there is justice in the world, if the people of the U.S. and Europe are paying attention, they will also serve to undo those Putin acolytes abroad who supported this monster and ignored the profound danger to us all that he embodies. – The Daily Beast

Paul J. Davies writes: Financial shock and awe may be the only tactic that can reverse Russia’s aggression – and it is Europe that will bear the costs. If it doesn’t, it is also Europe that will most likely bear the consequences. – Bloomberg

Tiana Lowe writes: Putin is a dictator and a murderer. He never deserved the deference and respect shown to him by the West and its leaders. But he gambled that we were pusillanimous wimps, and that bet just endlessly keeps paying off. – Washington Examiner

Stephen Blank writes: In other words, NATO should either accelerate the track membership for Ukraine or give it the membership it needs now. The argument that reforms there are incomplete is now irrelevant. NATO is first an organization for the collective, and Russia’s invasion threatens European security as a whole. […]These actions will deter Moscow, strengthen Ukraine and our allies, and invigorate international, not just European, security. If there are those who do not believe that defeating and deterring Putin is in our interest, then the burden of proof remains upon them. – Washington Examiner

Hal Brands writes: But if the Western democracies fail, then the fallout from Putin’s gambit may be a preview of greater global disruptions to come. – Bloomberg

Ben Dubow writes: Putin may be counting on a repeat of the euphoria that followed Crimea’s annexation as a further step in Russia’s spiritual rejuvenation. But he should take heed of the implications of the Russian Idea and what befell the Tsarist autocracy and Soviet Bolshevism–and the suffering inflicted on Russians in the process. – Center for European Policy Analysis

Eriks Selga and Jérémie Langlois write: Without new narratives and terminology, Putin will keep exploiting the misconception that Russia has unique claims on countries occupied by its predecessor, driving more wedges between democratic solidarity. – Center for European Policy Analysis

Daniel Hoffman writes: Putin cannot allow Ukraine to succeed as a democracy, which would serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for his own domestic opponents who are denied basic civil liberties including freedom of expression and assembly. Putin’s long-term objective is the destruction of Ukraine as a state. – Fox News

Anna Mahjar-Barducci writes: Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that “this is not the beginning of a war,” but rather the prevention of the development of a crisis, which may lead to a global military confrontation. She also said that the recognition of the DPR and LPR help to put an end to the war in Donbass. […]He then added that Putin’s actions are not to be read in the “space of politics,” where the support of the street is needed, but rather in a history textbook. “Tangible popular support is saved for the future.” – Middle East Media Research Institute",https://www.fdd.org/overnight-brief/february-25-2022/
