WARSAW, March 8 (Reuters) - Poland is ready to deploy all its MIG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States, and urges other NATO members that own planes of that type to do the same, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.

U.S. lawmakers pushed President Joe Biden's administration on Monday to facilitate the transfer of fighter aircraft to Ukraine from Poland as well as other NATO and Eastern European countries, after a plea on Saturday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. read more

""At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,"" it said in a statement.

Ukraine's military already flies Russian-made aircraft, making them the best choice for Ukrainian pilots who already know how to operate them, experts say. Combat pilot training on U.S.-made aircraft can take years and requires a different pipeline for maintenance.

In neighbouring Slovakia, Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad reiterated the country's general aim was to replace Russian military equipment, including MiG-29 fighter jets, but said the country was not yet ready for such as step.

""At the moment, we don't have a replacement for the MiGs, but we are doing everything to speed up the processes,"" Nad said in a statement released after he spoke by phone with U.S. Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin.

Poland is supporting Kyiv with defensive weapons, but has said it would not send jets to Ukraine, as it is not a direct party to the conflict between Ukraine - which is not a NATO ally - and Russia.

""...any decisions on delivering offensive weapons have to be taken by the entire NATO and on a unanimous basis,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Tuesday during a joint news conference with his Norwegian counterpart in Oslo.

""This is why we are ready to give all of our fleet of jet fighters to Ramstein, but we are not ready to make any moves on our own because, as I said, we are not party to this war,"" he added.

Poland has volunteered to give its 23 MiG-29s to the U.S. immediately, presumably for transfer to Ukraine, in exchange for an opportunity to buy used American aircraft, the Polish minister of foreign affairs said March 8. But the Department of Defense said it doesn’t see good reason to do the deal, and doesn’t consider it “tenable.”

“The authorities of the Republic of Poland,” after consultations between the government and President Andrzej Duda, “are ready to deploy—immediately and free of charge—all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,” according to a statement posted on the Polish government’s official website.

“At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes.”

The Polish government also urged other NATO allies that operate MiG-29s “to act in the same vein.”

The move is not technically a reversal from Poland’s position the day before, when Duda’s office tweeted that Poland “won’t send its fighter jets to Ukraine” or allow that country to use its airfields. The new March 8 message did not specify that the jets would go to Ukraine, but to the U.S. That cautious phrasing may have been meant to avoid provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin to move militarily against Poland, which has so far absorbed nearly a million Ukrainian refugees from Putin’s invasion.

But Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby said the way Poland presented the offer “shows just some of the complexities this issue presents.”

The prospect of fighter jets “at the disposal of the U.S. government” operating from a U.S./NATO air base in Germany, flying into airspace contested by Russia over Ukraine, “raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,” Kirby said.

“It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,” he added, saying the U.S. will continue to consult with Poland and other NATO allies “about this issue, and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one.”

Kirby added, “the decision about whether to transfer Polish-owned planes to Ukraine is ultimately one for the Polish government.”

Neither the Air Force nor the State Department would comment.

In recent days, there has been speculation that European countries that operate Russian-made combat aircraft would transfer them to Ukraine in exchange for American types. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said over the weekend that Poland has a “green light” from the U.S. to take such action, and a number of members of Congress have pledged that they would provide funds to make such a transfer happen.

The only U.S. fighter that Poland employs that could easily be absorbed into its air force is the F-16. Since Poland seemed to rule out new-purchase aircraft—which could take several years to be delivered—the jets would either have to come from USAF Active, Guard, or Reserve units, from storage at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz., “Boneyard,” or from a third party willing to sell its used F-16s back to the U.S.

The USAF Total Force operates 936 F-16C/D aircraft, and their average age is just under 31 years. The Air National Guard alone operates 288 F-16C and 45 F-16D aircraft.

A Davis-Monthan spokesperson could not immediately say how many F-16s parked at the facility are in “recallable” condition, meaning that they have not been harvested for parts and could be regenerated.

Poland did not specify how many jets it wants in return for its 23 MiG-29s. Commercially-available, used MiG-29s have recently fetched between $5 million and $8 million, depending on their age and condition. Israel recently sold 29 of its early-model F-16s to adversary air company Top Aces, but the price of the jets was not disclosed.

According to Polish government accounts, that country’s MiG-29s are flyable but need a lot of maintenance, the engines being particularly unreliable. Poland’s statement did not mention spare engines nor whether any compatible ordnance for the jets would be provided.

The U.S. is known to operate an undisclosed number of MiG-29s that it flies to familiarize fighter pilots with the capabilities of the jet. It bought 21 MiG-29s from Moldova in 1997 for a reported $40 million in cash, other assistance, and non-lethal military equipment, such as trucks. Some of those aircraft have been dismantled for analysis; others are in threat “petting zoos”; and some number are flown for dissimilar air combat training, along with other Russian-made fighters.

The MiG-29 is marketed worldwide and equals or surpasses the F-15C in several areas. The MiG-29's wings are swept-back and tapered with square tips. LERXs are wide and curved down to the front. LERX begins on the nose below the mid-mount point, and the wings’ trailing edges end at a high-mounted point. Twin jet engines are mounted low and to the sides of the fuselage. Diagonal-shaped air intakes give a box-like appearance. There is a large exhausts. The fuselage is made of a long, thin, slender body with long, pointed drooping nose. There is a high-mounted bubble canopy. The tail fins have sharply tapered leading edges, canted outward with angular, cutoff tips. Flats are high-mounted on the fuselage, movable, swept-back, and tapered with a negative slant.

The MiG-29 is a widely exported aircraft, flown by Iraq, Iran, North Korea and Cuba. The MiG-29 has a few advantages over its more electronically advanced American counterparts. At about 40 miles apart, the American planes have the advantage because of avionics. At 10 miles the advantage is turning to the MiG. At five miles out, because of the MiG weapons sight and better maneuverability, the advantage is to the MiG. The weapons sight is a helmet-mounted system that allows the missile to follow the line of sight of the pilot's helmet. Where the pilot looks is where it goes.

The US Department of Defense of the United States of America and the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Moldova reached an agreement to implement the Cooperative Threat Reduction accord signed on June 23, 1997, in Moldova. The Pentagon pounced on the planes after learning Iran had inspected the jets and expressed an interest in adding them to their inventory. Although Iran already flies the less-capable Fulcrum A, it doesn't own any of the more advanced C-models. Of the 21 Fulcrums the United States bought, 14 are the frontline Fulcrum C's, which contain an active radar jammer in its spine, six older A's and one B-model two-seat trainer. This agreement authorized the United States Government to purchase nuclear-capable MiG-29 fighter planes from the Government of Moldova. This is a joint effort by both Governments to ensure that these dual-use military weapons do not fall into the hands of rogue states. From Oct. 20 to Nov. 2, 1997, loadmasters and aerial port experts squeezed two MiGs apiece, sans wings and tails, into the cargo holds of C-17 Globemaster III transports from Charleston Air Force Base, S.C. The Charleston airlifters delivered the MiGs to the National Air Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson AFB near Dayton, Ohio. If the NAIC can discover how the Fulcrum works, Air Force pilots might gain an edge if they face the Fulcrum in future combat.

5,2ba395fc-672b-418c-a0ef-2dd02c2f4c4f,[],2022-03-08 00:00:00,"A senior administration official told POLITICO that the U.S. intelligence community and the Defense Department have been opposed to the transfer of the Polish planes to Ukraine, due to the complications in getting them over the border and into the hands of Ukrainian pilots. The Polish government also didn’t consult with their U.S. counterparts before making the announcement.

A statement by Defense Department spokesperson John Kirby reflected that deep concern late Tuesday, saying “we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” and it is “simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it.”

Kirby signaled the logistics were problematic: refitting the aircraft to allow non-NATO Ukrainian pilots to fly them, along with “the prospect of fighter jets … departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,” he said.

Still, the U.S. was in touch with the Polish government over the proposal.

In the minutes after the surprise announcement by the Polish Foreign Ministry, a top State Department official struggled to explain to Congress what just happened.

“To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,” Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of State for political affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday. “I was in a meeting where I ought to have known about that just before I came,” Nuland said. “So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles.”

In a statement posted to its website, the Polish foreign ministry offered to send all of its Russian-made MiG-29 fighter jets “immediately and free of charge” to the U.S. air base in Ramstein, Germany.

In return, the statement said, Warsaw “requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes.”

Poland also called on other NATO allies that operate MiG-29 jets “to act in the same vein.”

Ukraine also flies the MiG-29 and has suffered heavy losses since Russia invaded late last month. Top Ukrainian officials since asked other countries that operate the jet to transfer their MiG-29s, since it would mean minimal training for Ukrainian pilots.

By transferring the planes to American custody rather than directly handing them over to the Ukrainians, the Polish government would sidestep the logistical challenge of getting the jets over the border, though it is not clear if the U.S. could legally accept the transfer of the Polish planes.

The Polish MiGs were upgraded in 2013 and 2014 with new avionics and other equipment to increase their lifespan, though the Polish air force has focused more on its growing F-16 fleet, along with its 32 inbound F-35s, the first of which will arrive in 2024. Some of the new, sensitive technologies installed on the MiGs would likely have to be pulled out before transferring to the Ukrainians.

The airspace over Ukraine is still contested, a senior Defense Department official told reporters at the Pentagon on Tuesday, with neither the Ukrainians nor the Russians owning the sky.

“The Ukrainians are still able to fly and to conduct missile defense,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss current operations. “The Russians continue to fly and also are capable of missile defense — very little of the nation of Ukraine is not covered by some sort of Russian surface-to-air missile capability.”

The saga over the planes began just days after Russia invaded Ukraine, when European Union security chief Josep Borrell said Poland, along with other Eastern European countries that still fly Russian fighter planes, had agreed to quickly transfer the jets to Ukrainian pilots.

That turned out to not be the case. Borrell later walked back those comments, saying it was up to individual nations to decide, and Polish President Andrzej Duda publicly rejected the deal.

But U.S. officials confirmed over the weekend that a possible transfer was still under discussion. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday the U.S. was working with Poland on plans to supply Ukraine with the MiG-29s, and to “backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians,” on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Yet Warsaw seemed dug in, with a government office tweeting on Sunday that “Poland won’t send its fighter jets to #Ukraine as well as allow to use its airports. We significantly help in many other areas.”

As for Poland’s request for U.S. jets, it would most likely receive F-16s in return for giving up its MiG-29s.

Other countries that operate the MiG-29 include Slovakia and Bulgaria, though both countries last week rejected the idea of transferring their aircraft.

7,2ba395fc-672b-418c-a0ef-2dd02c2f4c4f,['Joseph Trevithick'],2022-03-08 16:09:20,"After multiple carefully worded denials regarding reports about planned sales or donations of MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets to Ukraine, the Polish government has formally announced plans to transfer its entire fleet of these aircraft to the U.S. government. Though not stated, it seems all but certain that American authorities will pass these jets to the Ukrainian Air Force. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this past weekend that such a transfer would, unequivocally, get a ""green light"" from the United States.

The Pentagon has now issued its own carefully worded statement in response to the Polish government's announcement, which you can find in an update at the bottom of this story.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the deal today, adding that it had requested the U.S. government provide sufficient numbers of other fighter jets to make up for the loss of these MiG-29s. The Polish Air Force's current fighter jet fleets consist of around 28 Fulcrums and some 48 Block 52+ F-16C/D Vipers. In terms of combat jets, Poland's Air Force also operates a smaller number of Su-22M4 Fitter ground-attack jets. The country also has F-35A Joint Strike Fighters on order, but does not expect to take delivery of the first one of these jets until 2024.

""The authorities of the Republic of Poland, after consultations between the President and the Goverment, are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,"" the Polish Foreign Ministry's statement reads. ""At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes.""

The title of the press release, which does not mention Ukraine at all, adds that this is ""in connection with the statement by the US Secretary of State."" This is all but certainly a reference to Blinken's comments regarding the transfer of fighter jets from Poland to Ukraine.

“We are looking actively now at the question of airplanes that Poland may provide to Ukraine and looking at how we might be able to backfill should Poland decide to supply those planes,” Blinken told reporters on Sunday during his visit to Moldova. “I can’t speak to a timeline but I can just say we’re looking at it very, very actively.”

Blinken had separately said in an interview with CBS News' ""Face The Nation"" that the U.S. government did not see transferring fighter jets to Ukraine as an escalation of its involvement in the conflict there. He added that if the Polish did decide to turn over their MiG-29s to the Ukrainians that such a plan would get a ""green light"" from American officials.

There had also previously been unconfirmed reports that Ukrainian pilots were already in Poland preparing to take custody of the country's MiG-29s. However, Poland had publicly rejected the idea of transferring any aircraft to Ukraine, as well as reports that it might allow Ukrainian jets to fly from its bases. It now appears that these prior statements were very carefully crafted to be technically accurate while negotiations for how the transfer might be affected were still ongoing.

Despite Blinken's previous comments, any transfer of MiG-29s from any NATO country is likely to draw a rebuke of some kind from Russia. Poland's desire to try to avoid that backlash is likely a key factor in its choice to hand the jets over to the U.S. government first. It's not clear if American officials, who have been pressing their Polish counterparts over this matter, were aware that authorities in Warsaw would propose this particular diplomatic maneuver.

""To my knowledge, it wasn't pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,"" Victoria Nuland, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, said at a hearing today when asked about the Polish government's plans. ""I look forward when this hearing is over to getting back to my desk and seeing how we will respond to this proposal of theirs to give the planes to us.""

In addition, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affair's statement today ends with an appeal to ""other NATO Allies – owners of MiG-29 jets – to act in the same vein."" There had also been reports that Bulgaria and Slovakia might transfer their Fulcrums to Ukraine. There was discussion about Bulgaria possibly giving up its Soviet-designed Su-25 Frogfoot ground-attack aircraft, as well.

Officials in both of those countries have also denied those reports, but the Polish government's decision raises questions about whether similar transfers to the U.S. government first are actually in the works or could be in the near future. At the same time, as The War Zone has previously explored in depth, for Bulgaria and Slovakia, giving their jets to Ukraine would mean ceding their own organic combat aviation capabilities for at least a number of years. This could make it more difficult for these countries to agree to such a plan, even with promises that the U.S. government help backfill at least some of that capacity.

Dozens of additional combat jets would be an obvious boon for the Ukrainian armed forces, which started out the conflict at a severe numerical disadvantage to the Russian military, especially in combat jets. The Ukrainian Air Force has been able to prevent Russia from gaining air superiority after nearly two weeks in no small part thanks to the aircraft it does have, but its fleets have suffered losses as the fighting has dragged on. The U.S. military has assessed that Russian forces are now working to expand deployments of surface-to-air missile systems to try to help change the balance of power.

There are still numerous questions about how any transfer of ex-Polish MiG-29s to Ukraine will actually be carried out, as well as what other fighters Poland's Air Force might now be in line to buy. The underlying idea behind giving Ukraine the Fulcrums, as well as the Frogfoots, is that the country's Air Force already operates these jets, which would hopefully make it easier for them to absorb additional examples.

However, Poland's MiG-29s, though originally built during the Soviet era, have been substantially upgraded over the years and are much more advanced than Ukraine's examples. Beyond that, the cockpit layout of these aircraft is substantially different from the types that the Ukrainian Air Force has in inventory now. While it might not be necessary to train Ukrainian pilots to use all of the features found on the Polish fighters for them to take the aircraft in combat, some amount of instruction will be necessary.

There are also certain NATO-specific or otherwise sensitive systems that will need to be removed from the aircraft first. Any sort of demodification process would take some amount of time.

In addition, the basic logistics of getting the planes to Ukraine look set to be complicated. Currently, the U.S. government is not flying weapons and other military aid to Ukraine directly. Instead, planes bring it to facilities in Poland and Romania where the cargo is then loaded onto trucks for transport overland. Breaking down 28 MiG-29s, loading them onto trucks, driving them to Ukraine, and then reassembling the aircraft sounds like a process that could easily be arduous.

There is a possibility that Ukrainian pilots could come to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, or wherever the Polish jets might eventually end up, and then fly them back to Ukraine. The Ukrainian Air Force recently arranged to fly a Su-27 Flanker fighter jet that had been forced to land in Romania under still unclear circumstances earlier in the conflict back home. In that case, Romanian MiG-21s escorted the very clearly unarmed Flanker to the border with Ukraine.

Ukraine does claim to have pilots ready to jump in the cockpits of these jets once they arrive. Whether it has sufficient maintenance personnel and supply chains to support them is another question. The Polish Air Force established dedicated supply chains to support these jets.

It's also unclear what ""used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities"" Poland might hope to receive from the U.S. government. As The War Zone

Another way to mitigate this lost capability could be the U.S. government, as well as other NATO members, offering to deploy their own fighter jets to Poland on a rotational basis to help defend the country's skies for at least some number of years. Multiple nations within the alliance have already deployed fighter jets to locations across its eastern periphery with Russia in recent months in light of the situation surrounding Ukraine.

All told, it will be interesting to see what will happen to Poland's MiG-29s and what their future in Ukrainian service might look like in the end.

Update 6:55 PM EST:

Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby has now issued a statement regarding the Polish announcement. His full response is as follows:

We are now in contact with the Polish government following the statement issued today. As we have said, the decision about whether to transfer Polish-owned planes to Ukraine is ultimately one for the Polish government. We will continue consulting with our Allies and partners about our ongoing security assistance to Ukraine, because, in fact, Poland’s proposal shows just some of the complexities this issue presents. The prospect of fighter jets “at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America” departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance. It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it. We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one.

It's important to note that what Kirby appears to be primarily objecting to is the possibility of U.S. military pilots flying these jets to Ukraine, either to deliver them or for some other purpose, which is indeed untenable. From what Russian officials have said since the invasion began, they would almost certainly view the U.S. government as having become a party to the conflict if it flew ex-Polish MiGs into Ukrainian airspace.

It's not immediately clear from Kirby's statement if the U.S. government has entirely ruled out the idea of serving as some kind of intermediary for a transfer of the jets to Ukrainian custody at a location outside of Ukraine.

Update 3/9/2022:

The Polish government has now made clear that its proposal yesterday was both intended as an intermediate step toward transferring its MiG-29s to Ukraine and that this was meant to reduce potential direct risks to the country. Russia has, as expected, warned Poland or any other NATO member against delivering these jets to the Ukrainian Air Force.

""Such a serious decision as supplying planes must be unanimous and unequivocally made by the whole North Atlantic alliance,"" Polish Prime Minister of Mateusz Morawiecki said during a press conference on March 9, 2022. ""We did not agree to supply planes by ourselves, because it must be the decision of the whole of NATO.""

""It cannot be that Poland has – as the only NATO country – to take the risk, and the other countries would not have to compensate or share it with us in any way,"" Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski said in a separate radio interview, also on March 9.

Update:

The Pentagon has now come out and said that it will not support Poland's proposed transfer of the MiG-29s for a number of reasons including fears that it could provoke serious retaliation from Russia. You can read more about this and other related developments here.

“The authorities of the Republic of Poland...are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Rammstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the US of America,” the ministry said.

“At the same time, Poland requests the US to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,” it added.

It also urged other Nato countries to also send their fighter jets of a similar type, according to a statement from the foreign ministry.

On Monday, US lawmakers urged President Joe Biden and his administration to streamline the transfer of the fighter jets to Ukraine from Poland as well as other Nato countries and Eastern European allies.

This comes after a plea on Saturday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“The authorities of the Republic of Poland ... are ready to deploy, immediately and free of charge, all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,” the foreign ministry said, according to Reuters.

“At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,” they added.

On Saturday, Mr Zelensky began a private video call with US lawmakers by telling them that this may be the last time they see him alive.

Appearing in what is now his trademark army-green shirt in front of a white wall with the Ukrainian flag, he told them Ukraine needs to secure its skies, either through a no-fly zone enforced by Nato or through the provision of more warplanes so Ukraine could better defend itself.

Mr Zelensky has been pleading for a no-fly zone, but Nato has refused, saying it could provoke a wider war with Russia.

The hourlong exchange with some 300 members of Congress and their staffs came as Russian troops continued to shell encircled cities.

“President Zelensky made a desperate plea,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said at the time, adding that Mr Zelensky wants the US to facilitate the transfer of planes from Eastern European allies, something which now appears to be in motion.

The US has been considering sending American-made F-16s as backfill to former Soviet bloc countries in Eastern Europe that are now members of NATO. They, in turn, can send Ukraine their own Soviet-era MiGs, which Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly.

There appears to be a logistical problem, however, in sending the F-16s to Poland or other East European allies because of a production backlog. These countries would essentially have to give their MiGs to the Ukrainians and accept an IOU from the US for the F-16s. The situation is further complicated because the next shipment of F-16s is set for Taiwan, and Congress would be reluctant to delay those deliveries as it eyes China.

When Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell asked about the types of military support his country needs, Mr Zelensky said drones as well as planes would be the most helpful.

Washington appeared surprised by the announcement by Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, who said on Tuesday that his government was “ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein airbase and place them at the disposal of the government of the United States of America.”

The Pentagon appeared to reject the proposal, saying it was not “tenable”.

In a statement, the US Department of Defense said the prospect of the jets departing from the base in Germany “to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance”.

“We will continue to consult with Poland and our other Nato allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said.

The dispute came as Mikhail Mizintsev, the head of Russia’s National Defence Control Centre, said Russian forces would “observe a regime of silence” from 7am GMT to ensure safe passage for civilians wishing to leave Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. It was unclear if the proposed routes would pass through Russia or Belarus, conditions previously opposed by the Ukrainian government.

Authorities in Kyiv have previously accused Moscow of shelling a similar refugee corridor meant to allow residents to escape the devastated port of Mariupol.

“The enemy has launched an attack heading exactly at the humanitarian corridor,” the Ukrainian defence ministry said on Facebook on Tuesday, adding that the Russian army “did not let children, women and elderly people leave the city”. The International Committee of the Red Cross said many Mariupol residents face an “apocalyptic” situation, with no water, power or heating.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said 5,000 civilians were successfully evacuated from the Sumy region on Tuesday, where 21 people had been killed in air strikes on Tuesday.

The Polish incident has exposed cracks in the Nato alliance which the Biden administration has struggled to keep in lockstep in the face of the Russian invasion. Vice President Kamala Harris is due to hold talks with the Polish government in Warsaw on Thursday where she will attempt to repair some of the diplomatic damage.The US said on Tuesday that it was deploying two of its Patriot antimissile batteries to Poland to help protect Nato troops and territory. The deployment is intended to provide a layer of protection against the Ukraine conflict spilling over the country’s western border.

“This defensive deployment is being conducted proactively to counter any potential threat to US and allied forces and Nato territory,” the US European Command said in a statement.

The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is no longer transmitting data to the UN’s atomic watchdog, the agency said, as it voiced “deep concern” for staff working under Russian guard at the captured Ukrainian facility.

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Russia that any attack on supply lines in Nato countries carrying arms and ammunition to Ukraine would be grounds for retaliation. “An attack on Nato territory, on Nato forces, Nato capabilities, that would be an attack on Nato,” Stoltenberg said.

British foreign secretary Liz Truss will meet her US counterpart Antony Blinken in Washington on Wednesday to discuss what more can be done to help Ukraine and reduce energy dependency on Russia. Truss called the invasion of Ukraine “a wake-up call for free democracies”.

Poland is thought to have 28 of the Soviet-era MiG-29 warplanes, and had been in negotiation with the Biden administration on a three-way deal in which Warsaw would gave the planes to Ukraine, on condition that the US would provide the Polish air force with newer US fighters.

“Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities,” Rau said in a statement on his ministry’s website. “Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes.”

Rau requested other Nato allies with MiG-29 jets – a reference to Slovakia and Bulgaria – “act in the same vein”.

By handing them to the US, Poland was hoping to mitigate the risk of direct retaliation from Russia.

However, the US under secretary of state for political affairs, Victoria Nuland, said the Polish announcement had taken Washington unawares, calling it a “surprise move by the Poles”.

“To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they plan to give these planes to us,” Nuland told Congress. “I look forward when this hearing is over to getting back to my desk and seeing how we will respond to this proposal of theirs to give the planes to us.”

The idea of donating old warplanes to Ukraine was raised on 27 February by the EU foreign and security policy chief, Josep Borrell, who declared: “We are going to provide even fighter jets.” That announcement annoyed Polish officials, who said Warsaw was not properly consulted over a move that could expose the country to risk.

The Russian defence ministry did not address the issue directly but warned that any country that provided air fields for Ukrainian warplanes that were later used against Russians would be considered by Moscow as being involved in the conflict. Polish thinking is that when the planes are delivered to Ukrainian pilots, they will be taking off from an air base in Germany as US assets.

Poland announced its plan as US officials said the war in Ukraine had reached a pivotal moment, with Russia sustaining severe losses but with Putin determined to press on.

“I think the next couple of days are going to be critical for both the humanitarian situation and also for the tide of this war,” Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), told the Guardian.

US intelligence agencies told Congress on Tuesday that they tentatively estimated that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian soldiers had been killed so far, but that Putin would persevere in the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance.

“We assess Putin feels aggrieved the west does not give him proper deference and perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose,” the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told the House intelligence committee.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/poland-mig-29-jets-us-ukraine
