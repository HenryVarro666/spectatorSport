Zelenskyy criticizes West for holding back on weapons deliveries

In a video message late on Saturday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country needs more modern weapons to continue fighting Russia's invasion — and that Western allies have been holding back in their support.

""Unfortunately, Ukraine has not yet received enough modern Western anti-missile systems. Has not received aircraft. Hasn't received what the partners could provide. Could — and still can!"" he said in an official English transcript of the video.

""Every Russian missile that hit our cities and every bomb dropped on our people, on our children only adds black paint to the history that will describe everyone on whom the decision depended. [The] decision whether to help Ukraine with modern weapons,"" Zelenskyy added.

In the video, the Ukrainian leader also praised troops in the embattled port city of Mariupol, saying their defense has helped ""hold back a significant part of the enemy forces"" and bought Ukraine ""invaluable time.""

Zelenskyy said more 'modern weapons' were needed to combat Russian forces

Holocaust survivors in Ukraine flee Russia's war to Germany

For Holocaust survivors living in Ukraine, it can be painful to emigrate to the country of the former perpetrators. But, given the Russian invasion, most are just grateful that the opportunity to escape exists.

One of the recent evacuees, Liliya Vaksman, fled the embattled city of Dnipro. As a child, she experienced Wold War II, persecution and flight. And now, at 82, she has again.

""I'm just shocked by what's happening in Ukraine now,"" Vaksman told DW. ""I just can't believe the same thing is happening again now as when I was a kid.""

DW met with Vaksman and two other Holocaust survivors who recently arrived in the German capital of Berlin. For more on their journey, read the full story here.

Red Cross team 'yet to reach' to Mariupol

A Red Cross evacuation mission to help civilians escape Mariupol has not yet arrived at the besieged port city.

A spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the convoy left again on Saturday after being turned back in an earlier attempt on Friday.

""They are spending the night en route to Mariupol and are yet to reach the city,"" an ICRC spokesperson told news agency AFP.

Russia's Defense Ministry has blamed the Red Cross, saying the convoys left too late to reach the city on time, according to comments carried on the Russian state news agency Interfax.

DW correspondent Nick Connolly in Kyiv said that Russia is facing increased pressure to ensure the safe evacuation of civilians from Mariupol.

""This is such a big story internationally — so much attention on this, that there is a whole lot of pressure on the Russians to make this possible,"" Connolly said.

After speaking with people who have escaped Mariupol in recent days, he said they describe the situation as being ""far from being a well organized, slick operation, it's all pretty chaotic on the ground.""

Tens of thousands of people are currently trapped in Mariupol, with limited access to food and water.

Scholz warns of global impact of war in Ukraine

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has called for the Russian war in Ukraine to come to an end ""quickly.""

Speaking in the western German city of Essen, Scholz said Russian President Vladimir Putin is pursuing ""territorial claims that stem from the imperialist visions of earlier centuries"" which he said were now ""destroying the future of Russia.""

""He [Putin] did not expect Ukraine to defend itself. He believed that there would be people standing there waving flags and applauding. That is not the case. Everyone is defending themselves,"" the chancellor said.

Scholz blames Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine

""All the difficulties that the world economy is facing today, which were already great enough because of the coronavirus pandemic and its economic and social effects, are now becoming even greater because of this war. I say: it is a destruction of the future, far beyond Russia and Ukraine,"" Scholz warned.

Russian troop mobilization reports in Transnistria 'untrue'

Kyiv's claim that Russian troops are massing in the tiny breakaway region of Transnistria in Moldova to conduct provocations on the Ukraine border is ""absolutely untrue,"" authorities in Tiraspol said.

Ukraine's army chief said Russian troops already in Transnistria were preparing for ""a demonstration of readiness for an offensive and, possibly, hostilities against Ukraine.""

Transnistria is a Russia-backed region of Moldova that broke away after a short civil war in the early 1990s and is unrecognized by most countries.

In response, Transnistria's Foreign Ministry insisted that the region's leaders had repeatedly ""declared the absence of any threat to Ukraine.""

Moldova's Foreign Ministry also said Saturday there is ""no information to confirm the mobilization of troops in the Transnistrian region"" and that ""state institutions are closely monitoring the security situation in the region.""

Wladimir Klitschko thanks 'German brotherland' after Berlin talks

""The support that Germany is providing to Ukraine is remarkable,"" he said. ""Be it the material aid, the provision of essential goods or defensive weapons.""

Klitschko added that the backing given by Berlin was in proportion to the ""horrors of the war initiated by Putin's regime.""

He said Germany and Ukraine were ""united like never before because together they defend international law and the core value of freedom.""

In thanking the ""German brotherland,"" Klitschko said he would ""never forget Germany's support and your government's commitment.""

Sanctions could imperil ISS, says Russian space chief

The future of the International Space Station (ISS) is at risk after Western space agencies missed a deadline by Moscow to lift sanctions, the head of Russia's space program has said.

Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, implied on Russian state TV that the sanctions, some of which predate Russia's invasion of Ukraine, could disrupt the operation of Russian spacecraft servicing the ISS with cargo flights.

Rogozin stressed that the Western partners need the space station and that ""no one but us can deliver fuel to the station."" Only the engines of Russian cargo craft are able to correct the ISS's orbit, keeping it safe from space debris, he added.

Space is one of the last remaining areas of cooperation between Moscow and Western nations.

A NASA astronaut caught a Russian ride back to Earth on Wednesday after a US record 355 days at the ISS, returning with two cosmonauts.

Rogozin later wrote on his Telegram channel that Western counterparts had vowed to promote ""further cooperation on the ISS and its operations.""

Poland's Prime Minister calls for 'real sanctions'

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called for ""real sanctions"" against Russia in a meeting with EU Parliament President Roberta Metsola at a refugee reception center near Warsaw.

Morawiecki expressed dismay that sanctions had not hit hard enough as evidenced by the successful Russian central bank interventions and enforcement of capital controls, stabilizing the ruble.

Former war crimes prosecutor calls for Putin arrest warrant

Veteran International Criminal Court (ICC) war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte called for an arrest warrant to be issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin by the ICC for the invasion of Ukraine in an interview with Swiss newspaper Le Temps.

Del Ponte said, ""Putin is a war criminal.""

She is best known for her investigations of war crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. An arrest warrant she said would indicate ""investigative work has been done."" Del Ponte said, ""It would be impossible for him to leave his country, and it would be a strong signal that he has many states against him.""

The ICC is based in The Hague. While Ukraine is not a signatory, it did recognize the ICC's jurisdiction regarding crimes committed by Russian-backed forces in Ukraine in 2014.

Russia withdrew from the Rome Statute treaty which established the ICC in 2016.

Pope Francis also took direct aim at Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""Once again, some potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests, is provoking and fomenting conflicts, whereas ordinary people sense the need to build a future that, will either be shared, or not be at all,"" Pope Francis said.

Ukrainian orphans will overwhelm state social services: Bavarian minister

The family minister in the southern German state of Bavaria has criticized the federal government for its policy on Ukrainian orphans arriving from the war zone, saying state youth welfare services would not be able to cope.

Ulrike Scharf told the DPA news agency that Berlin's categorization of groups of orphans arriving in Germany as unaccompanied minors meant that such services would not manage to take proper care of all the children, some of whom were disabled.

She said Federal Family Affairs Minister Anne Spiegel had overruled the states' unanimous objections to this system.

The groups of orphans arriving together with their carers would have to be separated, which would not be in the best interests of the children, she argued.

Red Cross to make a fresh attempt at Mariupol evacuation

A Red Cross team will make a fresh attempt on Saturday to help evacuate thousands of civilians from the port city of Mariupol after its earlier try failed due to ""conditions that made it impossible.""

The international aid organization appealed for all sides to provide security guarantees so that the evacuation mission can proceed.

""For the operation to succeed, it is critical that the parties respect the agreements and provide the necessary conditions and security guarantees,"" the Red Cross urged.

The initial plan on Friday was for the Red Cross to escort dozens of cars and buses carrying thousands of civilians out of Mariupol and bring them safely to another Ukrainian city.

Russian and Ukrainian officials had previously agreed to a humanitarian corridor, but it was unclear whether the message had been received by troops on the ground.

The aid group later managed to escort some Mariupol evacuees who had already escaped the besieged city, Ukrainian Red Cross Deputy Director-General Olena Stokoz told DW.

Russia's defence ministry said aid convoys had not been able to reach the besieged city of Mariupol on Friday or Saturday and blamed ""destructive actions"" by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Interfax news agency said.

A Red Cross convoy traveling to the Ukrainian port turned around on Friday because it had become impossible to proceed with its mission to begin evacuating civilians, the ICRC said, vowing to try again on Saturday.

Interfax quoted Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev, the director of the Russian National Center for Defense Management, as saying the ICRC had shown its inability to provide any help in preparing to evacuate civilians from the city.

6:30 pm: Pope blasts ‘infantile’ war unleashed by ‘some potentate’

In his most pointed denunciation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Pope Francis on Saturday blasted the leader who launched a “savage” war.

The pope did not cite President Vladimir Putin by name, but the reference was clear when he said “some potentate” had unleashed the threat of nuclear war on the world in an “infantile and destructive” display of aggression.

“We had thought that invasions of other countries, savage street fighting and atomic threats were grim memories of a distant past,” Francis told Maltese officials on the Mediterranean island nation at the start of a weekend visit.

Francis has to date avoided referring to Russia or Putin by name, in keeping with the Vatican's tradition of not calling out aggressors to keep open options for dialogue. But the latest criticism of the powerful figure responsible for the war marked a new level of outrage for the pope.

“Once again, some potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interest, is provoking and fomenting conflicts, whereas ordinary people sense the need to build a future that will either be shared or not be at all,” he said.

Earlier Saturday, Francis told reporters en route to Malta that a possible visit to Kyiv was “on the table,” but no dates have been set and the trip has not been confirmed.

4:03 pm: Protesters in Russian-held Ukrainian town violently dispersed, say local authorities

Local authorities in the occupied southern Ukrainian town of Enerhodar said Russian forces had violently dispersed a pro-Ukrainian rally on Saturday and detained some participants.

Residents had gathered in downtown Enerhodar, where they were singing the Ukrainian national anthem, when Russian soldiers arrived and bundled some into detention vans, the local administration said in an online post.

""The occupiers are dispersing the protesters with explosions,"" it said in a separate post on Telegram, sharing a video of what appeared to be multiple stun grenades landing in a square and letting off bangs and clouds of white smoke next to the town's main cultural centre.

It also accused Russian forces of shelling another part of the town on Saturday and said as a result four people had been wounded and were being treated in hospital.

The reports could not be immediately verified. Moscow denies targeting civilians and describes its invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation"". Ukraine and the West say it is an unprovoked war of aggression.

Francis has been invited by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk of Ukraine's Byzantine-rite Catholic Church and Ukraine's ambassador to the Vatican, Andriy Yurash.

He has spoken on the phone with Zelensky and Shevchuk. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the pope has strongly condemned what he has called an “unjustified aggression” and denounced ""atrocities"".

11:01 am: Seven evacuation corridors planned for Saturday, Ukraine says

Seven humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from Ukraine’s besieged regions are planned for Saturday, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

The planned corridors include one for people evacuating by private transport from the city of Mariupol and by buses for Mariupol residents out of the city of Berdyansk, Vereshchuk said.

The International Committee of the Red Cross also said its team would try to reach Mariupol again on Saturday to help evacuate people.

Russian missiles hit two cities in central Ukraine early on Saturday, damaging infrastructure and residential buildings, the head of the Poltava region said.

""Poltava. A missile struck one of the infrastructure facilities overnight,"" Dmitry Lunin wrote in an online post. ""Kremenchuk. Many attacks on the city in the morning.""

Lunin later said at least four missiles hit two infrastructure objects in Poltava while, according to preliminary information, three enemy planes attacked the industrial facilities of Kremenchuk.

8:04 am: China denies working ‘to circumvent’ sanctions imposed on Russia

China said Saturday it was not doing anything “to circumvent” sanctions imposed on Russia, following warnings from EU officials that any attempt to aid Moscow's war in Ukraine could damage economic ties.

In the clearest indication yet of Beijing's position on the matter, a foreign ministry official told reporters: ""We are not doing anything deliberately to circumvent sanctions imposed on Russia by Americans and Europeans.""

But the statement, delivered after virtual talks between top EU and Chinese leaders on Friday, comes as Beijing holds to its stance of refusing to condemn the invasion by its ally Russia.

7:24 am: Pentagon to allot extra $300 million in 'security assistance' to Ukraine

The US defence department announced Friday it is allotting $300 million in ""security assistance"" to Ukraine to bolster the country's defence capabilities, adding to the $1.6 billion Washington has committed since Russia invaded in late February.

The package includes laser-guided rocket systems, drones, ammunition, night-vision devices, tactical secure communications systems, medical supplies and armoured vehicles.

""This decision underscores the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in support of its heroic efforts to repel Russia's war of choice,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said in a statement.

7:04 am: Red Cross prepares fresh evacuation effort in Mariupol

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it would try to reach Mariupol again Saturday after its team that intended to conduct an evacuation effort Friday was forced to turn back after ""arrangements and conditions made it impossible to proceed"".

Mariupol has faced weeks of ferocious Russian shelling, with at least 5,000 residents killed, according to local authorities, and the estimated 160,000 who remain face shortages of food, water and electricity.

“We have managed to rescue 6,266 people, including 3,071 people from Mariupol,"" Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky said in a video address early Saturday.

Giving details of Friday's evacuation efforts along humanitarian corridors, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 42 buses carrying Mariupol residents had departed from the city of Berdyansk, 70 kilometres (44 miles) southwest, while another 12 buses had left Melitopol with local residents on board.

Dozens of buses carrying Mariupol residents arrived Friday in Zaporizhzhia, about 200 kilometres to the northwest, AFP reported.

Ukraine’s defence ministry says its forces have seized control of the Kyiv region from Russian troops as officials warned that the departing soldiers were creating a “catastrophic” situation for civilians by leaving behind mines.

The announcement on Saturday marks the first time Ukraine has claimed control of the capital region since Russia launched its invasion on February 24.

“The whole Kyiv region is liberated from the invader,” Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, wrote on Facebook.

There was no immediate Russian comment on the claim.

In total, Ukraine’s troops have retaken more than 30 towns and villages around Kyiv, according to officials. The recaptured towns bore the scars of five weeks of fighting, with destroyed armoured vehicles, military gear and dozens of bodies lying scattered over streets.

In Bucha, a town northwest of the capital, Ukrainian soldiers used cables to pull the bodies of civilians off the streets out of fear that Russian forces may have left them booby-trapped.

Bucha’s Mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk said authorities there have buried 280 people in a mass grave and said the victims included women as well as a 14-year-old boy.

“All these people were shot, killed, in the back of the head,” Fedoruk said.

On one street in Bucha, the AFP reported seeing at least 20 corpses, including one with his hands tied.

An open Ukrainian passport lay on the ground next to him, while two other people had a white cloth tied around their upper arms.

AFP said all were wearing civilian clothes – winter coats, jackets or tracksuit tops, jeans or jogging bottoms, and trainers or boots.

British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was appalled by the atrocities in Bucha and voiced support for the International Criminal Court’s inquiry into potential war crimes in Ukraine.

Russia denies targeting civilians and rejects war crimes allegations.

Mines

Since sending troops into Ukraine in what it calls a “special operation” to demilitarise its neighbour, Russia has failed to capture a single major city and has instead laid siege to urban areas, uprooting a quarter of Ukraine’s population.

Ukraine’s armed forces reported diminished Russian air and missile attacks on Saturday but said Russian troops retreating from near Kyiv were deploying mines.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned in a video address: “They are mining all this territory. Houses are mined, equipment is mined, even the bodies of dead people.”

He did not cite evidence.

Ukraine’s emergencies service said more than 1,500 explosives had been found in one day during a search of the village of Dmytrivka, west of Kyiv.

Russia’s defence ministry did not reply to a Reuters news agency request for comment on the mining allegations.

Russia has depicted its drawdown of forces near Kyiv as a goodwill gesture in peace talks. Ukraine and its allies say Russia was forced to shift its focus to east Ukraine after suffering heavy losses near Kyiv.

The shift, however, does not mean the country faced a reprieve from more than five weeks of war or that the more than 4 million refugees who have fled Ukraine will return soon.

Zelenskyy said he expects the towns Russian forces withdrew from to endure missile and rocket attacks from afar and for the battle in the east to be intense.

In his nightly video address on Saturday, the Ukrainian leader said the country’s troops were not allowing the Russians to retreat without a fight: “They are shelling them. They are destroying everyone they can.”

Russia, Zelenskyy said, has ample forces to put more pressure on Ukraine’s east and south.

“What is the goal of the Russian troops? They want to seize the Donbas and the south of Ukraine,” he said. “What is our goal? To defend ourselves, our freedom, our land and our people.”

‘Symbol of Ukrainian resistance’

Moscow’s focus on eastern Ukraine also kept the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol in the crosshairs. The port city on the Sea of Azov is located in the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region, where Moscow-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian troops for eight years.

Military analysts think Russian President Vladimir Putin is determined to capture the region after his forces failed to secure Kyiv and other major cities.

The International Committee of the Red Cross had hoped to evacuate Mariupol residents Saturday but had not yet reached the city. A day earlier, local authorities said the Red Cross was being blocked by Russian forces.

An adviser to Zelenskyy, Oleksiy Arestovych, said in an interview with Russian lawyer and activist Mark Feygin that Russia and Ukraine had reached an agreement to allow 45 buses to drive to Mariupol to evacuate residents “in coming days”.

The Mariupol city council said earlier Saturday that 10 empty buses were headed to Berdyansk, a city 84km (52.2 miles) west of Mariupol, to pick up people who managed to get there on their own.

About 2,000 made it out of Mariupol on Friday, some on buses and some in their own vehicles, city officials said.

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said 765 Mariupol residents on Saturday used private vehicles to reach Zaporizhzhia, a city still under Ukrainian control that has served as the destination for other planned evacuations.

Some civilians who have escaped the besieged city said Russian soldiers seeking Ukrainian fighters repeatedly stopped them as they fled.

“They stripped the men naked, looked for tattoos,” said Dmytro Kartavov, a 32-year-old builder.

Mariupol’s capture would give Moscow an unbroken land bridge from Russia to Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. But its resistance also has taken on symbolic significance during Russia’s invasion, said Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Ukrainian think-tank Penta.

“Mariupol has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance, and without its conquest, Putin cannot sit down at the negotiating table,” Fesenko said.

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met for face-to-face talks this week in Turkey’s Istanbul, but described the talks as “difficult”. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday that the “main thing is that the talks continue, either in Istanbul or somewhere else”.

A new round of talks has not yet been announced.

But Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia said on Saturday that enough progress had been made to allow direct talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy.

“The Russian side confirmed our thesis that the draft documents have been sufficiently developed to allow direct consultations between the two countries’ leaders,” Arakhamia said.

ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine, April 2 (Reuters) - Ukraine said on Saturday its forces had seized back all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since Russia launched the invasion.

As Russian troops regrouped for battles in east Ukraine, towns surrounding Kyiv bore scars of five weeks of fighting. Dead civilians laid scattered over streets, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian forces of leaving behind mines.

Ukraine's troops have retaken more than 30 towns and villages around Kyiv since Russia pulled back from the area this week, Ukrainian officials said.

Bucha's mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said more than 300 residents had been killed. Many tearfully recalled brushes with death.

""We don't want them to come back,"" said Mariya Zhelezova, 74, who spoke of coming under fire by Russian soldiers. ""I had a dream today - that they left, and didn't come back.""

FLEEING MARIUPOL

His body was found in a village north of Kyiv on April 1, the news website LB.ua where he worked said on Saturday.

In the east, a Red Cross convoy was again seeking to evacuate civilians from the besieged port of Mariupol after abandoning an attempt on Friday over security concerns. It was not expected to reach the city until at least Sunday.

Mariupol is Russia's main target in Ukraine's southeastern region of Donbas, and tens of thousands of civilians there are trapped with scant access to food and water.

MISSILE STRIKES

Pope Francis said a ""potentate"" was fomenting conflicts for nationalist interests, the closest he has come yet to criticising Putin, although he did not name the Russian president.

""Once again, some potentate, sadly caught up in anachronistic claims of nationalist interests, is provoking and fomenting conflicts, while ordinary people sense the need to build a future that will either be shared or not be at all,"" he said. read more

Ukrainian officials reported missile strikes in various parts of the country.

In the south-central Dnipro region, a Russian rocket hit a rail line, badly damaging tracks and suspending train traffic, Ukrainian officials said. Earlier, Russian missiles hit the central Ukrainian cities of Poltava and Kremenchuk, said Dmitry Lunin, head of the Poltava region.

Russia's defence ministry said its missiles had disabled military airfields in Poltava and Dnipro. It later said its forces had hit 28 Ukrainian military facilities across the country, including two weapons depots.

The Ukrainian military also reported Russian air strikes on the cities of Severodonetsk and Rubizhne in the Luhansk region.

Hanna Malyar, the deputy minister for Ukraine’s defense ministry, shared the news in a Facebook post. Malyar said Ukrainians should still refrain from returning to their homes, citing ongoing efforts to clear the area, including from leftover mines.

Earlier this week, Russia said it was withdrawing forces from around Kyiv and the city of Chernihiv, but President Biden expressed skepticism about the claim and the Pentagon said Moscow was actually “repositioning” troops.

“We believe this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean the threat to Kyiv is over,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said on Tuesday.

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators met this week for peace talks in Turkey as the war has stretched on for more than a month, pushing more than four million Ukrainians to flee the country and resulting in the deaths of hundreds of civilians.

Ukrainians have put up a stiff resistance to the invasion, however, killing as many as 15,000 Russian troops — reportedly including multiple high-ranking officers — by late March, according to NATO estimates. The Kremlin has reported significantly lower casualty numbers.

Around Kyiv, the British Ministry of Defense said early on Saturday that Ukrainian troops were attempting to advance from Irpin toward Bucha and Hostomel northwest of the capital and had retaken several villages to its east.

Russian troops had also reportedly withdrawn from the Hostomel airport, located northwest of the capital, according to the British ministry.

The Ukrainian capital was under assault for weeks at the hands of Russian forces bent on seizing the city.

Last week, Russia's Defense Ministry announced that it would scale back assaults on Kyiv amid peace talks between the two countries. One Ukrainian MP said the move was an attempt to ""save face,"" and that Russian forces were really ""kicked"" out of the city, causing concerns about whether the Kremlin really wants peace.

The latest: Putin's forces appeared to shift their focus away from Ukraine's capital toward the south and east of the country, with Russia's military striking an oil refinery and fuel storage facilities in the key port city of Odessa on Sunday morning.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a televised address late Saturday he was aware that Russian forces had ""reserves to increase pressure in the east,"" but Ukraine was ""strengthening our defenses"" in the region and in Donbas in particular.

State of play: Zelensky said Russian forces had shelled in and around Kyiv and Chernihiv as they withdrew, but Ukrainian forces had retaken the region.

Large civilian death tolls and severe damage were reported in the Kyiv region towns of Irpin and Bucha after Russian troops left.

A Red Cross convoy that's attempting to evacuate Mariupol residents had still to reach the besieged southeastern port city, but some civilians had fled in private vehicles, AP reports.

Meanwhile, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update late Saturday that there had been a ""concentration of air activity"" toward southeastern Ukraine in the past week, ""likely a result of Russia refocusing its military operations in this area.

The defense ministry said in a Sunday morning intelligence update that Russia's navy was maintaining a ""distant blockade"" of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, preventing Ukraine access to water supplies.

What to watch: ""Despite ongoing Russian efforts to diminish Ukrainian air defence capability, Ukraine continues to provide a significant challenge to Russian Air and Missile operations. As a result, Russian aircraft are still vulnerable to short and medium range air defence systems,"" the defense ministry said.

""Russia's inability to find and destroy air defence systems has seriously hampered their efforts to gain broad control of the air, which in turn has significantly affected their ability to support the advance of their ground forces on a number of fronts,"" the report added.
