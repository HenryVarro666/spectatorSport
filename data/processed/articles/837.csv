U.S. and key allies kick select Russian banks out of SWIFT payment system The U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and Canada on Saturday announced that select Russian banks would be removed from the SWIFT payment system, a move that Ukraine had pushed allies for in recent days. ""We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,"" the joint statement read. ""This past week, alongside our diplomatic efforts and collective work to defend our own borders and to assist the Ukrainian government and people in their fight, we, as well as our other allies and partners around the world, imposed severe measures on key Russian institutions and banks, and on the architects of this war, including"" Putin. ""As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies,"" the statement continued. ""We will implement these measures within the coming days."" The allies said they ""commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system,"" will impose ""restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions,"" and that they ""commit to acting against the people and entities who facilitate the war in Ukraine and the harmful activities of the Russian government."" On that last bit, the group of nations said they will take ""measures to limit the sale of citizenship ‚Äî so-called golden passports ‚Äî that let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems."" The nations said they will launch a task force this week to ensure the implementation of the sanctions and identify and freeze assets of sanctioned people and companies within each of their jurisdictions.

Biden admin may back hitting Russia‚Äôs access to SWIFT if European allies agree The Biden administration would be supportive of taking aim at Russia through SWIFT, a service that facilitates global transactions among thousands of financial institutions if there is consensus among America‚Äôs European allies, people familiar with the discussions signaled on Saturday. Asked whether the U.S. is seriously considering the measure if European allies are open to it, an administration official said, ‚ÄúAs the president and [administration] officials have made clear, we are focused on coordinating with allies and partners to impose further costs on Putin for his war of choice.‚Äù A European diplomat said one reason for the administration‚Äôs previous reluctance to push publicly for targeting Russia‚Äôs access to SWIFT has largely centered on concerns that doing so would expose and call attention to divisions among the allies about taking the step. The person said the Biden administration has been trying to sell the notion that the U.S. and European allies are in total lock-step and has not wanted to get ahead of where the Europeans are at on SWIFT.

Germany considering 'targeted' approach to cutting off Russia from SWIFT, foreign minister says German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Saturday that her country was working to further sanction Moscow for its invasion and is considering targeting Russia's involvement in the SWIFT banking system. Baerbock said that Ukraine had ""an inalienable right to self-defense,"" explaining Germany's decision to send weapons and other military assistance to the country. She also said that the country was attempting to figure out a way to limit blowback should countries target Russia's involvement in SWIFT ‚Äî a secure messaging service that links 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries. ‚ÄúWe are working flat-out on how to limit the collateral damage of a SWIFT decoupling so that it hits the intended target,"" she said in a statement Saturday. ""What we need is a targeted and functional retrenchment of SWIFT vis-√†-vis Russia.‚Äù That is a major shift, even from a few days ago, and could bring about action more quickly. President Joe Biden said earlier this week that pulling Russia out of SWIFT was something he was considering, but it was not fully supported by all European leaders. ""The sanctions that were proposed on all their banks have equal consequence ‚Äî maybe more consequences ‚Äî than SWIFT number one,"" Biden said when announcing new sanctions targeting Russia's banks and economy on Thursday.

Retired Lt. Gen. Hodges says he believes Kyiv might not fall Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, former commanding general of U.S. Army Europe, said Saturday that Ukrainian forces have surpassed expectations in their fight against Russia's military. Moscow's forces are underperforming and none of their objectives have been met, Hodges said in an interview on MSNBC, adding, ""I don't think it‚Äôs feasible that Kyiv is going to fall."" He noted the massive Russian troop numbers required to encircle the Ukrainian capital and the effort it would take to clear each of the city's buildings. ""I'm not going to say that it's basically irrefutable or inevitable that Russia will eventually overwhelm,"" he said. ""I just don't believe that they have the capability, especially the further they go from Russian sovereign territory and from Belarus, that they will be able to maintain this."" Russia's supply line is getting longer and they are using huge amounts of fuel and resources to maintain the invasion so they may soon decide to switch from ground fighting to a more accelerated and lethal form of conflict, he said Hodges' analysis comes after reports that the Kremlin is growing increasingly frustrated over the lack of traction it has made in Ukraine.

Ukraine's leader defiant as Kyiv holds firm against Russian attacks 'I'm here': Zelenskyy's message to his people Saturday morning Feb. 26, 2022 00:42 Kyiv woke Saturday after a night of explosions and gun battles in the streets to find the Ukrainian government was still in control of the capital, vowing not to lay down its arms against the Russian assault.

U.S. weighs hotline with Russian military to prevent accidental clash near Ukraine The Biden administration has been working to set up a communication backchannel with the Russian military to prevent an accidental clash between U.S. and Russian forces along the Ukrainian border, as Moscow mounts a sweeping attack across the country, according to two sources with knowledge of the discussions. Such an arrangement would allow officials from both countries to exchange information to ensure that Russian forces attacking Ukraine avoid crossing paths with U.S. forces operating nearby in Eastern Europe, including along the Polish border and the Black Sea, the sources said. Still, they said, while the administration has different options for a ‚Äúdeconfliction channel,‚Äù as the military calls it, with Russia, none of the options completely remove all risk to U.S. troops in the region. Some U.S. officials had reservations about setting up the communication channel before Russia launched its attack on Ukraine this week, fearing it could have been seen as tacitly accepting Moscow‚Äôs invasion, the sources said. The channel would focus on the risk of errant missile strikes and ensuring Russian and U.S. aircraft and warships operate in separate areas, the sources said. Read the full story here.

Johnson's message comes amid protests in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and in other parts of Russia against the attack on Ukraine. The OVD-Info rights group that tracks political arrests said that 1,820 demonstrators were detained across Russia on Thursday night, and over 400 were arrested Friday, The Associated Press reported. To the people of Ukraine: Slava Ukraini.

'The fate of Ukraine is being decided now,' Zelenskyy says Ukrainian President Zelensky says Russian forces will attack Kyiv Feb. 26, 2022 03:44 As Russian troops advanced on Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy issued a desperate plea for help. ‚ÄúThe fate of Ukraine is being decided now,‚Äù Zelenskyy said in an address on social media. ‚ÄúSpecial attention is on Kyiv ‚Äî we should not lose the capital. The enemy will use all the possible forces they have to break our resistance. They will be mean and hard.

Russian troops bore down on the city as the global backlash mounted against the unprovoked attack on a European democracy. Share this -







More than 100,000 displaced amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, aid group says Thousands of Ukrainians flee to Poland for safety Feb. 26, 2022 01:51 The International Rescue Committee estimated Friday that more than 100,000 people have been displaced amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Shelter and food needs as well as the risk of abuse and exploitation for women and girls fleeing Ukraine are among the humanitarian aid group's top concerns, Lani Fortier, IRC's director of emergency deliveries said in a statement. The group was mobilizing resources in neighboring Poland. ""Over 100,000 people are reported to be displaced internally within Ukraine and thousands more are fleeing over borders into Poland, Romania, Moldova and other European states,"" she said. Fortier urged Russia to respect international law after a hospital in Donetsk, part of a breakaway region Putin declared independent of Russia ahead of the offensive, was attacked. Four people were killed, her organization said. ""The IRC continues to urge for the adherence to International Humanitarian Law across the crisis including the protection of civilians, civilian infrastructure like hospitals and schools, and vulnerable groups including women and girls,"" the nonprofit said in Friday's statement.

Here are the Russian oligarchs targeted in Biden's sanctions A former KGB leader, diamond mine executive and deputy prime minister ‚Äî these are just some of the roles held by Russian oligarchs targeted by the Biden administration in a round of ""unprecedented"" sanctions against members of Putin's inner circle. The U.S., working closely with European allies, has been steadily waging sanctions against Moscow with the goal of deterring Putin from escalating actions in Ukraine. The efforts, which do not appear to have thwarted Putin yet, could have lasting effects on Russian business and government leaders with international dealings. The White House said Friday it would also take the rare step of directly sanctioning Putin, a largely symbolic act given that the Russian leader has hidden his wealth and made it difficult to freeze assets. ‚ÄúElites close to Putin continue to leverage their proximity to the Russian President to pillage the Russian state, enrich themselves, and elevate their family members into some of the highest positions of power in the country at the expense of the Russian people,"" the U.S. Department of the Treasury said in a statement.

U.N. humanitarian chief: 'We are not leaving Ukraine' The United Nations' humanitarian coordinator vowed that aid operations in embattled Ukraine would remain and would expand in the country following Russia's military invasion. Even before Russia attacked the country, around 3 million people in eastern Ukraine needed aid due to eight years of war, Martin Griffiths, the U.N.'s humanitarian assistance under-secretary, said Friday. ""We had not left. We are not leaving Ukraine,"" Griffiths said at a briefing. ""Obviously, our people there are bunkered down at the moment. But we're expanding our presence in Ukraine and scaling up efforts to help meet the needs of people affected across that country."" There have been unconfirmed reports of shelling on urban centers and civilian casualties, Griffiths said, and populations have been displaced. ""I think it's fair to say that hundreds of thousands of people are on the move in Ukraine and out of Ukraine as we speak,"" he said. The U.N. has moved $20 million for immediate emergency aid for Ukraine. Also Friday, Canada pledged to match donations made to the Red Cross for humanitarian aid to Ukraine and to those displaced by the conflict, up to $10 million. Share this -







Chernobyl isn't the biggest nuclear risk. Ukraine's active nuclear power plants are. While much attention has been paid to Chernobyl this week as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, there is growing concern about the four active nuclear power plants that supply half of the nation's power. Those four power plants, located near towns and cities in western and southern Ukraine, contain 15 operating nuclear reactors. The concern is that a nuclear disaster could occur if during the conflict they were accidentally damaged, left unmaintained or cut off from the power grid needed to cool the reactors. Ukraine reported that its country's nuclear power reactors are still operating ""safely and securely,"" the International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday morning. But the organization, which is dedicated to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, said it remained deeply concerned. Read more here. Share this -







One of Russia's closest allies denies request for troops Kazakhstan, one of Russia's closest allies and a southern neighbor, is denying a request for its troops to join the offensive in Ukraine, officials said Friday. Additionally, the former Soviet republic said it is not recognizing the Russia-created breakaway republics upheld by Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, as a pretext for its aggression in Ukraine. Despite ceasefire accords covering the disputed land, Putin on Monday declared Russia's recognition of Luhansk People‚Äôs Republic (LNR) and the Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic (DNR) as independent states. The surprising development from a traditional ally of Russia has the support of the United States. ‚ÄúWe welcome Kazakhstan‚Äôs announcement that they will not recognize the LPR and DPR,"" the National Security Council said in a statement.

Russia vetoes U.N. Security Council condemnation of its offensive Russia on Friday vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning its offensive in neighboring Ukraine. The council voted 11-1, with three abstentions, to condemn the country's military aggression and call for it to cease, reverse and withdraw. China was among three abstentions despite its tacit support for Russia, including a refusal to back sanctions against the country. India and United Arab Emirates also abstained. Russia's vote included ""no"" and its veto. Russia holds the presidency of the elite council for the month of February and presided over the vote. The resolution cosponsored by the United States and Albania would have had the council condemning the offensive ""in the strongest terms"" and demanding that Russia ""immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine.""

Ukrainian ambassador to U.S. accuses Russia of war crimes Russia has committed war crimes, taken civilians hostage and attacked an orphanage with 50 children inside, Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, said at a press conference Friday. ""The Russian propaganda machine says that civilians were not targeted. I want to tell you that is not true,"" she said, claiming that Russian rockets hit residential areas and ambulances, injured children and destroyed strategic gas pipelines. She said that Ukrainian armed forces are keeping the situation under control, claiming that 2,800 Russians were dead in the conflict and that 80 Russian tanks, 10 planes and seven helicopters had been destroyed. NBC News has not confirmed the numbers of any injuries or deaths on either side. The ambassador also raised concerns about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which remains irradiated and a key storage facility for atomic waste after the infamous 1986 meltdown. The Russians seized control and took 92 hostages, she said, forcing them to work in shifts that do not comply with international regulations. ""All responsibility now lies with the Russian army,"" she said regarding the continued maintenance of Chernobyl. Markarova noted that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Joe Biden had another call Friday to discuss an anti-war coalition that included 73 countries, ""working hand in hand,"" though she said those countries should also work to further defend Ukraine from Russian attacks. While she applauded the sanctions the U.S. and other countries have announced on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, she said the sanctions on Russia should go further to fully ""exclude it"" from the international financial system. The press conference concluded with Markarova thanking Russians who had ""protested against Putin's attack on Ukraine."" ""We would like to say, we see you, and it gives us hope that there are forces in Russia that don‚Äôt support a brutal attack on this nation,"" she said. Share this -

Ukrainian forces kept hold of the capital city of Kyiv Saturday as a senior U.S. Defense official said there were signs the invading Russian forces were frustrated by fiercer-than-expected resistance.

Here's what to know now:

In a major shift, Germany announced it would join the list of countries sending military assistance to Ukraine ‚Äî and said it was considering a ""targeted"" approach to disconnecting Russia from the SWIFT banking system.

The U.S. continues to see indications of viable Ukrainian resistance, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Saturday. Moscow was particularly stymied by the fight Ukrainians have put up in the north around Kyiv and Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, the official said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has refused to leave the capital. Instead he has been posting videos from the streets, urging his people to join him in defiance.

The ""Baltic Leader"" was headed to St. Petersburg but was diverted to the port of Boulogne-sur-Mer in northern France between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. (0200-0300 GMT), Captain Veronique Magnin of the French Maritime Prefecture told Reuters.

The vessel was ""strongly suspected of being linked to Russian interests targeted by the sanctions,"" she said.

The United States Treasury Department has issued blocking sanctions against the vessel because, according to Treasury, it was owned by a subsidiary of Russian lender Promsvyazbank, one of the Russian entities hit by U.S. and European Union sanctions.

The bank's CEO, Pyotr Fradkov, is the son of Mikhail Fradkov, a former head of Russia's foreign intelligence service, who also served as prime minister under Russian President Vladimir Putin. Pyotr Fradkov was himself included in the latest round of U.S. sanctions.

Promsvyazbank, in a comment sent to Reuters, said its subsidiary no longer owns the Baltic Leader, and that it was bought by a different entity before the sanctions were imposed.

The French economy ministry, in a statement, said the ship's owner was Promsvyazbank subsidiary PZB Lizing, and that the ship was intercepted in enforcement of EU sanctions on the lender and its subsidiaries.

Magnin, the maritime prefecture spokeswoman, said ongoing checks were being carried out by customs officials and the ship's crew was ""being cooperative.""

The Russian embassy in Paris will send a note of protest to the French foreign ministry over the seizure, the embassy said in a statement sent to Reuters.

The embassy also said the ship's crew had been allowed to come ashore and move freely about the port.

A Reuters photographer at Boulogne-sur-Mer said the ship was moored at dockside.

The United States, EU, and other Western states this week imposed extensive new financial and trade sanctions on Russia after it sent military forces into neighbouring Ukraine.

The U.S. Treasury Department said Promsvyazbank was put under sanctions ""for operating or having operated in the defense and related materiel and financial services sectors of the Russian Federation economy."" It was also targeted by EU sanctions. read more

3,00b5a7f7-2cc7-4f1b-9dbc-2ab95c959c82,"['Tim Lister', 'Ivana Kottasov√°', 'Laura Smith-Spark', 'Julia Hollingsworth']",2022-02-26 00:00:00,"Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN) A Ukrainian delegation will meet with a Russian delegation on Monday for talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border following assurances from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.

The announcement came Sunday as Ukrainian forces engaged in fierce fighting with Russian troops in multiple cities across Ukraine.

Russia is facing universal condemnation and increased sanctions from Western powers over Moscow's unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its fourth day.

Ukraine's Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin said the talks would take place Monday morning local time.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier said he would be willing to hold talks with Russia but not in Belarus, pointing out that Russian military actions are being launched from that country.

On Sunday, Zelensky said in a brief televised statement that he doesn't expect much from the meeting.

""I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,"" Zelensky said.

Ukraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Zelensky's office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. ""The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,"" Zelensky's office said.

""Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation's travel, meeting and return.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country's deterrence forces -- which include nuclear arms -- onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.

""Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,"" Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.

Putin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.

""The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,"" said the official. ""This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.""

As the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin's order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a ""direct threat to us"" and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday's scheduled talks.

Kuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to ""listen to what Russia has to say"" but will not give in to pressure. ""We will tell them what we think of this,"" he said. ""And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.""

Kuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin's inner circle do not agree with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ""because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.""

Fighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv

Earlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.

And fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. ""Do not leave your shelters!"" he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.

""Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,"" an assessment by the UK's Ministry of Defence said.

Ukrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city -- home to about 1.4 million people -- for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.

But despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.

Others are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations ""reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed"" in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.

In a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.

The Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: ""The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.""

But Zelensky rejected this, saying: ""They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.""

Ukraine is ""documenting their crimes,"" he said, adding: ""This is terror.""

Russian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia's offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and ""buses with children"" -- actions he labeled as ""war crimes.""

""The Russian government doesn't understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,"" he added.

Russian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain's Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize ""the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,"" another British assessment said Sunday.

Russia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces , and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.

The US continues to see Russian forces facing ""stiff resistance"" and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.

The official noted that the Russians are having a ""little bit more success"" in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.

Ukrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.

On Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.

""Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,"" Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. ""Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.""

Without providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were ""considerably lower"" than those by Ukrainian forces.

Russia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.

So far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine's border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces -- despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.

A NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.

""They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,"" said the official.

Asked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. ""They are way behind schedule,"" the official said. ""This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.""

But the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk ""were completely blocked"" by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.

Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.

CNN could not immediately verify those claims.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.

Accusations of war crimes

Concerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.

A CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.

Thermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.

There is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.

Although Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel. There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.

According to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.

A woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by ""enemy artillery"" on Saturday night, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service.

Polish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.

A defiant Ukraine

As the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.

Officials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails. Ukrainian males ages 18 to 60 are banned from leaving the country.

In a statement Sunday, Zelensky called on citizens of the world also to join the fight against the ""Russian war criminals.""

""This is not just Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,"" he said.

The Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.

Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.

The Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.

Western powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration. On Saturday, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and ""paralyze"" the assets of Russia's central bank.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Sunday that ""very soon the Russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay"" for the invasion of Ukraine, as he announced he would raise German military funding during a special session with lawmakers.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Sunday that the European Union is shutting down its airspace to Russia.

""We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered and Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the European Union. This will apply to any plane,"" von der Leyen said.

""Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane. And that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,"" she added.

On Sunday, the EU also announced a ban on Russian news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, according to the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell.

""Today we are taking a crucial step to turn off the tap for the Russian's information manipulation in Europe by banning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union,"" Borrell said at a joint press conference in Brussels.

At home, the Kremlin appears to be in damage control, attempting to limit information about the difficulties its forces are facing in Ukraine.

Social media platform Twitter said Saturday it is being restricted inside Russia and is working to address the issue.

Russia's media regulator told 10 news outlets that it would restrict access to their publications unless they stopped spreading ""false information"" -- including the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians caused by the Russian armed forces.

Nonetheless, Russians continued to turn out for anti-war protests over the weekend. Russian authorities have detained a total of 4,862 people for participating in unsanctioned anti-war protests across the country since the invasion of Ukraine was ordered independent monitoring site OVD-Info said on Sunday.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html
4,00b5a7f7-2cc7-4f1b-9dbc-2ab95c959c82,['Rfe Rl'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making ‚Äúthe most important decision of their life -- to fight.‚Äù

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders ‚Äúgave us a maximum of five.‚Äù

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted ‚Äúthose who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it‚Äôs to the bottom‚Äù of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

‚ÄúThe number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,‚Äù Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.‚Äù

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia‚Äôs accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russia‚Äôs strategic nuclear forces to raise their alert status. (Specifically, he has ordered Russia‚Äôs ‚Äústrategic deterrence forces‚Äù to ‚Äútransition to special regime of combat duty.‚Äù)

If Russia‚Äôs alerts look anything like ours, this means that the crews and institutions that control strategic missiles, submarines, and bombers will be told to make preparedness a higher priority. They will cancel leaves, conduct inspections, check their communications, and so on, and their intelligence organizations will devote more time and attention than usual to monitoring for indications of possible launches against Russia.

Read our ongoing coverage of the Russian invasion in Ukraine

In this heightened state of alert, it is easier to make mistakes yet there is less time to correct them. This is not yet a direct threat to the United States, but it is a signal from Putin, and a gamble.

I had expected that Putin might resort to raising the nuclear-alert status if the invasion of Ukraine went poorly, but I am surprised that he reached for this measure so soon.

And the invasion is, indeed, going poorly for Putin. The Ukrainians did not greet the Russians as liberators. Russian military performance has been worse, and Ukrainian military performance has been better, than many observers (including me) might have expected. Russia still has plenty of time to start bringing down a lot more force on Ukraine, but that will begin a bloodbath and Putin will have to admit that his earlier confidence in a quick victory was unwarranted.

Putin might also be rattled by the scale of the protests erupting in Russia itself. The Russian authorities have already jailed many hundreds of people, and at some point, even Putin must realize that he can‚Äôt arrest everyone (as much as he‚Äôd probably like to do so).

This all suggests that Putin‚Äôs order‚Äîconducted on television and captured on video‚Äîis a measure aimed as much at a domestic Russian audience as it is at the West. He may be hoping to produce a kind of Cold War rallying-around-the-flag among the Russian people. Or, at the least, to increase the sense that protest during a nuclear crisis is even more traitorous than usual.

Had Putin wanted to send a message solely to NATO, he could have merely given the order to the Russian chain of command, and Western intelligence and defense sources would have picked it up immediately. We know what such an order sounds like and what kind of activity would follow it.

In fact, that‚Äôs exactly what we did in 1973, when the Nixon administration increased U.S. nuclear readiness during the Yom Kippur War. We made no announcement, but we sent the alert orders in the clear, where we knew Moscow could hear them. Our public silence allowed for a certain amount of ambiguity, which we hoped would induce even more caution in the Kremlin.

Putin, however, gave a short speech before issuing the official order to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov (who were wearing the Russian equivalent of daily battle-dress uniforms rather than formal military dress). Like all his statements since the Ukraine crisis began, Putin‚Äôs preamble sounded like it was cribbed from a Soviet leadership speech circa 1975. He griped about economic sanctions, which have clearly gotten his attention, and he accused ‚Äúthe leading NATO nations‚Äù‚Äîan old Soviet formulation that always means the United States, sometimes along with the United Kingdom and Germany‚Äîof directing ‚Äúaggressive statements‚Äù at Russia.

If Putin was signaling his own people, however, the fact remains that those forces now on higher alert are readying for combat with the United States and the rest of NATO. The missiles and bombers are pointed at us, not the people of Moscow. Putin is playing an insanely dangerous game here. He‚Äôs holding a weak hand and yet threatening to go all in. This is yet more evidence that years of isolation, in which his only contact is with sycophants and security guards, have taken their toll on his mental state.

What should the U.S. do?

For now, the sensible, and confident, American answer should be to do nothing. This might seem counterintuitive: The Russians have gone to higher alert, and it would seem only prudent to answer this with a reciprocal raising of U.S. alert status. But that Cold War reaction would, I suspect, be exactly what Putin wants. He‚Äôs in a jam and he‚Äôs trying to look strong, and part of the way he can do that is to turn his hare-brained scheme in Ukraine into a gigantic Russian-American confrontation. Putin would like nothing better than to take everyone‚Äôs mind off Ukraine and focus us all on a game of nuclear chicken.

We should not take this bait. There‚Äôs no good strategic reason to give Putin what he wants, and we should hope that President Biden will pointedly ignore this obvious provocation.

6,00b5a7f7-2cc7-4f1b-9dbc-2ab95c959c82,[],2022-02-25 00:00:00,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) ‚Äî Invading Russian forces closed in on Ukraine‚Äôs capital Friday, in an apparent encircling movement after a barrage of airstrikes on cities and military bases around the country.

With growing signs that Russia aims to overthrow him, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told European Union leaders in a video link-up from his bunker late Thursday that it might be the last time they saw him alive.

But on Friday Zelenskyy released a video of himself and his senior aides outside the presidential office in Kyiv to reassure Ukrainians that he and other top officials would stay in the capital.

He later appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a bleak statement that multiple cities were under attack. ‚ÄúThis night they will storm,‚Äù he said.

The assault, anticipated for weeks by the West, amounts to Europe‚Äôs largest ground conflict since World War II as President Vladimir Putin tries to restore Moscow‚Äôs Cold War influence. It is unclear how much or little Russian forces have seized or the extent of the casualties.

U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO partners agreed Friday to send thousands of troops to help protect allies along the alliance‚Äôs eastern edge. Biden spoke later with Zelenskyy to convey his support and ‚Äúcommended the brave actions of the Ukrainian people who were fighting to defend their country,‚Äù the White House said.

Here are the things to know about the conflict and the security crisis in former Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe:

RUSSIAN TROOPS MARCH ON

The Russian military said Friday it had encircled the cities of Sumy and Konotop in northeastern Ukraine, but was ‚Äútaking steps to ensure civilians‚Äô safety.‚Äù

Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces have so far knocked out 211 Ukrainian military installations, including 17 command centers, 19 air defense missile systems, 39 radar units, 67 tanks and six warplanes. The Russian military also said it seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv, allowing it to quickly build up forces to take the capital.

Late Friday, the Russian military said it has taken over Melitopol, a city near the Azov Sea. The claim could not immediately be independently verified.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. defense official said it‚Äôs estimated that Russia has now launched more than 200 missiles into Ukraine and some have hit residential areas, although it was unclear if they were deliberately targeted.

But U.S. defense officials believe the Russian offensive has encountered considerable resistance and is proceeding slower than Moscow had envisioned.

Ukraine‚Äôs military reported shooting down an II-76 Russian transport plane carrying paratroopers near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Kyiv, an account confirmed by a senior American intelligence official. It was unclear how many were on board. Transport planes can carry up to 125 paratroopers.

HINTS OF TALKS TO STOP THE FIGHTING

Hopes for a negotiated end to the war dimmed on Friday after a tentative agreement to discuss Zelenskyy‚Äôs offer to designate Ukraine a non-aligned country appeared to break down.

The Kremlin initially said it was ready to send a delegation to Belarus, then later backpedaled, saying it preferred to meet in Warsaw. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested it was too late, saying Zelenskyy should have agreed to talks earlier on.

Autoplay Caption

But late Friday, Zelenskyy‚Äôs spokesman Sergii Nikiforov wrote on Facebook that the two sides are consulting on a place and time for the talks.

Hungary‚Äôs foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, offered Budapest as a possible location. Also writing on Facebook, he said he put the proposal to both Russia‚Äôs and Ukraine‚Äôs government and neither dismissed it.

Before the invasion, the West had rejected Russia‚Äôs demand to keep Ukraine out of NATO. Putin used the refusal to justify the invasion, claiming that the West left him no other choice.

CIVILIANS IN HARM‚ÄôS WAY

Waking to the second day of Russia‚Äôs invasion, horrified civilians found themselves at risk as artillery shells rained down on some residential buildings on Kyiv‚Äôs outskirts.

City residents stood uneasily in doorways of apartment buildings watching armored personnel carriers driving down the streets.

After 8 p.m., a large boom was heard near Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the square in central Kyiv. And the mayor said five explosions struck near a major power plant just outside the city. The causes of the explosions was not immediately known.

Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said its staffers have so far verified at least 25 civilian deaths and 102 injured, mostly from shelling and airstrikes.

A spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, Shabia Mantoo, said more than 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes in Ukraine and that ‚Äúup to 4 million people may flee to other countries if the situation escalates.‚Äù

FLEEING FOR SAFETY

Thousands of Ukrainians crossed Friday into neighboring countries to the west in search of safety from the unfolding war in their country.

With men of military age banned from leaving the country, most of those who crossed borders were women, children and the elderly.

One woman from Kyiv who arrived in Przemsyl, Poland, described how men were pulled off trains in Ukraine before they got to the border.

Cars were backed up for several miles at some border crossings as authorities in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova mobilized to receive the Ukrainians, providing shelter, food and legal help. These countries also eased their usual border procedures, including COVID-19 testing requirements.

POPE‚ÄôS PERSONAL APPEAL FOR PEACE

The pope broke protocol with an in-person visit Friday to the Russian Embassy to ‚Äúexpress his concern about the war‚Äù in Ukraine.

Pope Francis‚Äô extraordinary gesture was viewed as a sign of his anger at Russia‚Äôs actions, and his willingness to make a personal appeal for the end of hostilities.

The pope traveled to and from the embassy in a small white car, with Vatican officials saying they knew of no such previous papal initiative.

NUCLEAR WAR NIGHTMARE REVISITED

Reviving Cold War fears of a nuclear showdown, Putin has warned in a speech that he has the weapons available if anyone dares to use military means to try to stop his takeover of Ukraine.

Whether an empty threat or not, Putin‚Äôs words re-animated the specter of nuclear war ‚Äî through accident or miscalculation.

The Russian president said in a speech early Thursday that despite ‚Äúlosing a considerable part of its capabilities after the fall of the Soviet Union,‚Äù Russia remains ‚Äúone of the most powerful nuclear states‚Äù and has ‚Äúa certain advantage in several cutting-edge weapons.‚Äù

PROMISES OF MONEY FOR UKRAINE

The United Nations plans to seek over $1 billion in donations for humanitarian relief in Ukraine over the next three months, the U.N. humanitarian chief said Friday.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU has decided on an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion) in economic aid for Ukraine.

TURNING THE SCREWS ON RUSSIA

The West has taken a military option in Ukraine off the table, but world leaders ‚Äî with the exception of Moscow ally China ‚Äî are preparing measures aimed at hurting the Russian economy and its leaders, including Putin himself.

The U.S., Britain, Canada and European Union said Friday they will sanction Putin and Lavrov, his foreign minister. The EU unanimously agreed to freeze their assets.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki indicated the U.S. sanctions will include a travel ban.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the sanctions showed the ‚Äútotal helplessness‚Äù of the West. ‚ÄúWho are you going to talk to? ... A nuclear power, a great country; who have you decided to play with?‚Äù Zakharova said in televised remarks.

EU ministers have said that even further sanctions were still possible, including booting Russia out of SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions.

Asian and Pacific countries have joined the West in taking punitive measures against Russia, including export controls aimed at starving its industries and military of semiconductors and other high-tech products.

In retaliation to a British ban on Aeroflot flights, Russia‚Äôs civil aviation authority forbade U.K. flights to and over Russia starting Friday.

Canada‚Äôs largest province is pulling all Russian vodka from government-owned liquor stores, Ontario‚Äôs finance minister said. Quebec is considering a ban on Russian liquor.

The Council of Europe also suspended Russia from the continent‚Äôs foremost human rights organization.

And in pop culture, the wildly popular Eurovision song contest also banned Russia from the May finals in Turin, Italy.

SPORTING WORLD TURNS ITS BACK

Russia has been stripped of hosting the Champions League final by UEFA with St. Petersburg replaced by Paris, and Formula One dropped this season‚Äôs Russian Grand Prix in Sochi in September

The showpiece final in the European men‚Äôs football season will still be held on May 28 but at the 80,000-seat Stade de France.

The International Ski Federation announced Russia will not host any more of its World Cup events this winter, and the European curling championships scheduled to be held in November in Perm, Russia, will also be relocated, the sport‚Äôs international governing body announced on Friday.

The International Tennis Federation also canceled all events taking place in Russia indefinitely.

‚ÄòA sense of Russia having rolled the dice‚Äô: Analyst

Nigel Gould-Davies, senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the United Kingdom-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, says Moscow is ‚Äúfacing setbacks that it did not expect‚Äù but retains a ‚Äúvery significant‚Äù numerical advantage over Kyiv in military terms.

‚ÄúIt is taking casualties and Ukraine is taking prisoners, including some quite senior, at least one, possibly two, brigade commanders,‚Äù Gould-Davies told Al Jazeera from Washington.

‚ÄúSo Russia will be motivated now to accelerate the forces that it brings to this conflict,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúSo far, it has been using about less than half of the total forces it has mobilised and prepared for this [invasion].

Berlin discussing export of RPGs to Ukraine via a third country

Germany‚Äôs government is in talks over approving the delivery of 400 rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) to Ukraine via a third country but no final decision on whether to do so has been taken, the country‚Äôs defence ministry says.

If carried through, the move would signal a major policy shift after Berlin faced criticism for refusing to send weapons to Kyiv, unlike other Western allies.

Germany has a longstanding policy of not exporting weapons to warzones, rooted partly in its bloody 20th-century history and resulting pacifism. Countries aiming to onpass German weapons exports need to apply for approval in Berlin first.

Berlin is also still to decide on a request from Estonia regarding the passing on of old GDR howitzers to Ukraine. Finland had bought the howitzers in the 1990s after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and later re-sold them to Estonia.

‚ÄúVladimir Putin has unparalleled personal power over his country and he has chosen to go to war against a neighbour that posed no threat to Russia, because he wants to reverse history and take away the freedom and the democracy that the Ukrainian people chose for themselves.‚Äù

In its new sanctions, Payne said Australia will target 339 members of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament and eight more oligarchs. The new measures follow a series of Australian sanctions announced earlier in the week.

Moody‚Äôs puts Russia, Ukraine ratings on review for downgrade

Moody‚Äôs said it has put the credit ratings of Russia and Ukraine on review for a downgrade.

There are ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù around Russia‚Äôs ability to manage the disruptive impact of new sanctions on its economy, public finances and financial system, the ratings agency said.

Ukraine has a B3 rating and Moody‚Äôs said an extensive conflict could pose a risk to the government‚Äôs liquidity and external positions, given the country‚Äôs sizeable external maturities in the coming years and the reliance of its economy on foreign-currency funding.
