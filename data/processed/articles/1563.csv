Begin Text:

We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, condemn in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns. Haunting images of civilian deaths, victims of torture, and apparent executions, as well as reports of sexual violence and destruction of civilian infrastructure show the true face of Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and its people. The massacres in the town of Bucha and other Ukrainian towns will be inscribed in the list of atrocities and severe violations of international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights, committed by the aggressor on Ukrainian soil.

In the presence of the Foreign Minister of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, we expressed today our heart-felt solidarity with the Ukrainian people and our deepest condolences to the victims of this war and their families. We underline our unwavering support for Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders and express our readiness to assist further, including with military equipment and financial means, to allow Ukraine to defend itself against Russia’s aggression and to rebuild Ukraine.

We underscore that those responsible for these heinous acts and atrocities, including any attacks targeting civilians and destruction of civilian infrastructure, will be held accountable and prosecuted. We welcome and support the ongoing work to investigate and gather evidence of these and other potential war crimes and crimes against humanity, including by the ICC Office of the Prosecutor, the Commission of Inquiry mandated by the UN Human Rights Council, the Human Rights Monitoring Mission Ukraine of the OHCHR, and the OSCE’s mission of experts mandated by OSCE Participating States. We will provide investigative support, technical experts and funding. We will continue to promote accountability for all those complicit in Moscow’s war of choice, including the Lukashenka regime in Belarus. We are convinced that now is the time to suspend Russian membership of the Human Rights Council.

Russia must immediately comply with the legally binding order of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to suspend the military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine. Further, we urge Russia to withdraw completely its military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.

We warn against any threat or use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. We recall Russia’s obligations under international treaties of which it is a party, and which protect us all. Any use by Russia of such a weapon would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences. We condemn Russia’s unsubstantiated claims and false allegations against Ukraine, a respected member of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention that is in compliance with its legal obligations under those instruments. We express concern about other countries and actors that have amplified Russia’s disinformation campaign.

We express our gravest concern with Russia forcefully seizing control of nuclear facilities, and other violent actions in connection with a number of nuclear facilities, nuclear and other radioactive material, which have caused and continue to pose serious and direct threats to the safety and security of these facilities and their civilian personnel, significantly raising the risk of a nuclear accident or incident, which endangers the population of Ukraine, neighboring States and the international community.

We reiterate our demand that Russia upholds its obligations under international humanitarian law and desists from further blatant abuses. The Russian leadership must immediately provide for safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access and make safe passages work, enabling humanitarian aid to be delivered to besieged cities and civilians to reach safety.

We commit to supporting the Government of Ukraine’s humanitarian coordination structure and to disburse humanitarian support quickly. We ask others to join in this effort. A humanitarian push including more funding is urgently needed for Ukraine and beyond as Russia’s ruthless war and actions are having massive consequences on global commodity and food prices. The resulting rise in food insecurity is being felt disproportionately by the most vulnerable. We stand in solidarity with our partners across the world who have to bear the rising price of President Putin’s unilateral choice to wage war in Europe. We will make coherent use of all instruments and funding mechanisms to address food insecurity, keep markets open, and build resilience in the agriculture sector on all continents. We will actively counter Russia’s narrative that Western sanctions have caused the rise in global food prices and call it out for what it is: a blatant lie.

In light of Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine, carried out with Belarus’ complicity, we have already adopted unprecedented and coordinated economic and financial sanctions against Russia that impose a significant cost on its economy. We stress the necessity of further increasing the economic pressure inflicted on Russia and the Lukashenka regime in Belarus. Together with international partners, the G7 will sustain and increase pressure on Russia by imposing coordinated additional restrictive measures to effectively thwart Russian abilities to continue the aggression against Ukraine. We will work together to stop any attempts to circumvent sanctions or to aid Russia by other means. We are taking further steps to expedite plans to reduce our reliance on Russian energy, and will work together to this end.

We commend those neighboring states to Ukraine that demonstrated great solidarity and humanity by welcoming Ukrainian refugees and third country nationals affected by the conflict. We confirm the need for increased international assistance and will continue to support these countries, including by receiving more refugees. President Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine has already forced millions of civilians, especially women, children, and elderly, to flee their homes. Over 4.2 million crossed the border to other countries, almost all of them to the EU and the Republic of Moldova. We reiterate our concern about the risk to this vulnerable population, including the risk of human trafficking and our commitment to protect these refugees.

Ministers paid special attention to the Republic of Moldova, which hosts the largest group of refugees from Ukraine per capita. The Ministers agreed to further coordinate their assistance for Moldova’s humanitarian response and long-term resilience following the Moldova Support Conference co-hosted by Germany, France and Romania on 5 April in Berlin and the establishment of the Moldova Support Platform.

1,d0e010e5-c9ce-445c-917c-7a848a94787b,['Al Jazeera Staff'],2022-04-06,"Citing abuses in Ukraine, US announces new penalties that target Vladimir Putin’s adult children and Russia’s largest bank.

In a new round of sanctions, the United States has banned American investments in Russia, imposed penalties on family members of Vladimir Putin and other top Russian officials and tightened restrictions on Sberbank, the country’s largest financial institution.

The fresh sanctions, announced on Wednesday, come as the United States and its Western allies accuse Russia of war crimes in Ukraine after the discovery of atrocities in areas near Kyiv that had been occupied by Russian forces. The measures were taken in coordination with other G7 countries and the European Union, the White House said.

A senior Biden administration official told reporters on Wednesday that Russia is “descending into economic and financial and technological isolation” that is sending the country back to “Soviet-style” living standards.

“The sad reality is Putin’s war will make it harder for Russians to travel abroad; it means their debit cards may not work. They may only have the option to buy knockoff phones and knockoff clothes. The shelves of stores may be empty,” the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.

Wednesday’s sanctions also target Alfa Bank, Russia’s largest privately-owned financial institution.

“This action will freeze any of Sberbank’s and Alfa Bank’s assets touching the US financial system and prohibit US persons from doing business with them,” the White House said in a statement.

“Sberbank holds nearly one-third of the overall Russian banking sector’s assets and is systemically critical to the Russian economy.”

Penalties were also imposed on Putin’s two adult daughters as well as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s wife and daughter.

On Monday, President Joe Biden had reasserted his accusation that Putin is a “war criminal”, citing atrocities in Bucha, near Kyiv, where corpses were discovered in the streets after the withdrawal of Russian forces.

Biden stressed after Wednesday’s measures were announced that sanctions are hurting the Russian economy, vowing to continue efforts to further isolate Moscow.

“Just in one year, our sanctions are likely to wipe out the last 15 years of Russia’s economic gains,” Biden said.

I made clear that Russia would pay a severe and immediate price for its atrocities in Bucha. Today, along with our Allies and partners, we’re announcing a new round of devastating sanctions. https://t.co/LVqTDIOSvz — President Biden (@POTUS) April 6, 2022

In announcing the new sanctions on Wednesday, the White House invoked alleged abuses against Russian forces, including in Bucha. Moscow had denied the violations, suggesting that footage and evidence of abuse may have been staged.

Earlier this week, the US Treasury blocked Russia from using assets frozen in the United States to make debt payments.

“Even if Russia taps into other sources of hard currency to remain current on its debt obligations, that will translate into fewer resources available to Putin to fund his war machine,” the US official said on Wednesday.

Russia launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24 after a months-long standoff that saw Moscow amass nearly 200,000 troops near the Ukrainian borders as it demanded an end to NATO expansion into former Soviet republics.

The US and its allies were quick to impose sweeping sanctions on the Russian economy as well as financial penalties on Putin and elites in his inner circle.

Earlier on Wednesday, the US Department of Justice revealed two charges of violating sanctions against Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev, the first indictment since the February invasion.

Malofeyev faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each sanction charge if convicted, but the Department of Justice said he remains at large and is believed to be in Russia.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Wednesday that the US disrupted a malicious digital network, known as a botnet, controlled by the Russian military intelligence agency (GRU).

“The Russian government has recently used similar infrastructure to attack Ukrainian targets. Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used,” he said. “Thanks to our close work with international partners, we were able to detect the infection of thousands of network hardware devices. We were then able to disable the GRU’s control over those devices before the botnet could be weaponised.”

Last month, the White House urged private companies in the US to tighten digital protections in anticipation of a possible Russian cyberattack targeting vital infrastructure in the country.

“It does not matter how far you sail your yacht. It does not matter how well you conceal your assets. It does not matter how cleverly you write your malware or hide your online activity, the Justice Department will use every available tool to find you,” Garland said in a message to Russian oligarchs and “criminals” on Wednesday.

Garland also pledged that the Department of Justice will help in the investigation of possible war crimes in Ukraine. “Today, we are assisting international efforts to identify and hold accountable those responsible for atrocities in Ukraine. And we will continue to do so,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/6/us-bans-investments-in-russia-in-fresh-sanction-package

New Sanctions Imposed on Putin’s Family and Architects of War

President’s New Executive Order To Ban New Investment in Russia

WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took major steps to degrade the economy of the Russian Federation in response to Russia’s continued brutal war against Ukraine and atrocities against Ukrainian citizens. Treasury is imposing full blocking sanctions on Sberbank, Russia’s largest state-owned bank, and Alfa-Bank, Russia’s largest private bank. Treasury is also targeting family members of President Vladimir Putin (Putin) and Foreign Minster Sergey Lavrov (Lavrov), as well as Russian Security Council members who are complicit in the war against Ukraine. In addition, the President is issuing a new Executive Order today, which bans new investment in the Russian Federation and the provision of certain services to any person located in the Russian Federation by U.S. persons, wherever located.

“Russia’s military forces have committed heinous atrocities in Ukraine and the global community must hold them to account,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today we are taking additional steps to cut off Russia from international markets in response to Putin’s continued brutality. This serious action, including fully blocking Russia’s largest bank and banning new investment in Russia, will further restrict Putin’s ability to fund and supply his war.”

Today’s designations are taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024, which authorizes sanctions against Russia for its harmful foreign activities, including violating core principles of international law, such as respect for the territorial integrity of other states. OFAC’s actions complement the ongoing efforts of international allies and partners to hold accountable all those responsible for furthering this unconscionable war of choice against Ukraine and its people.

SBERBANK AND 42 SBERBANK SUBSIDIARIES

Today, Treasury is fully blocking Public Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia (Sberbank), which is uniquely important to the Russian Federation economy, holding about a third of all bank assets in Russia.

2:38 P.M. EDT

MS. PSAKI: Hi, everyone.

Q Happy Friday.

MS. PSAKI: Happy Friday. Is there more to say on this historic day? (Laughter.)

Okay. So, I want to first start by outlining our security assistance to Ukraine, and there’s been a lot of good questions about this, and we thought this would be a helpful rundown for all of you. It’s — the Department of Defense also put out a factsheet that has this detailed as well.

The security assistance the Biden administration is providing to Ukraine is enabling critical success on the battlefield against the Russian-invading force. The number one reason that they’re able to fight back is their bravery and courage. The number two reason is the security assistance that we are providing and we are providing in coordination with our allies and partners.

We’re working around the clock to fulfill Ukraine’s priority security assistance requests, delivering weapons from U.S. stocks when they are available, and facilitating the delivery of weapons by allies and partners when their systems better suit Ukraine’s needs.

All of the anti-armor and anti-air systems from the two packages of security assistance the President approved in March have been delivered. We are continuing work with allies and partners to identify additional weapons systems to help the Ukrainian military defend its country. Obviously, there was the announcement about the S-300s earlier today, and our efforts to work to backfill that.

At President Zelenskyy’s request, this includes helping Ukraine acquire long-range anti-aircraft systems and munitions that they are trained to use. More than 30 nations have sent Ukraine security assistance, thanks in part to the leadership of President Biden and diplomacy that he has been implementing for months now.

On April 5th, we announced an additional $100 million in security assistance to Ukraine through a presidential drawdown authority. We also announced $300 million in security assistance on April 1st under authorities provided by the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. These announcements bring the U.S. commitment to more than $1.7 billion in security assistance since Russia’s February 24th invasion, and $2.4 billion since the beginning of the administration.

I will not read through all of this for you. You can all, of course, read it yourself. And we will provide all of the list to all of you should — if you did not receive the Department of Defense factsheet.

I also wanted to note that, today, according to a new independent study, the Biden administration’s historic vaccination program saved 2.3 million lives in the United States, prevented 17 million hospitalizations and 66 million cases, and avoided $900 billion in healthcare costs.

Over the past 15 months, the President has mounted a successful nationwide vaccination effort while executing a comprehensive strategy on treatments, testing, and more. As a result, schools are open, our economy is booming. And importantly, today’s report shows we’ve spared millions of families the immeasurable loss that too many others have suffered.

And because of the President’s comprehensive response, we’ve entered a new moment in our fight against the virus. While COVID isn’t over, Americans now have more tools than ever before to protect themselves and this country is moving forward safely, back to many of our more normal routines.

Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress are holding up critical funding we need to make even more progress to save even more lives and to stay prepared against any potential surges or variants. Inaction will leave our nation less prepared for future surges and variants. It will mean fewer vaccines, treatments, and tests for the American people. This is deeply disappointing, and it should be unacceptable to every American.

I also wanted to give you a sense of the week ahead. Just one trip next week that we announced earlier today — at this point. There could be more.

On Thursday, the President will travel to Greensboro, North Carolina, to discuss his administration’s efforts to make more in America, rebuild our supply chains here at home, and bring down costs for the American people as part of building a better America.

Following that trip, he will travel to Camp David, where he will remain over the Easter weekend.

And then, finally, as I’ve been doing a little bit this week, I just want to shout out some amazing colleagues I have: Lewis, who we have stolen from FEMA — not really stolen; he’s a detailee. Well, he’s a fellow, actually. We’ve had him since November. Soon, they will steal him back.

And Lewis has been remarkable. Lewis has been reading Russian media, which comes in use — in great use. He has been tracking down a range of coverage about the war in Ukraine. He has been relentless in giving us updates and providing us information. And we’re incredibly grateful to Lewis, and we’ll be sad to see you go back to FEMA to do very important work.

Many of you know Amanda Finney. I call her “the mayor” because she knows every person, seemingly, who works in the building and on the complex, which is about 2,000 people. I would not survive this job without Amanda Finney. You probably would all not have received all the help you have received about a range of things without Amanda Finney. She is smart, sassy, levelheaded, stable. She’s remarkable. And we may all work for her one day in some capacity. I certainly may. But I’m very grateful to her. So, I just wanted to shout that out. And her yellow suit is very joyful for a joyful day.

Okay, with that — it’s a Friday!

Q It’s Friday. Thanks so much. I’ve got a couple things.

MS. PSAKI: Sure.

Q First on this — the missile attack at this train station. Does the administration think that Russia might have intentionally targeted the train station, knowing that there will be a lot of civilians there?

MS. PSAKI: Well, what we’ve seen over the course of the last six weeks — or more than that — has been what the President himself has characterized as war crimes, which is the intentional targeting of civilians.

This is yet another horrific atrocity committed by Russia, striking civilians who were trying to evacuate and reach safety.

Where we are now is we’re going to support efforts to investigate this attack as we document Russia’s actions, hold them accountable. And we will continue to surge security assistance and weapons deliveries to help Ukraine defend their country.

Obviously, the targeting of civilians would certainly be a war crime. And we’ve already called a range of the actions we’ve seen to date a war crime, but we’re going to be supporting efforts to investigate exactly what happened here.

Q Okay. Changing topics. Senior administration officials have said publicly on TV, suggesting it’s possible the President could get COVID. I’m wondering: Is the administration attempting to prepare the public for the possibility of the President getting the — testing positive?

MS. PSAKI: Well, what we’re trying to do is be as transparent and direct with the American people as possible about the fact that while the President is — takes a range of protocols, we have a range of protocols in place here that are aligned and even beyond the CDC requirements. Those include, as we’ve outlined here many times in the past, testing before you see the President, testing before you travel with him, social distancing when possible.

We believe we have the tools and protocol to address this point we are in the virus. But like anyone else, the President may at some point test positive for COVID. And while we have seen an increase in recent — I would just note: While we have seen an increase in cases around people, I should just say, that some of us may know, I would also note that cases remain down 95 percent since the height of Omicron. That is fact, that is data, even as we’ve seen cases of people we know.

But what is important for the American people to know is that he has taken a range of precautions, as we all have. But he’s also taken steps — like getting the second booster, as he did last week in public. And his doctors are comfortable that he could continue to carry out his duties because of all these steps and precautions and protections he’s taken. And we — certainly, that’s one of the reasons we encourage the rest of the American public to do the same.

Go ahead.

Q Do you — this is the first time that we’ve heard a White House official sort of describe it as a certain possibility that the President could get COVID. Are you saying that you think it’s more possible now, given sort of the little outbreak that we’re seeing in D.C. right now?

MS. PSAKI: No. We’re just saying that it is a possibility. Again, we are — cases are down 95 percent across the country since the height of Omicron. While cases are up in Washington, D.C., they’re also far below the height of the cases and where they were in Omicron.

But it is also the case that despite all the precautions we take. And even with the President being double boosted, he could still test positive for COVID, just as people in the — many people in the White House have, many people in the press corps have. That is a possibility. And we want to be transparent with the American public about that.

Q By our rough count here, you have at least 18 politicians and people close to the President who have now tested positive this week, though. And you’ve reiterated all the extra precautions that you are taking to try and keep him safe — some of the extra masking and testing protocol. But just to be safe, have you considered maybe cutting down some of the big indoor events or scaling back any — or changing, sort of, your tactic with some of these events?

MS. PSAKI: Well, clearly, we did the event — the historic event today outside. That was, in part, to ensure that we could have a huge number of people on the South Lawn celebrating the confirmation of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. But also, we know that having events outside is better for safety protocols. There’s no question about that.

But what’s important for the American people to know and understand is that because of all the steps we’ve taken, because the President is double boosted, because of — you know, obviously he has access to the best healthcare in the world, but his doctors have assessed that these are risks that can be taken. We risk-assess just like everybody out in the country.

And it’s important for him to be able to continue his presidential duties now and even if he tests positive in the future, just like Americans out there in the country are taking their kids to school, they go to the grocery store, maybe they’re making a decision to go to dinner. This is a time where we are certainly living with the virus, but we have a range of tools at our disposal to do that.

Go ahead.

Q Thanks, Jen. A couple of quick questions on oil, and then one on the French election. We have some reporting showing that the administration is considering easing sanctions to allow some oil imports from Venezuela as a way to replace banned energy shipments from Russia. Can you talk a little bit about any such considerations?

MS. PSAKI: I’m not aware of that being under consideration.

Q Okay. Okay. At the moment, is it — is it going to perhaps be considered for — going forward? Or —

MS. PSAKI: It has not been, so I’m not aware of it being under consideration.

Q Okay. And one other one on when Daleep was in India. He delivered this warning to India to not raise purchases of Russian oil. And we were wondering if perhaps sanctions along similar lines are being considered for other nations, asking them to keep purchases of Russian oil only limited to previous levels and, perhaps, not raise (inaudible).

MS. PSAKI: First, I wouldn’t characterize it as a warning, nor did we at the time. He went and had a constructive conversation and made clear that while it’s the decision of each individual country, including India, to determine whether they’re going to import Russian oil, it is only 1 to 2 percent of their imports. About 10 percent of their imports is from the United States.

And so he conveyed, of course, they should abide by sanctions, which are not related to that decision, but also, we would be here to help them diversify and move towards even reducing further beyond the 1 to 2 percent.

Q Is that decision, perhaps, being relayed also to other countries, asking them to perhaps follow the same guidelines?

MS. PSAKI: Well, we convey to every country to abide by sanctions. And we’ve conveyed to a range of European countries, as you know and as we’ve talked about, that as they work to diversify their energy sources, that we are here to assist in those efforts.

And there are a range of steps we’ve taken, including efforts on LNG — I mean, that’s natural gas, of course — but efforts on LNG and moving some resources from Asia and other places, and ensuring that there are options to — for any country that wants to, to diversify their energy sources.

Q Okay. And one on the French elections. Are you watching the French elections coming up this Sunday, perhaps, with any concerns — especially with the rise of Le Pen, who is a far-right candidate, running against Macron?

MS. PSAKI: We are certainly watching the elections, but I don’t have any prediction of what the outcome will be. And once there is an outcome, I’m sure we will speak to it.

Go ahead.

Q Understanding it’s a fluid situation, but I think the atrocities in Bucha serve as an accelerant towards the latest sanctions package, the coordination between the G7 —

MS. PSAKI: That we announced two days ago?

Q Yes.

MS. PSAKI: Yes.

Q Is there any sense that the strike that we saw this morning will also accelerate talks on additional sanctions between the coordinated allies?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say just go — to go back to a couple of days ago, that obviously the sanctions package we announced on Wednesday, with some — the biggest bank in Russia, Sberbank, certainly that was augmented as a result of the atrocities that we were seeing in Bucha.

And what we have done to date and we will continue to do is look at, unfortunately, the continued atrocities that we’re seeing in the country and assess how that’s going to impact sanctions, consequences, and, obviously, additional security assistance.

So that’s how we’ve been evaluating and working with our allies to date. And I’m certain, given the video footage we’ve seen on airwaves across the world and photos, that this will be a part of the discussion that our national security officials are having with their counterparts moving forward.

Q Okay. On the S-300 —

MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.

Q — it’s been fairly apparent for the last several weeks that that was a process that you guys were engaged in.

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q I know you are deliberately ambiguous as to some of the other processes that may be taking place, but is it fair to say that there are multiple other tracks that are similarly far down the line for other weapons systems? Or how can you characterize how far along you are, compared to where you are now with the S-300, on other systems?

MS. PSAKI: So — well, one, I mean, part of our objective here — and the S-300s are an example of that — is to see that we can get defensive equipment that Ukrainians are trained on and that we know can be effective moved to Ukraine.

So we are, of course, grateful to Slovakia and we work closely with Slovakia to also meet their defense needs. And part of our considerations here as we’re looking at the list of requests that the Ukrainians have is: What do we have access to here in the United States? What military equipment do we have access to?

There are systems we may not have access — access to or we may not even have those systems. So how can we work with countries around the world, like Slovakia, to meet those needs?

So there are a range of those conversations happening with our partners and allies at the same time. I will tell you that often it is the preference of these partners and allies not to be public about these conversations. And at times, it is the preference of the Ukrainians. And we certainly respect that.

Q And just one final one. It’s been a pretty historic 24 hours —

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q — for the history of the Supreme Court, for the country. We’ve seen the President speak publicly. Can you talk about — do you have any color in terms of what he’s been like behind the scenes, delivering on a campaign pledge —

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q — putting the first African American woman on the Court — how he’s been with staff, with the justice, all that?

MS. PSAKI: Sure. I’m going to try not to ugly cry about this day, because — which we were all — we were all doing on the South Lawn.

Look, I was with the President before he went out. I was there on time; I didn’t run out, as you would have seen. I was with him before, when he was reviewing his — doing his final review of his remarks.

And what he was reflecting on is — and you saw some of this in his speech — were the number of people, whether it is people who work at the White House; people who are part of his every day; you know, stewards or others who have commented to him how significant this moment is and how — you know, in a place where you are just trying to — trying to make it through every day — and every day is history, in many ways.

History can be heartbreaking. And many days, it has been. History can be exhausting. And many days, it has been. And history can be joyful. And today was a joyful day in history.

And that is certainly how the President was. You saw his granddaughter, Naomi, who he talked about in the speech, come out. She was there also for a brief greet with — with Justice Jackson beforehand. And he made a — made an effort to also introduce the new associate justice to some members of his close staff who just were inspired by the significance of today as well.

So I would say there was a deep recognition of this moment of history, a joy in reaching it. And I think we’ve all been saying to each other in the hallways, “No one can speal [sic] our — steal our sunshine today,” because that’s how everybody is feeling.

Q Thanks, Jen.

MS. PSAKI: Go ahead.

Q Thank you, Jen. To follow up on that, did the President spend any time with the Jackson family before the formal event or afterward (inaudible)?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I think, as we confirmed, she signed her commission — or he signed her commission, and her family was with her for that. So, it was briefly before he came out to do the remarks.

Q Okay, got it.

And to follow up on a question from Katie earlier this week about other precautions that the President may or may not be taking, do you know or he is taking any monoclonal antibodies to help prevent catching COVID?

MS. PSAKI: Well, Evusheld is for immunocompromised. That would be the preemptive step. And he’s not immunocompromised, so he’s not taking Evusheld.

Q Is taking any other medication that might help?

MS. PSAKI: Like what?

Q Well, I don’t actually know. (Laughs.) That’s a great question. Other than the booster — you know, we’ve heard other people taking other kinds of prophylactics to prevent it. Is he taking anything, that you know of?

MS. PSAKI: There are not other — this is why I asked. There are not other — Evusheld is obviously one that, if you’re immunocompromised, is something that has been approved and recommended. Since he is not categorized that way, he isn’t taking it.

But other than that, the precautions we’re taking are — he obviously got the booster when he was eligible last week, and, you know, we take additional steps, including testing, socially distanced meetings when possible as well, in order to protect him as much as possible.

Q Thank you. And then just one more on something that Samantha Power shared.

MS. PSAKI: Sure.

Q She said that Russian forces have killed at least seven journalists in Ukraine in six weeks and that Putin soldiers are killing journalists at an unprecedented rate. Is there any intelligence, any information that Putin is targeting journalists? And do you have any warning that you’re sharing with American journalists covering the war?

MS. PSAKI: Well, one, we — we value the role that American journalists and journalists from around the world — (cell phone disruption) — that felt like a direction to somewhere — have played in — in bringing light — bringing to light for a lot of people in this country this war: what’s happening, the devastation, the horrors. It has been a — had a direct impact on people’s emotional response in the United States. There’s no question about that.

We recognize the work of journalists in war zones, of course, and value it. And as you all know, we also work very closely with leaders of news organizations to ensure that they have up-to-date information to keep members of their media organization safe.

It is still a war zone — an active war zone, and we’re still conveying that Americans should not be there — right? — including journalists.

In terms of specific targeting, we knew from the beginning — and we’ve talked publicly about this, of course — that President Putin and the Russian military was going to target — was intending to target or could target civilians and others, including journalists could be part of that. But I don’t have anything — any new intelligence or anything beyond that.

Q Thank you.

MS. PSAKI: Go ahead.

Q Thanks, Jen. Is there a carve-out in CDC regulations for COVID for the Vice President?

MS. PSAKI: Tell me more, Peter. I’m sure this is going somewhere. Let’s see.

Q Well, you know, the —

MS. PSAKI: What do you got for me on a Friday?

Q The CDC says, for people exposed to COVID, up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations: Do not go to places where you are unable to wear a well-fitting mask. So why is she here at the White House today giving the new Supreme Court justice a big hug with no mask?

MS. PSAKI: You mean when she gave her a ma- — a hug outside?

Q Yes.

MS. PSAKI: She was outside.

Q Does the CDC say that people who are close contact can give people hugs outside?

MS. PSAKI: We know, Peter, that outside it is — it is — you are — you can benefit significantly being outside. That’s why we have — we had the event outside today.

I will tell you that the Vice President has been wearing a mask inside. When there was a private greet, they were all wearing masks, before they went out —

Q We saw she was wearing a mask yesterday at the Senate.

MS. PSAKI: She was playing an important role in confirming or overseeing the confirmation of the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. The vast majority, as was on camera, Peter —

Q Is there a public health carve-out for that?

MS. PSAKI: As was on camera. Let me finish my answer here. Because Fox and other — I don’t know actually that Fox carried it, but others did — saw that she was socially distanced from people for the vast, vast majority of her time overseeing that confirmation yesterday.

Q So this is not a case of rules for thee but not for VP?

MS. PSAKI: In fact, the Vice President wore a mask inside today when she was both with the President, with her staff, other people. She was outside at the event. She was socially distanced for 99.9 percent of the event today. And she had an emotional moment, which is understandable.

Q Okay. And one other topic. Following up on the smartphones that are being given to border crossers with technology so they can be tracked or so they can check in: Is there any plan to give free smartphones to U.S. citizens that want them?

MS. PSAKI: Should we not be tracking migrants who irregularly cross the border?

Q I’m asking if the same —

MS. PSAKI: Or do you have an alternative suggestion for how they should be tracked?

Q I, unfortunately, have not been asked to make U.S. immigration policy. That’s not my —

MS. PSAKI: Today’s your moment. (Laughter.)

Q Well, it’d be great if anybody that wanted a free phone and a free monthly plan could get one. So, is that going to be an offer for everybody or just people that walk into the country illegally?

MS. PSAKI: Well, Peter, as — when we talked about this the other day, what I noted to you is that we have a range of means of tracking individuals who irregularly migrate to the country, as — in order to ensure that they are meeting their Notice to Appear obligations and that they are appearing in court when they should appear in court. Phones is one of them. There are also ankle devices and a range of tracking devices.

Eighty percent of individuals have — of non-citizens released at the border from DHS custody under prosecutorial discretion have either received a Notice to Appear or are still within the window to report.

So, yes, there is telephonic reporting. There is SmartLink, which enables participant monitoring via smartphone. There’s the Global Positioning System. These are the range of means with modern technology that we monitor.

Q Last one on this: Does the President have any plans to figure out what these small towns who are bracing for a major influx in migrants next month need by making his first-ever trip to the border?

MS. PSAKI: I have nothing to predict for you in terms of additional trips. The President will be traveling the country, but I don’t have any more specifics for you at this point. Thanks for the question.

Q Just for clarity: Earlier — earlier, you guys told us, via pool, that the President was tested — tested negative. That was today, for clarity?

MS. PSAKI: Yup. Mm-hmm.

Q Okay. So, the cadence has clearly changed. Right? We know there was one on Wednesday; he was negative. Today is Friday; he tested negative. Just for keeping track of his — is it now three times a week, two times a week? Is there a way to describe it?

MS. PSAKI: His doctor makes an assessment on how many times he should be tested, and we do our best to provide that information to you as he’s tested.

Q And aside from the time he spent with Ketanji Brown Jackson and her family, there was no — because there’s precedent to this — there was no indoor reception, indoor ceremony that existed of some kind that the cameras didn’t see before?

MS. PSAKI: No.

Q Okay. Let me — if I can, during his remarks today, the President said something that was a bit striking. He was condemning some of the conservative Republicans and their criticisms of Judge Jackson when she was testifying recently. He said: “There was verbal abuse. The anger. The constant interruptions. The most vile, baseless, [vile] assertions and accusations.” Whoo. Is that a preview of messaging that we’re going to hear from the President heading into the midterms? Was that — was that — is that a message that the White House wants to deliver and will be repeating?

MS. PSAKI: I don’t believe that the conduct of senators at a hearing is going to be central to the President’s remarks when he’s out in — out traveling the country.

But I think what he was speaking to, on a historic day, is that while Judge Jackson was the picture — now Justice Jackson — was the picture of dignity in her hearings, some others in the room decided to be the opposite.

And he is somebody who has more experience overseeing Supreme Court hearings than anyone living. He has overseen them during Republican and Democratic Presidents and expects a certain level of conduct, professionalism, and decorum. And that is not what we saw.

Q So that was more of a one-off for today, as opposed to, like, a central theme that we’ll see in terms of contrast?

MS. PSAKI: I would say that I think the American people can expect that he’ll continue to talk when he’s out in the country — for whatever reason — about how to bring down their costs, how to make sure that he is fighting for them, and bringing them relief, and how’s going to get the COVID pandemic under control — less about the conduct of senators at a hearing.

Q Let me ask a very quick question, then, on costs, if I can. Right now, the cost of gas in this country, on average, is $4.14. Does the White House want a gas tax holiday?

MS. PSAKI: Is it certainly on the table and certainly something we continue to consider. We have seen a number of states do that. And while, you know, it can have an impact — about 18 cents, I believe, if I remember correctly — one of the reasons why we’re considering it — our primary focus, to date, as you all know, has been taking steps to increase supply and get it — get more supply into the global marketplace. But it remains an option under consideration.

Go ahead.

Q The U.N. today put out a report saying that global food prices in March reached a record high.

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q What is the U.S. doing, if anything, to mitigate possible additional increases here?

MS. PSAKI: Here in the United States?

Q Correct.

MS. PSAKI: Well, it is something that we are certainly watching very closely. While we continue to believe that the impact will largely be in the Middle East and in Africa, I believe, and a lot of, you know, other parts of the world — less in the United States — we are continuing to work — our Department of Agriculture is continuing to work with farmers and suppliers about any needs we have here. And the President is continuing to work to bring down costs in a range of areas for the American people, as we prepare for the impacts of this war.

Q It was pretty widely reported yesterday, prior to her COVID diagnosis, that Speaker Pelosi was planning a trip to Taiwan. Beijing reacted very negatively to that. Is the U.S. — is the Biden administration comfortable if she were to do that — such a high-ranking U.S. official?

MS. PSAKI: I don’t — I think we’ve understood her trip. I don’t have any further comment on it.

Go ahead.

Q Thanks, Jen. Two questions for you. The first: Today, my colleagues in the UK reported that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak had a U.S. green card, which he surrendered this past October. He’s been an MP since 2015. And USCIS manual says that serving in a foreign government while standing for election in a foreign government is not compatible with lawful permanent resident status. Why was this not flagged earlier?

MS. PSAKI: I would point you to the State Department or the Department of Homeland Security. I don’t have any more comment from here.

Q Is it — I mean, is it a problem? Does the President see it as a problem that — possible for someone to serve at high level in a foreign government and maintain lawful permanent resident status in the U.S? I mean, what if this were someone who was serving in the Russian Duma?

MS. PSAKI: It wasn’t. But I would also, again, point you to the portions of the government that oversee green cards and oversee, you know —

Q They haven’t responded.

MS. PSAKI: — the status of documents. I’m happy to bump it for them as well and see if there’s more we can provide.

Q That’s fine. The second question: There’s a death row inmate in Texas, Melissa Lucio. She’s set to be executed soon. Many experts believe her confession was coerced and is false. She has bipartisan support for clemency and support from the EU and many other foreign allies. Would the President consider asking Governor Abbott to intervene?

MS. PSAKI: Well, you know the President’s position and view on the death penalty. And there’s an ongoing review at the Department of Justice at a federal level. This is obviously at a state level.

Q Right.

MS. PSAKI: I don’t have anything to predict for you on that.

Q And then a follow-up: Given his commitment to police reform, would he consider asking the DOJ to prohibit police departments that receive federal funds from using the Reid technique for interrogations? It’s considered to create a lot of false confessions.

MS. PSAKI: Well, again, I know the Department of Justice has taken a number of steps, including on chokeholds and other actions that needed to be reformed in police departments across the country. I don’t have anything to preview or predict in terms of additional steps.

The President supports their efforts to do more. Many of them have talked about their desire to do more. And obviously, we are continuing to consider an executive order on police reform here, given there has been an inability of Congress to move forward.

Go ahead.

Q Thanks, Jen. There’s some pretty desperate images coming out of Shanghai right now, which is under lockdown for COVID — people begging for food and medicine. Is the White House monitoring that? Is there anything the U.S. can do to help the humanitarian situation there?

And also, on the supply chain front, is the administration aware of any further supply chain snags coming as a result of this? And how are you prepared to address them?

MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, first, the — on the first part of your question, the State Department is closely monitoring the situation. They’re providing consistent updates of the situation on the ground. And we’ll certainly assess, with USAID and others, if there’s additional assistance that could be provided.

On the supply chain component: What we know is that the port is continuing to operate normally. And where we’re seeing the impacts — which still could have an impact over the course of time, of course — is factories, warehouses, and trucking, where we are seeing shutdowns within the region, which we know could cause delays, especially for air cargo, as well.

Because this is just happening, we don’t have a prediction at this point on how that could impact bigger global supply chain issues. It depends on a lot of factors — how long, et cetera — but it is something we are closely monitoring, and it is something we will continue to work to — to address if it extends farther.

Q And then just one more — housekeeping item. Do you have a timing update on when the President might sign the trade preference bill on Russia that passed?

MS. PSAKI: I don’t. And I know you and others have been looking for this. And let me see if I can get an answer before we all wrap up today.

Q Thank you.

MS. PSAKI: Go ahead.

Q Jen, could you speak to the efficacy of sanctions? I know there was a new sanctions package rolled out this week.

And initially, we heard a lot from administration officials about this being a deterrent. I know that has changed. And so, can you speak to sort of the end goal and what is the efficacy of sanctions?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say that it has — we have a couple of objectives at this point as it relates to the war in Ukraine. One is to impose severe consequences, send a marker for the world and for history about the horrific nature of these atrocities — these consequences.

And the second part of our objective is to ensure that these consequences are having a significant impact on the economy in Russia. We’re seeing an inflationary rate of about 15 percent — a projection of a contraction of 15 percent in the Russian economy. Six hundred private-sector companies have left Russia. We know it is having the impact that the world intended. This is the most significant coordinated set of sanctions ever done in history on this large of an economy.

The third objective here is to make it much more difficult for President Putin to fund his war. And if you look back — say, earlier this week, at the example of the bond payments and how Russia has basically been put in a decision of — in a place where they either have to use their limited resources they have that are also being used to fund the war to prevent a default or default — that is the position they’re in at this point in time.

But also, because we have cut them off, through export controls and a number of other means, from having access to materials and technology but also access to funds, it makes it more difficult for them to fund the war. That is part of it.

And the last objective is to continue to make it clear that this is a strategic blunder — their decision to invade Ukraine — and one that will make President Putin a pariah in the world.

So those are why and what we are hoping to achieve.

Q Can I ask one follow-up?

MS. PSAKI: Yeah.

Q Is there anything being done in terms of either monitoring or actually just — I guess, monitoring to take a look at the effects of sanctions on ordinary Russians or anything the administration is thinking to just deal with that population of people who are being affected?

MS. PSAKI: The Russian people, you mean?

Q Yes, correct.

MS. PSAKI: Cert- — I mean, certainly, we are looking at how this is impacting the Russian economy writ large. And it is — certainly, as inflation is going up and as the economy is contracting, that means prices will go up. And we do know there will be a broad impact. That is the fault of President Putin, and the fault of President Putin invading a sovereign country.

So, it is important also for the Russian people to know and understand that. And we have been working through a range of means to communicate about the realities of the war and the facts of the war through Telegram, through YouTube, through a range of channels as well.

Go ahead.

Q Thanks, Jen. General Milley, earlier this week, talked about the possibility of building permanent U.S. bases on NATO’s eastern flank. I wonder what seriousness the White House has given that — or, as you look long term at the war in Ukraine, whether shoring up the eastern flank with permanent bases is something that’s been considered.

MS. PSAKI: They’ll continue to be a range of discussions, but I have nothing beyond what General Milley said.

Q Can I ask you one more question? I want to dig a little deeper on the French elections.

MS. PSAKI: Sure.

Q Does the White House worry that the election of Le Pen could, you know, destabilize the NATO Alliance or make it difficult, being that she’s, you know, come up with pro-Russian statements?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I’m just not going to get ahead of an election in a foreign country. And obviously, we will watch it closely, and I’m sure we’ll have more to speak to once the results are concluded.

Go ahead.

Q Thanks, Jen. What can you tell us about the multiple Secret Service agents who have been suspended or removed from the President, Vice President, and First Lady’s detail pending this investigation of two men impersonating officers of law enforcement?

MS. PSAKI: Not much from here. I can point you to the Secret Service. And obviously, the FBI is overseeing the investigation.

Q Is there a broader concern in the administration that these principals — is there concern that they’re not being protected effectively? Is — can you speak at all to that? Or —

MS. PSAKI: As I said, yesterday, we — the President remains confident in the leader of the Secret Service. And beyond that, I would point you to the Secret Service and to the FBI.

Q And then, I guess, just on the invitations you issued to Republicans who voted to confirm Justice Jackson. I know one of them has COVID, but did you hear from the other two — Senator Murkowski and Romney? I know the President went a little further to talk about Senator Romney’s father today in his speech. Did the White House hear from the Republicans who were invited today? Why didn’t they come?

MS. PSAKI: I would point you to their offices to speak to that. I mean, it doesn’t change the President’s gratitude to them for, you know, bucking the trend in their party of not supporting an

eminently qualified nominee. And they — they did that, and it was something he wanted to call out today and express his gratitude.



Thank you.



Q Yeah, thank you, Jen. I’m wondering what the White House’s reaction is to yesterday’s U.N. vote to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council — the fact that there were 58 nations that abstained from taking a vote and then on top of the other 24 nations that voted against it.

Although there was, you know, more — obviously, the majority of countries did vote to suspend Russia, do you think that this — you know, that many abstains — abstentions, that many people sitting on the sidelines of this shows that the entire world really isn’t unified around condemning these actions by Russia?



MS. PSAKI: Well, a win required two thirds present and voting, and that is exactly what happened, and far beyond that. And we know that there were abstentions. And only 24 countries, including North Korea, voted with Russia.



But the outcome, which is what is most important to us, is what we wanted, which is Russia has been suspended from the U.N. Human Rights Council.



Suspension — just so everybody knows; somebody asked me this question the other day — but it is the only method provided for in the U.N. resolution that established the Human Rights Council back in 2005 — is the most serious action available.



It’s only been applied once in history. This is only the second time in history that a country has been kicked out of the U.N. Human Rights Council. The last example was Libya. So that obviously speaks to the significance. And it also speaks to the fact that two thirds — more than two thirds of countries who are members are — believe that they should not have a leadership role on global human rights as they work to subvert and violate global human rights.



This also means that, once suspended, Russia will not be able to vote against future actions during subsequent Human Rights Council sessions.



And so, to us, it is significant — only the secs [sic] time — second time in second time in history. And it speaks to the global outrage in response to these atrocities.



Q But are there any concerns that nearly 60 nations decided not to weigh in on this matter?



MS. PSAKI: Again, our focus is on the fact that it was a win. For only the second time in history was a country kicked out of — suspended from the U.N. Human Rights Council.



Q And then one other question: Does President Biden still intend to attend the White House Correspondents Association dinner here later this month, in a couple of weeks?



MS. PSAKI: We haven’t announced his plans to attend or anything about his schedule, so I don’t have any update on that today.



Q All right.



MS. PSAKI: Go ahead, Karen.



Q Thanks, Jen. Just some follow-ups to things that came up.



MS. PSAKI: Sure.



Q To follow up on Peter’s question about the testing cadence — you guys have told us about negative tests on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Should we expect that the President would get tested on Sunday, two days later?



MS. PSAKI: I would say I don’t have a prediction of that. His doctor makes an assessment of when he should be tested and how often and what the cadence should be. It’s not always exactly the same. And — but we will provide information to you when he tests negative —



Q Okay.



MS. PSAKI: — or either way, of course. Yes.



Q And to follow up on Katie’s question: Did the President talk to any of the senators — Romney, Murkowski, and Collins — after their vote yesterday on Ketanji Brown Jackson?



MS. PSAKI: I don’t have any update on that from here.



Q Okay. And when he said he hoped he didn’t get them in trouble today when he referenced them, what did he mean by that?



MS. PSAKI: He meant he recognizes that the vast majority of the other members of their party voted a different way.

Go ahead.



Q Thank you. On India: Next week, Secretary of State Blinken and Defense Secretary are hosting their Indian counterparts — External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh — for the first India-U.S. 2+2 dialogue under this administration. What is President’s message to the meeting? What is his expectations? Is he sending any concrete ideas to this meeting as well?



Q President Biden believes our partnership with India is one of the most important relationships we have in the world. As you know, he met with Presi- — Prime Minister Modi and other Quad leaders in March. He expects that at this 2+2, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin will continue driving forward our work with India and our shared goals in the Indo-Pacific region and around the world.



We also believe both sides will continue our close consultations on the consequences of President Putin’s brutal war against Ukraine and mitigating the impact by addressing energy and food prices. Obviously, it could cover a range of topics, but we expect that to be a central one.



Q And secondly, given the U.S.’s frustrating experience having the U.N. Security Council (inaudible) coming out and doing all they should do with Ukraine, what is President’s thoughts on the reforms to the U.N. Security Council itself?

MS. PSAKI: Well, I know a question has been asked about whether Russia could be kicked out of being a permanent member; we don’t anticipate that happening. But obviously, the step taken yesterday to suspend Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council is an indication of the global response and horror at the atrocities we’ve seen happen on the ground in Ukraine. But beyond that, I don’t have any other predictions of reforms.



Q Should there be individual veto or group veto inside the Security Council?



MS. PSAKI: Again, I understand your questions, but I don’t have any predictions or calls for that at this point.



Go ahead, Francesca.

Q Thanks, Jen.



MS. PSAKI: Okay, we’ll just do a few more.



Go ahead.



Q Thanks, Jen. Since his State of the Union Address, the President has only made a handful of domestic trips. We’ve talked in here before about how he’d like to get back into the community and have a chance to interact with the American people. Is the current COVID wave getting in the way of his travel plans?



MS. PSAKI: No. I expect he’s going to travel a bunch in the next few weeks.



Q Okay. And you had mentioned that you will be going to North Carolina and you didn’t have too much more to add on that. But might the President, while he’s in Greensboro, be visiting one of the area’s two Historically Black Colleges and Universities?



MS. PSAKI: I don’t have more details at this point in time. As they get finalized, I’m sure we’ll share them with all of you.



Go ahead.



Q Thanks, Jen. I have a two-part question on student loans.



MS. PSAKI: Yep.



Q Last year, President Biden directed the Department of Education to create a report on whether he has presidential authority to unilaterally do a broad cancellation of debt. I don’t believe that’s ever been made public. And as you’re looking at loan extensions — or loan pause extensions, will we — can we anticipate seeing a release of that report?



And secondly, as — you’ve talked about how the President wants to lower costs for Americans. Borrowers have expressed stress, anxiety about these short-term extensions. What’s your message to them?



MS. PSAKI: I think our message to them is that not a single person has paid a dime on their student loans since the President took office. And he’s continued to evaluate and assess with the Department of Education and other policymakers in the administration what the needs are to lower costs for people, including people who have student loans and are — do feel stressed, even as the economy is continuing to recover but as we see costs too high in some areas.



On the first question, I don’t have any update on that. I would tell you that if Congress were to send him a bill to cancel $10,000 in student loans — in student debt, he’d be happy to sign it.



Go ahead.



Last one. Last one. Last one.



Go ahead.



Q Thank you. Well, Rachel Wallace, who was the general counsel of the science office who the White House found had been bullied by Dr. Lander, has been told that she will not be getting her job back as general counsel. Why?



MS. PSAKI: I am not aware of this personnel update. I’d have to check on it. I’m happy to do that. And we will get you back a comment.



Q Okay. Then a follow-up: Yesterday, you said — when asked about Vice President Harris and the mask at the Senate — you said that she would follow CDC protocols at the event today. CDC protocols clearly say you should be wearing a mask. It doesn’t distinguish between outside and inside. So why didn’t she wear a mask?



MS. PSAKI: And she was socially distanced for the vast majority of the event today.



Q She was sitting — standing next to the President.



MS. PSAKI: About six feet away.



Thanks, everyone. Thank you, everyone.

3:19 P.M. EDT",https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/04/08/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-april-8-2022/
5,d0e010e5-c9ce-445c-917c-7a848a94787b,['Rfe Rl'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

6,d0e010e5-c9ce-445c-917c-7a848a94787b,"['Kevin Liptak', 'Betsy Klein', 'Kaitlan Collins']",2022-04-06,"(CNN) President Joe Biden declared ""major war crimes"" were being discovered in Ukraine as Russian forces retreat from areas around Kyiv , citing scenes of brutal, cold-blooded executions as rationale for ratcheting up US sanctions on Moscow.

""Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable,"" Biden told a union crowd in Washington as the White House announced new sanctions on Russia's largest financial institutions and number of individuals tied to the Kremlin, including Russian President Vladimir Putin's two adult daughters.

""We will keep raising the economic cost and ratchet up the pain for Putin and further increase Russia's economic isolation,"" Biden said, decrying the intentional targeting of civilians by Russia and heralding a united Western response, even as he acknowledged the battle was still ongoing.

Horrific images from the Ukrainian city of Bucha imparted ""a sense of brutality and inhumanity left for all the world to see, unapologetically,"" Biden said in his remarks as he announced new steps the US was taking to punish those responsible.

The sanctions are designed to tighten the vise on Russia's economy, which has been kneecapped by Western punishment. Still, ever-harsher consequences for the invasion of Ukraine have not appeared to force Putin to ease a brutal campaign that has increasingly targeted civilians.

Biden has previously said he believes Putin to be a war criminal, and this week called for a trial to hold Moscow accountable. Still, the process for prosecuting war crimes is complex and lengthy, and questions remain about how and when such accountability could be delivered.

US Attorney General Merrick Garland said Wednesday the Justice Department is assisting with the collection of evidence for potential war crimes prosecutions related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He said he'd spoken with French and other European officials about the collection of evidence currently underway.

And Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday the US was ""working to document"" war crimes with the goal of providing the information to relevant agencies.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan also said this week the US would seek information from intelligence services, eyewitness Ukrainians, international organizations and interviews in the global media to build a case.

Biden praised Ukraine on Wednesday for sustaining a fight against Russia that prevented it from taking the country's capital.

""Thanks to the bravery, the grit and the fighting spirit of the Ukrainian people Russia has already failed in its initial war aims. Russia wanted to take Ukraine's capital city Kyiv and topple its democracy and elected government. Today, Kyiv still stands and that government presides,"" Biden said.

But he cautioned the violence may not end soon.

""The fight is far from over,"" he said. ""This war could continue for a long time.""

The ""full blocking"" sanctions on Russia's largest financial institution, Sberbank, and its largest private bank, Alfa Bank, are meant to grind Russia's economy further to a halt. They will prohibit transactions with any American financial institutions and freeze assets held by the banks in the US.

""They will not be able to touch any of their money. They will not be able to do any business here,"" Biden said.

Sberbank holds nearly one-third of Russia's total banking sector assets, and the White House says that with Wednesday's sanctions, more than two-thirds of the Russian banking sector are now blocked.

""The sad reality is Putin's war will make it harder for Russians to travel abroad. It means their debit cards may not work. They may only have the option to buy knockoff phones and knockoff clothes, the shelves at stores may be empty,"" a senior administration official told reporters.

""The reality is the country's descending into economic and financial and technological isolation and at this rate, it will go back to Soviet-style standards from the 1980s,"" the official went on.

In targeting Putin's two adult daughters, the US hopes to freeze any assets the Russian President may be hiding with them, according to the senior administration official. Without detailing which of Putin's assets could be hiding with Mariya Putina and Katerina Tikhonova, the official said the practice was common among the Russian elite.

Members of Russia's Security Council, including former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, are also being targeted by individual sanctions. The US has already sanctioned more than 140 oligarchs and their family members and over 400 Russian government officials, the senior official said.

""Look, these oligarchs and their family members are not allowed to hold on to their wealth in Europe and the United States and keep these yachts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, their luxury vacation homes while children in Ukraine are being killed, displaced from their homes every single day,"" Biden said in his speech.

The new sanctions will cut those individuals off from the US banking system and freeze any assets held in the United States.

The White House also announced a ban on new investment in Russia that will be executed in alignment with the G7 and EU. The ban will be implemented with an executive order signed by President Joe Biden.

And the US will also apply full blocking sanctions on critical major Russian state-owned enterprises, which will be announced by the Department of Treasury on Thursday. The official also noted Tuesday's announcement that the Department of Treasury has blocked Russia from making debt payments with dollars stockpiled at US banks.

While the US and its allies have imposed the most sweeping sanctions regime targeting a country of the size of Russia in history, officials acknowledge it has done little to shift Putin's calculation. The threat of the sanctions didn't deter the invasion itself, and the piling on of economic penalties hasn't brought Russia any closer to a withdrawal or negotiated settlement since.

Pressed about the efficacy of sanctions in ending Putin's war in Ukraine, the senior official sought to underscore the effect they are having on life in Russia and said Putin would eventually have to reckon with his people.

""Even an autocrat like Putin has a social contract with the Russian people. He took away their freedom in exchange for promising stability, and so he's not giving them stability,"" the official said.

""The question really is not so much: What can we do and when will that have an effect? I think it's: What's the endgame here for Putin? What's he playing for?"" the official said. ""This is very clearly becoming a failure for him and at some point he will have to recognize that reality.""

WHO, along with the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, Ukrainian authorities and other partners, has procured 209,000 packs of generic antiretroviral drug TLD.

Ukraine has an estimated 260,000 people living with HIV, the second-largest number in Europe after Russia, and prior to Moscow's invasion around half of them were on antiretroviral treatment.

Last month, the UN agency for HIV/AIDS warned that Ukraine was left with less than a month's supply of drugs for HIV patients.

""This war has the potential to undermine the hard-earned progress of recent years on a number of health issues, including HIV. We could not let that happen when Ukraine had begun to turn a corner on HIV,"" WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Henri P. Kluge said.

While there is no cure for HIV, antiretroviral medicines can control the virus and prevent onward sexual transmission to other people. Any disruption in treatment can lead to complications including drug resistance.

For the latest developments of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, all times EDT:

9:18 p.m.: “This is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more. But they will not succeed, because they killed a lot.”

-- Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, quoted in The New York Times, saying that Russian soldiers are hiding the bodies of those they've killed.

7:45 p.m.: U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the House Financial Services Committed on Wednesday that Russia should be expelled from the Group of 20 major economies forum, Reuters reported.

Yellen told lawmakers that Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the killings of civilians in Bucha ""are reprehensible, represent an unacceptable affront to the rules-based global order, and will have enormous economic repercussions in Ukraine and beyond.""

7:16 p.m.: U.S. Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland said Russia’s disinformation about its war against Ukraine needs to be exposed.

She said the Russian lies include blaming Ukrainians for things Russians have done, even “the war crimes we see on the ground.”

Nuland was in Cyprus on a five-nation tour to strengthen ties and rally support for Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.

6:43 p.m.: A few Ukrainian troops have learning how to operate Switchblade drones, single-use weapons that fly into their targets and detonate on impact, a senior U.S. defense official disclosed on Wednesday, Reuters reports.

The Ukrainians arrived in the United States for regular military education programs before Russia's invasion on February 24.

""We took advantage of the opportunity to pull them aside for a couple of days and provide them some training, particularly on the Switchblades,"" the senior U.S. defense official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Until now, the United States and NATO have had to limit the weaponry they send to Ukraine to the systems Ukrainian forces knew how to operate before Russia's invasion.

6:12 p.m.: Rich countries will tap 120 million more barrels of oil from emergency reserves in a bid to calm crude prices that have soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday.

The move includes 60 million barrels to be released by the United States, which has recently announced it would tap its strategic oil reserves, Agence France-Presse reports.

5:50 p.m.: The parents of a former U.S. Marine held captive in Russia pleaded for information about him on Wednesday, expressing fears about his “rapidly declining health” and that “something terrible” had happened to him.

Joe and Paula Reed, who met last week with President Joe Biden about the plight of their son, Trevor, 30, said in a statement that it has been five days since he was last heard from, in a Friday phone call with his girlfriend.

Trevor Reed is serving a nine-year term after being convicted of endangering the lives of two police officers while drunk on a visit to Moscow in 2019. Reed denied the charges. The United States called his trial a ""theater of the absurd.”

5:12 p.m.: Since the start of Russia’s invasion, millions of Ukrainians have fled their homes, leaving behind animals in shelters and zoos. Now it is up to dozens of volunteers and international groups to care for them. VOA’s Mariia Prus has the story. (Warning: this story contains graphic images that some viewers may find disturbing)

4:44 p.m.: After a sharp plunge in value at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the Russian ruble has recovered much of its value against other world currencies, a change made possible by aggressive capital controls put in place by the government in Moscow and a continual stream of payments for the country’s oil and gas exports. But as VOA’s Rob Garver reports, the ruble’s strength in the face of sanctions may be illusory.

4:01 p.m.: The Pentagon said on Wednesday it assessed that Ukraine could win the war against Russia, even as U.S. officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict, Reuters reported. ""Of course they can win this,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. ""The proof is literally in the outcomes that you're seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.""

3:48 p.m.: The town of Borodyanka, outside Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, was severely damaged by Russian air strikes. According to Prosecutor-General Iryna Venediktova, there were a high number of civilian casualties because of the heavy fighting there. Collapsed buildings have not been cleared and the number of victims has not yet been determined. Levko Stek traveled to Borodyanka and listened to locals’ stories about what Russian troops did there. He has this story for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

3:27 p.m.: Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a ""good understanding"" of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Wednesday.

Sherman said the ""range of sanctions"" and export controls coordinated among U.S. allies and partners against Russian President Vladimir Putin, the country's economy, and oligarchs, should serve as an example for China's leader Xi Jinping. ""It gives President Xi, I think, a pretty good understanding of what might come his way should he, in fact, support Putin in any material fashion,"" Sherman told a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, according to Reuters.

3:16 p.m.: Hundreds of people are believed to be dead and buried under destroyed apartment buildings in the town of Borodyanka, scene of Russian bombings during the month of March, The Kyiv Independent reported Wednesday. Home to 12,000 people, Borodyanka and the nearby villages were retaken by Ukrainian forces on April 1, when Russian troops withdrew from the region, following weeks of intense fighting around the capital Kyiv.

2:48 p.m.: Ukraine will need a reconstruction plan after the war with Russia similar to the one the United States offered to Europe after the Second World War, European Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn said on Wednesday.
