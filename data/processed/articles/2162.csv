Once again, in the centre of Europe, innocent women, men and children are dying or fear for their lives. We condemn this barbaric attack, and the cynical arguments to justify it.

It is President Putin, who is bringing war back to Europe. In these dark hours, the European Union and its people stand by Ukraine and its people. We are facing an unprecedented act of aggression by the Russian leadership against a sovereign, independent country. Russia's target is not only Donbass, the target is not only Ukraine, the target is the stability in Europe and the whole of the international peace order. And we will hold President Putin accountable for that.

Later today, we will present a package of massive and targeted sanctions, to European Leaders for approval. With this package, we will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia. We will weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernise. And in addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets. Like with the first package of sanctions, we are closely aligned with our partners and allies – the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, but also, for example, Japan and Australia. These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war.

And we know that millions of Russians do not want war. President Putin is trying to turn back the clock to the times of the Russian empire. But in doing so, he is putting at risk the future of the Russian people. I call on Russia to immediately stop the violence and to withdraw its troops from Ukraine's territory. We will not let President Putin tear down the security architecture that has given Europe peace and stability over many decades. We will not allow President Putin to replace the rule of law by the rule of force and ruthlessness. He should not underestimate the resolve and strength of our democracies.

History has proven that societies and alliances built on trust and freedom are resilient and successful. And that is exactly what the autocrats fear.

Feb 26 (Reuters) - The European Union has imposed two packages of sanctions on Russia for launching an ""unprecedented and unprovoked military attack against Ukraine"".

Further sanctions, including the suspension of Russia's access to the global SWIFT payment system, could follow. The measures come on top of sanctions already in place since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

According to the EU, the sanctions are designed ""to cripple the Kremlin's ability to finance the war, impose clear economic and political costs on Russia's political elite responsible for the invasion and diminish (Russia's) economic base"".

This is a list of the measures imposed so far:

BLACKLISTINGS

The EU has blacklisted hundreds of additional people, many of them members of the Russian parliament who voted for the recognition of the breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Their bank accounts in the EU are now frozen and they are banned from travelling to the bloc.

The most prominent individuals on the blacklist are Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, although they are exempt from the travel ban. This is meant to enable negotiations with them should the opportunity arise.

Still, Putin is now one of only three world leaders blacklisted by the EU, along with Syria's Bashar al-Assad and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. The blacklist currently includes 654 individuals and 52 entities in total.

SANCTIONS TARGETING FINANCE AND ECONOMY

Sanctions targeting Russia's economy are designed to cut the country's access to EU capital markets, increase borrowing costs for those sanctioned and gradually erode its industrial base.

They include an asset freeze and financial ban on three key Russian banks, add more state-owned companies to the sanctions list and ban Russian elites from depositing money in EU banks.

The sanctions also prohibit any form of lending and buying of securities by Russian banks and government, including the Russian central bank.

Seventy percent of the Russian banking system (measured by assets), government and key state-owned companies will no longer be able to refinance in the EU's capital markets, according to EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.

ENERGY SECTOR

The sanctions ban the export of specific refining technologies, making it harder and more expensive for Russia to modernise its oil refineries. They add to an existing oil equipment ban imposed in 2014. Russia earned 24 billion euros in 2019 from refined oil exports to the EU, according to the bloc.

TRANSPORT SECTOR

The EU has banned the export, sale, supply or transfer of all aircraft, aircraft parts and equipment to Russia as well as all services related to the repair, maintenance and financing of aircraft.

Three-quarters of Russia's commercial air fleet were built in the EU, United States and Canada, according to the EU. The sanctions mean that ""Russia will not be able to maintain its fleet to international standards"", the EU said.

DUAL-USE GOODS AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY

The EU has toughened existing sanctions on goods that can be used for civilian as well as military purposes, targeting Russia's military-industrial complex and limiting its access to advanced technology such as drones and software for drones, software for encryption devices, semiconductors and advanced electronics.

These measures are meant to downgrade Russia's technological capabilities over time.

DIPLOMAT VISAS

Russian holders of diplomat passports will no longer enjoy visa-free travel to the EU, and Russian government officials and business people will no longer benefit from lower fees when applying for a visa. This measure will not apply to Russian citizens in general, who will retain the benefits they currently have.

TRADE WITH BREAKAWAY REGIONS IN UKRAINE

The EU has imposed an import ban on goods from breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, on doing business with tourism services there and on exports of certain goods and technologies.

3,91451bc2-ea3d-4378-a48a-441246352fc4,"['Raf Casert', 'Associated Press', 'Samuel Petrequin']",2022-02-24 06:20:49-04:00,"BRUSSELS (AP) — World leaders Thursday condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “barbaric” and moved to slap unprecedented economic sanctions on Moscow and those close to President Vladimir Putin.

The West and its allies showed no inclination to send troops into Ukraine — a non-member of NATO — and risk a wider European war. But NATO reinforced its member states in Eastern Europe as a precaution against an attack on them, too.

“Make no mistake: We will defend every ally against any attack on every inch of NATO territory,” said NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg.

In the meantime, the allies began to take steps aimed at isolating Moscow and forcing it to pay so high a price that it changes course.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the attack “hideous and barbaric” and said of Putin: “Now we see him for what he is — a bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest.”

As the first major world leader to make a big move, Johnson announced a freeze on the assets of all large Russian banks and plans to bar Russian companies and the Kremlin from raising money on British markets.

Britain will also ban the export to Russia of a wide range of high-tech products, including semiconductors, and prohibit the nation’s flagship airline, Aeroflot, from landing at British airports.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Stoltenberg both called the invasion a “barbaric” attack on an independent nation that threatened “the stability in Europe and the whole of the international peace order.” The European Union scheduled an emergency summit in Brussels.

Von der Leyen threatened to hit Russia with “massive and targeted sanctions.” She said she would put to EU leaders late Thursday a proposal that would target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking access to key technologies and markets.

She said the sanctions, if approved, “will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernize. And in addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets.”

“We want to cut off Russia’s industry from the technologies desperately needed today to build the future,” von der Leyen said.

In the days before the attack, Germany suspended approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, and the EU imposed sanctions against hundreds of Russian lawmakers and other officials and institutions from the defense and banking worlds. The EU also sought to limit Moscow’s access to capital and financial markets.

In a similar bid to fend off an invasion, U.S. President Joe Biden announced sanctions over the past few days against Russian banks and oligarchs and warned of even heavier penalties in the event of an attack.

Biden convened a morning meeting Thursday of his National Security Council to deal with the crisis.

Separately, the U.N. is expected to vote Friday on a resolution condemning Russia and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all its forces. But Moscow is certain to veto the measure.

Von der Leyen insisted all Western powers were in lockstep on the crisis. Even Hungary, an often recalcitrant member of the EU, promptly condemned the attack, raising hopes that the 27 states would quickly achieve the required unanimity for the sanctions package.

Highlighting a widening rift in superpower relations, China stood alone in failing to condemn the attack and instead accused the United States and its allies of worsening the crisis.

In a clear defense of Moscow, China “called on parties to respect others’ legitimate security concerns.”

READ MORE: China avoids criticism of Russia attack, calls for talks on Ukraine

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said that “all parties should work for peace instead of escalating the tension or hyping up the possibility of war” — language China has consistently used to criticize the West in the crisis.

China went further and approved imports of wheat from Russia, a move that could reduce the impact of Western sanctions. Russia, one of the biggest wheat producers, would be vulnerable if foreign markets were closed off.

The turmoil set off by the attack rippled from Europe to Asia and the U.S. Stocks plunged, oil prices surged, and European aviation officials warned of the danger to civilian aircraft over Ukraine amid the fighting.

Oil prices climbed by more than $5 per barrel. Brent crude briefly jumped above $100 per barrel in London for the first time since 2014 over fears of a disruption of supplies from Russia, the No. 3 producer.

The possible repercussions extended well beyond economics and geopolitics. The director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worried that the crisis will further distract global attention from helping the world’s least vaccinated continent fight COVID-19.

""We will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia. We will weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernise,"" she said in a press conference in Brussels, speaking ahead of an emergency EU summit later in the day.

""We will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets,"" she added.

""These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war,"" she said.

The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, speaking alongside her, said he would coordinate evacuations of EU nationals and EU diplomatic personnel still in Ukraine.

He vowed to make Russia face ""unprecedented isolation"" on the world stage by reaching out to Europe's international allies.

Russia's assault on Ukraine has also prompted debate in Germany and further afield about sending weapons to Ukraine.

""I was against arms deliveries in order to keep channels of communication with Moscow open. That's over for now. What matters now is defence. Whatever #weapons we can provide, we must deliver to #Ukraine,"" Norbert Röttgen, a senior German MP tweeted.

""Innocent women and children are dying or fearing for their lives,"" von der Leyen also said Thursday, amid the first reports of casualties from Ukraine in international media.

Borrell called the events ""the darkest hours for Europe since the days of World War 2"". ""It's costing many lives, with unknown consequences ahead of us,"" he added.

""A major nuclear power has attacked a neighbouring country and is threatening reprisals against any other states that may come to its rescue,"" he said.

The EU, on Wednesday night, prior to Russia's attack, already adopted its first tranche of Russia sanctions by imposing visa-bans and asset freezes on 374 Russian individuals and four entities.

The EU's ""massive"" economic sanctions were drawn up last April in coordination with the US and the UK, when Russia began its build up of military forces around Ukraine, but have remained a closely guarded secret.

An EU sanctions options paper drafted in 2014, when Russia first attacked Ukraine, indicated how far EU leaders might be willing to go.

It outlined three scenarios: low-intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity.

The EU's 2014 ""high-intensity"" option named five steps: ""capital market restrictions""; ""prohibition of new investment in Russia""; ""strict application of EU regulatory rules to Russian assets in EU companies""; an ""import ban on gas""; and ""an import ban on oil"".

No leaders mentioned halting Russian gas or oil imports in the run-up to Thursday's events.

But according to research by the Kiel Institute for World Economy, a German think-tank, a Russia gas embargo by the EU and its allies, including the US, the UK, and Japan, would cost Russia 2.9 percent of its GDP and an oil embargo a further 1.2 percent, while doing little immediate harm to Europe.

""The medium-term economic consequences of trade embargoes would hit Russia much harder than the Western allies,"" Kiel's Hendrik Mahlkow said.",https://euobserver.com/world/154423
5,91451bc2-ea3d-4378-a48a-441246352fc4,[],,"Following initial sanctions measures in the US, EU, and UK in response to Russia’s recognition of two regions of Ukraine, discussed in our previous Legal Update, we provide below an update on significant new measures adopted by the US and several allied countries on February 23 and February 24, 2022, to counter Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

These measures reflect a significant escalation and more expansive use of economic restrictions targeting important elements of the Russian economy in a coordinated effort by several allied governments. These include:

The US adopted (i) further sanctions against the largest Russian financial institutions, key state-owned enterprises, ruling elites and other key Russian interests; and (ii) the “most comprehensive” export control regulatory regime against any single nation, expanding the extra-territorial reach of US export controls against Russia and targeting its access to a wide range of goods, software and technology under an expansive new framework.

The EU adopted the first tranche of sanctions restrictions targeting financial institutions, other entities and individuals, and territorial restrictions on Donetsk and Luhansk; and consideration of a second package of sanctions tomorrow.

In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised a “massive package of economic sanctions” that will be “designed in time to hobble the Russian economy.” 1



Meanwhile, Canada, Australia, and Japan imposed their own sanctions on Russia as well.

Finally, the Ukrainian government has called for even more sanctions, including as it regards Russia’s access to financial messaging systems, which has found some public support in the US Congress, although reporting suggests that world leaders are divided on such a move.2 In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry has threatened a “strong response” to US sanctions.3

This continues to be a dynamic and quickly evolving environment, with additional sanctions from the US, EU, UK and other allies likely and the risk of countermeasures from Russia. Companies should continue to monitor and assess the impact on their operations.

EUROPEAN UNION

A First EU Sanctions Package Against Russia Enters into Force, While a Second Sanctions Package Is Being Discussed

1.1 Scope of the First EU Sanctions Package Against Russia

Following the Russian government’s recognition on February 21, 2022, of the independence of the Donetsk People’s Republic (“DNR”) and the Luhansk People’s Republic (“LNR”), the EU announced the adoption of a new sanctions package against Russia on February 22, 2022.4

On February 23, 2022, the Council of the European Union (“Council”) formally adopted the legal texts, which formalize these new sanctions.5 These texts entered into force as from their publication in the Official Journal in the very last minutes of February 23, 2022.

Pursuant to these texts, the following sanctions are now applicable:

Asset freeze measures , which prohibit virtually all transactions involving funds or economic resources of designated persons, 6 have been imposed against individuals and entities in the political, military, business, banking, and media sectors.



Targets of these asset freeze measures include (i) politicians, primarily members of the Russian State Duma who voted for the recognition of the DNR and LNR; (ii) high-ranking officials, including Russia’s defense minister, the minister of economic development and deputy prime ministers; (iii) military commanders in the navy, air force, and ground forces; (iv) banking executives; (v) media personalities; (vi) business persons; (vii) three banks (Rossiya Bank, Promsvyazbank and VEB); and (viii) the Internet Research Agency.



Of note, under EU practice, asset freeze measures not only apply to specifically designated individuals and entities but are also presumed to extend to the entities they own or control. 7



Derogations or authorizations may nonetheless be obtained to receive, deal with, or make available funds or economic resources that would otherwise be subject to an asset freeze measure, based on specific grounds listed in the relevant legal texts. In particular, a new ground for authorization has been introduced to allow transactions necessary for the termination by August 24, 2022, of operations, contracts, or other agreements, including correspondent banking relations, concluded with the three newly designated banks before February 23, 2022.

Travel ban measures against the individuals who have been designated as subject to asset freeze measures.

against the individuals who have been designated as subject to asset freeze measures. Restrictions on access to capital for Russia and its governments, as well as the Central Bank of Russia, which prohibit:

(i) The purchase, sale, provision of investments services for, assistance in the issuance, or otherwise dealing with certain transferable securities and money-market instruments issued by them after March 9, 2022; and

(ii) The making or being part of any arrangement to make new loans or credit to them after February 23, 2022.

These restrictions in addition extend to any EU or non-EU legal entity acting on behalf of or at the direction of the Central Bank of Russia.

The legal texts nonetheless provide for certain exceptions to the prohibition on new loans and credits for:

(i) Trade finance loans, i.e., loans or credit that have a specific and documented objective to provide financing for non-prohibited imports or exports of goods and non-financial services between the Union and any third state; and

(ii) Drawdown or disbursements made under a contract concluded before February 23, 2022, subject to certain conditions regarding the terms and conditions of such drawdown or disbursements, as well as the existence of a contractual maturity date for repayment and for the cancellation of commitments, rights, and obligations under the contract.

The definition of “transferable securities” is also extended to any securities giving rise to a cash settlement determined by reference to transferable securities.8

The “no claims” and “anti-circumvention” provisions are also amended to cover these new restrictions.

Comprehensive prohibitions on trade with the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine (“Specified Territories”), which consist of:

(i) A prohibition on importation of goods originating in the Specified Territories in the EU and related services (financing, financial assistance, insurance, and reinsurance).

(ii) A prohibition on investments and financing in the Specified Territories, including prohibitions on:

- The acquisition of a new, or the extension of an existing, participation in ownership or control of real estate in the Specified Territories or in entities in the Specified Territories (including the acquisition in full of such entities and the acquisition of shares and other securities of a participating nature);

- Granting or being part of an arrangement to grant loans, credits or financing to entities in the Specified Territories or for the documented purpose of financing entities in the Specified Territories;

- The creation of any joint venture in or with entities in the Specified Territories; and

- Investment services directly related to the above activities.

(iii) A prohibition on the export of goods and technologies suited for use in the transport, telecommunications, energy and oil, gas and mineral resources sectors (“Restricted Sectors”) and a prohibition on the provision of services (technical assistance, brokering services, training, financing, or financial assistance) related to these goods to or for use in the Specified Territories;

(iv) A prohibition on the provision of technical assistance, brokering, construction, or engineering services directly related to infrastructure in Restricted Sectors in the Specified Territories; and9

(v) A prohibition on services directly related to tourism activities in the Specified Territories.

The relevant legal texts provide for limited derogations or authorization mechanisms to enter into transactions that would otherwise be prohibited under the above restrictive measures, based on specific grounds listed in the relevant legal texts.

In addition, while not formally part of the sanctions package, a notice has been published by the European Commission to importers regarding imports of products into the Union under the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement from the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine.10 In accordance with this notice, goods produced in or exported from the non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine can no longer benefit from preferential (i.e., duty-free) access to the EU market under the terms of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement.

1.2 A Second EU Sanctions Package Is Expected on February 25, 2022

Following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops in the early hours of February 24, 2022, the European Commission’s president issued a press statement confirming that a package of “massive and targeted sanctions” would be submitted for adoption by the EU Member States. The sanctions contemplated are expected to (i) “target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia” and (ii) “freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets.”11

Following technical meetings between Member States representatives in the morning of February 24, 2022, the European Council adopted conclusions in the evening of February 22, 2024, laying out, in general terms, the scope of this second sanctions package: “[t]hese sanctions cover the financial sector, the energy and transport sectors, dual-use goods, as well as export control and export financing, visa policy, additional listings of Russian individuals and new listing criteria.”12

The following measures are reported as being under consideration:

- Additional asset freeze measures, targeting two Russian banks and five state-owned institutions;

- New listing criteria to facilitate the imposition of asset freeze measures against oligarchs;

- Extension of restrictions on access to capital (i.e., restrictions on transferable securities, money-market instruments, loans, and credits) to certain state-owned enterprises, notably in the aerospace, defense, shipping and shipbuilding sectors;

- Export control restrictions on dual-use goods, as well as strategic goods for the military sectors and advanced technologies, including aircraft and jet parts, equipment needed to upgrade Russian oil refineries, electronics, sensors, telecommunications, marine applications, and lasers;

- Restrictions on new large deposits by Russian nationals in EU financial institutions; and

- Restrictions on visa-free travel for Russian diplomatic passports.

The legal texts will now be reviewed by Member States’ representatives and discussed during a technical meeting in the morning of February 25, 2022, before being formally adopted by the Member States in the afternoon. Publication of the new sanctions package in the Official Journal of the EU is expected to follow, with an immediate entry into force.

Furthermore, the European Council’s conclusions of February 24, 2022, confirm that a new sanctions package against Belarus should be prepared, to be adopted at a later date.

UNITED KINGDOM

UK Announces Next Waves of Sanctions Against Russia on February 24, 2022

On February 24, 2022, the prime minister announced plans for the “largest and most severe” package of economic sanctions that Russia “has ever seen.” Among other things, he announced that the UK will:

Impose assets freeze restrictions on more than 100 entities and individuals, including VTB Bank and major Russian manufacturers;

Introduce powers to exclude Russian banks from the UK financial system, including preventing access by such banks to GBP and clearing services in the UK;

Limit the amount of money Russian nationals can deposit in UK bank accounts;

Introduce a ban on Aeroflot landing in the UK;

Ban the export of all dual use items to Russia, including items relating to the electronics, telecommunications and aerospace sectors; and

In parallel, introduce new sanctions against Belarus.

The prime minister stated that new legislation to introduce these measures will be laid before the UK Parliament next week.

At the same time, on February 24, 2022, the UK implemented comprehensive sanctions on six entities and five individuals. The targeted entities include VTB Bank, Russia’s second largest bank by total assets, and certain aerospace and defense companies such as Rostec, United Aircraft Corporation and United Shipbuilding Corporation. These designations supplement the eight new assets freeze designations announced by the UK on February 22, 2022. The prime minister’s announcement foreshadows further assets freeze designations in the coming days.

In addition to the above sanctions measures, the prime minister announced a number of other measures intended to provide additional tools for UK law enforcement to identify and target the wealth of Russian oligarchs based in the UK. These include plans to reinforce the UK’s Unexplained Wealth Order regime before Easter, bring forward reforms to the Companies House register, and introduce a new dedicated “kleptocracy cell” within the National Crime Agency. In response to the question of banning Russian access to SWIFT, the prime minister said that “nothing is off the table.”

UNITED STATES

1. OFAC Sanctions Targeting Key Russian Interests

On February 24, the US Treasury Department announced significant new sanctions on key Russian financial institutions, state-owned enterprises, high-net worth individuals, and other key Russian interests with substantial integration in the global economy. These includes the following:

Cutting off Russia’s largest financial institution, Sberbank, from the US financial system through prohibitions on US financial institution correspondent banking and payable-through account relationships with Sberbank, 25 of its subsidiaries designated by name, and any of their majority-owned affiliates located around the world. 13 These include banks, trusts, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;

through prohibitions on US financial institution correspondent banking and payable-through account relationships with Sberbank, 25 of its subsidiaries designated by name, and any of their majority-owned affiliates located around the world. These include banks, trusts, insurance companies, and other financial institutions; Comprehensive sanctions against Russia’s second largest financial institution, VTB , as well as Otkritie, Sovcombank, Novicombank, and 54 of their subsidiaries designated by name, as well as any of their majority-owned affiliates located around the world; 14

, as well as Otkritie, Sovcombank, Novicombank, and 54 of their subsidiaries designated by name, as well as any of their majority-owned affiliates located around the world; Additional debt and equity restrictions against major state-owned and private entities , including Alfa Bank, OJSC Russian Railways, Credit Bank of Moscow, Russian Agricultural Bank, Transneft and several others; 15

, including Alfa Bank, OJSC Russian Railways, Credit Bank of Moscow, Russian Agricultural Bank, Transneft and several others; New sanctions on Russian government officials and heads of state-owned enterprises ; 16 and

; and Sanctions against the financial and defense sectors of a Russian ally for “facilitating” the invasion of Ukraine. In addition, the Treasury Department announced new sanctions on Belarusian entities in the defense and financial sectors “due to Belarus’s support for, and facilitation of, the invasion [of Ukraine].” OFAC designated 24 Belarusian individuals and entities, focusing on the defense and financial sectors. This action blocks all property and interests in property of the designated entities that are in the US or in the possession or control of US persons.17

In addition to issuing these wide-ranging new sanctions, OFAC also issued a number of General Licenses. Notably, these include:

OFAC also issued additional conditional and time-limited authorizations for a range of other transactions, including certain energy sector, food, medicine, and medical device transactions. Notably, OFAC emphasized that the wind-down General Licenses were not issued for all designated banks. Moreover, caution is warranted in relying on any General License, as entities may be subject to multiple prohibitions, and the terms of the General License may authorize only certain aspects of a transaction.

The Biden administration has indicated that additional sanctions could come in short order—including on elites and their family members, additional Russian financial institutions, and additional Russian energy interests and firms.

2. Imposition of the “Most Comprehensive” US Export Controls Ever to Target a Single Nation. On February 24, the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) imposed an unprecedented package of new export control restrictions to achieve this goal. The controls, which took effect upon publication today (here), include:

New Commerce Control List (“CCL”)-based license requirements for Russia for a broad array of commercial and dual-use items not previously controlled for Russia and spanning a range of sectors, including microelectronics, telecommunications items, sensors, navigation equipment, avionics, marine equipment, and aircraft components.

A review policy of denial for license applications for exports to, reexports to, or transfers within Russia and limitations on the availability of license expectations.

An expansion of the existing Russia “military end use” and “military end user” control scope to all items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), excluding food and medicine subject to EAR99 and items classified as ECCN 5A992.c or 5D992.c.

Russia-specific “foreign direct product” (“FDP”) rules that expand the reach of US export controls for exports, re-exports, and transfers (in-country) to Russia and/or to Russian military end users:



New FDP Rule for all of Russia (“Russia FDP Rule”), establishing controls over foreign-produced items that are: (i) the direct product of certain US-origin software or technology subject to the EAR; or (ii) produced by certain plants or major components thereof which are themselves the direct product of certain US-origin software or technology subject to the EAR. The rule applies where there is knowledge or reason to know that a foreign-produced item is destined for Russia or incorporated into a product destined for Russia. This excludes items designated as EAR99. New FDP Rule for Russian military end users (“Russia-MEU FDP rule”), establishing more controls over foreign-produced items that are: (i) the direct product of any software or technology subject to the EAR that is on the CCL; or (ii) produced by certain plants or major components thereof which are themselves the direct product of any US-origin software or technology on the CCL. These items are subject to the EAR and require a license if an Entity List entity with a “footnote 3” designation is a party to the transaction or if there is knowledge or reason to know the item will be incorporated into or used in the production or development of any part, component or equipment produced, purchased, or ordered by such an entity. The notice provides an initial list of 49 entities, including the Russian Ministry of Defense. The restrictions apply to all items, including EAR99-designated items. Exports, re-exports, and transfers (in-country) from certain US partner countries that are adopting or have expressed the intent to adopt similar foreign direct product measures are not and will not be subject to these rules.



Notably, the new regulations also significantly limit the availability of license exceptions for Russia, including but not limited to certain limited and conditional exceptions relating to: (i) certain software updates for civil end-users that are subsidiaries or joint ventures with companies headquartered in the United States or partner countries (License Exception TSU); (ii) important limitations on License Exception ENC covering common encryption commodities, software, and technology to restrict usage for government end-users as well as Russian state-enterprises; and (iii) certain consumer communications devices (License Exception CCD) not for government end users or certain individuals associated with the government.

NEW SANCTIONS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS

Australia, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, and South Korea have also announced sanctions on Russia in regards to Ukraine in recent days. These could also be simply initial rounds of sanctions and could evolve as the situation in Ukraine changes.

Canada

President Justin Trudeau announced that Canada will impose the following sanctions:

Restrictions on members of the Russian State Duma who voted for the decision to recognize the independence of the DNR and LNR;

A ban on dealings by Canadians in the DNR and LNR;

New prohibitions on direct and indirect dealings in Russian sovereign debt; and

Sanctions on two significant Russian financial institutions.18

Japan

The Japanese government also announced that it would impose the following:

Prohibitions on trade with the DNR and LNR;

Prohibitions on transactions in both the primary and secondary markets for Russian sovereign debt in Japan;

Expansion of coverage of maturity regarding existing prohibitions of bond issuances by designated Russian banks; and

Asset freeze and travel bans on individuals determined to be involved in destabilizing Ukrainian territories.

Japanese officials also suggested that the Japanese government is assessing potential Russian retaliation and contingency plans for supply chain disruption in key sectors, including chipmaking and energy.19

Australia

In Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced measures including:

Sanctions against members of Russia’s Security Council and several banks, including Rossiya, Promsvyazbank, IS Bank, Genbank and Black Sea Bank for Development and Reconstruction (in addition to an investment ban on VEB);

An extension of existing sanctions on Crimea and Sevastopol to include Donetsk and Luhansk prohibiting trade in transport; energy; telecommunications; and oil, gas and minerals sectors; and

A planned expansion of designation criteria to include those of “strategic and economic significance to Russia.”20

Switzerland

In Switzerland, President Ignazio Cassis stated that he would expand on sanctions imposed on Russia after the country annexed Crimea.

The country will impose reporting requirements for people on the EU’s sanctions list to prevent them from using the Swiss territory to circumvent penalties. The individuals sanctioned by the EU on February 23 will be subject to these reporting requirements.

However, the individuals on the EU sanctions list will still be able to access Swiss bank accounts and withdraw money. The Swiss government has not yet made a decision on further measures, including asset freezes.

The announced measures still need to be approved by the Swiss Federal Council, which should take several days.21

South Korea

Finally, the South Korean Foreign Ministry confirmed that it would join international export control efforts against Russia on February 24. However, the country is not considering imposing its own sanctions against Russia.22

6,91451bc2-ea3d-4378-a48a-441246352fc4,[],2022-02-24 00:00:00,"World leaders Thursday reacted to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with raw outrage — and vows of unprecedented sanctions — that shrouded a sense of powerlessness to defend Ukraine militarily without running the risk of a wider war in Europe.

NATO had already reinforced its eastern flank facing Russia and planned a virtual summit of its leaders on Friday after President Vladimir Putin warned that any interference from other countries would lead to ""consequences you have never seen in history.”

European Union and NATO member Lithuania declared a state of emergency since the Baltic nation borders Russia’s Kaliningrad region to the southwest and Russia's ally Belarus to the east. NATO countries had 100 jets and 120 ships on high alert as a deterrent.

""Make no mistake: We will defend every ally against any attack on every inch of NATO territory,” said NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Stoltenberg both called the invasion a “barbaric"" attack on an independent nation that threatened “the stability in Europe and the whole of the international peace order.” The EU scheduled an emergency summit in Brussels.

But no one promised to move in militarily and defend Ukraine at the risk of touching off a bigger European war. Ukraine is not a NATO member, and the U.S. and its Western allies have said for weeks that they would not send troops into the country.

The goal instead is to make Moscow pay so high a price by other means that the Kremlin will change course.

“Our mission is clear: Diplomatically, politically, economically and eventually militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure,” said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

Almost all of the world — but not China — condemned the attack and threatened to hit the Russian elites with, in the words of the EU president, “massive and targeted sanctions.” Von der Leyen said she would put to EU leaders late Thursday a proposal that would target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking access to key technologies and markets.

She said the sanctions, if approved, “will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernize. And in addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets.”

“We want to cut off Russia’s industry from the technologies desperately needed today to build the future,” von der Leyen said.

In the days before the attack, Germany suspended approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, and the EU imposed sanctions against hundreds of Russian lawmakers and other officials and institutions from the defense and banking worlds. The EU also sought to limit Moscow's access to capital and financial markets.

In a similar bid to fend off an invasion, U.S. President Joe Biden announced sanctions over the past few days against Russian banks and oligarchs and warned of even heavier penalties in the event of an attack. He convened a morning meeting Thursday of his National Security Council to deal with the crisis.

Von der Leyen insisted all Western powers were in lockstep on the crisis. Even Hungary, an often recalcitrant member of the EU, promptly condemned the attack, raising hopes that the 27 states would quickly achieve the required unanimity for the sanctions package.

Highlighting a widening rift in superpower relations, China stood alone in failing to condemn the attack and instead accused the United States and its allies of worsening the crisis.

China went further and approved imports of wheat from Russia, a move that could reduce the impact of Western sanctions. Russia, one of the biggest wheat producers, would be vulnerable if foreign markets were closed off.

In a clear defense of Moscow, China “called on parties to respect others' legitimate security concerns.”

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said that “all parties should work for peace instead of escalating the tension or hyping up the possibility of war” — language China has consistently used to criticize the West in the crisis.

One thing was clear: Weeks of diplomatic cajoling, global crisscrossing of leaders and foreign ministers, and the threat of sanctions against Putin's inner circle had failed to persuade the Kremlin not to plunge Europe into one of its biggest crises since the end of the Cold War.

The turmoil set off by the attack rippled from Europe to Asia. Stock markets plunged, oil prices surged, and European aviation officials warned of the danger to civilian aircraft over Ukraine amid the fighting.

Oil prices climbed by more than $5 per barrel. Brent crude briefly jumped above $100 per barrel in London for the first time since 2014 over fears of a disruption of supplies from Russia, the No. 3 producer.

The possible repercussions extended well beyond economics and geopolitics. The director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worried that the crisis will further distract global attention from helping the world’s least vaccinated continent fight COVID-19.",https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/02/24/world-expresses-outrage-plans-stronger-russia-sanctions

The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada banned certain Russian banks from SWIFT on Saturday, the high security network that facilitates payments among 11,000 financial institutions in 200 countries. Earlier in the week, Germany halted certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline following Moscow's actions.

The European Union, United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Switzerland,Australia and Taiwan all hit Moscow with new injunctions over the weekend, condemning the military incursion that unfolded over the past 24 hours.

Russia is already paying a price for its aggression. The country's stocks and currency tanked last week after Putin's ordered troops into eastern Ukraine. Russia's stock market was closed Monday.

The Ruble hit record lows Monday, sliding as much as 30% against the dollar, while the Russian central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20%.

Putin is ""indifferent"" to Western sanctions against him, his spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday, as he has no assets abroad.

""The sanctions contain rather absurd statements about some assets, etc... Everyone knows that President [Putin] doesn't have any assets, in fact, except for those that are declared every year in the amount of a [car] trailer and an apartment, and some bank deposits,"" he said.

Though Putin owns modest assets on paper, opposition members and investigative journalists allege he has a hidden fortune.

Here's a look at the latest major sanctions.

European Union

The European Commission -- along with the United States, United Kingdom and Canada -- pledged Saturday to remove Russia from SWIFT, a global messaging service that connects financial systems, as part of stricter moves to remove Russia from the international finance system.

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen on February 25, 2022 in Brussels, Belgium.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication is used by over 11,000 financial institutions to send secure messages and payment orders -- kicking Russia out of it is considered a ""nuclear move.""

The countries also committed to imposing ""restrictive measures"" that would prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of sanctions. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the measures will paralyze Russia's central bank assets and freeze its transactions, making it impossible to liquidate its assets.

""We will stop Putin from using his war chest,"" von der Leyen said in a statement.

The statement said it will limit the sale of ""golden passports,"" which allow wealthy Russians to gain citizenship in another country in exchange for an investment. This move would clamp down on wealthy Russians with connections to the government becoming citizens of other countries and ""gaining access to our financial systems.""

Von der Leyen and French president Emmanuel Macron announced other measures early Friday, vowing to inflict ""maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.""

""We will hold the Kremlin accountable,"" said von der Leyen.

The sanctions are aimed to hit Russia's financial, energy and transport sectors, and include export controls and trade financing bans.

Switzerland

Even historically neutral Switzerland is adopting the EU's sanctions against Russia, President Ignazio Cassis announced Monday. The country, which is a major center for wealthy Russian oligarchs, said it's freezing the assets of certain individuals ""with immediate effect.""

Swiss Federal President Ignazio Cassis speaks during a press conference in Bern, Switzerland, Monday, February 28.

The sanctions and asset freeze will apply to Putin, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Switzerland affirmed its commitment to neutrality and said it will examine further EU sanctions on a ""case-by-case basis.""

""Russia's unprecedented military attack on a sovereign European country was the deciding factor in the Federal Council's decision to change its previous stance on sanctions,"" a statement said.

France

France's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire in Paris on February 28.

The French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said Monday that the country will go after luxury goods owned by Russians targeted by sanctions, following a defense council meeting called by French President Emmanuel Macron.

""We are pursuing the complete census of financial assets, real estate, yachts and luxury vehicles that would belong to Russian personalities under European sanctions,"" Le Maire said.

Japan

Japan said Monday that it will impose more sanctions on Russia, aligning with the G-7. Specifically, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Japan will limit transactions with Russia's central bank and that it would impose sanctions on Belarus, Reuters reported . Over the weekend, the country indicated it will deny certain Russian banks access to SWIFT and that it will freeze Putin's assets.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida spoke at a news conference on February 25 in Tokyo, Japan.

Kishida announced a range of measures last week, including freezing the assets of certain Russian individuals and financial institutions while also banning exports to Russian military organizations.

""In response to this situation, we will strengthen our sanction measures in close cooperation with the G7 and the rest of the international community,"" Kishida said in a press conference on Friday.

Australia

Australia's leader said Friday that it would ""begin imposing further sanctions on oligarchs, whose economic weight is of strategic significance to Moscow and over 300 members of the Russian Duma, their parliament.""

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaks at a press conference in Sydney, Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022.

Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison added that Canberra was ""also working with the United States to align with their further sanctions overnight on key Belarusian individuals and entities complicit in the aggression, so we are extending those sanctions to Belarus.""

The new round of measures came after Australia imposed travel bans and targeted financial sanctions on eight members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation on Thursday.

New Zealand

New Zealand is prohibiting the export of goods to the Russian military and security forces in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern speaks on the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 25, 2022 in Auckland, New Zealand.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Friday that it would cut trade with Russia and impose travel bans against Russian officials as it continued to call for a return to diplomatic dialogue to resolve the crisis.

""Right here and now we need to take immediate action,"" Ardern said in a press conference in Wellington.

""This is the blatant use of military might and violence that will take innocent lives and we must stand against it.""

Taiwan

Taiwan announced Friday that it would join the economic sanctions against Russia, without specifying which measures were being considered.

In a statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday that it ""strongly condemns"" Russia's decision to start a war against Ukraine, adding that it has posed a serious threat to the rules-based international order.

The decision to impose sanctions was made ""to compel Russia to halt its military aggression against Ukraine, and to restart peaceful dialogue among all parties concerned as soon as possible,"" the ministry added.

Taiwan is a global leader in the production of semiconductors.

The United States

US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced further actions against Russia on Monday, including barring Russian financial institutions -- such as the Russian Central Bank -- from making transactions in American dollars.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department in Washington, DC, on February 22.

The US also imposed sanctions on the state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund, calling it a ""known slush fund"" for Putin and his inner circle.

The aggressive moves were taken to prohibit Russia from accessing a ""rainy day fund"" that officials said Moscow had been expecting to rely upon during the invasion of Ukraine. Instead of using the reserves to buffer a plummeting ruble, Russia will no longer be able to access the funds it keeps in US dollars.

US President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled another set of harsh measures against Russia, saying: ""Putin chose this war.""

Those sanctions include export blocks on technology, a centerpiece of Biden's approach that he said would severely limit Russia's ability to advance its military and aerospace sector.

In a statement, the White House said ""this includes Russia-wide restrictions on semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime technologies.""

Washington also put sanctions on people it described as ""corrupt billionaires"" and their families who are close to the Kremlin.

It said it would cut off 13 major state-owned companies from raising money in the United States, including energy giant Gazprom and Sberbank, Russia's largest financial institution.

The White House also vowed to sanction two dozen Belarusian individuals and companies, which include ""two significant Belarusian state-owned banks, nine defense firms, and seven regime-connected officials and elites.""

The United Kingdom

The United Kingdom imposed fresh sanctions on Russian banks Monday and said it had a ""hit list"" of oligarchs to be sanctioned, according to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.

The country will prevent Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, from clearing payments in Sterling. And three more Russian banks -- Otkritie, Sovcombank and VEB -- will face a full asset freeze.

Truss said the UK will bring a full asset freeze on all Russian banks ""in days"" to Parliament on Monday.

The UK joined other Western countries over the weekend to ice Russian banks out of SWIFT.

The United Kingdom is also set to sanction 100 individuals and entities as part of further sanctions against Russia, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday.

An asset freeze will be imposed on Russian state bank VTB, he added, following the sanctioning of five Russian banks on Tuesday. Russian state and private companies will also be prevented from fund raising in the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom will ban Russia's national airline, Aeroflot, and apply sanctions to Belarus ""for its role in the assault on Ukraine,"" the prime minister added.

Going forward, Britain is also hoping to bring in legislation this week to ban the export of certain technologies to Russia, particularly ""in sectors including electronics, telecommunications, and aerospace,"" according to Johnson.

""We will continue on a remorseless mission to squeeze Russia, from the global economy, piece by piece. Day by day, and week by week,"" Johnson told lawmakers.

9,91451bc2-ea3d-4378-a48a-441246352fc4,"['Raf Casert', 'Foster Klug', 'Associated Press']",2022-02-24 11:22:57+00:00,"BRUSSELS (AP) — World leaders expressed a raw outrage shrouded by an impotence to immediately come to the aid of Ukraine to avoid a major war in Europe, condemning Russia’s attack on its neighbor as the European Union and others promised unprecedented sanctions to hit the Kremlin.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called it a “barbaric attack” on an independent nation that also targeted “the stability in Europe and the whole of the international peace order.” The EU will hold an emergency summit in Brussels, where NATO is also meeting after Poland and the Baltic nations bordering Russia and Ukraine called for an urgent session.

But no one promised to move in militarily and defend Ukraine as it could touch off a major European war. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned anyone listening that any interference would “lead to consequences you have never seen in history.”

So instead, most of the world — but not China — condemned and threatened to hit the Russian elites with, in the words of EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, “the strongest package, the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented.”

“A major nuclear power has attacked a neighbor country and is threatening reprisals of any other states that may come to the rescue,” Borrell said. “This is not only the greatest violation of international law, it’s a violation of the basic principles of human coexistence. It’s costing many lives with unknown consequences ahead of us. The European Union will respond in the strongest possible terms.”

Von der Leyen said the “massive and targeted sanctions” she will put to EU leaders “will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking the access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia.”

She said the sanctions, if approved, “will weaken Russia’s economic base and its capacity to modernize. And in addition, we will freeze Russian assets in the European Union and stop the access of Russian banks to European financial markets.”

Like the first package of sanctions that were imposed when Russia recognized the two breakaway eastern Ukrainian republics, von der Leyen said all Western powers were walking in lockstep.

“We are closely aligned with our partners and allies the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, but also, for example, Japan and Australia,” she said.

And highlighting a widening rift in superpower relations, China stood alone in failing to condemn the attack and instead accused the United States and its allies of worsening the crisis.

And it put its friendship in practice Thursday by approving imports of wheat from Russia, a move that could help to reduce the impact of possible increased Western sanctions. Russia is one of the biggest wheat producers but would be vulnerable if foreign markets block shipments.

In a clear defense of Moscow, China “called on parties to respect others’ legitimate security concerns.”

Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said that “all parties should work for peace instead of escalating the tension or hyping up the possibility of war,” in language China has consistently used to criticize the West in the crisis.

“Those parties who were busy condemning others; what have they done ? Have they persuaded others?” Hua said.

One thing was clear — weeks of diplomatic cajoling, global crisscrossing of leaders and foreign ministers, and the threat of sanctions against Putin’s inner circle had failed to persuade the Kremlin to take one of the most significant measures in Europe since the end of the Cold War.

NATO envoys met in an emergency session as the 30-nation military organization prepares to bolster its defenses in allies neighboring both countries. Preparations are also underway for a NATO summit.

Overall though, more sanctions appear the only option for the foreseeable future. And from South Korea to Australia to Europe, governments were lining up to oppose Putin.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and said Ukraine was in the thoughts of everyone in the U.K. “during this dark time.”

French President Emmanuel Macron, who had labored until the last minute for a diplomatic solution, said “France firmly condemns Russia’s decision to wage war,” and promised support for Ukraine.

“Russia must end its military operations immediately,” Macron said.

The turmoil from the beginning of a long-feared act of aggression rippled from Europe to Asia. Stock markets plunged, oil prices surged, and European aviation officials warned of a high risk to civilian aircraft over Ukraine, reminding air operators that “this is now an active conflict zone.”

Russia’s attack and uncertainty about the intensity of the Western response sent stocks tumbling and oil prices surging by more than $5 per barrel. Market benchmarks in Europe and Asia fell by as much as 4%, while Brent crude oil briefly jumped above $100 per barrel in London for the first time since 2014 on unease about possible disruption of supplies from Russia, the No. 3 producer.

In New York, the U.N. Security Council held an extraordinary emergency meeting meant to dissuade Russia from sending troops into Ukraine. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ plea to “give peace a chance” came just as Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared on Russian TV to announce a military operation that he maintained was to protect civilians in Ukraine.

Putin, who said that rebels in eastern Ukraine had asked Moscow for military assistance, warned other countries that any effort to interfere with the Russian operation would lead to “consequences they have never seen.” Explosions were heard in Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine. Moscow had massed more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders. On Monday, Putin recognized the independence of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and ordered Russian forces there for what he called “peacekeeping.” Guterres at the U.N. disputed that, saying the troops were entering another country without its consent.

In a bulletin Thursday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency said “there is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft” and that “the presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems poses a HIGH risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels.”

Africa highlighted the global impact and diplomatic reach of the attack. Few African nations have issued responses to the crisis but the director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention openly worried that global attention will now shift even further from helping the world’s least vaccinated continent respond to COVID-19.

“The conflict in Ukraine definitely will draw attention, political attention, towards that crisis,” John Nkengasong said.
