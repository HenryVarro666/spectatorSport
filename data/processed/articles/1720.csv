Speaking at France's annual agriculture fair, he said, ""If I can tell you one thing this morning, it is that this war will last.... This crisis will last, this war will last and all the crises that come with it will have lasting consequences.""

He added that the world must prepare for a 'long war' between Russia and Ukraine.

Blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin, Macron said, ""War has returned to Europe - this was chosen unilaterally by President Putin - with a tragic humanitarian situation, a [Ukrainian] people who are resisting and a Europe that is there and resisting by the side of the Ukrainian people.""

FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES ON UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR

French President Macron has called an emergency meet of his top ministers and military security officials to discuss the situation in Ukraine on Saturday.

In the run-up to the outbreak of war, Macron had repeatedly tried - in vain - to broker a summit between Putin and US President Biden.

On February 24, Emmanuel Macron had promised that France would “respond with no weakness” to Russia's “act of war” in Ukraine. He said that “sanctions toward Russia will be on the level of the aggressions it is itself guilty of — on the military and economic level"".

Several Western countries have imposed sanctions on Russia following its acts of aggression in its neighbouring country, Ukraine.

The world must brace for a long war between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow launched an invasion of its pro-Western neighbour, French President Emmanuel Macron warned on Saturday.

Macron cut short his visit to the agriculture fair, usually one of the main fixtures on the French political calendar, in order to return to dealing with the crisis triggered by the Russian invasion.

""War has returned to Europe, this was chosen unilaterally by President (Vladimir) Putin, with a tragic humanitarian situation, a (Ukrainian) people who are resisting and a Europe that is there and resisting by the side of the Ukrainian people,"" said Macron.

With the war and sanctions against Russia risking damage for specific sectors in France, notably the wine industry, Macron vowed a ""plan of resilience"" to help them cope.

The French leader was a key figure in efforts to avert conflict, repeatedly speaking to Putin and seeking in vain to broker a summit between the Russian leader and US President Joe Biden.

The war has also broken out as the clock ticks down to France's presidential elections in April.

Macron, who is expected to seek and win a second term, has left the official declaration of his candidacy to the last minute, although he must make a move next week ahead of a March 4 deadline to register.
