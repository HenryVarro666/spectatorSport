According to U.S. military sources, a U.S. senior defense official said on February 25, 2022, the United States assesses that Russia is yet to achieve air superiority over Ukraine amid its military intervention in the former Soviet republic.

Numerous media report the progress of the Russian forces and the seizure of airfields near Kyiv by airborne troops using transport helicopters.

But life goes on for the children of the Kharkiv Hippocrates centre where they treat patients with the most serious nervous system conditions.

The centre is a hospice and a rehabilitation facility. Its head, Dr Roman Marabyan, had been called up to the army, so I spoke to his deputy, Valentyna Drokina.

She seems overoptimistic for a doctor stuck with her patients in a city that’s been seeing no reprieve from Russia.

In more peaceful times, the centre used to care for dozens of young patients from the Kharkiv region and north-eastern Ukraine.

Some children were orphans - their parents abandoned them in state facilities after learning their diagnoses. The centre’s nurses and doctors have become not just children’s carers, but parental figures. Other children usually had mothers by their side.

The war has brought all of them together.

“We are one family now,” says Valentyna Drokina. Her centre welcomes all abandoned children with life-threatening conditions and those with their parents who didn’t have enough time to flee Kharkiv.

Out of 21 children that are being treated in this facility, only three can walk on their feet. Valentyna tells me the centre’s professionals had equipped its basement so that the children could spend the most dangerous hours down there.

“When it’s needed, every adult comes up to the kids, each takes one child and runs with them to the cellar,"" she says.

Quote Message: ""Children have no idea of what’s going on. They think we are playing with them"" ""Children have no idea of what’s going on. They think we are playing with them""

The centre is home not just to its young patients and their parents, but also to the staff who work there. Valentyna says they even found room for three ordinary families who couldn’t find a safe place to stay.

“We are OK as long as there are no power outages.” She says the area hasn’t been shelled with Grad rockets, so they’re staying strong.

But then her voice breaks. She’s starts crying and adds:",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60542877
