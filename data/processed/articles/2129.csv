Riding point for the formation was lethal-looking two-seater Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopters with distinctive double-rotors, side-mounted 30-millimeter cannons, and a dozen Ataka anti-tank guided missiles on stub wings.

But the Alligators were but the escort for the real strike force: Mi-8 ‚ÄòHip‚Äô assault transports carrying a more lethal cargo: up to 300 elite Russian airborne soldiers. Reportedly the paratroopers may have come from the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade.

The paratroopers, or desantniki, weren‚Äôt heading for Kyiv itself, but rather Antonov Airport ten miles northwest on the outskirts of the metropolis. Also known as Hostomel or Gostomel after the nearby town, Antonov Airport was operated by the former chief manufacturer of Soviet transport aircraft, and its 2.17 mile-long runway was used principally for cargo flights and aircraft testing.

The airport‚Äôs most famous resident was the world‚Äôs heaviest and widest cargo aircraft (in terms of wingspan) ever made: the only ever built Antonov An-225 Mriya (‚ÄúDream‚Äù), which has remained in demand to deliver oversized cargoes across the world on short notice, most recently shipment of Covid-treating medicines.

If the Russian assault went as planned, Antonov could be used to land thousands of additional airborne soldiers and their light armored vehicles by cargo plane, allowing Russian troops to begin tightening the noose around the Ukrainian capital even before Russian mechanized armies fought their way in.

Cell phone cameras recorded the helicopters‚Äô approach which evoked the famous aerial assault scene in the Vietnam war film Apocalypse Now.

Kyiv soon admitted the desantniki had seized control of an airport right on its doorstep.

But Russia‚Äôs ambitious airborne assault was a high-risk affair. It meant flying a bunch of helicopters in proximity to numerous short-range air defense systems‚Äîoften using heat-seeking missiles instead of radar guidance, and thus not disabled by Russian air defense suppression strikes targeting Ukrainian radars.

The other problem was that openly inserting a small infantry unit deep behind enemy lines‚Äîsay right next to the capital‚Äîis very risky, a move predicated on hopes that Ukrainian forces would be in such disarray they would be unable to mount a counter-attack.

So despite the overwhelming scale of Russia‚Äôs assault on Ukraine, the gambit for Antonov Airport did not go as planned.

Alligators in the Dnieper River

As Russian helicopters skimmed south along the Dnieper River dividing Kiev toward and Hostomel, they came under fire from small arms and man-portable surface-to-air missiles‚Äîlikely Soviet Strela or Iglas-S missiles and/or possibly Piorun and U.S.-built Stinger missiles recently transferred from Poland and Lithuania respectively. Short-range air defense vehicles with autocannons and their own short-range missiles may also have engaged.

Aware of their peril, helicopters pumped out scores of brilliant flares in the hopes of decoying heat-seeking missiles. But it did not prove enough. One of the Alligators was struck and fell into the Dnieper, smoke pouring upwards into the sky even after its immersion.

Both the helicopter‚Äôs crew members ejected‚Äîan unique capability of the Ka-52 found in a few other helicopters‚Äîlofted down into the water as well.

Another Alligator appears to have sustained so much damage it was forced to crash land. Footage of the empty cockpit implies both crew members escaped.

Ukrainian sources claim a third helicopter downed, though confirmation is unavailable, with some alleging a Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter made the kill.

Counterattack

Contrary to Russian hopes, Kyiv‚Äôs defenders were not so disorganized as to fail to assess both the small size of the paratrooper force and the danger an enemy airheadt next to the capital posed if let uncontested. Indeed, after 10 AM a Ukrainian told a journalist their intelligence reported eighteen Il-76MD troop transports bound towards Kyiv had taken off from Pskov, base of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division.

First, the 4th Rapid Response Brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard surrounded the airport. This was a new model unit organized according to NATO standards combining light infantry, a battalion of T-64BV main battle tanks, an artillery battery and supporting surveillance drones.

Lacking armored vehicles, the Russian airborne at Hostomel depended on air support to stave off Ukrainian attack. Russian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack jets were recorded flying in for strikes.

But Ukrainian warplanes‚Äîhaving remarkably escaped Russia‚Äôs first strike‚Äîpounded the airfield in return, with an image showing two of Ukraine‚Äôs swing-wing Su-24M ‚ÄòFencer‚Äô bombers swooping over the airfield and releasing a brace of bombs, as well as flares for self-defense.

Another video recorded from a civilian home near Hostomel shows a Ukrainian MiG-29 skimming over rooftops and launching what appear to be unguided S-8 rockets terrifyingly close to the recorder‚Äîreportedly targeting either withdrawing Russian airborne infantry, or a Russian helicopter per various sources.

Eventually, Ukrainian minister Oleksiy Arestovych claimed the airport had been secured by Ukrainian forces. But twenty minutes later he issued a partial retraction‚Äîa mopping up operation was still ongoing. When CNN‚Äôs Matthew Chance arrived at the airport gate he encountered Russian, not Ukrainian soldiers he was expecting.

Later that evening, the Russian airborne were allegedly driven from the airport, though the remaining elements continued skirmishing in the woods outside of it.

Some accounts claim Ukraine‚Äôs ‚Äò45th Spetsnaz Brigade‚Äô was responsible for the final assault, but this appears to refer only to a Russian, not Ukrainian, unit. Instead, at 10 PM local time, the 4th Brigade‚Äôs Facebook page posted an image of soldiers holding a seemingly bullet-riddled battle flag celebrating the victory.

On the same site, Antonov Airline‚Äôs chief pilot assured that the legendary An-225 remained undamaged, contrary to earlier reports claiming its hangar had caught fire.

Russia strikes back

Kyiv‚Äôs forces may have sought to render Hostomel inoperable by demolishing or obstructing its runway after the battle. That‚Äôs because Russian forces crossing the Ukraine-Belarus border had reportedly penetrated through the Exclusion Zone around Chernobyl and were rolling towards northwestern Kyiv.

Furthermore, a contingent of Spetsnaz special forces infiltrated into Kyiv wearing Ukrainian military uniforms‚Äîincidentally, a violation of Article 39 of the Geneva Convention‚Äîsprang into action, causing small arms fire to echo throughout the capital.

Videos recorded from high-rise apartments in the northern Obolon suburb show a Spetsnaz- gun truck riddled by fire from Ukrainian troops, while a hijacked Strela-10 (SA-8) tracked air defense vehicles races away‚Äîonly to run over a civilian car driving from the opposite direction. Remarkably the elderly man inside survived and was hospitalized for treatment.

Fighting meanwhile continued around Hostomel with remnants of the Russian airborne, who may have been reinforced by Spetsnaz or by Russian mechanized elements. Finally around 2 PM local time on February 25, Russia‚Äôs ministry of defense claimed it had recaptured Antonov Airport supposedly in an operation involving 200 helicopters, a number unlikely to be accurate.

Nonetheless, video footage does appear to show Russian paratroopers manning a checkpoint at Hostomel.

While Ukraine‚Äôs victory at Hostomel may have proved ephemeral, it indicated that Ukraine‚Äôs military is neither paralyzed nor evaporating in the face of Russia‚Äôs assault like Georgia‚Äôs did in the 2008 Russo-Georgia war.

However, Ukraine‚Äôs capacity to defeat an arguably ill-advised Russian operational gambit does not assure future success. Russia is attacking Ukraine on so many fronts it can afford to be stalled in some areas, such as around Kharkiv and Mariupol, as long as breakthrough are achieved elsewhere, as has occurred in southern Ukraine at Kherson and Melitopol.

As Russia has yet to commit all its forces, it will likely use Soviet ‚Äòechelon‚Äô style tactic wherein troops withheld from the first wave are channeled down the most promising avenues of attack, or into as yet untested sectors deemed vulnerable.

Still, the battle at Hostomel suggests Putin‚Äôs unprovoked invasion will meet stiffer resistance than he apparently expected.

While several major airports around Ukraine have reported shelling, a CNN reporter found Russian troops inside Hostomel Airport Thursday morning, Feb. 24. Hostomel is a small cargo field to the northwest of Kyiv that is also known as Antonov Airport, for the Antonov aircraft company based there.

A wide range of social media videos appeared to capture the attack in real time, with Russian Ka-52 and Ka-50 attack helicopters and Mi-17 troop transports seen swarming over Ukrainian heads. Several pass over identifiable landmarks in Kyiv.

One video emerged of what appears to be the crash of a Ka-52 or Ka-50 in a body of water said to be Vyshhorod, an estuary area just north of Kyiv, and about 10 miles from the Hostomel Airport. The video catches debris impacting into a wide body of water as a large hulk burns, and a parachutist descends behind it under an ejection-style parachute.

The simple, non-steerable parachute that lands near the crash appears to have survival equipment hung below it but no obvious weapons or combat gear, indicative of an ejection. The Russian Ka-52 and 50 models are both equipped with ejection seats, a rarity among helicopters. In the event of an ejection, the rotors above the pilot are blown off with explosive charges to clear a path.

Another video shows a large flight of what look like Mi-17s (or the similar Mi-8s) taking direct ground fire and deploying flares. The Mi-17 ‚Äî the design of which dates to the 1970s ‚Äî can carry about two dozen troops, roughly on par with the United States‚Äô CV-22 Osprey.

The Mi-17s appear to be passing over the curved breakwater of the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant, flying east. That path is on a direct line with Hostomel Airport.

Another widely shared video appears to show the remains of another Ka-52 after a forced landing with extensive battle damage and spent rocket tubes. The helicopter appears to be carrying laser-guided Vikhr air-to-ground missiles. An attached note claiming to have captured the pilot could not be confirmed.

Russian airborne troops seized control of the Gostomel airfield, but Ukraine's leader President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed that they would be encircled and crushed.

""The enemy paratroopers in Gostomel have been blocked, and troops have received an order to destroy them,"" Zelensky said, in a video address.

Earlier AFP reporters had seen helicopters flying low over the city from the north and Ukraine's commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhny, had confirmed: ""Fighting is underway for Gostomel airfield.""

The Gostomel airfield, which is alongside the Antonov airport, is immediately on the northern edge of Kiev, and the fighting there is the closest that Russian forces had got to the Ukrainian capital on the first day of their invasion.

Lyudmila Klimova, a 58-year-old who lives nearby, said: ""The base is smoking over there, it was bombed, our houses are nearby. We don't know where to run, my parents are here, my sister.

""Russian troops are there, a friend of mine lives there, and the Russians have already approached his mother with a machine gun.""

Alexander Kovtonenko, a 30-year-old civilian also living nearby, said that two fighter jets had fired missiles at Ukrainian ground units as the assault got underway.

""Then there was shooting, it lasted three hours,"" he told AFP. ""Then three more jets flew in and they started shooting again.""

Smoke was rising from the scene and social media images appeared to show an assault by helicopter-borne troops. CNN showed footage of Russian troops at the airport and a reporter said he had spoken to them.

When explosions first rang out across Ukraine around 5 a.m. local time on Thursday, residents scrambled for cover and headed for the country‚Äôs borders to flee to safety. Moscow had officially launched a series of attacks on the country, which Russian President Vladimir Putin had been foreshadowing.



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was under attack ‚Äúfrom the south, north, east and from the air.‚Äù Russian ground forces entered regions across the country, bombs fell on major cities, and cruise and ballistic missiles targeted military control centers in the area of the capital, Kyiv. On the second day of the advance, as the capital was rocked by explosions, residents and leaders braced for the city to be overrun.

By Thursday afternoon, Russian forces had taken control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant north of Kyiv where a 1986 reactor explosion caused the release of large amounts of radiation into the environment.

The invasion represents what could be the largest security threat to Europe since World War II. Ukrainian officials reported that more than 100 Ukrainian soldiers and Russian soldiers have died, along with at least several civilians. The Ukrainian government warned residents in Obolon, a district north of the capital, not to go outside early Friday.

The NATO Strategic AirLift International Solution (SALIS) is based at Hostomel too.

In the framework of the invasion carried out by Vladimir Putin‚Äôs government a confrontation between Russian and Ukrainian troops took place at Hostomel airport in the vicinity of Kiev.

According to The New York Times, at least a half dozen Russian helicopters were spotted flying west over the Dnieper river toward Hostomel, a town on the outskirts of the city. The helicopters also attacked Hostomel‚Äôs airport and at least one of those helicopters appears to have been shot down by Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces.

Hostomel is known as Antonov Airport as it was built by the aircraft manufacturer and is used as a test site.

As reported by Aviacionline.com, Hostomel is also home of the world‚Äôs largest and heaviest aircraft, the Antonov AN-225 Mriya. Various media outlets and social media accounts have reported that the massive cargo aircraft was destroyed when the hangar housing it caught fire.

But in the afternoon of Feb. 24, 2022, Dmitro Antonov, chief pilot of Antonov Airlines, owner of the AN-225, assured that the Mriya is intact with a post on his Facebook account.

‚ÄòDear friends. Everything fell into place. Great deception again. The Russian troops was near Kiev. Gostomel airport now under Russian airborne forces. Large planes big possibility will land tonight. From the positive Mriya is whole. We hold on and Glory to Ukoaine,‚Äô Antonov said.

The Antonov An-225 Mriya (Ukrainian: –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–≤ –ê–Ω-225 –ú—Ä—ñ—è, lit. ‚Äòdream‚Äô or ‚Äòinspiration‚Äô; NATO reporting name: Cossack) is a strategic airlift cargo aircraft that was designed by the Antonov Design Bureau in the Ukrainian SSR within the Soviet Union during the 1980s. It is powered by six turbofan engines and is the heaviest aircraft ever built. It also has the largest wingspan of any aircraft in operational service. The single example built has the Ukrainian civil registration UR-82060. A second airframe with a slightly different configuration was partially built. Its construction was halted in 1994 because of lack of funding and interest, but revived briefly in 2009, bringing it to 60‚Äì70% completion. On Aug. 30, 2016, Antonov agreed to complete the second airframe for Airspace Industry Corporation of China (not to be confused with the Aviation Industry Corporation of China) as a prelude to commencing series production.

The Antonov An-225 was an enlargement of the successful Antonov An-124 that was initially developed for transporting the Buran spaceplane. The only An-225 airplane was completed in 1988. After successfully fulfilling its Soviet military missions, it was mothballed for eight years. It was then refurbished and re-introduced, and is in commercial operation with Antonov Airlines carrying oversized payloads. The airlifter holds the absolute world records for an airlifted single-item payload of 189,980 kilograms (418,830 pounds), and an airlifted total payload of 253,820 kg (559,580 lb). It has also transported a payload of 247,000 kg (545,000 lb) on a commercial flight.

Moreover, the NATO Strategic AirLift International Solution (SALIS) is based at Hostomel too. SALIS is a programme created to provide unique air transport capability (outsized cargo) for its participating nations. Currently, a group of nine NATO Allies (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) are benefiting from the programme.

The programme is managed by the NATO Support Procurement Agency (NSPA) on behalf of the nine nations. In December 2018, NSPA signed a contract with the German-based company Antonov Logistics Salis to obtain assured access of up to five AN-124 aircraft within few days. In addition, the current contract also provides access to AN-22, AN-225 and IL-76 Chap IV aircraft.
