The minister is very active on Twitter and shares day to day regular updates on the current crisis which has affected the entire country. Foreign minister shares false allegations of Russians, slams Russians for their actions and also emphasizes security in the country. Politician signifies the fighting spirit through all his tweets.

Russian FM Lavrov spreads disinfo by falsely alleging Ukraine wants to restore its nuclear arsenal. Once again: This is a cynical, blatant lie by Russia who itself fires at nuclear facilities in Ukraine. Safe zones must be established around them to prevent disaster in Europe. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 4, 2022

Took part in the extraordinary meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers. My message: act now before it’s too late. Don’t let Putin turn Ukraine into Syria. We are ready to fight. We will continue fighting. But we need partners to help us with concrete, resolute and swift actions, now. pic.twitter.com/s4FCaAOjNy — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 4, 2022

Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out. If it blows up, it will be 10 times larger than Chornobyl! Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone! — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 4, 2022

When Russians can’t achieve real goals, they focus on fake TV coverage. Having seized a TV tower in Kherson, they plan a show: Russian troops provide humanitarian aid while fake ‘locals’ brought in from Crimea stage a fake ‘demo’ in favor of Kherson region ‘uniting’ with Crimea. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 3, 2022

Call with DPM and FM of Qatar @MBA_AlThani_. Grateful to Qatar for cosponsoring UNGA resolution ‘Russian aggression against Ukraine’ and providing Ukraine with humanitarian assistance. We discussed global efforts to elevate political and economic pressure on Russia. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 3, 2022

Our aces heroically defend our skies. But Russia has advantage. Dear partners who still have not provided Ukraine with military aircraft: how can you sleep when Ukrainian children are under bombs in Mariupol, Kherson, Kharkiv, other cities? You can take this decision now. Do it! — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 3, 2022

Another Russian hallucination by SVR head Sergey Naryshkin. He claims that Ukraine has been working on creating nuclear weapons with U.S. knowing about it and being ready to assist. I once again refute this sick fake. Ukraine has always been and remains a responsible NPT member. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba) March 3, 2022

Polish people, you are passing the test of history.



Your ancestors will tell the tale of your generosity for centuries to come.
