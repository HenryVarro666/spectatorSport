Russians Seize Europe’s Largest Nuclear Plant [16:45]

Europe’s largest nuclear power plant has fallen into Russian hands. A fire that began during intense fighting over the plant was extinguished, and there are no immediate signs that any radiation has leaked.

“This is an unprecedented situation,” IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said at a press conference on the morning of March 4. “Unfortunately, here we are in completely uncharted waters.”https://t.co/dF7YFnmIKY — The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent) March 4, 2022

JP Morgan: Russia’s GDP to slump to 1998 lows [16:15]

Russia is heading towards financial collapse. Following Western sanctions imposed on the country following its invasion of Ukraine, economists forecast that Russia’s GDP will drop between 7-9%.

This will surpass the recession experienced during Russia’s debt crisis in 1998.

Western sanctions, including the SWIFT cut-off, trade sanctions, asset freezes, and individual sanctions have severely hurt the Russian economy.

American financial publication Bloomberg has described Russia’s economic downturn as a “deep dive” with its recession threatening to surpass levels witnessed during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008.

Economist Tim Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, told Bloomberg that he expects to see inflation comparable to the “extreme scenarios” witnessed post 1998 in Russia. Back then, Russian inflation reached a 84%, destroying the rouble, causing Russia to default on its debt.

Major Ukrainian supermarkets boycott Coca-Cola over refusal to leave Russian market [15:35]

Some of Ukraine’s largest supermarket group FOZZY, which owns the supermarket chains Silpo, Fora, Cash & Carry, and others have stopped stocking Coca-Cola products in protest of the company’s refusal to leave the Russian market.

All Coca-Cola products (Coca-Cola, Fanta, Schweppes, Sprite, BonAqua, Rich, and others) will be pulled from shelves.

In a post on the supermarket group’s Facebook page, it stated that Coca-Cola had decided to “continue working in Russia despite the military invasion of Ukraine.”

Major Western companies are leaving the Russian market in solidarity with Ukraine. Companies are also withdrawing due to the economic sanctions which have economically isolated the country.

Zelensky reportedly survives three assassination [15:20]

According to British newspaper The Times, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy has survived at least three attempts on his life in the past week.

The British newspaper claims that members of both the Chechen special forces and Kremlin-backed mercenary group Wagner group attempted to intercept and kill the Ukrainian president.

Ukrainian Secretary of National Security and Defence Oleksiy Danilov was reported to have told local TV stations that the attacks were foiled by anti-war elements of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).

Zelensky allegedly narrowly avoided an assassination attempt on Saturday when Chechen assassins were killed on the outskirts of Kyiv before they could reach the President.

NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg warns of hard days ahead for Ukraine [15:09]

During a press conference following a meeting of NATO Foreign Minister on 4 March, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that the next few days in Ukraine would be worse those prior.

“The days to come are likely to be worse,” Stoltenberg stated. “With more death, more suffering, more destruction, as the Russian armed forces bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across the country,”

A 64-kilometre-long convoy of Russian heavy equipment is slowly on route towards Ukraine’s capital Kyiv. Ukrainian forces are bracing for a frontal assault on the city, with many Kyiv residents using the lull in fighting to evacuate the city.

Other major Ukrainian cities are suffering heavy bombardment by Russian artillery and cruise missile systems.

NATO refuses to establish no-fly zone over Ukraine [15:00]

NATO has rejected Ukrainian demands for a no-fly zone over Ukraine today, stating that stepping in directly would lead to an even larger conflict.

“We are not part of this conflict, and we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told journalists.

Ukraine has called for the West to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict. Russian aerial superiority has hounded Ukrainian efforts to defend key cities.

“We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that (a no-fly zone) we would end up with something that could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe involving much more countries and much more suffering,” Stoltenberg reaffirmed.

A NATO no-fly zone would pit the alliance directly against Russian fighters, potentially escalating the conflict.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that if NATO is unwilling to establish a no-fly zone, then it should provide Ukraine with additional war planes.

Army of 400,000 IT specialists working to protect Ukrainian cyber security [14:25]

On Friday, Ukraine Online’s State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection said during a briefing on cyber security that an independent “IT Army” of 400,000 specialists globally are working to fight back against Russian cyberattacks and protect Ukraine’s cyber security.

State Service of Special Communications Deputy Chair Viktor Zhora said Ukraine itself has at least up to 250,000 IT specialists, in addition to huge numbers that are working from abroad, including IT students.

“We have several hundred thousand students who are learning cyber security that joined this voluntary movement,” he said.

He added that for the first time, Russia is facing cyberattacks, mainly targetting government services, the media, which he said is “constantly lying to Russian citizens” about why “Ukrainians should be extinct,” as well as payment and transport services, which help in the escalation and the continued deaths of innocents people.

Zhora added the “IT Army” is doing everything to protect Ukraine in cyberspace. “All means will be used for this,” he said.

With regards to cyber threats on nuclear power plants, in light of the attacks on Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station, he said they are well protected in Ukraine and are completely safe from cyber attacks.

“However, there are still risks of physical attacks which in my opinion are much more serious,” he said, adding that he believes a cyberwar can be ended by the ending of conventional war and that Ukraine will do everything possible to do so.

Zhora added that so far, 10,000 Russian soldiers have been killed already. ” But Russia doesn’t know about it yet,” he said. He reiterated that all acts of aggression should be stopped.

Belgium’s Centre for Cybersecurity published information on the recently launched government website on the Ukraine situation regarding the cyber threat to the country, saying “for the time being, there is no objective evidence of a concrete cyber threat to our country,” but added that consequences for Belgian organisations can never be excluded.

UNESCO calls on Russia to respect Ukraine’s cultural heritage, stop attacks on civilians [09:06]

In a statement released to the press, UNESCO has called on Russia to protect Ukraine’s seven World Heritage sites and stop its attacks on residential areas.

The U.N’s cultural agency is currently working to assess the damage done to cultural sites across the region.

Ukraine’s capital city Kyiv is homed to World Heritage site St. Sophia’s Cathedral, famous for its striking gold domes.

Europe’s largest nuclear power plant seized by Russia [09:06]

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station has been seized by Russian troops after it caught fire following fierce fighting to capture the plant. The fire that broke out during the fight was extinguished during the night without any casualties. However, the plant is now under Russian control.

The Ukrainian regional authority confirmed in a Facebook post that Russian forces captured the plant, which provides more than one-fifth of the total electricity generated in Ukraine, and added that the condition of power units was being monitored to ensure they could operate safely.

At the time of fighting, the spokesperson for the nuclear power plant, Andriy Tuz, warned of a “real threat of nuclear danger.”

In a video on social media, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy referred to the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, and said Russia “wants to relive it… I address all Ukrainians, all Europeans, everyone who knows the word ‘Chernobyl,’ everyone who knows how many victims that explosion brought.”

In footage captured live from the official video live stream from the plant, Russian troops could be seen engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian defenders. Other world leaders condemned Russia for its reckless move.

Ukraine, Russia agree on humanitarian corridors [08:20]

Following the second round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, it was agreed that humanitarian corridors would be created, the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, told Russian media. However, Ukraine said talks didn’t deliver the needed results.

“We have thoroughly discussed three points – military, international and humanitarian needs,” Medinsky said, adding that the primary matter to resolve was how to rescue civilians who found themselves in a military clash zone. The humanitarian corridor will help provide a safe escape for civilians who are evacuating areas where fighting is ongoing.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had appealed to Nato to declare a no-fly zone over his country, which Russian forces invaded by land, sea and air on 24 February.

""We are not part of this conflict,"" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in denying Ukraine's request.

""We have a responsibility as Nato allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering,"" he said following a Nato meeting in Brussels.

Ukraine, an ex-Soviet republic, wants to join the European Union and Nato, moves that Moscow sees as threatening its security and influence. Russian forces have shelled residential areas and civilian infrastructure since unleashing their assault, as well as capturing two nuclear sites.

While the West condemned Putin, members of the 30-strong Nato, bound to defend each other in case of attack, are wary of getting into a war with nuclear-armed Russia. The EU threatened more sanctions but it was not clear what ammunition it had left.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the alliance would defend ""every inch"" of Nato territory from attack. ""Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us, we are ready,"" he said.

But the alliance - in which the US, Britain and France are also nuclear powers - dashed Ukraine's hopes of immediate help Kyiv says could turn the tables in the war.

""We should not have Nato planes operating over Ukrainian airspace or Nato troops operating in Ukrainian territory,"" Stoltenberg said.

More deaths, more sanctions

Support for Ukraine so far has come in the form of the heaviest international sanctions on Russia to date, as well as arms supplies from Nato states.

In a day of intense diplomacy - if no obvious immediate results - the G7 countries said they would hold to account those responsible for war crimes and would not recognise any Russian territorial gains.

EU countries said more financial punishment was coming, after the bloc already cut several Russian lenders from the SWIFT banking system, curbed trade with Moscow and targeted some of the wealth held by Russian oligarchs in the West.

EU was looking at curbing Russia's access to the International Monetary Fund, officials said.

""It's Putin's war, and only Putin can end it,"" top EU diplomat Josep Borrell, said. ""If someone expects that sanctions can stop the war tomorrow, they don't know what they're talking about.""

Ukraine called on the West to freeze out all Russian banks. But it was not clear when and what more sanctions the EU could agree, given its reliance on Russian energy supplies, which think-tank Eurointelligence said amount to $700 million daily.

Ireland said a fourth round could affect more Russian banks, bar Russian ships from European ports and cut imports like steel, timber, aluminium or coal.

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Nato on Friday: ""Act now before it's too late,"" Kuleba said.

But Stoltenberg said the worst was yet to come as Russia was rolling out more heavy arms.

""The days to come are likely to be worse, with more deaths, more suffering and more destruction,"" he said.

Jens Stoltenberg expects “the days to come are likely to be worse with more death, more suffering, and more destruction, as the Russian armed force bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across the country. ”

NATO Secretary General stressed the Alliance is not part of this conflict and “we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine because that would be even more devastating and more dangerous with even more human suffering.”

“NATO is not seeking a war with Russia. The Kremlin’s ambition is to recreate a sphere of influence.

And deny other countries the right to choose their own path. So ministers discussed the need to support partners who may be at risk, including Georgia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ministers agreed that NATO’s relationship with Russia has fundamentally changed for the long term but we remain committed to keeping channels for diplomacy and de-confliction open to avoid any unintended escalation, misunderstanding, or miscalculation.

The Russian defence ministry said in a statement carried by the RIA Novosti and Tass agencies it has agreed on evacuation routes with Ukrainian forces to allow civilians to leave the strategic port of Mariupol in the south-east and the eastern town of Volnovakha.

The vaguely worded statement did not make clear how long the routes would remain open.

Mariupol had become the scene of growing misery amid days of shelling that knocked out power and most phone service, and raised the prospect of food and water shortages for hundreds of thousands of people in freezing weather. Pharmacies are out of medicine, Doctors Without Borders said.

A top official there said the ceasefire there was to last until 4pm (2pm GMT) and an evacuation was beginning at 11am (9am GMT).

Pavlo Kirilenko, head of the Donetsk military-civil administration that includes Mariupol, said the humanitarian corridor would extend from the city to Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles away.

Mariupol deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov later told the BBC that the Russians “continue to use hard artillery and rockets to bomb Mariupol. That’s why people are very scared, but anyway they go to three specific points from which we will go to evacuate them by municipal buses”.

The head of Ukraine’s security council, Oleksiy Danilov, had called on Russia to create humanitarian corridors to allow children, women and the elderly to escape the fighting, calling such corridors “question number 1”.

Diplomatic efforts continued as US secretary of state Antony Blinken arrived in Poland to meet with the prime minister and foreign minister, a day after attending a Nato meeting in Brussels in which the alliance pledged to step up support for eastern flank members.

Mr Blinken was due to visit a border post to meet refugees later in the day.

As Russian forces batter strategic locations, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has lashed out at Nato for refusing to impose a no-fly zone over his country, warning that “all the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you”.

Nato says a no-fly zone could provoke widespread war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia.

But as the United States and other Nato members send weapons for Kyiv and more than one million refugees spill through the continent, the conflict is already drawing in countries far beyond Ukraine’s borders.

Russia continues to crack down on independent media reporting on the war, also blocking Facebook and Twitter, and more outlets say they are pausing their work inside the country.

And in a warning of a hunger crisis yet to come, the UN World Food Programme says millions of people inside Ukraine, a major global wheat supplier, will need food aid “immediately”.

Ukraine’s leader is set to brief US senators on Saturday on a video conference call as US congress considers a request for 10 billion dollars (£7.5 billion) in emergency funding for humanitarian aid and security needs.

In a bitter and emotional speech late on Friday, Mr Zelensky criticized Nato over the lack of a no-fly zone, saying it will fully untie Russia’s hands as it escalates its air attack.

“The alliance has given the green light to the bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages,” he said, warning that “the history of Europe will remember this forever”.

Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had earlier ruled out the possibility of a no-fly zone, saying Nato planes would have to shoot down Russian aircraft.

In a separate video message to anti-war protesters in several European cities, Mr Zelensky continued to appeal for help. “If we fall, you will fall,” he said.

The UN Security Council will hold an open meeting Monday on the worsening humanitarian situation.

The UN estimates that 12 million people in Ukraine and four million fleeing to neighbouring countries in the coming months will need humanitarian aid.

While the vast Russian armoured column threatening Ukraine’s capital remained stalled outside Kyiv, Mr Putin’s military has launched hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites across the country.

Russian forces did not make significant progress on Friday in their offensive to sever Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, which would deal a severe blow to its economy.

There were also no changes in the north and the east, where the Russian offensive has stalled, meeting fierce Ukrainian resistance.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich said battles involving airstrikes and artillery continued north-west of Kyiv, and the north-eastern cities of Kharkiv and Okhtyrka came under heavy fire.

He said Ukrainian forces were still holding the northern city of Chernihiv and the southern city of Mykolaiv.

Ukrainian artillery also defended Ukraine’s biggest port city, Odesa, from repeated attempts by Russian ships, he said.

More than 840 children have been wounded in the war, and 28 have been killed, according to Ukraine’s government.

A total of 331 civilians had been confirmed killed but the true number is probably much higher, the UN human rights office said.

Kyiv’s central train station is still crowded with people desperate to flee the capital.
