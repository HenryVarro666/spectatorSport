The Pentagon has been providing daily updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Ukraine's efforts to resist.

Here are highlights of what a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Monday on Day 40:

Nearly 70% of Russian troops near Kyiv have withdrawn

About two-thirds of the Russian forces that were arrayed against Kyiv have withdrawn toward Belarus, according to the official. This is up from an estimated 20% late last week.

Before repositioning, there were close to 20 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) bearing down on Kyiv from the north and northwest, with each group comprised of 700-900 troops. Roughly 13 of those BTGs are now either in Belarus or on their way there, the official said.

The Pentagon believes these forces will be resupplied and possibly reinforced in the north before heading back into Ukraine to fight elsewhere.

""Our best assessment -- and it is only an assessment -- is that they will be applied in the eastern part of the country in the Donbas region,"" the official said.

During a briefing Monday afternoon, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Ukrainian troops are pursuing the Russians as they retreat.

""As they're moving out, Ukrainians are attacking them,"" Kirby said. ""And I'm not a military strategist or a historian, but my understanding of a retreat is that you're moving back as you're getting pushed back, and that's what's happening. So I think that's a very accurate description of what's going on.""

The U.S. has also seen some Russian troops leave the Ukrainian city of Sumy to head north to the Russian border, according to the official.

Despite these movements, the official said the ""vast majority"" of the more than 125 BTGs that Russia committed to the invasion are still inside Ukraine.

'Sickening' Russian atrocities in Bucha

The official said that while the U.S. cannot independently verify Ukrainian claims of Russian atrocities committed against civilians in Bucha, a suburb northwest of Kyiv recently retaken by Ukrainian troops, there is no reason to doubt them.

""It's sickening, it's disgusting,"" the official said, adding that the claims should be included in the growing list of alleged Russian war crimes to be investigated.

On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the town, where he accused Russia of genocide. Ukrainian officials have said more than 400 civilians were found dead there, many with hands tied behind their backs, shot at close range.

""We have long said that the Russians would be brutal in their execution of this war. They have been,"" the senior U.S. defense official said. ""We said more than a week ago that we clearly believe the evidence pointed to war crimes by Russian forces. And what we're seeing out of Bucha certainly reinforces those concerns.""

Kirby went a step further his briefing.

""It's fairly obvious not just to us but to the world that Russian forces are responsible for the atrocities and Bucha,"" he said. ""Now exactly who, what units, whether they're contractors or Chechens, I don't think we're able to say right now.""

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ""expressed outrage at the apparent atrocities that were committed by Russian forces in Bucha"" on a call with his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov, according to Kirby. Austin also committed to using ""every tool available"" to help document and share information to help hold responsible parties to account.

President Joe Biden put blame on directly on Russian President Vladimir Putin while speaking to reporters Monday.

""You may remember I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal,"" Biden said. ""Well, the truth of the matter, you saw what happened in Bucha ... he is a war criminal.""

Russia shifting airstrikes

In addition to moving some of its troops away from the capital, Russia has also refocused its long-range strikes elsewhere, largely in the eastern and southern parts of the country, the official said.

""Clearly they're still hitting Mariupol, but we have not seen the same level of airstrike activity on Kyiv,"" the official said. ""So there's been a declination there over the last few days.""

Russia has fired more than 1,400 missiles against Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion.

Military aid being rushed into Ukraine

The U.S. has continued to rush small arms, anti-tank and aircraft missiles and medical supplies into Ukraine, and has coordinated shipments from a half dozen other donor nations in the last 24 hours, according to the senior defense official.

""Everything we're doing with respect to Ukraine is being expedited -- everything,"" the official said.",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sickening-atrocities-bucha-70-russian-troops-kyiv-withdrawn/story?id=83866706
1,ec710ef5-28b9-4497-b887-836053fa5dee,[],2022-04-04 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. military is not in a position to independently confirm Ukrainian accounts of atrocities by Russian forces against civilians in the town of Bucha, but has no reason to dispute the accounts either, a senior U.S. defense official said on Monday.

""We're seeing the same imagery that you are. We have no reason whatsoever to refute the Ukrainian claims about these atrocities -- clearly, deeply, deeply troubling,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

""The Pentagon can't independently and single handedly confirm that, but we're also not in any position to refute those claims.""

The Kremlin has denied accusations related to the murder of civilians in the town.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official called the atrocities “clearly, deeply, deeply troubling.”

“We certainly believe that that warrants further investigation. It’s sickening; it’s disgusting. And, and we certainly believe... that should be added to the allegations of war crimes and investigated,” the official added.

While Russia has denied these accusations, images shared over the weekend showed corpses of civilians thrown around the streets of Bucha. Russia withdrew from the town after controlling it since it first invaded Ukraine last month.

Russian forces withdrawing from around Kyiv

The same official also said that the US believed Russian forces were repositioning about “two-thirds of its forces from around Kyiv.” Those withdrawing are “consolidating’ in Belarus, the official said.

Last week, the Pentagon assessed that Russia was turning its focus to the Donbas after failing to capture Kyiv and overthrow the Ukrainian government.

On Monday, the senior defense official reiterated the belief that the forces repositioning from around Kyiv were likely to head to the east of Ukraine.

""We still assess that the vast, vast majority of the more than 125 battalion tactical groups that the Russians invested in this invasion are still in Ukraine,"" the official said.

Spurred by reports of Russian atrocities outside Ukraine’s capital, and alarmed at signs that Russia’s invasion force is about to escalate assaults in eastern Ukraine, many civilians in that region are fleeing while they can, officials said Wednesday.

“The cities of the Luhansk region are in ruins,” warned one eastern governor. “Thousands of residents have not yet left. Get out of the way!”

The exodus accelerated as Western nations moved to provide more weapons to Ukraine’s military and further ostracize Russia economically with new sanctions, including restrictions on its leading banks and on the assets of President Vladimir V. Putin’s children.

The new sanctions are a response to outrage and revulsion over the atrocities, including executions and torture, that appear to have been carried out by Russian forces before they retreated from areas outside Kyiv in the past few weeks. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the atrocities were fabricated or were committed by the Ukrainians themselves.

The European Union also was weighing a ban on coal from Russia, the leading provider of fossil-fuel energy to Europe, and Russia appeared to move closer to default on its foreign debt because of U.S. currency restrictions.

“Together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” said President Biden, who has described Mr. Putin as a war criminal and suggested he should not remain in power.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — roughly one in four — have fled their homes since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the United Nations, including more than four million who have fled the country. It is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The Russian military announced last week that it would focus its campaign on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. The redeployment came as the Russians, hampered by botched planning and fierce Ukrainian military resistance, retreated from the Kyiv area and apparently abandoned — at least for now — any effort to capture the capital in their war to subjugate the former Soviet republic.

Western military analysts have said the Russians vastly underestimated the challenges in Ukraine and that their initial invasion force of more than 150,000 has been weakened by losses, exhaustion and low morale. But that does not mean Russia’s military cannot undertake a powerful new assault in eastern Ukraine.

The shift has accelerated civilian displacement in the east. Thousands of people have been leaving, according to Ukrainian officials, and photos and videos posted online. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have been massing in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.

In Kramatorsk, a city in the north of the Donetsk region, photos showed crowds of people huddled at a platform in a central train station.

At least two people were killed and five injured when Russian forces launched a strike on a humanitarian aid site in the town of Vugledar in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk governor.

Russian forces now control 60 percent of the town of Rubizhne, in the Luhansk region, according to the governor there, Serhiy Haidai, who said the attackers had scaled up their offensive this week.

“Evacuations are taking place under the roar of enemy guns,” Mr. Haidai wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that approximately 30,000 people had left the region since Russia invaded. He urged remaining residents to flee before Russia scaled up attacks.

Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the Kharkiv military region, said Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the army would evacuate two towns in the eastern part of the country because fighting was escalating there.

The towns, Lozova and Barvinkove, are southwest of Izium, a city Russian forces seized as part of an apparent drive toward Sloviansk, which military analysts say is strategically critical to Russia’s plan to gain full control of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, speaking on national television, said “large groupings of Russian troops” had been massing in the region.

“They are not going to stop,” he said. “They have a great desire to create big problems for our armed forces in this direction, and we also expect that fierce battles will be fought there for our territory in the near future.”

The Pentagon’s assessment of Russian deployments appeared to corroborate what Ukrainian officials were saying. Pentagon officials said Russia had withdrawn all of its troops arrayed against Kyiv and another city in the north, Chernihiv, and sent them back to Russia or to its ally Belarus to rearm, resupply and possibly redeploy in eastern Ukraine.

The Pentagon officials said those forces included as many as 40,000 troops that, in many cases, had departed under fierce attack from the Ukrainian military units that retook the territory.

“We believe they are all out,” one senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational issues.

Russia now has about 30 battalion tactical groups — as many as 30,000 troops — in the east, the senior Pentagon official said. Earlier this week, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said Russia would most likely send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east” in the coming weeks.

Largely in anticipation of this next major phase of the war, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been used with high success in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.

NATO foreign ministers, meeting this week, have been discussing how to further help Ukraine prosecute the war without entangling the alliance in direct combat with Russian forces.

The war, they said, is far from over, noting that however badly Russia’s forces have performed, and their retreat from areas around Kyiv notwithstanding, they are making slow and brutal progress in the east.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general.

Ukrainian officials in a number of areas, including Mykolayiv in the south and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, have been sharing schedules of planned evacuations or links to online portals for people to sign up to join buses and trains that are transporting residents to safer places.

But in some besieged cities in the south, like Mariupol, it is already nearly impossible to leave, making evacuations sporadic and risky.

Attempts by the Red Cross to enter Mariupol to supervise civilian departures have repeatedly been scrubbed, leaving fearful residents to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, 500 people who had escaped Mariupol to join a Red Cross convoy in the nearby city of Berdyansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 100 miles away.

The climate of fear gripping Mariupol has spread to the region of Kherson, near the Black Sea, where people have lived under occupation by Russian forces since they encircled and entered the city and its suburbs on March 2.

“Anyone who did not leave early is now stuck here,” said Evgeniya Selivantseva, a doctor from Velyka Lepetyka, a village on the Dnipro River, in the Kherson region.

Dr. Selivantseva, 38, described a deepening humanitarian crisis in the village: Gasoline stations have run out of fuel, and food and medical supplies are running low. Food is so scarce that local leaders have started a makeshift flour mill.

“We feel helpless and totally defenseless,” she said. “People are afraid to leave their homes.”

The proposed European Union ban on Russian coal, part of the bloc’s effort to further penalize Russia over atrocities in Ukraine, reflected a choice of an imported energy source that would be the easiest to replace.

Deliberations over the ban and other sanctions were set to continue into Thursday, and European Union officials and diplomats anticipated that the measures would be approved. The process reflected the challenges of reaching agreement among all 27 member nations on the penalties, which would also include banning Russian ships from E.U. ports.

If approved, the sanctions would be the harshest enforced by the bloc since the invasion.

Though the European Union depends on Russian coal, the bloc could find substitute imports more easily than for natural gas and oil.

But banning coal from Russia could send energy prices soaring for European consumers, given the existing shortages in the bloc, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Carlos Torres Diaz, a senior vice president at Rystad, called the potential sanctions “a double-edged sword.”

But the chances that Russian officials, including Vladimir Putin, will ever face charges at trial are, for now, very slim.

There is no international tribunal set up to prosecute war crimes committed in Ukraine. The establishment of such a court would likely require approval by the United Nations Security Council, where Russia has veto power.

War crime cases can be brought before the I.C.C. in The Hague, but successful prosecution would be challenging, experts say. Russia also withdrew from the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the I.C.C., which means it would not cooperate with the court. (The U.S. is also not a treaty member.)

Still, the U.N. has set up a commission of inquiry to gather evidence of war crime allegations that could be used by a court to prosecute those responsible.

In the meantime, the atrocities in Bucha are likely to complicate negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.

“Now exactly who, what units, whether they’re contractors or Chechens. I don’t think we’re able to say right now,”

Moscow faced global revulsion and accusations of war crimes Monday after the Russian pullout from Bucha revealed streets strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians, some of whom had seemingly been killed at close range.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the scenes outside Kyiv as a “stage-managed anti-Russian provocation.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the images contained “signs of video forgery and various fakes.”

Russia has similarly rejected previous allegations of atrocities as fabrications on Ukraine’s part.

Ukrainian officials said the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv that were recaptured from Russian forces in recent days.

Russia withdrew many of its forces from the capital area in recent days after being thwarted in its bid to swiftly capture Kyiv.

It has instead poured troops and mercenaries into the country’s east in a stepped-up bid to gain control of the Donbas, the largely Russian-speaking industrial region that includes Mariupol, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting and worst suffering of the war.

In Bucha, Ukraine, Russia is accused of carrying out war crimes against civilians. The United Nations has said an independent investigation is needed to ensure accountability.

SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

That grim reality of what has happened in Kyiv's suburbs, particularly in Bucha, weighs heavily on the city just as it weighs heavily on people around the world. NPR's Nathan Rott was in Bucha today, and he joins us now to tell us what he saw. We should warn listeners a lot of what we are about to discuss will be very disturbing. Hey, Nate.

NATE ROTT, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.

DETROW: And, Nate, remind us why just about every Western leader is talking so much about Bucha this week.

ROTT: Yeah. So Bucha is this place that was recently left by Russian forces. And it's a place that, you know, some of the most horrifying accounts of the war are coming from - dead civilians lining streets next to bikes or with spilled groceries, deceased men who appear to have their hands tied. It's those images that are raising the most serious questions about war crimes to this point in the conflict. And it's those images that are causing the United Nations Security Council to meet today.

DETROW: You were there today. Tell us what you saw.

ROTT: Yeah. So I went on a press tour arranged by Ukrainian officials. It was a very large group of journalists, well over 100, who were all being escorted by police into this area that's still being swept for mines. One of the places we stopped is one that you've probably seen if you've been looking at the images from Bucha. It's a narrow residential street that's clogged with destroyed and burnt military vehicles.

(SOUNDBITE OF ASHES CRUNCHING)

ROTT: The street is littered with bullet casings, torn camouflage jackets and craters from artillery rounds. In places, there's so much ash on the ground, it actually feels like you're walking on black sand.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING)

ROTT: A small, dark dog barks beside its owner, his home destroyed. All of the homes on the street have been damaged. Volodymyr Avramov's is one of the worst.

VOLODYMYR AVRAMOV: (Through interpreter) A fire broke out. I started extinguishing the fire. I tried to. You can see right there.

ROTT: Our translator, Luka, points to a burnt fire extinguisher as we walk through the rubble, making our way to the back of what's left of Avramov's house. He says Russian troops threw a grenade in his window the first night they came and yelled to come out of the house.

AVRAMOV: (Non-English language spoken).

ROTT: They said, hands - show your hands.

AVRAMOV: (Non-English language spoken).

ROTT: So he, his daughter and her husband walked out, hands in the air. The Russians started asking, who are you? Where are the Nazis?

AVRAMOV: (Non-English language spoken).

ROTT: And he said, there are no Nazis here. The Russian troops took Oleg, Avramov's son-in-law, to the road, he says.

AVRAMOV: (Non-English language spoken).

ROTT: And they shot him in the head. He says he took his daughter as bullets were flying. They went to a neighbor's house and hid there. They'd stay there for the next month, wearing the same clothes Avramov was wearing as we talked to him. His son-in-law's body laid there, he says, the entire time.

AVRAMOV: (Non-English language spoken).

ROTT: ""I don't know how I held on,"" he says. ""The explosions, living in a basement - I was ready,"" he says, ""to walk out and just get killed."" Avramov is one of many residents in Bucha trying to figure out what to do next. Officials are telling residents not to return. The area is still not safe. Police and military are sweeping neighborhoods block by block, looking for mines, unexploded ordnance and bodies. And sadly, they're finding all of the above. At a rural subdivision in Bucha near a brightly colored playground, Ukrainian police gather journalists in front of a house.

They're moving badly burned bodies to bags.

(SOUNDBITE OF BODY BAG ZIPPING)

ROTT: Six bodies were found here the night before, says police spokesman Dmytro Andriv - four women, two men. Here's Andriv's translator.

DMYTRO ANDRIV: (Through interpreter) They was shot by gun fires and then somebody trying to hide this crime and to burn these bodies.

ROTT: Ukraine's prosecutor general is examining the bodies that are being discovered here, looking for evidence of possible war crimes.

DETROW: That was Nate Rott reporting in Bucha. And, Nate, we should be clear that what we've just heard are allegations of war crimes, but they are allegations that have not yet been fully investigated.

ROTT: Yeah, that's right. The only investigation that's going on right now, to our knowledge, is by Ukrainian authorities and journalists. The United Nations has said an independent investigation is needed to ensure accountability, but that doesn't seem to have been initiated yet.

DETROW: Nate Rott from NPR. Thank you for reporting on such a difficult story.

ROTT: Yeah. Thank you, Scott. I appreciate you.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.
