Russian forces secured limited advances east of Kyiv and north from Crimea on March 12 but continue to face logistical challenges, mounting casualties, and sustained Ukrainian counterattacks. Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations northwest of Kyiv in the past 24 hours. Russian forces made limited advances around Chernihiv and toward Kyiv’s eastern outskirts after pausing for several days. Continued Ukrainian counterattacks and successful operations by Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Forces continue to threaten Russia’s long line of communication in northeastern Ukraine. Russian forces captured unspecified “eastern outskirts” of Mariupol on March 12 and continue to shell the city in a likely effort to force it to capitulate.

Key Takeaways

Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations northwest of Kyiv for the second day in a row.

Russian forces resumed limited attacks toward northeastern Kyiv and renewed efforts to fully encircle Chernihiv.

Ongoing Ukrainian counterattacks in northeastern Ukraine are likely forcing Russia to redeploy forces away from offensive operations toward Kyiv to consolidate its long line of communication.

Russian forces made limited territorial gains in eastern Mariupol and continued to shell the city.

The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces conducted a new advance northeast from Kherson along the western bank of the Dnipro.

The Ukrainian military claimed to have damaged or destroyed 31 Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) as of March 11.

The Kremlin likely seeks to deter continuing Western military aid shipments to Ukraine, threatening that Russia will view Western military aid shipments to Ukraine as legitimate military targets on March 12.

The Ukrainian military claimed to have damaged or destroyed 31 Russian BTGs as of March 11, its first numbered claim of damage to Russian forces of the war. Ukrainian military intelligence reported at 6:00 am local time on March 12 that Ukrainian forces have destroyed 13 Russian BTGs and rendered 18 BTGs combat ineffective as of March 11.[1] US intelligence estimated Russia deployed approximately 120 BTGs to Ukraine’s borders prior to February 24.[2] The Ukrainian military has not previously made any official statements on numbers of destroyed Russian BTGs. The Ukrainian General Staff continues to report widespread Russian logistics and morale issues, stating on March 12 that Russia “was forced to change tactics” due to unsuccessful attempts to conduct an offensive, that Russian units continue to abandon equipment, and that the rate of Russian desertions and surrenders to Ukrainian forces is increasing.[3] The General Staff additionally stated that Russia is calling up conscripts from the DNR and LNR, mercenaries from Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and Russian convicted prisoners to offset heavy combat losses and reserve problems.[4] The Ukrainian Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) reported on March 12 that Russian commanders authorized their soldiers to loot civilian businesses and households and move to ”self sufficiency” to offset continued supply problems.[5]

Ukraine updated its previous report that Russian aircraft bombed the Belarusian town of Kopani on March 11 in a likely false-flag attack, adding that Russian aircraft also bombed Bukhlichi and Verkhny Terebezh.[6] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian and Belarusian forces have not conducted any military operations toward western Ukraine but that Minsk is “taking measures to strengthen the protection of the border with Ukraine” and Ukraine cannot rule out Belarus entering the war.[7]

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov claimed that Russia will view Western military aid shipments to Ukraine as legitimate military targets on March 12.[8] Ryabkov claimed Russia previously warned the United States that ”pumping Ukraine with weapons” is dangerous and makes the arms shipments military targets. Ryabkov reiterated Kremlin claims that the United States provoked the war in Ukraine by supplying Ukraine with weapons. The Kremlin likely seeks to deter continuing Western military aid to Ukraine by threatening to target arms shipments, though Russian forces have so far conducted relatively few air and missile strikes in western Ukraine to date and would likely face strong Ukrainian air defenses.

Russian forces are engaged in four primary efforts at this time:

Main effort—Kyiv (comprised of three subordinate supporting efforts);

Supporting effort 1—Kharkiv; Supporting effort 1a—Luhansk Oblast;

Supporting effort 2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast; and

Supporting effort 3—Kherson and advances westward.

Main effort—Kyiv axis: Russian operations on the Kyiv axis are aimed at encircling the city from the northwest, west, and east.

Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations northwest of Kyiv in the past 24 hours. Russian forces made limited advances around Chernihiv and toward Kyiv’s eastern outskirts after pausing for several days. Continued Ukrainian counterattacks and successful operations by Territorial Defense Forces continue to threaten Russia’s long line of communication in northeastern Ukraine.

Subordinate main effort along the west bank of the Dnipro

Russian forces did not conduct offensive operations northwest of Kyiv for the second day in a row.[9] The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces continued to regroup and replenish reserves. Russian forces continue to shell Kyiv’s northwestern suburbs but did not launch any ground attacks on March 11-12.[10] Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian loitering munitions-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over downtown Kyiv on March 12, the first Russian use of armed UAVs in Ukraine that ISW has observed.[11] Russian forces are likely deploying new assets to the western Kyiv front as part of ongoing resupply and replenishment efforts.

Subordinate supporting effort—Chernihiv axis

Russian forces resumed limited attacks toward northeastern Kyiv on March 12. The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces attacked toward Zazymya (northwest of Brovary) and Vyshenky with unspecified “partial success.”[12] Russian forces attacked toward Mykhailo-Kotsyubynske and Shestovytsia, roughly 15km west and southwest of Chernihiv, in a likely effort to fully encircle the city.[13] The Ukrainian General Staff additionally reported the deployment of Russian bridging equipment in Mykhailo-Kotsyubynske, Levkovychi, Zhukotka, and Hrodnya, around Chernihiv.[14] Russian forces may be preparing for an operation to cross the Desna River from west to east to further surround Chernihiv.

Subordinate supporting effort—Sumy axis

Russian forces continued to reinforce the Sumy axis on March 12 and did not launch new ground offensives.[15] The Ukrainian General Staff reported at midnight local time on March 11 that Russian forces are shifting reserves in Velyka Pysarivka, Moskovsky Bobryak, and Lebedyn – several towns along Russia’s exposed ground line of communication in northeastern Ukraine.[16] Ukrainian territorial defense forces additionally conducted at least two successful attacks near Sumy on March 11, destroying and capturing several Russian tanks and artillery vehicles.[17] ISW previously assessed that continuing Ukrainian counterattacks in northeastern Ukraine would force Russia to redeploy forces to consolidate this long line of communication.[18]

Supporting Effort #1—Kharkiv:

Russian forces captured unspecified northern portions of Izyum, 110km southeast of Kharkiv, on March 12.[19] Russian forces additionally launched an unsuccessful attack on Rubizhne, south of Kharkiv.[20] Russian forces continued to shell Kharkiv but did not conduct any major ground attacks on March 12.[21] Russian forces likely seek to bypass Kharkiv from the southeast and advance toward Dnipro and Zaporizhya, but are unlikely to make substantial advances without committing further combat power.

Supporting Effort #1a—Luhansk Oblast:

The Ukrainian General Staff reported Russian forces concentrated additional reserves in Severodonetsk and Svatove but did not conduct any offensive operations in the past 24 hours.[22]

Supporting Effort #2—Mariupol and Donetsk Oblast:

The Ukrainian General Staff confirmed Russian forces captured the “eastern outskirts” of Mariupol on March 12 but did not provide further details.[23] Ukrainian forces reported repelling a Russian offensive toward Krasna Polyana and Olhynka – two towns north of Mariupol which Russian forces previously claimed to have already captured – as of noon local time on March 12.[24] Russian forces are unlikely to seize Mariupol through a direct assault without a greater concentration of forces (which they remain unlikely to have the ability to assemble). Russia will likely continue to shell the city and maintain gradual ground assaults to force the city to capitulate.

Supporting Effort #3—Kherson and west:

The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces conducted a new advance northeast from Kherson along the western bank of the Dnipro on March 12, deploying artillery and air defense assets to Mylove.[25] Russian forces have not yet conducted attacks at strength along the west bank of the Dnipro on the southern axis of advance. Russian forces may intend to advance northeast to encircle Zaporizhya, but are unlikely to have the forces necessary to do so while Russian forces in the south remain committed to the encirclement of Mariupol. Russian forces directly south of Zaporizhya conducted limited advances on March 12, capturing Stepove and Shcherbaky (approximately 40km south of Zaporizhya).[26]

Russian forces did not conduct any new attacks toward Mykolayiv on March 12 and reinforced their existing positions.[27] Russian forces are unlikely to resume major offensive operations toward Odesa in the next 48-72 hours.

Immediate items to watch

The Kremlin likely seeks to pressure Belarus to join the war in Ukraine and will deploy Syrian fighters to Ukraine in the near future;

Ukrainian counterattacks and operations by Territorial Defense Forces in northeastern Ukraine threaten Russia’s exposed line of communication, requiring Russia to redeploy forces away from the offensive toward eastern Kyiv;

Russian forces are undertaking another operational pause to prepare for renewed efforts to encircle Kyiv from east and west and/or to seize the city center itself following their failures of March 8-9;

Russian troops may drive on Zaporizhya City itself within the next 48-72 hours, likely to try and block it on both banks of the Dnipro River and set conditions for subsequent operations after Russian forces take Mariupol, which they are currently besieging.

Over the past two days, artillery units destroyed up to 80 units of enemy equipment on the outskirts of Chernihiv and in nearby villages.

The North operational command stated this on Facebook, Rubryka reports.

The invaders tried to force the river to move in the direction of Kyiv.

As noted, on the night of March 12, a column of equipment of the 228th Motorized Rifle Regiment of the 90th Panzer Division of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation was broken. It should provide logistics for the enemy.

""Cars with fuel, ammunition, and weapons were on fire for two days,"" the statement said.

In addition, units of the OC North defeated a brigade-tactical group of the same regiment that tried to blockade Chernihiv.

The Ukrainian military discovered and destroyed two command and observation posts of the enemy's battalion tactical group from the 35th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade (Aleysk, Altai Krai) on the outskirts of the regional center.

The defenders of Chernihiv also managed to eliminate the enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group.

""Nevertheless, the enemy continues to launch air and missile strikes on civilian objects and residential buildings in Chernihiv, killing civilians, destroying housing, despite international law and the rules of hostilities,"" the North said.

As Rubryka reported, on March 13, a tank column of invaders was defeated near Chernihiv.",https://rubryka.com/en/2022/03/13/na-chernigivshhyni-ukrayinska-artyleriya-za-dvi-doby-znyshhyla-80-odynyts-vijskovoyi-tehniky-okupantiv/

Kramer', 'Mike Ives', 'Alexandra Stevenson', 'John Yoon', 'Azi Paybarah', 'David Moll']",2022-03-03 00:00:00,"A fire broke out early Friday at a complex in southern Ukraine housing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after Russian troops fired on the area, and the Russian military later took control of the site, Ukrainian officials said.

Security camera footage verified by The New York Times showed a building ablaze inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex near a line of military vehicles. The videos appeared to show people in the vehicles firing at buildings in the power plant. Ukraine’s state emergency service later said the blaze went out after 6 a.m.

The fire did not affect essential equipment at the plant, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Twitter, citing its communication with the Ukrainian government.

About an hour after dawn, Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate said in a statement that Russian military forces were now occupying the complex. It said that all of the site’s power units remained intact and that no changes in radiation levels had been observed.

The fire broke out after a Russian attack on a training building outside the perimeter of the plant, according to a statement by Ukraine’s state emergency service. A spokesman for the nuclear plant, Andriy Tuz, was quoted by The Associated Press as telling Ukrainian television that shells had set fire to one of the plant’s six reactors that was under renovation and not operating.

Ukraine’s nuclear inspectorate later said in its statement that one unit of the six units was operating, another was in “outage,” two were being cooled down, and two others had been disconnected from the grid.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine had accused the Russian military of deliberately attacking the complex and said an explosion there would have been “the end for everybody, the end of Europe.”

“Only immediate actions by Europe could stop the Russian army,” he added.

President Biden spoke with Mr. Zelensky about the fire and joined him in urging Russia to “cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site,” the White House said. Local reports later said that emergency crews had gained access.

Mr. Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer M. Granholm, said on Twitter that the United States had not detected elevated radiation readings in the area, echoing an earlier assessment by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down,” she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain said he would seek an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council about the blaze at the complex, according to his office.

Before the fire was reported by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, the director general for the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that “a large number of Russian tanks and infantry” had entered Enerhodar, a town next to the plant. The director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said that troops were “moving directly” toward the reactor site.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, on the Dnieper River roughly a hundred miles north of Crimea, is the largest in Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, its six reactors produce a total of 6,000 megawatts of electric power.

In comparison, the Chernobyl plant in northern Ukraine produced 3,800 megawatts — about a third less. (A megawatt, one million watts, is enough power to light 10,000 hundred-watt bulbs.) The four reactors of the Chernobyl complex were shut down after one suffered a catastrophic fire and meltdown in 1986.

The reactors’ cores are full of highly radioactive fuel. But an additional danger at the Zaporizhzhia site is the many acres of open pools of water behind the complex where spent fuel rods have been cooled for years. Experts fear that errant shells or missiles that hit such sites could set off radiological disasters.

For days, social media reports have detailed how the residents of Enerhodar set up a giant barrier of tires, vehicles and metal barricades to try to block a Russian advance into the city and the reactor site. Christoph Koettl, a visual investigator for The New York Times, noted on Twitter that the barricades were so large that they could be seen from outer space by orbiting satellites.

Starting this past Sunday, three days into the invasion, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator began reporting an unusual rate of disconnection: Six of the nation’s 15 reactors were offline. On Tuesday, the Zaporizhzhia facility was the site with the most reactors offline.

Russia said its troops could target supplies of Western weapons in Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin did not show a willingness to end the war during a call with the French and German leaders, a French presidency official said.

The humanitarian situation in the besieged port city of Mariupol continues to deteriorate with the UN citing reports of “looting and violent confrontations” among civilians over the few resources available.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said about 1,300 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia’s invasion started.

Croatia criticises NATO after crash of Russian-made drone

Croatian officials criticised NATO for what they said was its slow reaction to a military drone that apparently flew from the Ukrainian war zone through the airspace of three NATO member states, before crashing in the Croatian capital.

The Russian-made unmanned aircraft crossed Romania and Hungary before entering Croatia and slamming late Thursday into a field near a student dormitory. Some 40 parked cars were damaged but no one was injured after a loud blast.

“We cannot tolerate this situation, nor should it have ever happened,” Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said while visiting the crash site. “This was a pure and clear threat and both NATO and the EU should have reacted,” he said. “We will work to raise the readiness not only of us but of others as well,” he added.

Correspondent: Strong smell of explosives in Kyiv

Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen, reporting from Kyiv, said there is a smell of explosions and explosives in the city as Russian forces advance.

“[The smell is] really strong; it’s getting closer in the last days and even hours. You hear a lot more artillery fire, shelling; it’s mainly been coming from the northwest, a town called Irpin. There’s been heavy fighting for days [there] already,” Vaessen said.

“[Irpin] is basically the entrance into the capital, so it’s a very strategic point for the Ukrainian army and towns around Irpin have already fallen in Russian hands. Irpin is very much the last point before Russian forces can enter the capital.

“Also on the northwest flank of the capital, you can see that Russian forces are closing in … There was a huge bombardment this morning; eight rockets were fired at an air base in the south, so it’s very much a sense here that there’s going to be an encirclement around the capital. We don’t know when … no one knows how fast Russian forces are advancing.”

Aid workers warn over risks of human trafficking

Concerns on how to protect women from becoming victims of human trafficking at border crossing are growing.

Mornay, a former member of the French Foreign Legion who is helping refugees at the Medyka border crossing between Poland and Ukraine, told The Associated Press news agency that his team found three men trying to get several women into a van.

“I cannot say 100 percent they were trying to recruit them for sex trafficking, but when we approach them they got nervous and they just left immediately,” he said.

Romania’s local authorities also told AP they have been working on advising women to make sure to have their phone battery charged and to remember the car’s tag they board once they have crossed the border.

Annual global profit over sexual exploitation is around $32bn, a European Union commission report showed, a figure that rises during humanitarian crisis. “The risk of some capitalising on the pain of these people is very high,” said Andreea Bujor, an aid worker with World Vision Romania.

Belarus has said it is deploying five combat units to its southern border to prevent “nationalist armed formations” from Ukraine from entering the country.

“The troop movements are in no way related to any preparations, let alone to any participation of Belarusian soldiers in the special operation on the territory of Ukraine,” said Deputy Defence Minister Viktor Gulevich in a statement.

Ukraine accuses its neighbour of planning to enter the war alongside Russia. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko vehemently denies this.

Russian forces have used Belarus as a base from which to attack targets in Ukraine with fighter jets and missiles.

Israel not pushing Ukraine to yield to Russian demands, Ukraine adviser says

A top Ukrainian adviser has pushed back against suggestions Israel tried to nudge Ukraine into caving to Russian demands during talks.

Israel, “just as other conditional intermediary countries, does NOT offer Ukraine to agree to any demands of the Russian Federation,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter. “This is impossible for military & political reasons. On the contrary, Israel urges Russia to assess the events more adequately.”

Israel has been engaged in diplomatic efforts to try to end the war in Ukraine. A report in Israel’s Walla news and Jerusalem Post had suggested, citing an unidentified Ukrainian official, that Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had urged Ukraine to give in to Russia.

UN experts say Russian media law amounts to information ‘blackout’

A Russian law giving Moscow stronger powers to crack down on independent journalism is placing Russia under a “total information blackout” on the war in Ukraine, UN independent experts have said.

Moscow last week blocked Facebook and other websites and passed a law that imposed a prison term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military.

“Russia’s recent adoption of a punitive ‘fake war news’ law is an alarming move by the government to gag and blindfold an entire population,” three independent UN experts appointed by the top UN rights body, the Human Rights Council, said in a statement.

” … the law places Russia under a total information blackout on the war and in so doing gives an official seal of approval to disinformation and misinformation,” they continued.

Russian shelling prevents Mariupol evacuation, Ukraine says

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said Russian shelling prevented evacuees from leaving the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, while Russian forces also stopped some buses of people trying to flee the Kyiv region.

In a video address, Vereshchuk said some planned evacuations were successful, including 1,000 people who were evacuated from the village of Vorzel, in the Ukrainian capital area.

Russian forces have laid siege to Mariupol, and Ukraine says 1,582 civilians have died there since the invasion began.

4,06077d2a-80dd-4083-ad89-bc71c5795b62,[],2022-03-12 14:50:35+00:00,"Pushing into the third week of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, the whole world witnessed how the Russian Armed Forces hace stumbled and bumbled into a seeming stalemate with Ukraine, which experts predicted would fall in mere days. The invasion was conducted with an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 Russian troops, attempting to advance into various Ukrainian cities accompanied with tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery.

So far, their campaign has not gone well, to say the least. They have allegedly sustained casualties of 12,000 troops, lost over 57 aircraft and helicopters, 353 tanks, and 1,165 armored personnel carriers, according to Ukrainian media (the numbers differ when compared to Russian sources and independent monitoring sites). While these numbers may be off, they can’t be way off given the lack of progress of the Russian army so far. Taking these kinds of casualties would stall an invasion pretty quick.

SOFREP has attributed the Russian army’s lack of success so far to poor operational planning (not accounting for weather) that relegates them to use the roads, too few troops, logistics issues, lack of coordination and communications, as well as a general lack of morale among the Russian troops with numerous reports of soldiers sometimes walking away from armed and fueled tanks and vehicles and surrendering to the Ukrainians.

Obliterating Russian Tanks

With Russia being the 5th largest army in the entire world with over 900,000 active servicemen, 13,000 tanks, 20,000 armored fighting vehicles, 1,300 military aircraft, 500 helicopters, and 6,000 artillery pieces, many thought that Ukraine would fold up like a lawn chair. Its own 196,600 active military personnel along with 900,000 reservists, thousands of local volunteers, and international fighters have so far successfully reduced Russian advances into Ukraine to a snail’s pace, resulting in Putin shelling civilian areas indiscriminately in what seems to be a fit of spite and impotence.

With all of the videos of shelling, explosions, gunfire, and general warfare being posted online through various social media platforms, it would be safe to say that majority of the general public has seen photos or videos of Russian tanks being pulled away by farmers on their tractors, or even civilians driving away with tanks and armored vehicles and selling them online.

If you’re a serious military observer, then you must have been busy with tracking all of the military movements from both sides, perhaps taking note of casualties on both sides, as well as monitoring all active units involved in the war through independent online sources.

As the video below and others like it show, Ukrainian forces have been very successful in slipping into the rear areas of the Russian advance and ambushing convoys of tanks, trucks and fighting vehicles to prevent them from reaching the front.

Much has been said about the Russian tank units in Ukraine, with many people, including Ukrainians themselves, fearing the sheer number of main battle tanks ravaging their cities. However, it seems that the Ukrainians are doing fairly well with defending against missiles. In fact, they were so successful in using their western-supplied Javelin anti-tank guided missile system (FGM-148 Javelin) and Next Generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW) anti-tank weapons that a cult following has developed within the general public.

These weapons have been so praised and prized by the Ukrainian Armed Forces that a “St. Javelin of Ukraine” was created on social media depicting a Christian Mary Magdalene holding the weapons. More so, the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones have also helped destroy large amounts of armored vehicles, with a song written for it by Ukrainians.

According to independent military tracker Oryx, Russia has lost over 65 tanks, with 85 units captured by Ukrainians, 38 abandoned, and two damaged. Here’s a summary of the listed statistics for Russian tanks:

1 T-64BV captured

1 T-64BV damaged

2 T-72A destroyed

5 T-72A captured

9 T-72B destroyed

2 T-72B damaged (1 damaged and abandoned)

5 T-72B abandoned

17 T-72B captured

1 T-72B Obr. 1989 destroyed

2 T-72B Obr. 1989 abandoned

1 T-72B Obr. 1989 captured

3 T-72B3 destroyed

1 T-72B3 damaged

2 T-72B3 abandoned

3 T-72B3 captured

23 T-72B3 Obr. 2016 destroyed

4 T-72B3 Obr. 2016 abandoned

21 T-72B3 Obr. 2016 captured

1 T-80BV destroyed

2 T-80BV abandoned

4 T-80BV captured

6 T-80U destroyed

13 T-80U abandoned

20 T-80U captured

1 T-80UK abandoned and destroyed

3 T-80BVM destroyed

1 T-80BVM abandoned

7 T-80BVM captured

7 T-90A destroyed

3 T-90A abandoned

6 T-90A captured

6 Unknown tanks destroyed

1 Unknown tank damaged

2 Unknown tanks abandoned

With these numbers in mind, here are the Russian army units that seem to be taking the brunt of the beating right now trying to advance into Ukraine. Here’s what we managed to dig up. As a primer, the Guards Divisions of the Russian army constitute the bulk of their offensive strike capability. Their ranks are not filled by conscripts serving a single year in uniform but by professional soldiers serving contracts of three years or longer. They are generally equipped with the most modern weapons the Russian state can offer.

Guard’s Armies are built around the tank, armored fighting vehicle, artillery, and helicopter gunships. Their role would be to smash through enemy defenses creating a gap that infantry units can then rush into and expand on by pushing on its flanks. The armored formations would then fan out in the rear of the enemy army to encircle them and cut them off, forcing either their surrender or annihilation. In order to be employed effectively, a Guards Tank Division needs to advance over open ground to maximize its frontal firepower and maneuverability, so being stuck on roads severely limits its abilities as a fighting unit. The Mechanized Infantry that travel with the tanks in armored personnel carriers are employed as shock troops to fighting infantry encountered at the breach and to take and hold positions until follow-up infantry units arrive. Some of the problems the Russian army is having in Ukraine is probably related to the training of this type of infantry which as a matter of doctrine do not go very far from their tracked vehicle, staying within 50 yards of it to protect it and to be covered by its cannon and heavy machine guns in a fight. With Ukrainian forces employing Javelins that can reach out a mile, you see the problem. If attacked on a road, Russian tanks can’t go off-road in pursuit for fear of being bogged down in the mud and the mechanized infantry with them will not go more than 50 yards from their APCs. The more Russia advances into Ukraine, the more infantry they have to leave behind to secure towns and cities and their routes of supply.

And they don’t appear to have enough troops to do that.

1st Guards Tank Army

The 1st Guards Tank Army is one of the more famed divisions in the Russian Ground Forces as Vladimir Putin reassembled it to neutralize threats from Baltic countries. Historically, they were known for obliterating the Nazis’ 1st Panzer Division in World War II. They played a vital role in the Battle of Kursk and fought in (ironically) Ukraine, Poland, and Berlin.

The 76th Guards Air Assault Division, on the other hand, is headquartered in Pskov, with its lineage tracing back to the 157th Rifle Division. It spearheaded the 2014 annexation of Crimea and was subsequently awarded the Order of Suvorov by Vladimir Putin.

The 41st Army, which was said to be headquartered in Novosibirsk, was deployed to the west to provide support to the Western and Southern Military Districts along with the 55th Mountain Brigade and the 74th Guards Motorized Rifle Brigades. The 41st Army was notably commanded by Major-General Andrei Sukhovetsky, who was the deputy commander, and Major-General Vitaly Gerasimov, who was the army’s first deputy commander serving under Sukhovetsky — both of whom died last week.

It can be remembered that Sukhovetsky was killed via a sniper shot while he had been visiting frontlines in an attempt to regain the momentum of the invasion as the army reportedly was suffering from low morale. However, he was left so exposed in the frontlines of the war that he was shot and killed by Ukrainian operatives.

The exact numbers of the soldiers serving under the 41st CAA are unknown. However, it is comprised of the following:

35th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade from Aleysk

55th Mountain Motorized Rifle Brigade from Kyzyl

The 200th Arctic Motor Rifle Brigade, 6th CAA (OPCON), was spotted in Kharkiv sporting some T-80BVM tanks, 2S3 Akatsiya Self-Propelled Howitzers, and 2K22M1 Tunguska SPAAWs. The units were reportedly part of the war in Donbas and were redeployed to Ukraine, fighting mainly in the Battle of Kharkiv, which saw some of its members being captured. They were previously led by Colonel Denis Kurilo, who died during said battle in Kharkiv. According to journalist Yuri Butusov, he had seen Ukrainian Javelins destroying some 2SK Akatsiyas (and around 30 more vehicles) and apparently saw Kurilo abandoning his soldiers before getting himself killed.

The brigade was operating some 41 T-80BVM main battle tanks, 36 2S19 MSTA self-propelled howitzers, 18 BM-21 Grad MRLS, 9P149 tank destroyers, 9K35 Strela-10s, 9K33 Osa, 2K22 Tunguskas, and some Barnaul-T air defense systems.

Air and Missile Defense Forces, VKS and 7th Guards Air Assault Division

The Air and Missile Defense Forces, VKS, and the 7th Guards Air Assault Division were spotted operating in Mykolaiv and Bashtanka with their Pantsir-S1 SPAAWs and their BMD-4M Airborne IFV units, respectively. The Air and Missile Defense Forces, led by Lieutenant General Yury Grekhov, is one of three sub-branches that comprise the new Russian Aerospace Forces, with the other two being the Air Force and the Space Forces.

It is comprised of the following:

1st Order of Lenin Air Defense and Anti-Ballistic Missile Defense Army (Special Purpose)

4th Air Defense Division “Hero of the Soviet Union Lt.-Gen. B. P. Kirpikov” – uses the S-300PM/PS and the S-400)

5th Air Defense Division (uses the S-300PM and the S-400)

9th Anti-Ballistic Missile Defense Division (Armed with A-135 anti-ballistic missile systems).

Probably 7th guards air assault division. They will be moving up with a sizable number of BTGs from 58th CAA behind them, elements of 22nd Corps, and probably 20th division from 8th CAA. In short, it looks like we're very near the beginning of offensive operations. https://t.co/4tGUZd0tsc — Michael Kofman (@KofmanMichael) February 24, 2022

The Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) in general were notably criticized by military observers and strategists as they noted that over 300 combat aircraft were stationed nearby northern, eastern, and southern Ukraine and could have been used to weaken the Ukrainian Air Force, but they chose not to. This led the Ukrainian forces to use low-level defensive counter-air (DCA) ground attacks to down Russian helicopters. Specifically, they used SAMs, MANPADS, and Stinger missiles to destroy these Russian attack helicopters with minimal casualties. The lack of air support also led the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB-2 armed UAV to destroy Russian vehicle columns.

On the other hand, the 7th Guards Air Assault Division, which was seen to be operating BMD-4M Airborne IFV units, is known to be one of the most elite guard divisions from the Russian Airborne Troops, which were vital components for the Battle of Mykolaiv. It currently operates an unknown number of 2S9 “Nona” 120 mm self-propelled artillery vehicles, 1В119 reconnaissance, and fire-control vehicles, BMD-1, BMD-2 and BTR-D, anti-aircraft BTR-ZDs, and anti-tank BTR-RDs which are equipped with 9М111 “Bassoon” anti-tank rocket systems. It is currently led by Guards Colonel Anastasia Vladimirovna Shevchuk.

Unknown Units

We were also able to determine some MB-21 Grad rocket artillery and T-90s operating in Mariupol. However, we were not able to identify which units they came from. TIGR-M infantry mobility vehicles were also seen in Kharkiv; however, we could not determine what unit they were from.
