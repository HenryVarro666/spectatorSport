""What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft. This is the sound of a new iron curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world,"" Zelenskiy said.

""Our national task is to make sure this curtain does not fall across our land.""

2,e3bbe242-c5bf-440a-b537-e52ed2d7b1b4,[],,"AFP — Russia’s attack on Ukraine could herald a Cold War revival in Europe with two blocs armed to the teeth pointing nuclear weapons at each other across an iron curtain, politicians and experts say.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s statement that Moscow’s assault on his country was “the sound of a new Iron Curtain lowering” has resonated in Western halls of power where many had assumed that Europe’s post-war division into hostile camps led by the US and Russia was consigned to the history books.

From Hitler’s defeat in 1945 to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Europe was divided into two camps with the dividing line running through Germany.

The so-called Iron Curtain, a term coined by British wartime leader Winston Churchill, separated the western liberal, capitalist democracies from the communist countries in the east, each part of zones of influence that were mostly accepted by the other side.

‘Shift borders’

But after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of Moscow’s former satellites turned to the West, joining NATO and the European Union if they could — like Poland and Romania — or at least liberalizing their economies and political systems, like Ukraine.

Former German chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in communist east Germany, warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is on a quest to roll back that trend and re-establish Moscow’s sphere of influence.

“Russia’s war of aggression marks a profound turning point in European history after the end of the Cold War,” Merkel said Friday.

Her successor, Olaf Scholz, echoed such concerns when he called the invasion of Ukraine “an attempt to forcibly shift borders within Europe.”

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Putin point-blank of wanting to “reconstitute the Soviet empire” or at least “reassert a sphere of influence.”

French President Emmanuel Macron also seemed to be looking at the Russian offensive’s long-term impact when he described the war as a “turning point in the history of Europe and our country” with “deep and lasting consequences for our lives.”

Russia taking “Ukraine off the map of nations,” as French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian fears it will, would dramatically lengthen the border NATO countries share with Russia, with a big rise in potential flashpoints — and fewer buffers.

Already the US and other NATO members are sending reinforcements to the alliance’s frontline.

Once Washington stations the promised 7,000 extra soldiers, the US will have 90,000 troops in total deployed in Europe.

Among European nations promising more efforts, France has said it would accelerate its troop deployment in Romania, while Italy is to send 3,400 soldiers to its most exposed NATO allies.

‘All kinds of repercussions’

Western experts have little doubt that victory in Ukraine would see Putin tighten his grip not just on Kyiv, but also on neighboring Belarus, which has already served as a launchpad for Russia’s attack.

“The war in Ukraine will have all kinds of repercussions on the line that runs from Baltic to the Black Sea,” said Jean-Sylvestre Mongrenier at the Thomas More institute think tank.

Belarus would “become a satellite again,” he told AFP, and Russian pressure would grow on the Baltic countries and Poland.

Scholz called on Germany’s allies to prevent the conflict from spilling over into other countries “with everything at our disposal” and warned Putin not to underestimate NATO’s determination to defend its members.

France meanwhile expressed concerns that Russian tanks may also roll into Moldova and Georgia, two other former Soviet republics where separatists declared unrecognized statelets.

As tensions rise, the nuclear arms threat — a key ingredient of post-war Europe’s Cold War order — is also making a return.

Le Drian has reminded Putin that “the Atlantic alliance is also a nuclear alliance,” while the Russian leader threatened retaliation “like you have never seen in history” for anyone interfering with the war in Ukraine — which many understand to mean nuclear reprisal.

Both Russia and the US have thousands of nuclear warheads at their disposal, with France and Britain adding to the West’s atomic capabilities.

3,e3bbe242-c5bf-440a-b537-e52ed2d7b1b4,[],2022-02-25 10:01:31+00:00,"Russia unleashed all-out war on Ukraine from land, sea and air on Thursday, attacking targets all around the country including the capital Kiev, pushing Europe towards its most ruinous conflict since 1945 and prompting international fury at the actions of president Vladimir Putin.

It was a momentous day for Europe and the world – a day that saw at least 57 Ukrainians killed and another 169 injured, according to Ukraine’s health ministry. Western countries promised new and tougher sanctions, while protesters gathered across the world against Putin’s military action, including in Russia, and a potential refugee crisis and a jump in energy prices looked imminent.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky accused president Putin of trying to lower a “new iron curtain” across the continent.

“What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft,” said Mr Zelensky. “This is the sound of a new iron curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world. Our national task is to make sure this curtain does not fall across our land.”

And he warned that Russia would not stop at Ukraine. “If you don’t help us now,” he told the international community, “if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.”

As Russian troops made further inroads, they captured the infamous Chernobyl nuclear plant, where a reactor exploded in 1986, spewing a radioactive cloud across Europe. Moscow’s defence ministry also claimed to have “neutralised” Ukraine’s air defences and wiped out 11 airfields.

The devastating assault began early this morning, with Putin, with a huge arsenal of nuclear warheads behind him, warning the international community not to interfere. “If you do you will face consequences greater than any of you have faced in history,” he claimed.

He vowed “to defend people who have been victims” of what he dubbed “the Kiev regime” and said that he would “demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine” – tapping into a baseless and long-standing Russian narrative that suggests the country is being subjugated by right-wing radicals.

Missiles were fired at key military and infrastructure targets inside Ukraine. Luhansk, Sumy and Chernihiv, in the east of Ukraine, were all subjected to attacks, while tanks battled on the outskirts of Kharkiv, after paratroopers dropped in.

An amphibious assault on the key port city of Mariupol was launched, and ground forces are now moving in across the country from Russia, Crimea and its vassal state, Belarus, which is close to Kiev. Another key city, Odessa, is also said to be under attack.

A Ministry of Defence intelligence update said Russia’s air strikes had targeted military infrastructure – especially command and control and air defence installations – and that the Ukrainian forces had “put up a staunch resistance and continue to hold key cities”.

In the capital, where almost three million people live, air sirens forced residents to desperately seek shelter in the city’s underground. Bomb explosions were heard close to Kiev itself, including an air assault on Hostomel Airport.

According to a senior US defence official, Russian troops are making a move on Kiev, where a local curfew has now been imposed.

Footage has emerged of dogfights between Ukrainian and Russian jets, with Kiev claiming to have brought down seven aircraft. Social media videos showed apartment buildings hit in residential areas in Kharkhiv and scores of Ukrainians queuing to donate blood.

Ukrainians have begun to flee the county’s main urban centres, including the capital and south-western city of Mariupol. Many who stayed sought shelter in basements or in the Kiev metro system.

One resident, Ihor Nazarenko, told The Independent: “It is about one man; an angry bitter man who wants to punish us because we will not accept what he wants.”

Those who have remained say they have been able to access food and water, but this could change in the wake of the Ukraine military suspending commercial shipping at its ports.

Mr Zelensky urged citizens to defend the country from Russian forces and said weapons would be issued to everyone who came forward. Ten thousand automatic rifles had been handed out to civilians in Kiev in the past few hours, according to Denys Monastyrsky, the Ukrainian interior minister.

In the US, president Joe Biden accused Russia of an “unprovoked and unjustified attack” and said: “The world will hold Russia accountable.”

Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz said the Russian leader “was endangering the lives of countless innocent people” and pinned the blame on Putin. He added: “For all that there is no justification. This is Putin’s war”.

The G7 nations were meeting to decide on a response, while Ukrainians protested the Russian invasion outside Downing Street.

In Moscow’s Pushkin Square, around 2,000 protesters bravely took to the streets to voice their anger at their own government’s invasion, with another 1,000 gathering in St Petersburg. A reported 700 have been arrested.

Boris Johnson called Russia’s actions “a catastrophe for our continent” and European Commission foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, described the move as “among the darkest hours of Europe since the end of World War II.”

France’s Emmanuel Macron said Russia’s actions marked “a turning point in the history of Europe”.

Mr Johnson called on Europe to sever the continent’s dependence on Russian oil, which has given the Kremlin a “grip” on Western politics, he said.

As part of the package of sanctions unveiled by the UK, Russian airline Aeroflot will imminently be banned from the UK, while there will be an asset freeze on all major Russian banks, including immediately against VTB.

A Kremlin spokesman shrugged off threats from western leaders and said Russia could not be placed behind an “Iron Curtain” once more.
