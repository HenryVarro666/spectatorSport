Things are moving fast in Ukraine so here's a re-cap of the latest developments on the ground and reaction to Russia's invasion. Much of the information coming from both sides remains unverified but it is clear that Russia is mounting a major assault.

Russian missile strikes and explosions have been reported near major cities and targeting military infrastructure. Russia says it has destroyed more than 70 military targets.

The Ukrainian military claims to have shot down at least six Russian aircraft but this has not been confirmed.

Fierce fighting is reported in the east, where Russian forces are said to have attacked a hospital in the Donetsk region. There have been clashes in the port cities of Odesa and Mariupol, and in Kharkiv, in the north-east.

Russia appears to be in control of the Antonov airbase, around 15-20 miles outside Kyiv. But Ukraine says it is fighting back and a battle appears to be continuing there.

The number of overall casualties continues to be unclear. Dozens of military personnel and civilians are reported killed.

Or in Russian President Putin’s Orwellian language, “a special military operation” to “disarm and de-Nazify” Ukraine.

It appears almost certain Moscow will seek to occupy at a minimum half of Ukraine, but more likely the entire country. That’s because Putin’s goal is not merely to grab additional territory, but to ensure that Ukraine remains cut off from Western military and economic partnership, and firmly under Moscow’s sway. That will involve installing a puppet regime to ensure that happens.

Putin also issued a thinly veiled threat of nuclear attack—“consequences greater than any you have faced in history” should NATO attempt to intervene in assistance to Ukraine.

This article seeks to assess the major developments in the first twelve hours of Russia’s assault on Ukraine.

‘Shock and awe’ bombardment

Moscow began its war with a massive missile and artillery bombardment targeting high-value military targets across the entire breadth (and nearly every major city) of Ukraine, particularly air defense radars, airbases, barracks, ammunition dumps, and port facilities, including Kyiv’s primary remaining naval bases at Mykolaiv and Odesa.

According to a Pentagon official, the bombardment was conducted by 75 medium and heavy bombers (presumably Su-34 and Tu-22M, Tu-95 or Tu-160 bombers) using land-attack cruise missiles, naval cruise missiles (likely Kalibr missiles), and “short and medium-range ballistic missiles”, likely referring to Iskander missiles.

So far attacks don’t appear to have been aimed at civilian power and water infrastructure, seemingly indicating Russian hopes of a swift victory with limited economic damage. However, some strikes have nonetheless landed on civilian targets, causing fatalities.

У Вугледарі російські окупаційні війська вбили 4 та поранили 10 цивільних – снаряди окупантів уразили місцеву лікарню. Серед поранених – 6 медиків. Обстріл стався близько 11-ї години.

Стан поранених різного ступеня важкості. pic.twitter.com/WMOxXfz7aQ — IgorGirkin (@GirkinGirkin) February 24, 2022

That said, Russia has not launched the massive, crippling cyberattacks long expected as part of its strategy—at least, not more than were already harrying Ukraine with on a daily basis before the commencement of kinetic operations.

Additionally, hundreds of rocket and howitzer artillery systems on Ukraine’s border unleashed massive barrages, particularly in the area around Kharkiv. Dud rockets can now be seen planted in the concrete of Ukrainian towns and cities.

Though some analysts speculated Russia might bombard Ukraine for several days before sending in ground forces, that didn’t prove to be the case. Armored columns began rolling into Ukraine just an hour or two after the barrage began.

It’s important to note that the tempo of missiles strikes on the opening day of the war is unlikely to be sustained indefinitely. Cruise and ballistic missiles are highly expensive weapons and Russia has a much smaller inventory of them than the United States does. That’s even true of shorter-range precision munitions released by aircraft. Though missile strikes will continue more sporadically against critical targets as they emerge, artillery and gravity bombs will increasingly do most of the damage, especially once air defenses are deemed sufficiently suppressed.

Belarus stabs Ukraine in back with thrust aimed at Kyiv

The deployment of 30,000 Russian troops to Belarus in January under the false pretext of a routine exercise is bearing its expected, terrible fruit: both Russian and Belarussian troops have advanced south towards the capital of Kyiv, overrunning the Chernobyl exclusion zone along the way. Moscow claims they have encountered little resistance so far. This thrust appears to be forming a pincer attack to encircle Kyiv.

While Belarus’s role in hosting the troops made Putin’s hold on its dictator Lukashenko clear, the actual participation of Belarussian forces in attacks on the border demonstrates how completely Minsk has become an appendage of Russian military power.

Were Ukraine’s air defenses destroyed?

Ukrainian forces claim to have downed seven Russian aircraft, including at least one Su-24 bomber. So far, the author has only seen photographic proof of destroyed helicopters, however.

Having devoted much of its first strike to suppressing Ukrainian air defenses, Russia now claims to have “destroyed” them.

I profiled means Russia might use for Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) in an article in January. Since hostilities have commenced. Images reveal damage or destruction of at least three fixed air defense radars, as well as two of Ukraine’s newer-generation mobile L220 radars. Missile debris shows Russia has used its Kh-31P anti-radiation missile.

It’s still far from clear that Ukraine’s more mobile air defense radars and longer-range S-300P and Buk missiles are entirely destroyed yet, though they are surely engaged in a desperate fight for survival.

But even if Russia’s initial strikes really did knock those out, Ukraine’s numerous short-range air defense systems, which include Stinger missiles recently delivered from the Baltics, will remain. These already appear to be causing helicopter losses despite extensive use of heat-decoy flares.

As Russia has a limited inventory of precision weapons that can be used accurately from high altitude, its warplanes will eventually have to assume risks diving into the short-range air defense envelope to accurately strike ground targets.

It also appears likely (but not confirmed) that Russia’s initial bombardment destroyed most of the Ukrainian Air Force’s roughly 100 combat jets and roughly two dozen TB2 Bayraktar combat drones on the ground. Video does however show the UAF has flown sorties, though the author isn’t aware of any confirmed air-to-air engagement or Bayraktar strike footage so far.

One video billed as depicting an aerial engagement in fact shows two UAF MiG-29s in the air.

Airborne assault at Hostomel

The international cargo airport at Hostomel (or Gostomel), on the western outskirt of Kyiv, was heavily struck by Russian missiles in the initial bombardment. Then Russian paratroopers launched a helicopter-borne air assault, depositing troops in Mi-8 helicopters escorted by Ka-52 attack helicopters.

Very dangerous; it’s just 15 minutes west of the capital ring road. pic.twitter.com/JhlyVktVRC — Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) February 24, 2022

This was a risky operation as helicopters remain quite vulnerable to short-range air defenses. Indeed, at least two Ka-52s appear to have been downed near Hostomel.

However, the paratroopers reportedly secured the airport, which may now be converted into a logistical hub to land supplies and more airborne. Landing cargo aircraft there could still be risky, though, should Ukrainian air defense forces remain active in the area.

Kharkiv and Mariupol—Bombarded but Defiant

Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city is situated just 15 miles south of the border with Russia. During the preceding buildup, large Russian forces including armored units of the elite 1st Guards Tank Army massed in the city of Belgorod. In the opening hours of the war, a massive barrage of artillery rockets could be seen launching from Belgorod to come plummeting down on targets around Kharkiv.

But while Russian forces have advanced over the border towards Kharkiv, they reportedly have allegedly been stymied by effective Ukrainian resistance.

80 miles northwest of Kharkiv, though, Russian forces reportedly seized the road hub city of Sumy (population around 260,000), which can used as an additional corridor with which to advance towards Kyiv. However, Russian vehicle columns allegedly suffer substantial losses to U.S.-supplied Javelin missiles.

Far to the south, the long-besieged port of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov has come under renewed attack. However, the defenses at Mariupol reportedly held against initial Russian attacks, with at least two Russian soldiers captured.

Unfortunately, Russian advances to the west appear certain to cut supply lines to both of these cities.

Russian forces break out of Crimean Peninsula, capture Kherson on Dnieper River

Troops from Russia’s 22nd Army Corps in Crimea, heavily reinforced by other armies, have broken through Ukrainian defenses along at least two axes and advanced dozens of miles north to reportedly capture the major Ukrainian city of Kherson (population 280,000), which lies on the Dnieper River. Russian forces are also reportedly advancing eastward in attempt to seize another Dnieper River bridge at Nova Kakhovka.

This is a heavy blow considering how an attack from this axis was relatively predictable and the terrain seemed defensible. Combined with Russian troops advancing south in the area around Kyiv, this could set the stage for Russian forces to cut off supply lines to all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper.

Waiting in the wings

Despite attacking Ukraine on every possible front, Russia has yet to deploy all of the forces it has amassed. Additional VDV airborne troops remain on standby for air landing operations, which could be delivered by helicopter, parachute, or by landing directly onto the runways of newly captured or undefended airports. It also has heavily reinforced naval infantry brigades in amphibious tank-landing ships in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov that has yet to be put into action.

Whether out of shock or possibly according to a defensive strategy, Ukrainian forces do not appear to have significantly impeded Russian mechanized forces rapidly advancing across open terrain towards Kyiv and Kherson. Likely, Ukrainian forces will have the most success combatting Russian troops in cities, where concealment is abundant, reducing the effectiveness of Russian airpower, surveillance assets, and ‘non-contact’ warfare tactics.

Moscow surely hopes to compel Kyiv’s surrender without having to storm particularly Kharkiv and Kyiv one block at a time. If Ukraine’s military insists on an urban fight, though, it could inflict heavy losses on Russia, but at the cost of massive urban destruction and loss of civilian life as occurred in Aleppo, Grozny (Chechnya) and Sarajevo.

Ukrainian forces downed an enemy aircraft over Kyiv in the early hours of Friday, which then crashed into a residential building and set it on fire, said Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister.

Russia has launched a barrage of missile, artillery and air attacks on Ukraine early Thursday, triggering the worst security crisis Europe has witnessed in decades. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry warned that the capital, Kyiv, was being targeted and urged citizens to go to shelters. Ukraine’s border guard said that it was being shelled from five regions, including from Crimea in the south and Belarus to the north, and that Russian forces had crossed into the country.

The U.S.-drafted resolution is then expected to be taken up by the 193-member UN General Assembly within days, a senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier on Thursday.

The United Nations Security Council will vote on Friday on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia for invading Ukraine and require Moscow to immediately and unconditionally withdraw, but the measure is set to fail because Moscow can cast a veto.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday and Kyiv has reported dozens of casualties and hundreds of wounded.

A series of explosions were heard in Kyiv earlier which Herashchenko said were the sounds of air defenses firing at the aircraft.

It was unclear whether the aircraft was manned. Herashchenko wrote on Telegram that a nine-story residential building was on fire.

As Russian forces attacked cities across Ukraine, requests for volunteers began to appear on hacker forums on Thursday morning, as many residents fled the capital Kyiv.

The government of Ukraine is asking for volunteers from the country’s hacker underground to help protect critical infrastructure and conduct cyber spying missions against Russian troops, according two people involved in the project.

Although action will be blocked in the 15-member Security Council, Washington and allies see a vote as a chance to show Moscow is isolated over its actions. Diplomats said it appeared at least 11 members would vote in favor, while it was unclear how China, India and the United Arab Emirates would vote.

The volunteers would be divided into defensive and offensive cyber units. The defensive unit would be employed to defend infrastructure such as power plants and water systems. In a 2015 cyberattack, widely attributed to Russia state hackers, 225,000 Ukrainians lost electricity.

A person directly involved in the effort confirmed that the request came from the Defense Ministry on Thursday morning.

“Ukrainian cybercommunity! It’s time to get involved in the cyber defense of our country,” the post read, asking hackers and cybersecurity experts to submit an application via Google docs, listing their specialties, such as malware development, and professional references.

A Ukrainian security official said earlier this month that the country had no dedicated military cyber force, the Washington Post reported. “It’s our task to create them this year,” he told the Washington Post.

The effort to build a cyber military force is coming late in the game, Aushev acknowledged.

“We have an army inside our country,” said Yegor Aushev, co-founder of a cybersecurity company in Kyiv. “We need to know what they are doing.” On Wednesday, a newly discovered piece of destructive software was found circulating in Ukraine, hitting hundreds of computers, according to researchers at the cybersecurity firm ESET. Suspicion fell on Russia, which has repeatedly been accused of hacks against Ukraine and other countries.

The Biden administration announced sweeping export restrictions against Russia on Thursday, hammering its access to global exports of goods from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts.

Russia’s benchmark MOEX Russia Index closed 33 per cent lower in Moscow, the fifth-worst plunge in stock market history in local currency terms. It marked the first time since 1987’s Black Monday crash that a decline of that magnitude hit a market worth more than US$50 billion.

But it got much worse for their net worth after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. In less than 24 hours, they lost US$39 billion — more than they had up to that point this year.

Russia’s wealthiest individuals were already feeling the squeeze from escalating tensions between the nation and Ukraine.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin, when making threats about using nuclear weapons, needs to understand that NATO, too, is a nuclear alliance.

In a White House speech announcing the new controls, President Joe Biden said they would “impose severe costs on the Russian economy both immediately and over time,” noting that allies including 27 members of the European Union such as France, Germany and Italy, as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, had joined in the response to maximize its impact.

The controls, announced by the Commerce Department and first reported by Reuters, rely on a dramatic expansion of the so-called Foreign Direct Product Rule, forcing companies making high- and low-tech items overseas with U.S. tools to seek a license from the United States before shipping to Russia.

“Yes, I think that Vladimir Putin must also understand that the Atlantic alliance is a nuclear alliance. That is all I will say about this,” Le Drian said on French television TF1.

Asked whether Putin’s threat of “such consequences that you have never encountered in your history” was tantamount to threatening to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, Le Drian said it was understood as such.

Russian forces fired missiles at several cities in Ukraine and landed troops on its coast on Thursday, officials and media said, after President Vladimir Putin authorized what he called a special military operation in the east.

“For more than 70 years, we have avoided large-scale war in Europe,” said U.S. senator Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “With his illegal invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has tragically brought decades of general peace to an end.

MOSCOW/KYIV — Russian forces fired missiles at several Ukrainian cities and landed troops on its south coast on Thursday, officials and media said, after President Vladimir Putin authorized what he called a special military operation in the east.

The assault came shortly after Putin declared on state television that Russia was beginning a military operation for the “demilitarization and denazification” of eastern Ukraine. He said that Russia did not intend to occupy the country. But explosions were occurring across a wide swath of Ukraine’s territory, not just near separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, suggesting that at least for now, Russia intended a far wider operation.

“Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.

“This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”

Flashes could be seen and explosions could be heard in Kyiv, a city of 3 million people, as a senior Ukrainian official said the city’s main airport was under assault. Explosions could also be heard in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city, which lies just 12 miles from the border with Russia. A Ukrainian official also said the city of Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, was being shelled.

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” U.S. President Joe Biden said. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a military operation in eastern Ukraine on Thursday in what appeared to be the start of war in Europe over Russia’s demands for an end to NATO’s eastward expansion.

Shortly after Putin spoke in a special televised address on Russian state TV, explosions could be heard in the pre-dawn quiet of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Gunfire rattled near the capital’s main airport, the Interfax news agency said.

Explosions also rocked the breakaway eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk and civilian aircraft were warned away as the United States said a major attack by Russia on its neighbor was imminent.

Putin said he had authorized a special military operation in breakaway areas of eastern Ukraine and clashes between Russian and Ukrainian forces were only a matter of time.

Hours earlier, pro-Russian separatists issued a plea to Moscow for help to stop alleged Ukrainian aggression – claims the United States dismissed as Russian propaganda.

Putin said he had ordered Russian forces to protect the people and demanded Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.

“All responsibility for bloodshed will be on the conscience of the ruling regime in Ukraine,” Putin said.

A wholly unprovoked attack on a peaceful country 🇺🇦 is unfolding. Horrified. Just because you’ve prepared and thought about this possibility for weeks and months doesn’t mean it isn’t shocking when it actually happens. — Melinda Simmons (@MelSimmonsFCDO) February 24, 2022

He repeated his position that NATO expansion to include Ukraine was unacceptable and said Russia had been left with no choice but to defend itself against what he said were threats emanating from Ukraine.

The scope of the Russian military operation was not immediately clear. Moscow has long denied that it has plans to invade despite massing tens of thousands of troops near its neighbour.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy said on Wednesday that Moscow had approved an offensive and had not replied to an invitation for talks.

“Today I initiated a telephone conversation with the President of the Russian Federation. The result was silence,” he said.

U.S. President Joe Biden said his prayers were with the people of Ukraine “as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces.”

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.”

He said he would announce further sanctions on Russia on Thursday, in addition to financial measures imposed this week.

President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. https://t.co/Q7eUJ0CG3k — President Biden (@POTUS) February 24, 2022

The Russian operations began as the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on the Ukraine crisis in New York.

A draft resolution calling out Moscow over its actions toward its neighbor is doomed to fail due to Russia veto power, however a Security Council diplomat said it would put Russia on notice that it is “not in compliance with international law.”

Ukraine restricted civilian flights in its airspace due to “potential hazard,” hours after a conflict zone monitor warned airlines should stop overflights over the risk of an unintended shooting down or cyber attack.

An El Al flight from Tel Aviv to Toronto and a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Kyiv turned out of Ukraine’s airspace around the time a notice was issued, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24.

Russia also partially closed its airspace in the Rostov flight information region to the east of its border with Ukraine “in order to provide safety” for civil aviation flights, according to its notice to airmen.

Convoys of military equipment including nine tanks were seen moving towards Donetsk earlier on Wednesday from the direction of the Russian border, a Reuters witness reported.

Shelling has intensified since Monday when Putin recognized two separatist regions as independent and ordered the deployment of what he called peacekeepers, a move the West calls the start of an invasion.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke separately with her counterparts from Britain and Canada, while G7 leaders are also due to talk on Thursday.

Satellite imagery taken on Wednesday showed new deployments in western Russia, many of them within 10 miles (16 km) of the border with Ukraine and less than 50 miles from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, U.S. satellite company Maxar said.

The images showed field deployment, military convoys, artillery and armored personnel carriers with support equipment and troops. The images could not be independently verified by Reuters.

A 30-day state of emergency in Ukraine restricting the freedom of movement of conscripted reservists, curbing the media and imposing personal document checks, according to a draft text, begins on Thursday.

The Ukrainian government has also announced compulsory military service for all men of fighting age.

Western countries and Japan imposed sanctions on Russian banks and individuals but have held off their toughest measures until an invasion began.

The United States stepped up the pressure on Wednesday by imposing penalties on the Russian firm building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and its corporate officers.

Germany on Tuesday froze approvals for the pipeline, which has been built but was not yet in operation, amid concerns it could allow Moscow to weaponize energy supplies to Europe.

10:10 p.m.

Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized a special military operation in Ukraine’s Donbass region in the early hours of Thursday morning and told the Ukrainian military to lay down its weapons and go home.

In a special televised address on Russian state TV, Putin said Russia has been left with no choice but to defend itself against what he said were threats emanating from modern Ukraine.

Putin also made an appeal to the Ukrainian military.

“I urge you to immediately lay down your weapons and go home. All servicemen of the Ukrainian army who fulfill this demand will be able to freely leave the combat zone and return to their families.”

The scope of the Russian military operation in Ukraine was not immediately clear. A Reuters reporter in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, heard explosions which sounded like artillery shelling in the distance soon after Putin had finished speaking.

Putin said Russia would respond instantly if any external force tried to interfere and that Moscow would try to de-militarize and ‘de-Nazify’ Ukraine.

“Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of modern Ukraine,” said Putin.

His comments come after the United States said Russia had stationed nearly 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders and after Russian-backed separatists appealed to him for military help against what they said was growing Ukrainian aggression.

Kyiv has denied any such aggression.

7:45 p.m.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expects Russia to invade Ukraine before the night is over but still sees a chance to “avert a major aggression,” told NBC News on Wednesday.

“Everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine,” Blinken told NBC, adding he could not be precise about time or place.

7:40 p.m.

United Nations Security Council members are preparing to put forward a draft resolution on Ukraine that will call out Russia over its actions toward its neighbor, said a Security Council diplomat, but the move is doomed to fail.

It will not be adopted by the 15-member council as Russia is a veto power – along with the United States, France, Britain and China – but it gives Washington and allies a chance to show that Moscow is internationally isolated over its actions on Ukraine.

“We work on the resolution in the Security Council. I hope we can move to action in the next hours or days, … and if we cannot succeed in the Security Council we’ll go right away to the General Assembly,” said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

5:20 p.m.

Satellite imagery taken on Wednesday showed a number of new deployments in western Russia, many of them within 10 miles of the border with Ukraine and less than 50 miles from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, a private U.S. company said.

The images shared with Reuters showed field deployment, military convoys, artillery and armored personnel carriers with support equipment and troops. The images released by Maxar Technologies, which has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces for weeks, could not be independently verified by Reuters.

2:30 p.m.

The Canadian military’s limits are being put to the test with the deployment of hundreds of additional troops and hardware to reinforce the NATO military alliance in eastern Europe.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Tuesday that Canada will deploy an additional 460 Canadian troops to help NATO in its standoff with Russia, including an artillery unit, a naval frigate and a surveillance aircraft.

It’s unclear what impact, if any, the deployment of additional forces to Europe will have on Canada’s other military commitments in Asia as well as the Middle East, where hundreds of Canadian troops continue to participate in the fight against the Islamic State.

2:15 p.m.

U.S. President Joe Biden said his administration will impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company in charge of building Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.

“Today, I have directed my administration to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told representatives of the finance industry, regulators and trade associations on Wednesday he wanted the toughest possible next tranche of sanctions against Russia, a government source said.

Johnson met regulators and heads of top banks and financial sector industry groups to discuss the government’s approach to sanctions against Russia after Moscow heightened fears of a full-scale invasion by recognizing breakaway regions in Ukraine.

The government source said the prime minister told the meeting he wanted the “toughest possible next tranche” and that he thought it “will make a difference and change the outcome. Putin must fail.”

Cyberattack on Ukraine government sites reported.

Several government websites as well as some banks faced a DDOS attack around 4 p.m. local time, the Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov said on social network Telegram.

The web pages of ministries including the Foreign Ministry and the Defence Ministry are either temporarily out of order or are not operating smoothly. The respective press offices acknowledged problems with the sites, but didn’t elaborate on the reason.

“We’ve not seen something [like this] that’s taken it to a completely different level,” an official told the BBC.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan left for Moscow on Wednesday to push for the construction of a long-delayed, multi-billion-dollar gas pipeline to be built in collaboration with Russian companies, an official said.

Khan’s trip to meet President Vladimir Putin and discuss issues including economic cooperation comes hours after a number of Western nations hit Russia with new sanctions for its military deployment into parts of eastern Ukraine.

“Both countries are eager to launch the project at the earliest,” Pakistan’s energy ministry spokesman told Reuters about the Pakistan Stream gas pipeline. He confirmed that Energy Minister Hammad Azhar is accompanying Khan on the visit.

7:00 a.m.

A Russian-backed leader in the breakaway Donetsk region of Ukraine said that a military mobilization was gathering pace to counter Ukrainian “aggression.”

Denis Pushilin, leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic that was recognized by Russia this week, said the situation had become critical but the separatists would win with support from “big Russia.”

Andrey Turchak, a senior member of Russia’s ruling party, said no force in the world could change the legal result of Russia’s recognition of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.

On a visit to Donetsk, Turchak told the separatist leader of the Russian-backed Donetsk People’s Republic that Russia would not abandon its people.

He said 93,000 people had already been evacuated over the border to Russia.

6:18 a.m.

The European Union’s member states have given their green light, via their envoys in Brussels, to a first package of sanctions on Russia, an EU diplomat said.

The sanctions still need formal approval by the foreign ministers.

The EU chose not to sanction Putin himself but instead blacklist all members of the lower house of the Russian parliament who voted in favour of the recognition of the breakaway regions, freezing any assets they have in the EU and banning them from traveling to the bloc.

Banks involved in financing separatist activities in eastern Ukraine will also be targeted and the two enclaves will be removed from a free-trade deal between the EU and Ukraine.

The impact of the new sanctions on banks and of limits on the Russian government’s ability to raise capital on the EU’s financial markets is likely to be limited.

Western governments for now are preferring to keep the much larger sanctions packages that they have planned in reserve should the crisis escalate.

Ukraine will introduce a nationwide state of emergency in which special restrictions will apply in order to keep the country calm and protect its economy amid fears of a Russian invasion, a senior Ukrainian security official said.

The state of emergency will last for 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days, Oleksiy Danilov told a briefing. Parliament must now vote to enact the decision.

Introducing a state of emergency gives powers to the authorities, who can choose which ones to implement. These could include restrictions on transport, extra protection for critical infrastructure and a ban on strikes.

Regional authorities can make decisions on whether to introduce curfews and other measures, Danilov said.

“These are preventive measures to keep calm in the country, so that our economy and our country can work,” Danilov said.

“Depending on the threats that may arise in certain territories, there will be either a more strengthened or more weakened state of emergency. We are talking about border areas where we have a border with the Russian Federation, with Belarus,” he said.

Ukraine’s parliament voted to approve in the first reading a draft law which gives permission to Ukrainians to carry firearms and act in self-defence.

“The adoption of this law is fully in the interests of the state and society,” the authors of the draft law said in a note, adding that the law was needed due to “existing threats and dangers for the citizens of Ukraine.”

Ukraine’s parliament on Wednesday approved imposing sanctions on 351 Russians, including lawmakers who supported the recognition of the independence of separatist-controlled territories and the use of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine.

The sanctions restrict almost all possible types of activities, in particular a ban on entry into Ukraine, prohibit access to assets, capital, property, licenses for business. The security council was due to impose the sanctions after the vote.

European Union governments expect to set a 1400 GMT Wednesday deadline for formal approval of a package of sanctions drawn up to punish Russia for its move on two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, a senior EU diplomat said.

Ukraine has started conscripting reservists aged 18-60 following a decree by President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy, the armed forces said in a statement.

Ukraine’s foreign ministry warned Ukrainians not to visit Russia and urged its citizens already there to leave the country, in a travel advisory issued on Wednesday.

The Ukrainian military said on Wednesday one soldier had been killed and six wounded in shelling by pro-Russian separatists in east Ukraine in the past 24 hours as ceasefire violations remain at a high level.

The military said on its Facebook page it had recorded 96 incidents of shelling by separatists over the past 24 hours compared with 84 a day earlier. It said separatist forces used heavy artillery, mortars and Grad rocket systems.

The mission of the International Monetary Fund is starting its work in Ukraine for the second review of the Fund-supported program, the global lender said on Wednesday.

Ukraine hopes that the continuation of cooperation with the IMF can reassure markets that have been rattled by tensions with Russia and that the talks will result in disbursement of US$700 million under its US$5 billion IMF program.
