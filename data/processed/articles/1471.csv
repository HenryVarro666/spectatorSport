The Russian offensive against Ukraine remains largely static as of late March 19, with mobile ground operations appearing to be concentrated in the south of the country as well as the Donbas region. Heavy fighting has been reported around the cities of Mariupol and Severodonetsk in recent days as the Kremlin seeks to achieve its military aim of seizing control of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in addition to establishing a land bridge between Russia and Crimea. Nevertheless, a one-day humanitarian corridor and localized ceasefire were reportedly observed in the Luhansk Region starting at 09:00 March 19, enabling the evacuation of refugees from the towns of Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Popasna, and Lysychansk.

Russian air, missile, and artillery strikes against targets elsewhere in Ukraine also continue as of March 19. Daily shelling has been reported in several cities, including the capital, Kyiv, as well as Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy. In recent days, shelling and aerial bombardments have also occurred in Vinnytsia, Izyum, Kremenchuk, Bila Tserkva, Nikopol, Mykolaiv, Kyiv, Izmail, Odesa, Poltava, and Zaporizhzhia. Russian missiles have also sporadically targeted military facilities in western Ukraine, including an aviation repair facility near Danylo Halytskyi International Airport (LWO) in the Lviv Region along with a missile and aircraft munitions depot near the village of Deliatyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk Region.

Though Russian advances have slowed or halted, ground assaults continue to take place in several locations, albeit at a lower intensity than in the initial phase of the conflict. Russian forces have clashed with Ukrainian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv without making significant advances. Inconclusive clashes have also reportedly taken place on the outskirts of Izyum, in Kharkiv Region, as well as in areas surrounding the city. Mariupol continues to face ground assaults on its eastern and western outskirts amid heavy bombardment; Russia-backed forces have occupied several satellite towns around Mariupol.

Protests denouncing the Russian offensive and the subsequent occupation have taken place in multiple urban centers. Residents have held protests in locations throughout the Kherson Region in recent days; Russian forces reportedly fired into the air to disperse a gathering in Kherson March 14. Elsewhere, protests have been held in Berdyansk and Melitopol, which are also under Russian occupation. These actions highlight the difficulty Russian forces may encounter when attempting to impose order in some cities under their occupation.

Disruptions and Shortages

Ukrainian Railways (UZ) continues to operate evacuation trains from Kyiv and multiple other areas, including Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvyi Rih, Zakarpattia, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa. Clashes and artillery strikes periodically prompt the suspension of evacuations. Large crowds continue to be reported at stations offering evacuation services. Intercity and regional rail services are available intermittently; rail services are subject to disruptions without warning. Civilian aviation is suspended and the nation's seaports are closed.

Nightly curfews are in effect in multiple regions during various time frames. In the Kyiv Region, a curfew is in place 20:00-06:00 on March 19 and 20; in Mikolaiv, a nightly 20:00-06:00 curfew will enter into force on March 20. In Zaporizhzhia, authorities have imposed a curfew from 16:00 March 19 through 06:00 March 21; the city's railway station will suspend operations during this time frame. Generally, civilians must stay indoors during curfew hours; exemptions are in place for workers in critical infrastructure, and persons seeking urgent medical care or bomb shelters. Depending on the ground situation, authorities may extend or amend curfew hours on short notice.

Intermittent telecommunications, internet, and utility disruptions continue across much of the country. Reports also indicate a shortage of basic supplies, including groceries and pharmaceutical products, in multiple cities facing Russian ground assaults. The most severe shortages and disruptions are consistently reported in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol, which have suffered heavy bombardments and repeated ground assaults in recent days. Similar situations are likely in other cities facing Russian ground offensives or heavy bombardments. Finally, the National Bank of Ukraine has limited foreign currency transfers and withdrawals.

Ukraine's borders with Belarus, Russia, and the Transnistria region of Moldova are closed to foreign nationals; only Ukrainian citizens can enter from these areas. Ukraine's borders with Hungary, Moldova, Poland, and Slovakia remain open. Though congestion has eased since the early days of the conflict, delays may worsen depending on conflict developments elsewhere in the country.

Context

Negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials are ongoing. Although recent talks have failed to yield any concrete de-escalation of the conflict, officials from both sides have intimated that progress is being made. Both Russian and Ukrainian positions are believed to have softened with Moscow no longer demanding Ukraine's unconditional surrender, while Kyiv has indicated a willingness to abandon the pursuit of NATO membership in exchange for security guarantees. However, the official negotiating positions of each country are still far apart. Ukraine has demanded a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces, while Russia has demanded that Ukraine surrender, disarm, and declare itself to be a neutral country remaining outside NATO and the EU.

The Verkhovna Rada (parliament) has voted to extend martial law through April 25. Martial law gives the government emergency powers to carry out extraordinary measures for the defense of the country. Public gatherings are prohibited and authorities may use private property for the needs of defense.

Advice

Avoid travel to Ukraine until the situation stabilizes; consider exiting the country if safe to do so. Where fighting or airstrikes are occurring, shelter in place until the situation becomes clear. If officials report incoming fire, stay away from windows and exterior walls. Strictly heed the instructions of local security personnel, particularly when ordered to air-raid shelters. Stockpile food, fuel, and water when possible and safe to do so. Maintain contact with your diplomatic representation. Confirm that a thorough communication plan exists to ensure rapid accountability for all personnel operating in Ukraine. Reconfirm the status of public transport services, road routes, and borders before departure.

Rodrigo Abd / AP KYIV — In peacetime, Ukraine has a thriving surrogate industry, one of the few countries where foreigners can get Ukrainian women to carry their pregnancies. Now at least 20 of those babies are stuck in a makeshift bomb shelter in Ukraine’s capital, waiting for parents to travel into the war zone to pick them up. They’re well cared for at the moment. Surrogacy center nurses are stranded with them, because constant shelling makes it too dangerous for them to go home. Russian troops are trying to encircle the city, with Ukrainian defenders holding them off for now, the threat comes from the air. Nurse Lyudmilla Yashchenko says they’re staying in the bomb shelter to save their lives, and the lives of the babies, some of whom are just days old. They have enough food and baby supplies for now, and can only hope and wait for the newborns to be picked up, and the war to end. Share this -

Zelenskyy appeals to Russians: 'These are wives, these are children, relatives and friends' In a portion of his latest address early Sunday, Ukraine's president appealed to Russians' humanity and sense of justice. Speaking in Russian, his first language, Zelenskyy claimed 14,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the invasion, which began Feb. 24. ""This is 14,000 mothers,"" Zelenskyy said, according to an NBC News translation of his remarks. ""This is 14,000 fathers. These are wives, these are children, relatives and friends. And you don't notice it? But there will only be more victims. As long as this war continues. Your war is against us, Russia against Ukraine. On our land."" Estimates of the number of Russian soldiers killed in the conflict have varied, and NBC News has not independently verified the death toll. It's not clear if Zelenskyy's appeals — this wasn't the first — hit their mark, but there have been signs of unease and even dissent in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has cracked down on news media and all but banned displays of disagreement with the Kremlin. Nearly 15,000 protesters have been arrested in Russia since the war began, according to OVD-Info, a Moscow-based human rights group that tracks police detentions. Zelenskyy said at the top of his address, in Ukrainian, that the nation doesn't want to kill. “Ukraine has always sought a peaceful solution,"" he said. ""Even more we are interested in peace now. Because we count everyone who is killed. Because it means something to us, every ruined family, every ruined house. Because we are Ukrainians, and for us a person is priceless."" Share this -







Get Ukrainian fighters 'every bit of support' possible, U.S. lawmaker says WARSAW — A bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers visiting Poland said Saturday that the most urgent need in Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion is to equip and support the country in every way that will help it defend its independence. The seven-member delegation led by Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Democrat from Massachusetts, has visited reception centers for refugees from Ukraine in eastern Poland. They noted Poland’s openness in accepting refugees from Ukraine, including in private homes. More than 2 million people fleeing war have come to Poland since Feb. 24, when Russia’s troops invaded Ukraine. “We are here to reassure and support the people of Ukraine. We are here to thank the people of Poland for the unbelievable generosity they have shown to the refugees,” said Lynch, who is chairman of the subcommittee on National Security in the Committee on Oversight and Reform. During an online meeting with the media Saturday, the American lawmakers stressed the need to urgently assist Ukraine’s military in their fight against Russian forces. They said there is no room for peace talks as long as there is a “hot war.” “The most urgent action that we can take is to make sure that the Ukrainian fighters — those valiant patriots who are fighting for their freedom — have every bit of equipment, every bit of supply, every bit of support that we can possibly deliver to them,” Lynch said.

Ukrainian refugees line up for ID cards in Poland WARSAW — Hoping to restore some normalcy after fleeing the war in Ukraine, thousands of refugees waited in long lines Saturday in the Polish capital of Warsaw to get identification cards that will allow them to get on with their lives — at least for now. Refugees started queuing by Warsaw’s National Stadium overnight to get the coveted PESEL identity cards that will allow them to work, live, go to school and get medical care or social benefits for the next 18 months. Still, by mid-morning, many were told to come back another day. The demand was too high even though Polish authorities had simplified the process. “We are looking for a job now,” said 30-year-old Kateryna Lohvyn, standing in the line with her mother. She said it has taken some time to recover from the shock of the Russian invasion. “We don’t yet know (what to do),” she added. “But we are thankful to the Poles. They fantastically welcome us.” Maryna Liashuk said the warm welcome from Poland has made her feel at home already. If the situation worsens, Liashuk said she would like to stay permanently in Poland with her family. Share this -







Russian cosmonauts say yellow and blue suit colors match alma mater When three Russian cosmonauts arrived at the International Space Station wearing yellow flight suits with blue accents, some saw a message in them wearing the colors of the Ukrainian flag. They shot that down on Saturday. Cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev said each crew picks the colors about six months before launch because the suits need to be individually sewn. And since all three graduated from Bauman Moscow State Technical University, they chose the colors of their prestigious alma mater. “There is no need to look for any hidden signs or symbols in our uniform,” Artemyev said in a statement on the Russian space agency’s Telegram channel. “A color is simply a color. It is not in any way connected to Ukraine. Otherwise, we would have to recognize its rights to the yellow sun in the blue sky. “These days, even though we are in space, we are together with our president and our people!” Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the space agency Roscosmos, tweeted a picture of the university’s blue and gold coat of arms. Shortly after their arrival at the orbiting station on Friday, Artemyev had a different answer about the flight suits, saying there was a lot of the yellow material in storage and “that’s why we had to wear yellow.” Share this -







More than 4,000 able to leave Mariupol through humanitarian corridors Amid the rubble of Mariupol, an estimated 4,128 civilians were able to leave the besieged port city through one of eight humanitarian corridors opened Saturday, a top Ukrainian official said. They were taken to Zaporizhzhia, where an additional 500 Mariupol residents will go Sunday on minibuses, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in an NBC News translation. Mariupol has been the target of an ongoing assault by Russian forces, who are alleged to have attacked civilians and Ukrainian troops with indifference. Russia has denied targeting civilians. The port city has been without electricity, heat, water, food or medical supplies for days. Vereshchuk reported that continued fire from Russian troops prevented evacuations from Borodyanka in the Kyiv region. More than 1,800 in other areas near the capital were able to get out via humanitarian routes, he said. In a recorded speech posted early Sunday, Zelenskyy said they would not abandon attempts to evacuate residents. In the Luhansk region, 675 people were evacuated; in Lysychansk, the number was 160; in Sievierodonetsk, 160; Rubizhne, 45; and in Popasna 310 people fled. In the Kherson region, 14 vehicles with humanitarian aid were stopped en route, thwarting delivery for now, the deputy prime minister said. Share this -

U.S. aid groups help to move orphans away from the conflict American group helps guide Ukrainian orphans to safety March 19, 2022 03:00 LVIV, Ukraine — As orphans, they were already among some of the most vulnerable people in Ukraine before the Russian invasion. Now some are being helped to move away from the conflict by American aid groups. “Some of their children, they’ve lost their family, so it’s pretty traumatic,"" said Dr. Sherri Mcclurg from New Horizons for Children. She added that their situation was ""just heartbreaking."" Seth Griffith, Director of Disaster Response for aid group Aerial Recovery said that his group had been assisting local government ""into safe areas in the country where we can house them and feed them and keep them maintained in the system so that we don’t lose track."" A lot of the American volunteers are ex-military personnel. But for at least one volunteer taking Ukraine's orphans under his wing, flying to the country to provide aid was an instinctive decision. “I was one of them at one point. So it only felt natural to be able to come in and help out,” said Vlad Fin, an Aerial Recovery volunteer who grew up as an orphan in Kharkiv before being adopted by a U.S. family. Share this -







Millions of children have fled Ukraine as refugees since February, UNICEF says More than 1.5 million children have fled Ukraine as refugees since Feb. 24, UNICEF's Executive Director Catherine Russell said Saturday. Countless others have been displaced since Russia invaded the country. Afshan Khan, UNICEF’s Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia, said the staggering number of child refugees could lead to a spike in human trafficking and exploration. ""Displaced children are extremely vulnerable to being separated from their families, exploited, and trafficked. They need governments in the region to step up and put measures in place to keep them safe,"" Khan said in a statement. From the start of the war in mid-February to March 17, more than 500 unaccompanied Ukrainian children were found crossing the border into Romania, UNICEF said. The organization warned that the actual number of separated children fleeing to neighboring countries is much higher. To help reunite these children with their families, UNICEF and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have set up ""Blue Dots,"" which are places fleeing families can go for help. “Children fleeing the war in Ukraine need to be screened for their vulnerability as they cross into a neighboring country,” said Khan. “Every effort should be made to strengthen screening processes at refugee border crossings.” Share this -







Chinese minister blames NATO for war in Ukraine China's vice foreign minister reiterated blame against NATO for the war in Ukraine and criticized sanctions against Russia in a speech delivered at a conference in Beijing Saturday.

Why some countries want to stay on friendly terms with Russia Despite outrage in Western capitals over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, many other countries around the world — including some important U.S. allies and partners — have been reluctant to confront Russia or to support economic sanctions against Moscow, experts and former U.S. officials say. A small number of countries have declared unqualified backing for Russia since its forces rolled into Ukraine, including regimes in Syria, Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela. But a longer list of governments, including China, have avoided using the word “invasion,” abstained from U.N. votes castigating Russia or declined to take part in punishing sanctions on Russia’s economy. The ambivalent response from governments around the world reflects how Russia is able to use its oil wealth, defense industry and historic ties to retain a degree of influence in foreign capitals. It remains unclear if countries that are straddling the fence can offer a valuable lifeline to Moscow, or whether these states can play a meaningful role mediating an eventual end to the conflict. Russia is watching the response of other countries closely, including customers for its defense industry and fellow oil producers. But one government in particular may hold the key for Moscow — China. Experts say only Beijing has the economic heft and global power to help soften the blow of harsh economic sanctions introduced by the United States and the European Union, or to potentially persuade Moscow to pull back from its military offensive in Ukraine.

Poland proposes total European Union trade ban with Russia Poland has proposed to the European Union that the bloc impose a total ban on trade with Russia, Prime Minister Mateus Morawiecki said on Saturday, urging tougher sanctions on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. ""Poland is proposing to add a trade blockade to this package of sanctions as soon as possible, (including) both of its seaports... but also a ban on land trade. Fully cutting off Russia's trade would further force Russia to consider whether it would be better to stop this cruel war,"" Morawiecki said. Earlier this week E.U. member states agreed on a fourth package of sanctions against Russia. Details were not disclosed, but the French presidency said Russia's ""most-favoured nation"" trade status would be revoked. Share this -
