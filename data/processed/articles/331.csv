1,f7273b8e-f7ef-4861-a185-9ee7ed497bc8,[],,"ZAGREB, Croatia — An unidentified flying object, which local media reported could be a Soviet-era drone, crashed in the Croatian capital Zagreb Thursday night, police say.

Several parked vehicles were damaged in the 9:00 p.m. accident, but there are no reports of anyone injured, an interior ministry statement says this morning.

Police rushed to the scene after residents reported that they “felt a detonation preceded by a fall of an object from the sky,” the statement says.

In a park close to the Jarun lake, some six kilometers (four miles) from the city center, police found a crater and two parachutes nearby, it adds.

Local media quoted military aviation experts as saying that the device that crashed could have been a Soviet-era Tu-141 reconnaissance drone used by Ukraine.

Police sealed off the site and temporarily halted public transport in the area.

2,f7273b8e-f7ef-4861-a185-9ee7ed497bc8,['Tyler Rogoway'],2022-03-10 21:17:51,"In what can only be deemed a totally bizarre event, Croatia's capital of Zagreb was awakened to a loud blast just hours ago only to find a large crater filled with what appeared to be aircraft parts. Some said it was a plane that crashed and that parachutes were seen nearby, others said it was a missile. After close examination of the visual evidence, The War Zone strongly believes this was actually a Tu-141 ""Strizh"" reconnaissance drone that must have severely malfunctioned and crossed over the entirety of Hungary or parts of neighboring countries and into Croatia from Ukraine. Flying direct from Ukraine's border to Zagreb is nearly a 350-mile journey. It has been reported that Ukraine has been putting the high-speed, Soviet-era drones to work in recent days following Russia's invasion of the country. Ukraine is the only known current operator of the Tu-141.

We were first alerted to the mysterious crash by @Darkstar_OSINT who quickly briefed us on the strange situation and the claims surrounding it. Upon inspecting the wreckage and considering the odd and somewhat conflicting reports, as well as the biggest news story of the year occurring in the region, we concluded only one aircraft really fit the bill—the Tu-141.

It just so happens one of the wings was left largely intact, allowing us to verify our hunch. Still, the fact that this drone flew so far off course is both puzzling and alarming. But it would not be the first loss of the Tu-141 of the war. Another went down in Ukraine just days ago.

The Tu-141 is a fascinating piece of Soviet-era hardware that Ukraine has upgraded and made useful following the invasion of Crimea in 2014. More of a cruise missile than a traditional drone, the aircraft is rocket-launched from its trailer and flies a predetermined course at transonic speed, collecting various forms of intelligence, before recovering via parachute. It can then be reset and used again.

Ukraine MoD

The Tu-141's roots go back to its predecessor, the Tu-123, which first flew in 1960, but the Strizh is far from youthful, having first been introduced into service by the Soviet Union in the late 1970s. With a range of about 650 miles, the Tu-141 can take on some of the missions that a manned tactical reconnaissance jet can, but without the risk of losing the crew. Ukraine has also used the type as a target drone recently and it could also act as a decoy during combat, although this particular Tu-141 was heading in completely the wrong direction for such a mission.

It's also possible that Russia has pulled some of these out of storage to act as crude decoys in a ploy to stimulate Ukraine's air defenses, but we have no proof of this at this time. This crashed example would have been beyond its stated range from the Russian border, although it could have reached Zagreb if it was launched from Belarus.

I don't think the folks in Croatia realize exactly what landed in their town just yet. It will be interesting to hear what Ukraine says about this. Also, it does raise some serious air defense readiness questions for the NATO countries that the Tu-141 flew over, if indeed that was the case. And as always, new information can emerge and details can change, but based on the information currently available, it seems very likely that the mysterious craft involved in this incident was indeed the Tu-141.

We will update this post as more information comes available.

UPDATE:

A release from Croatia's presidential office quotes President Zoran Milanovic as stating the ""pilotless military aircraft” entered Croatian airspace from neighboring Hungary flying at over 500 knots and around 4,000 feet in altitude. The drone crashed after it ran out of fuel and ""it is clear"" it came from Ukraine. Meanwhile, Hungary says it arrived in its airspace via Romania, but was not detected in real-time by anyone's air defenses. Nobody knows if it was launched by Ukraine or Russia at this time, but some accounts state it had red stars on it, which are Russian markings. The Russian Embassy in Croatia says that Russia stopped using the Tu-141 in the early 1990s.

President Milanovic underlined how serious this event was and how troubling it is that the drone was not detected during its relatively long flight, stating: “What I wonder is, how is it possible that an unsophisticated drone had flown unnoticed for nearly an hour in the air space of NATO member states, and that nobody noticed... This is not an issue for Hungary only, it is an issue for the joint NATO command in Spain that should have all the information in real-time, in the shortest possible period of time and react, yet nothing happened”.

This is surely a major issue, especially considering how on alert the NATO countries bordering Ukraine are right now and the extra air defense capabilities deployed within their borders at this time.

A criminal investigation has been launched by Croatian authorities into the incident.

MINISTER OF DEFENSE MARIO BANOŽIĆ AT THE #PRESS CONFERENCE: ""I call on the citizens to have no reason to worry. Contacts have been made about this extraordinary event and information has been exchanged with the services @NATO and neighboring countries with which we have intensive communication "".

The full release from the President of Croatia's office:

The President of the Republic and Commander in Chief Zoran Milanović addressed the public at a special press conference held because of the crash of the drone in a neighborhood of Zagreb. Earlier in the day President Milanović held a meeting with the Chief of the General Staff of the Croatian Armed Forces, the directors of the security and intelligence agencies, experts from the General Staff and intelligence services. In his public address, President Milanović stated that this is a “serious incident”, which according to available information, “was not directed against Croatia”. He called for calm from the citizens. “Therefore, we know where the object flew from, we had no advance warning. The drone flew over Hungary for over 40 minutes, it was less than seven minutes in the Croatian air space, and crashed in the Jarun neighbourhood, fortunately with no casualties. This is a serious incident according to information we have. An investigation is underway, we wish to ascertain all the facts. I call upon the citizens to be calm because events like this are bound to happen in such conflicts. We estimate that this was not directed against Croatia. Nevertheless, certain procedural things must be examined, we must ascertain how it has come to this, and how come a drone the size of an airplane was not struck down on its path from evidently Ukraine to Zagreb”, President Milanović stated. Asked how it is possible that Croatia did not undertake anything in terms of air defense and how is it possible that nobody undertook anything in other NATO member states over which the drone flew, President Milanović replied: “This is currently the object of a serious investigation in the states over which this drone flew for a long period of time. It was in Croatian air space briefly, therefore the question is, given the quality of the equipment we have could we have done anything?” He was further questioned whether the Croatian air defense detected at all this drone, and President Milanović replied: “The radars detected it, but it was in our air space for a very briefly. This is not the time to point the finger at anyone. I am not pointing the finger at anyone, but I demand exact facts”. President Milanović confirmed that he called the Prime Minister this morning to discuss the matter. “The facts will be ascertained. What I wonder is, how is it possible that an unsophisticated drone had flown unnoticed for nearly an hour in the air space of NATO member states, and that nobody noticed. An investigation is under way, this is not a job for the police only because they lack this kind of expertise. Military services and personnel are involved, and as things stand now, the drone flew in from Ukraine, at an altitude of 1,300 metres, at a speed of over 500 knots, which is slightly below 1,000 km/h, which is the speed of a commercial passenger aircraft, and crashed in Zagreb when it ran out of fuel. Control was lost over it”, President Milanović noted. Even though the drone came from the territory of Hungary, President Milanović said: “This is not an issue for Hungary only, it is an issue for the joint NATO command in Spain that should have all the information in real time, in the shortest possible period of time and react, yet nothing happened”. Journalists inquired whether a National Security Council session will be convened because of this incident. “A National Security Council session will be held when the Prime Minister and I agree on it. We have all the information for the time being. I have been thoroughly briefed. A National Security Council session used for a photo op is senseless. When at a time like this I call the Prime Minister or he calls me, when we coordinate and talk to a group of people that are the only ones in the country to know something, when I talk to the mayor, that’s that. The National Security Council is not an operational body”, President Milanović explained. Questioned further on the state of affairs in the Croatian air defense, President Milanović stated that “it is in the state as much as is invested in it”. He explained that we now depend on our Western allies until we get 12 French aircraft. He warned that they will be useless until we invest further resources in them. The President reminded that the rate of investments “is unsatisfactory”, something he has been saying for months and at the last Defense Council session. He has yet to receive the minutes of this session “because I demanded that there be a formulation about the state of affairs being unsatisfactory”. “Yes – unsatisfactory. We have not yet paid the price, but could have. Let us learn the lesson from this”, the President warned.

The crash triggered a loud blast, but there are no reported injuries

The drone may have crossed Hungary before crashing in Croatia

There is also a possibility that Russia used the drone as a crude decoy

An ""unidentified flying object"" that crashed in the Croatian capital Zagreb on Thursday may have been a malfunctioned reconnaissance drone that flew off course from Ukraine, said reports. Images of the wreckage, which appeared to be aircraft parts, lying inside a crater have been making the rounds on social media.

Analysis of the wreckage suggests the craft may be a Tu-141 ""Strizh"" reconnaissance drone from Ukraine, The Drive reported. The drone may have gone haywire before crossing Hungary and crashing in Croatia, which is 350 miles away from Ukraine.

According to Croatian authorities, the overnight crash caused a loud blast but no injuries. A statement issued by Croatia’s National Security Council meeting said the ""pilotless military aircraft"" entered Croatian airspace from neighboring Hungary at a speed of 700 kph (430 mph) and an altitude of 1,300 meters (4,300 feet). Both Croatia and Hungary are members of NATO.

The Tu-141s are Soviet-era high-speed missile-like drones, which are used only by Ukraine. Though made in the 1970s, the drones were later upgraded and used on several occasions, including during the 2014 Crimean annexation. Ukrainian troops were said to be using it against Russians last week but lost one after it was shot down.

The Tu-141 reconnaissance drone is ""more of a cruise missile"" than a traditional drone. It is rocket-launched from its trailer and flies a predetermined course at transonic speed, collecting various forms of intelligence. It can be recovered using a parachute and reused after reset, The Drive report added.

The ""Strizh"" drones have a range of 650 miles and can undertake tactical reconnaissance missions. Though they are also used as target drones and as a decoy during combat, it is not clear how this particular Tu-141 headed in the wrong direction.

There are also possibilities that Russia took these cold war-era drones from their storage to act as ""crude decoys"" to trick Ukraine's air defenses. Though the drone's range limits and the location of the crash site prove it couldn't have been from Russia, there is a possibility that it will reach Zagreb if the launch site is in Belarus. However, none of these possibilities are verified.

Ever since the Russian forced stepped into their territory, Ukraine has been using drones to defend itself. It was using the Turkish-made Bakar Bayraktar TB2 armed drones, which reportedly shot down a Russian fuel truck.

Ukraine's Ministry of Defense had also urged consumer drone owners and pilots to come to the aid of their country. Military trackers said the TB2s have accounted for 33 Russian vehicle losses, including two logistics trains.

The answer to what actually fell in Zagreb may have been given by Tyler Rogoway, a military aviation expert and editor of The War Zone on The Drive, writes Klix.ba.

Rogoway wrote that based on a detailed study of the aircraft parts, from images and footage from Zagreb, he believes a Soviet Tu-141 drone flying from Ukraine crashed in the capital Hravstke.

An explosion rocked Zagreb (Croatia) at around 23:00 local time on March 11, 2022, triggering fear among the population. The emergency services then found a crater 3 m wide and 1 m deep with the remains of a “pilotless military aircraft”, with some witnesses stating that it was a plane that crashed after the crew ejected and parachuted down to safety.

A press release from Croatia’s presidential office quotes President Zoran Milanovic stating the aircraft entered Croatian airspace after flying undetected over Hungary for over 40 minutes.

According to the first investigation reports released from Croatia, the drone lost the control signal and flew until it ran out of fuel. Meanwhile, Hungarian sources said it arrived in their airspace via Romania, again without being detected by air defenses. The event is being treated as a serious incident and Croatia launched an investigation to try to understand how an old Soviet-era drone was able to fly undetected through NATO airspace.

The War Zone’s Tyler Rogoway, after close examination of the visual evidence, strongly believes this drone was actually a Tu-141 “Strizh” reconnaissance drone that must have severely malfunctioned. Nobody knows if it was launched by Ukraine or Russia at this time, but some accounts state it had Russian red stars on it. Even more confusion is added to the mix by sources from the Ukrainian military which said the drone did not belong to them.

The Tupolev Tu-141 Strizh is a Soviet reconnaissance drone that historically served with the Soviet Red Army during the late 1970s and 1980s, before being retired in the early 1990s. In 2014, Ukraine “resurrected” the drone after the invasion of Crimea, since large stocks of it remained in its territory following the fall of the Soviet Union.

Some Tu-141s were reportedly operated during these last two weeks, with at least one while being shot down as seen in photos on social medias. Again, it is not possible to verify who is really operating the drones, as some sources mentioned the presence of the “Z” symbol which was seen on many vehicles since the beginning of the invasion.

#Ukraine: We have managed to identifiy new wreckage, and can confirm a Ukrainian drone was shot down! However, it’s not the TB-2, but the Cold war era Tupolev Tu-141 reconnaissance drone; note the landing gear/KR-17A engine. Likely to be UA operated, but possible Russian decoy. pic.twitter.com/MOP454BWPH — 🇺🇦 Ukraine Weapons Tracker (@UAWeapons) March 8, 2022

The Tu-141 is a relatively large, medium-range reconnaissance drone, designed to undertake reconnaissance missions several kilometers behind the front lines at transonic speeds. Among its payloads, it can carry a range of film cameras, infrared imagers, EO imagers, and imaging radar. Some of these payloads are reportedly shared with the recon variant of the Su-24 Fencer.

As with previous Tupolev designs, the Tu-141 has a dart-like rear-mounted delta wing, forward-mounted canards, and a KR-17A turbojet engine mounted above the tail. It is launched from a trailer using a solid-propellant booster and lands with the aid of a tail-mounted parachute and retro rockets, which could explain the reports about the drone being shot down and the parachutes found on the scene.

In 2014, a Ukrainian Tu-143 Reys, a type of drone developed from Tu-141 but smaller and with a shorter operational range than the Strizh, was recovered, almost intact, by pro-Russia separatists in a field in Ukraine.

Update

It looks like that contrary to the initial Croatian press release, both Romania and Hungary detected the drone.

It is still unclear who launched it and for what purpose, and also why NATO surveillance systems did not notice such a large aircraft.

Jarun is a picturesque southern suburb of Zagreb, a favourite recreation area for residents of the Croatian capital. Around 23:00 on March 10, a roar shook the area – something huge fell from the sky. Metal debris scattered along Jarunska Street, a crater 3 meters wide and a meter deep formed, several cars were damaged.

Nearby, residents found two parachutes.

Croatian President Zoran Milanovic said that the military-type drone that crashed in Zagreb was fired from Ukraine.

Tu-141 Strizh defeats NATO radars

The six ton Tu-141 Strizh reconnaissance drone had a serious malfunction and crossed all of Hungary and parts of Romania until it reached Croatia. A direct flight from the Ukrainian border to Zagreb is almost 350 miles.

The Soviet-made Tu-141 Strizh drone flew over the airspace of three NATO member countries at a speed of 700 km/h at an altitude of 1300 m without being noticed by NATO radars.

Ukraine and Russia shrug it off

Ukraine is the only known operator of the Tu-141 drones worldwide.

Markiyan Lubkivsky, a former Ukrainian ambassador to Croatia and now an adviser to the Minister of Defense, told a Croatian public broadcaster that the drone is not Ukrainian.

“Ukrainian aircraft have different markings,” he said. He added that an official communication from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine regarding this incident is being prepared. He told the Ukrainian media that “there are red stars on the wreckage of the drone.”

Aleksey Arestovich, the adviser to the President’s Office, told Ukrainian media that the country does not have drones capable of covering such a distance.

“Most likely, [this is] a drone of the operational-tactical level, Russian, which was launched from our territory. It lost control and flew all the way to Croatia,” Arestovich suggested.

Russia said that it had shot down a similar drone in Crimea and was launched by Ukraine. Russia has decommissioned the last Swifts in early 2000.

Reactions from Croatia

The chief investigator of aviation accidents at the Croatian Accident Investigation Agency, Danko Petrin, told the media that modern drones are always in contact with the base. But this was an outdated model created in the Soviet Union in 1970. “There were cases when this type of aircraft could get out of control. I assume that this is also the case here because such aircraft are not missiles that are sent as weapons, but their goal is to return to the base to submit the collected data. After all, it’s unclear what exactly she could record at night. It is obvious that it was a mistake in the flight programming or that the aircraft got out of control, but that has yet to be determined by the investigation,” he said.

Reactions from Hungary

The Romanian Ministry of Defense reported that the drone moving from Ukraine was in the airspace of the country for less than three minutes, during which time it was not possible to identify it.

As per Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, on Friday night, Hungarian air defense systems noticed an unidentified object in the sky in the northeast of the country, which later turned out to be a drone. It is noted that the UAV crashed on the outskirts of Zagreb.

“Gripen [multi-role fighters] on duty took off from the air force base in Kecskemet, which checked the area, but did not find flying objects there and therefore returned to the base,” he told local press.

Eyebrows raised over NATO missile defence effectiveness

A retired Croatian military pilot Ivan Selak, in an interview with a local channel, suggested that the drone fell due to the fact that it ran out of fuel. It flew a thousand kilometres, and surprisingly, it was not picked up by radar, he noted. In the airspace of Croatia, the plane was 8-9 minutes and flew over Hungary even longer.

The UAV flew about 1300 km, and the Hungarians did not notice it, he said. The UAV flew at a higher altitude, and the RCS is also not small, he added.

He said NATO was responsible for detecting, raising the alarm and interception as the radars in Hungary, Croatia and other places are directly linked to the command post at Torrejon Airbase in Spain.

“NATO’s integrated air defense system should be activated within 15-20 minutes, after which fighters should take off,” he said.

“The facts will be established. How is it possible for an old-style aircraft to spend more than one hour in the sky over NATO member countries, and no one notices (…) Military services are involved in the investigation,” said Croatian President Zoran Milanovic.

Responding to the Croatian press, NATO said that Alliance’s missile defense system had recorded the flight path of the object that had fallen in Zagreb.

Tu-141 Strizh drone

The first prototype of the Tu-141 unmanned aerial vehicle flew in December 1974. The first experimental Tu-141 flew with experimental KR-17A engines. Serial production of Tu-141 began in 1979 at the Kharkiv Aviation Plant (former No. 135). The production ended in 1989, and 152 Tu-141 UAVs were produced.

The landing of the UAV was carried out using a parachute system.

The drone could fly 1110 km/h, up to 1000 km and the practical ceiling was 6000 meters.

In an official statement, Zagreb police said:

“After 11 pm tonight, the Zagreb Police Administration received several signals from citizens that they had felt a detonation in the wider part of Jarun, which was preceded by the fall of an object from the air. Police officers arrived at the scene and found a crater in the green area and two parachutes, for which we previously received signals from citizens. Police officers have cordoned off the area of ​​the accident, an inspection is being carried out, with the participation of all competent services. “

The emergency services confirmed the information that the fallen object looks like a part of an airplane engine – it made a crater with a diameter of three meters and a meter deep, 24 Sata writes.

“They took us all as soon as they arrived. We were told: “Everyone get away, this is a protected area and they put on helmets and bulletproof vests. Firefighters climbed a tree and saw what it was all about. Police were illuminating the area and searching. They were there for an hour, “said a witness to the incident.

According to the first information, the unidentified object that crashed in Zagreb could be a reconnaissance drone Tu-141 “Swift”, concluded Tyler Rogovei, an expert in military aviation and editor of the “War Zone” portal. As he writes, the photos of the remains show that it is almost certainly a drone, which is probably from Ukraine.

“We firmly believe that this is a missile-like reconnaissance drone. It appears to have crashed severely, flown across Hungary and finally crashed in Zagreb,” Rogovei wrote, presenting further evidence that the drone had arrived in Croatia. from the area of ​​hostilities. – It was recently announced that Ukraine has been putting drones into operation since Soviet times and as far as I know, the Ukrainians are the only ones in the world who use the Tu-141 drone.

Rogovey explained how he came to this conclusion: “One wing remains intact, which allowed us to compare the photos. As for this type of drone, this is not the first time, even in this war. Just a few days ago there was another crash in Ukraine However, Ukrainians popularized this type of drone during the Russian conquest of Crimea in 2014. In reality, it is a cruise missile rather than a traditional unmanned aerial vehicle. intelligence, and, yes, there is a parachute, so it can be used repeatedly. “",https://darik.news/en/unknown-aircraft-crashed-in-zagreb-ukrainian-drone-suspected-video-photos.html
