Russia’s war against Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe and is causing enormous human suffering and destruction.

We condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. We call on President Putin to immediately stop this war and withdraw military forces from Ukraine, and call on Belarus to end its complicity, in line with the Aggression Against Ukraine Resolution adopted at the UN General Assembly of 2 March 2022. Russia should comply with the 16 March ruling by the UN International Court of Justice and immediately suspend military operations. Russia’s attack on Ukraine threatens global security. Its assault on international norms makes the world less safe. President Putin’s escalatory rhetoric is irresponsible and destabilizing.

Ukrainians have inspired the world with heroic resistance to Russia’s brutal war of conquest. We strongly condemn Russia’s devastating attacks on civilians, including women, children, and persons in vulnerable situations. We will work with the rest of the international community to hold accountable those responsible for violations of humanitarian and international law, including war crimes. We are deeply concerned about the increased risk of sexual violence and human trafficking. We urge Russia to allow rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access and safe passage for civilians, and to allow for humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and other besieged cities. We also condemn attacks against civilian infrastructure, including those endangering nuclear power plants. We will continue to counter Russia’s lies about its attack on Ukraine and expose fabricated narratives or manufactured “false flag” operations to prepare the ground for further escalation, including against the civilian population of Ukraine. Any use by Russia of a chemical or biological weapon would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences.

Russia needs to show it is serious about negotiations by immediately implementing a ceasefire. We call on Russia to engage constructively in credible negotiations with Ukraine to achieve concrete results, starting with a sustainable ceasefire and moving towards a complete withdrawal of its troops from Ukrainian territory. Russia’s continuing aggression while discussions are taking place is deplorable. We support Ukraine’s efforts to achieve peace, and those undertaken diplomatically by Allies to weigh in on Russia to end the war and relieve human suffering.

We stand in full solidarity with President Zelenskyy, the government of Ukraine, and with the brave Ukrainian citizens who are defending their homeland. We honour all those killed, injured, and displaced by Russia’s aggression, as well as their families. We reaffirm our unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders extending to its territorial waters.

Ukraine has a fundamental right to self-defence under the United Nations Charter. Since 2014, we have provided extensive support to Ukraine’s ability to exercise that right. We have trained Ukraine’s armed forces, strengthening their military capabilities and capacities and enhancing their resilience. NATO Allies have stepped up their support and will continue to provide further political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend itself. NATO Allies will also continue to provide assistance in such areas as cybersecurity and protection against threats of a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear nature. NATO Allies also provide extensive humanitarian support and are hosting millions of refugees. Foreign Ministers will discuss further our support to Ukraine when they meet in April.

We are united in our resolve to counter Russia’s attempts to destroy the foundations of international security and stability. We are holding Russia and Belarus to account. Massive sanctions and heavy political costs have been imposed on Russia in order to bring an end to this war. We remain determined to maintain coordinated international pressure on Russia. We will continue to coordinate closely with relevant stakeholders and other international organizations, including the European Union. Transatlantic coordination remains crucial for an effective response to the current crisis.

We call on all states, including the People’s Republic of China (PRC), to uphold the international order including the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, as enshrined in the UN Charter, to abstain from supporting Russia’s war effort in any way, and to refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions. We are concerned by recent public comments by PRC officials and call on China to cease amplifying the Kremlin’s false narratives, in particular on the war and on NATO, and to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

We remain committed to the foundational principles underpinning European and global security, including that each nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements free from outside interference. We reaffirm our commitment to NATO’s Open Door Policy under Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.

We are providing tailored support to partners affected by Russian threats and interference and will step up our assistance to help them resist Russian malign influence and strengthen their resilience, based on our partners’ requests and our long-standing partnership programmes. In April, Foreign Ministers will consider concrete proposals for enhancing our support to these partners.

We will continue to take all necessary steps to protect and defend the security of our Allied populations and every inch of Allied territory. Our commitment to Article 5 of the Washington Treaty is iron-clad.

In response to Russia’s actions, we have activated NATO’s defence plans, deployed elements of the NATO Response Force, and placed 40,000 troops on our eastern flank, along with significant air and naval assets, under direct NATO command supported by Allies’ national deployments. We are also establishing four additional multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. We are taking all measures and decisions to ensure the security and defence of all Allies across all domains and with a 360-degree approach. Our measures remain preventive, proportionate, and non-escalatory. We will now accelerate NATO’s transformation for a more dangerous strategic reality, including through the adoption of the next Strategic Concept in Madrid. In light of the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades, we will also significantly strengthen our longer term deterrence and defence posture and will further develop the full range of ready forces and capabilities necessary to maintain credible deterrence and defence. These steps will be supported by enhanced exercises with an increased focus on collective defence and interoperability.

We are increasing the resilience of our societies and our infrastructure to counter Russia’s malign influence. We are enhancing our cyber capabilities and defences, providing support to each other in the event of cyber-attacks. We are ready to impose costs on those who harm us in cyberspace, and are increasing information exchange and situational awareness, enhancing civil preparedness, and strengthening our ability to respond to disinformation. We will also enhance our preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. We will take further decisions when we meet in Madrid.

The steps we are taking to ensure the security of our Alliance and of the Euro-Atlantic area will require adequate resourcing. Allies are substantially increasing their defence expenditures. Today, we have decided to accelerate our efforts to fulfil our commitment to the Defence Investment Pledge in its entirety. In line with our commitment in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty, we will further strengthen our individual and collective capacity to resist all forms of attack. At our meeting in Madrid, we will submit additional plans on how to meet the Pledge.

Russia’s unprovoked war against Ukraine represents a fundamental challenge to the values and norms that have brought security and prosperity to all on the European continent. President Putin’s choice to attack Ukraine is a strategic mistake, with grave consequences also for Russia and the Russian people. We remain united and resolute in our determination to oppose Russia’s aggression, aid the government and the people of Ukraine, and defend the security of all Allies.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_193719.htm

With the threat of wider conflict hanging over Europe, NATO opted for stability on Thursday by extending Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg’s term in office for an extra year to help steer the 30-nation military alliance through the security crisis sparked by Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Stoltenberg tweeted Thursday that he is “honoured” by the decision of NATO leaders to extend his term until Sept. 30, 2023.

“As we face the biggest security crisis in a generation, we stand united to keep our alliance strong and our people safe,” he said, after U.S. President Joe Biden and his counterparts agreed to extend his term at a summit in Brussels.

The former Norwegian prime minister was named to NATO’s top civilian post in October 2014. It’s the second time that his term of office has been extended. His mandate was due to expire in September.

In a tweet, Biden said that Stoltenberg has “done a remarkable job leading and strengthening our Alliance — particularly during this critical moment for international security.”

In February, Norway’s government appointed Stoltenberg as head of the Scandinavian country’s central bank and said it hoped he could start in his new role around Dec. 1.

In Oslo, Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum confirmed that Stoltenberg had resigned from the job. Temporary governor Ida Wolden Bache has been nominated in his place and her appointment is expected to be confirmed later Thursday.

“Of course I would like to see Jens Stoltenberg become our next central bank governor, but we are in the middle of a dramatic situation in Europe and I have great understanding that he prioritizes continuing in the important role he has in NATO,” Slagsvold Vedum said.

Stoltenberg, 63, has described Russia’s war on Ukraine as “the most serious security situation we have been in for decades.”

Stoltenberg has been praised for steering NATO through a difficult and divisive period under the Trump administration, when the U.S. threatened not to come to the aid of member countries that weren’t spending enough on defence.

Speaking to reporters on an Air Force One flight to Brussels on Wednesday, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Biden and Stoltenberg have “developed a relationship of trust.”

“Secretary-General Stoltenberg has played an instrumental role in helping secure the powerful unity you’ve seen at NATO through this crisis,” Sullivan said

Stoltenberg was twice prime minister in Norway — from 2000 to 2001 and then again from 2005 to 2013 — and he also served as finance minister, and industry and energy minister.

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St├╕re told Norwegian news agency NTB that Stoltenberg had done “a solid job” as NATO chief. “Never before has the alliance been stronger, and never before in the alliance’s history has unity been more important.”

Wolden Bache was due to be formally be named the central bank chief later Thursday for a six-year term.

“Norges Bank has great respect for Mr Stoltenberg’s decision made in the light of his very important responsibilities as Secretary General of NATO,” she said.

Prior to Thursday’s announcement, speculation had been rife that a woman would be named at the helm of the world’s biggest security organization for the first time.

Follow our live news updates on the Russia-Ukraine war.

BRUSSELS — President Biden and leaders of more than 30 nations convened Thursday to demonstrate united opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, announcing new economic sanctions, aid for refugees, deployment of additional forces to Eastern Europe and grim preparations in case Russia uses chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.

But the historic gathering of world leaders in a series of three summits on Thursday underscored how the United States and its allies have in some ways reached their self-imposed limits in crafting a united global response to the largest European conflict in more than a half-century. While they are sharpening the tools they are using against Russia, they appear to have few new ones to reach for.

Mr. Biden and the allies have moved with unexpected speed and authority over the past four weeks, rallying much of the world against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

And yet, the sense of stalemate on the battlefield is now also felt in the halls of diplomacy, where taking dramatic new steps to counter Mr. Putin’s aggression is proving difficult. Europeans have said they are not willing to bear the consequences of new limits on the Russian energy that they depend on. And Mr. Biden has said he is not willing to commit troops to Ukraine and risk going to war against Russia.

As the allied leaders met in Brussels, the Ukrainian military, entering the second week of a counteroffensive, claimed on Thursday to have destroyed a Russian military landing ship in the southern port of Berdyansk. In the embattled towns around the capital, Kyiv, intense fighting had set so many fires on Thursday that the city was shrouded in a ghostly haze of white smoke.

Mr. Biden said the United States would accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, and he and his counterparts announced a new round of weapons shipments for Ukraine, but not the fighter jets that President Volodymyr Zelensky has pleaded for.

They expressed in one voice their “resolve to counter Russia’s attempts to destroy the foundations of international security and stability.” But they again declined to enforce a no-fly zone in the skies over Ukraine, which would mean readiness to shoot down Russian planes.

They vowed to tighten sanctions on Russia, but the Europeans stopped short of blocking imports of Russian oil and gas, as the United States has done. Europe is hugely dependent on Russian energy, paying Mr. Putin the vast revenues needed to support his military — and giving him the power to wreak havoc on Europe by disrupting supplies.

“I think we’re seeing a coordinated divergence between the European Union and the United States,” said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group. “There’s no rupture or even a split. Rather, there is an agreement that the U.S. will go more aggressively than the E.U. because they can afford to do so.”

Speaking to reporters Thursday evening, Mr. Biden said that he had requested the emergency meetings — with leaders of NATO, the European Union and the Group of 7 industrialized nations — to show Mr. Putin that the allies will not “crack” in their determination to keep economic pressure on Russia over days, weeks, months and more.

“We have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united,” he said, adding that he favors ejecting Russia from the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations.

For Mr. Zelensky, though, none of it was enough. He has become more pointed in his criticism of Western restraint on military aid as Russian forces have savaged Ukrainian cities and towns, especially in the south.

Speaking by video to NATO leaders behind closed doors, Mr. Zelensky thanked them for their support but chided them for not doing more. He described his battered country, which is not a NATO member, as trapped “in the ‘gray zone’ between the West and Russia,” according to a transcript released by the Ukrainian government.

“On Feb. 24, I addressed you with a perfectly clear, logical request to help close our skies,” he said of his request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine to keep Russian planes away. “In any format. Protect our people from Russian bombs and missiles. We did not hear a clear answer.”

“And you see the consequences today,” he added a moment later. “How many people were killed, how many peaceful cities were destroyed?”

He repeated his appeal for warplanes, though the White House and the Pentagon have said that supplying them could give Russia a pretext for drawing NATO into a direct conflict. “You have thousands of fighter jets! But we haven’t been given any yet,” Mr. Zelensky said. “To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance — without restrictions.”

For NATO leaders, the high stakes of their meeting were evident in the joint statement issued at its conclusion. The 72-year-old alliance warned Russia against deploying “chemical, biological and nuclear weapons” in Ukraine, signaling a growing concern that Mr. Putin is willing to use them to advance his aggression or to falsely implicate Ukraine’s government.

Mr. Biden was cautious Thursday in his response to questions about the warning. He declined to say whether the United States or NATO would respond militarily if Russia used chemical weapons, which are banned by international treaty.

“We would respond if he uses it,” Mr. Biden said. “The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.”

But in warning about the threat from weapons of mass destruction, NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the organization was “enhancing allies’ preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological and nuclear threats.” It will provide detection equipment, protection and medical support to Ukraine, he said, along with training for decontamination and crisis management to deal with the impact of any use of weapons of mass destruction.

The alliance’s top military commander, Gen. Tod D. Wolters, “has activated NATO’s chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense elements,” Mr. Stoltenberg added, placing on increased alert NATO teams that specialize in detecting and responding to contamination after a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack. Member nations are taking similar steps.

Mr. Stoltenberg noted that the use of such weapons inside Ukraine could contaminate neighboring NATO countries.

“Many people fear that Russia will use such weapons and accuse Ukraine of doing it, so it is important to precisely determine who, where and when did it so there’s no ambiguity,” said Gustav Gressel, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The United States hit Russia with a new round of sanctions on Thursday, targeting more than 300 members of its Parliament and dozens of defense companies, while moving to restrict Russia’s ability to use gold reserves to prop up its currency. It also imposed sanctions on Herman Gref, a Putin ally and the president and chairman of Sberbank, one of Russia’s largest banks; the bank itself was sanctioned last month.

The economic actions, which came in conjunction with new sanctions from Western allies, were the latest attempt to inflict economic pain on Mr. Putin. The United States also moved to curtail Russia’s ability to evade existing restrictions on its central bank and major financial institutions, responding to concerns that Russia was finding ways to stabilize the ruble and rebuild its foreign currency reserves.

The Treasury Department is taking aim at alternative assets that Russia could use to support its economy. It issued new guidance on Thursday to make clear that transactions involving Russia’s $130 billion of gold reserves were also subject to U.S. sanctions. Russia built up its gold war chest in recent years to help blunt the impact of earlier sanctions by using the precious metal to buy currency or secure loans.

The U.S. is working to close that loophole by threatening penalties for anyone who facilitates such transactions.

Mr. Biden and European Union leaders are expected to announce an agreement to provide significant amounts of American liquefied natural gas to Europe this year, according to two European diplomats. They said the shipments could limit Europe’s reliance on Russian energy in the near term, and boost confidence in its ability to become less dependent over time.

“The question of course isn’t whether Europe has enough oil and gas for right now, but what happens next winter,” said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

In addition to accepting 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, Mr. Biden announced that the United States would donate $1 billion to help European countries deal with the surge of people fleeing Russia’s invasion, White House officials said on Thursday.

A senior administration official said special efforts were being made to welcome Ukrainians who have family members in the United States.

An estimated four million Ukrainians have poured into Poland and other countries as Mr. Putin’s forces have bombarded civilian areas across Ukraine. Mr. Biden’s commitment would significantly increase the United States’ role in dealing with the unfolding humanitarian crisis.

On the battlefields, Ukrainian fighters have had some success this week in pushing Moscow’s much larger forces farther away from Kyiv and other cities, according to Western intelligence agencies, even as the bloody siege gripping the port of Mariupol has tightened. But many Ukrainian claims of gains have been impossible to verify, and brutal street fighting still echoes through some towns that Ukrainian forces claim to have recaptured.

Russia did not immediately comment on Ukraine’s claim to have destroyed a warship in Berdyansk, whose port Moscow has used to funnel reinforcements to Mariupol and across Ukraine’s eastern front. But British and U.S. officials confirmed that it was a strike by Ukrainian forces, and videos and photos reviewed by The New York Times confirmed that a Russian ship was ablaze in the port, and showed smoke rising from others.

“The destroyed ship in Berdyansk could carry up to 20 tanks, 45 armored personnel carriers and 400 paratroopers,” the Ukrainian deputy defense minister, Anna Malyar, said in a statement on Thursday. “This is a huge target that was hit by our military.”

The United Nations says that the war has forced more than 10 million Ukrainians, about one-fourth of the population, from their homes, including the “internally displaced” who have fled to safer parts of the country — Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II. The U.N. children’s agency reported on Thursday that they include 4.3 million children, more than half the children in Ukraine.

On Friday, Mr. Biden is expected to travel to Poland, in part to witness the surge of people taking refuge there. In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Biden hinted that he might travel to the border with Ukraine — something that officials have been unwilling to confirm.

“I’m not supposed to say, but anyway,” he said. “I hope I get to see a lot of people.”

The White House also announced new sanctions against more than 400 Russian elites, Duma lawmakers and defense companies — one more turn of the screw in the West’s economic pressure campaign against Moscow. The Group of 7 leading industrialized nations, which joined in the new sanctions, disclosed initiatives aimed at cracking down on efforts by Russia to evade sanctions and preventing its central bank from using gold reserves to shore up the country’s sagging economy.

The U.S. also plans to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees into the country and to donate $1 billion to help European nations flooded with Ukrainians fleeing the war, Biden said at a news conference where he declared that NATO has “never been more united than it is today.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden said, “was banking on NATO being divided” and “is getting exactly the opposite what he intended to have, as a consequence of going into Ukraine.” While stressing that the U.S. and its allies hadn’t expected their actions alone to be enough to deter Putin, Biden said the “most important thing is for us to stay unified and focus on what a brute this guy is.”

The extraordinary gathering of leaders, planned in just days, was convened largely to send a signal of resolve to Putin while ensuring NATO allies remain on the same page as they plot additional measures against Moscow and prepare for scenarios that could draw them deeper into the conflict.

“We are determined to continue to impose consequences on Russia to bring about an end to this brutal war,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said as he opened the meeting, expressing support for Ukraine, recognizing “the great courage” of its people and of those inside Russia “who are bravely speaking out against the war.”

“We hear the voices,” he said. “They matter.”

The meetings come one month to the day since the war began and at what could be a critical juncture for the fate of Ukraine, Europe and the world.

“Putin can’t afford to lose this struggle. By the same token, President Biden can’t afford to lose this struggle,” said Thomas Graham, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who has handled Russia issues on the National Security Council in Democratic and Republican administrations.

Despite certain optimism in the West, Graham said, “there’s a great deal of devastation that Putin can do over the next several weeks.”

North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders began a closed session Thursday after posing for a “family photo,” ratifying the plan Stoltenberg outlined Wednesday to double the number of battle groups in Eastern Europe. That will result in the deployment of more forces to Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. The alliance had already doubled its initial troop presence on its eastern flank since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.

“Today’s establishment of four new battle groups in Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary is a strong signal that we will collectively defend and protect every inch of NATO territory,” Biden said in a statement after the alliance leaders’ meeting.

The U.S. has 100,000 troops stationed in Europe, roughly 20,000 more than were there before Russia attacked.

Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, addressed the summit via video, asking the alliance to step up military assistance to help his country fight back.

“The world is waiting. Ukraine is waiting. For real action, for real security guarantees, from those whose word is to be trusted and whose actions can really preserve peace,” Zelensky said. “We need peace now. The response is yours.”

Zelensky has made similar requests in speeches to lawmakers in Washington, Berlin, Ottawa and other Western capitals in recent days.

Biden touted the $1 billion in new security assistance for Ukraine, which included antiaircraft systems, antitank missiles, drones, heavy weaponry and ammunition, telling reporters that “our weapons are flowing into Ukraine as I speak.” And he suggested in a statement that other countries would be sending additional aid: “We are committed to identifying additional equipment, including air defense systems, to help Ukraine.”

The president arrived in Brussels on Wednesday evening and also participated in meetings Thursday afternoon with the G-7 leaders and the European Commission. After a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday morning, he planned to fly to Rzeszow, Poland, a city just 40 miles from the Ukrainian border that has become a hub for Western defense assistance going to Ukraine. He is scheduled to get a briefing on humanitarian efforts and to visit with U.S. troops before flying to Warsaw for a meeting Saturday with President Andrzej Duda.

Under NATO’s Article 5, an attack against one member nation is considered an attack against all. Since Russia began its war in Ukraine, NATO members have imposed severe economic sanctions, taken steps to ban or limit imports of Russian energy and contributed billions in defense aid to Ukraine. They are attempting to punish Moscow as severely as possible while steering clear of any direct military engagement that Putin could use to justify expanding the conflict into NATO territory.

Putin, NATO allies fear, may seek to escalate the conflict out of frustration over his brazen campaign’s lack of progress. Russian officials seemed to have believed the invasion would take just days but instead it has bogged down as the war enters its second month. Perhaps as many as 15,000 Russian troops have been killed by Ukraine’s military and resistance fighters, who on Wednesday halted the eastern advance on the capital, Kyiv, and pushed back Russian forces several miles.

NATO agreed Thursday that it would provide Ukraine with detection and protective equipment, medical support and training for decontamination and crisis management in the event of a Russian chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack, Stoltenberg said. In a joint statement issued by the leaders of all 30 member nations, the alliance vowed that “any use by Russia of a chemical or biological weapon would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences.”

World & Nation Full coverage of the war in Ukraine Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

During his 30-minute news conference ahead of the third and final meeting with European Union leaders, Biden clarified that NATO “will respond” if Putin uses chemical weapons. “The nature of the response will depend on the nature of the use,” he said.

With Russia struggling to conquer Ukrainian territory, Putin has increasingly unleashed artillery, bombs and missiles against civilian targets, prompting Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Wednesday to formally declare that the U.S. has concluded Russia’s actions against Ukraine constitute war crimes.

Biden told reporters that leaders discussed expelling Russia from the Group of 20 major economies, which is scheduled to meet later this year in Indonesia, and that he favors the move. The U.S. succeeded in getting all 29 other NATO leaders to sign off on mentioning China by name in the joint statement after Thursday’s meeting and urging Beijing to “abstain from supporting Russia’s war effort in any way, and to refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions.”

When questioned by reporters, the president expressed guarded optimism that Beijing would ultimately realize that a neutral posture would better serve its own strategic interests. “China understands that its economic future is much more closely tied to the West than it is to Russia,” Biden said.

The crisis in Ukraine has taken Biden’s chosen frame for his presidency — a historic confrontation pitting democracies versus autocracies — beyond the theoretical. It has also served as the impetus for reinvigorating a transatlantic alliance that, some seven decades after World War II, had seemed to be losing its focus and shared purpose.

“This war is accelerating Europe’s awakening to the real threat posed by Russia,” said Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, transatlantic security research director for the German Marshall Fund.

“But it seems that the European Union has pretty much reached the limit of what it actually can do because if we really wanted to act seriously and cause pain to Russia, it would involve limiting our imports of gas and oil,” Scheffer said, adding that some countries have declared they cannot take such action.

Calling the coming days “a tipping-point phase of conflict” because Russia may be encountering difficulties on the ground while Ukraine is fighting hard but desperate for more aid, Scheffer said NATO countries needed to “accelerate our support before it’s too late. It’s not a question of months or weeks, it’s a question of days.”

4,13722f31-ce89-46a0-bc71-b58698ae0a5c,[],,"Zohar Palti, a former senior Mossad official who wrapped up a stint as head of the military’s political-military bureau this week, is speaking to the media for the first time, opening up about his opposition to Israel attacking Iran a decade ago, and his current opposition to a new nuclear deal which may be nearing finalization.

Speaking to Haaretz, he says he led opposition to Israel taking military action against Iran in 2012, when then-prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-defense minister Ehud Barak were pushing for a strike.

“During the spring-summer of 2012, the operational preparations reached a peak. In my understanding, they [Netanyahu and Barak] were truly preparing to attack,” he tells Haaretz.

“I am not claiming to read the secrets of the heart. But when the IDF is instructed to deploy for ‘P+16’ [possible attack within 16 days], when air force aerial refueling planes are brought back from long-term servicing, it’s an emergency situation. The air force put all its planes into the air in order to prepare. Quite a few risks were taken in that period.”

“But what are you going to attack in Iran? An enrichment facility? I am in favor of attacking if there is an urgent need, if a sword is held to your throat, as [former Mossad head Meir] Dagan put it. But that was not the situation in 2012 or in the preceding years,” he adds.

Speaking to Channel 13, he claims Israel will be given free rein to act against Iran if it does build a bomb.

“If they go for the bomb, in my opinion there will be no limitations on us. If the Iranians build a bomb and continue on their current path, I don’t know a single democratic state on earth, and certainly none that is allied with us, that would stop us. To the contrary. They would greatly respect our right to make our own decisions, on the basis of our capabilities.”

NATO is also establishing four multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The eight battlegroups will extend all along NATO’s eastern flank, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.

NATO Allies are also increasing the resilience of their societies and infrastructure to counter Russia’s malign influence. This includes enhancing cyber capabilities and defences, and providing support to each other in the event of cyber attacks. Allies are ready to impose costs on those who harm them in cyberspace, and are increasing information exchange and situational awareness, enhancing civil preparedness, and strengthening their ability to respond to disinformation. NATO Allies will also enhance their preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

In addition to these immediate responses, NATO is also strengthening its deterrence and defence posture for the longer term, to face a more dangerous strategic reality. This will include significant developments in all domains – from major increases to forces on land, in the air and at sea, to stepping up cyber defences, to making the best use of space assets. These steps will be supported by enhanced exercises with an increased focus on collective defence and interoperability.

NATO is not seeking a war with Russia. NATO is a defensive Alliance. All measures are and will remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.

What is Nato?

The term NATO is also known as the North Atlantic entanglement. The full name of NATO is North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The main purpose of this term is to guarantee the safety and freedom of its members by political and military means. The headquarters of NATO is located in Brussels, Belgium.

If seen, its main objective politically is to build trust and solve the problems of all the members. If due to any reason the diplomatic efforts fail, then in that situation he has the military power to undertake crisis management operations. It uses a collective eye system by which all independent member states can agree with you against an attack by any outside party. Also, all the members can cooperate with outside forces only.

How Powerful is Nato?

NATO is considered the most powerful alliance in the whole world. But an alliance is based on its 30 allied and their partner nations to support missions and operations. Through this alliance, all the employees work in a group to fulfill any purpose. But NATO does not have its own armed forces. But it has a permanent unified military command structure. by which civilians and the military of all member states work together.

There can be no army through NATO. But there are many benefits available because it includes the military capability of each member country of the coalition. Because all countries include some of the other armies. Such as tanks, fighter jets, submarines, etc. By which the cause of the Alliance helps a lot.

NATO has been bound by its military power since 1949, due to which today it has about 3.5 million soldiers, personnel and civilians, etc. Because of the alliance, all the members definitely contribute one way or the other. All NATO missions are handled by the ACO under the leadership of SACEUR. The Supreme Allied Commander Europe [SACEUR] coordinates all forces. After the completion of any mission or operation, all the forces return to their respective countries.

A terrible war is started by the NATO Alliance through covid-19. Because it is also building a field hospital for medical help for all the patients suffering from the corona virus. NATO is seen as number one for helping in any crisis or disaster happening all over the world. If any country participates in a NATO operation, all member countries cover all costs.

The tale of Kharkiv is the story of the army that didn't fail, and an army that failed to win. Defying widespread expectations that it would collapse in short order, Russian forces have been unable to breach the Ukrainian army's lines around the north-eastern city and have not managed to encircle it.

Russia invaded at 05:00 on 24 February. The night before, 22-year-old Vlad and his brother-in-arms Mark, also 22, were at a fellow private's wedding.

When they learned of the attack, Vlad and Mark joined their battalion - the 22nd Motorised Infantry - and headed straight to the front lines. They have been there ever since.

A month on, while Russian missiles still strike at the city centre and at least half the 1.4m population have fled, there are neighbourhoods that remain untouched.

Against the regular beat of Russian artillery outside, I ask Mark and Vlad what they are fighting for.

Vlad's reply is short and to the point, ""For peace in Ukraine."" Mark shoots him a glance, ""My comrade says for peace in Ukraine,"" he laughs, then he swears and asks: ""Who knows? These people came to our land. No-one was waiting for them here, no-one was calling them.""

Do they think of the soldiers on the other side, I wonder. Vlad says he has a message for them: ""Run. Run away. Either you stay here in the ground or you go back home.""

He pauses, but then adds: ""Don't kill kids, destroy homes and families.""

This time it is Mark who is to the point:

Quote Message: Go back home while you are still alive."" Go back home while you are still alive.""

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

BRUSSELS — The United States and its European allies reinforced their tough stand against Russia on Thursday, sharply warning Moscow against using chemical weapons in Ukraine and announcing new sanctions on Russians. The White House also announced the United States will accept 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The statement on chemical weapons issued by the Group of Seven nations reflects growing concern among the world’s democracies that Russian President Vladimir Putin, facing setbacks on the battlefield and abroad, would resort to more extreme actions.

The Biden administration, along with the G-7 and the European Union, also unveiled Thursday a new set of sanctions targeting more than 400 individuals and entities, including the Duma, or legislature, and its members; additional members of the Russian power elite; and state-owned defense companies. The economic measures, some of which the E.U. had already taken, are the latest in a far-reaching sanctions package the West has unleashed on Moscow as punishment for the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

And in addition to welcoming about 100,000 refugees, the Biden administration announced Thursday that the United States will provide more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance for those affected by Russia’s war with Ukraine, as well as more than $11 billion over the next five years to mitigate food security threats stemming from the crisis.

The announcements by the United States and its allies were intended to showcase the unity of the world’s democracies as they press Moscow to curtail its war against Ukraine. Many leaders framed the crisis as a test of whether the norms of the post-Cold War world would survive.

Speaking to reporters at a news conference before departing NATO for additional meetings at the E.U., President Biden said he supported removing Russia from the Group of 20, an assembly of the world’s largest economies.

“My answer is yes,” Biden said, responding to a question about whether Russia should be excluded from the G-20 because of its invasion of Ukraine.

Putin is expected to attend a G-20 summit hosted by Indonesia in October, and Biden said the ultimate decision to exclude Russia would be up to the entire group. But, he added, if any nations object, one option would be “basically Ukraine being able to attend the G-20 meeting to observe” — an idea he said he broached with NATO leaders on Thursday.

As the war entered its second month, there was no pause Thursday in the destruction and bloodshed that has killed thousands of civilians, Ukrainian soldiers and invading Russian troops. Between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in four weeks of fighting, a senior NATO military official told The Washington Post on Wednesday. In comparison, the 20-year U.S. war in Afghanistan resulted in 2,461 American fatalities, according to Pentagon figures. U.S. military officials have been hesitant to put precise numbers on Russian casualty figures, citing the difficulty of reaching accurate estimates.

As Russian forces push westward along Ukraine’s southern coast, the Ukrainian navy claimed on Thursday that it had destroyed a Russian military vessel docked at the port city of Berdyansk. Videos shared on social media and verified by The Post showed a ship struck by several explosions and then engulfed in flames. The precise cause of the explosions is unclear from the videos and a spokesman for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry declined to provide further details, saying only that the operation was “a success.”

The port where the ship was destroyed is about 50 miles southwest of Mariupol, a city under siege and the site of an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. Ukraine accused the Russian army of firing on civilians evacuating Mariupol and forcibly deporting about 6,000 of the city’s residents to Russia. The deportations mark a “new phase of terror against the city,” according to a statement from Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Russia and Ukraine opened seven corridors for civilians to flee the violence, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a daily video update, including routes near the capital, Kyiv, and in the eastern Donetsk region. The two sides also carried out their first “full-fledged” military prisoner exchange, trading 10 personnel from each country, Vereshchuk said without providing further details.

Biden’s trip to Europe — he heads to Poland on Friday — comes as NATO is grappling with internal fissures on how to best prevent further Kremlin escalation amid growing concerns that Putin may be preparing to deploy chemical weapons. Economic sanctions and military aid to Ukraine have failed to stop Putin’s offensive, but the Russian incursion has bogged down, leaving an unpredictable and potentially volatile situation.

Biden’s packed schedule Thursday included the news conference as well as meetings with NATO, the G-7 major economies and the E.U.

The added economic penalties cover 328 Duma members and the Duma as an entity; Herman Gref, the head of Russia’s Sberbank and a Putin adviser since the 1990s; and Russian power broker Gennady Timchenko, his companies and his family members. The sanctions will also target 17 board members of the Russian financial institution Sovcombank and 48 state-owned defense enterprises.

The Western allies also announced a new initiative focused on cracking down on sanctions evasions, providing for countries to share information and prevent “backfilling,” where some countries may help Russia make up shortfalls caused by the sanctions.

Further action is expected Friday, when Biden meets with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to announce a significant initiative to direct shipments of liquefied natural gas to Europe, part of a broader effort to help reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy.

The United States has banned imports of oil, natural gas and coal from Russia. The E.U., which is vastly more dependent on Russian energy, has vowed to cut gas imports by two-thirds by the end of the year, but the bloc faces pressure to do more. However, calls for an outright ban on Russian energy, or just on Russian oil, have so far divided the 27-member E.U.

Following a “family photo” Thursday morning — a diplomatic nicety in which the NATO leaders gathered for an official picture — NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg opened the extraordinary NATO summit by condemning Russia’s “unprovoked aggression” against Ukraine and reaffirming the alliance’s support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.

“We are determined to continue to impose costs on Russia to bring about the end of this brutal war,” Stoltenberg said.

He said the allies will discuss efforts to continue supporting Ukraine and strengthening NATO’s defenses. “We pay tribute to the great courage of the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian armed forces fighting for their freedom and their rights,” he said. “We also recognize those in Russia who are bravely speaking out against the war. We hear their voices. They matter.”

And at a midday news conference Thursday, Stoltenberg said that one month of war had fundamentally changed the alliance’s security environment “for the long haul.”

NATO leaders also announced Thursday that they had agreed to extend Stoltenberg’s term as the alliance’s leader by a year so he can help steer NATO through the protracted confrontation with Russia. Stoltenberg, whose mandate was set to expire in September, had previously said he was leaving then to lead Norway’s central bank, but will now stay on until September 2023.

Stoltenberg said the alliance fears Russia could use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine and is taking steps to prepare for possible contamination, including in NATO countries, but was vague on specific repercussions.

“We are concerned partly because we see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext by accusing Ukraine, the United States and NATO allies of preparing to use chemical and biological weapons,” he said. In the past, he added, Moscow has accused others to create a pretext to use these weapons themselves.

NATO leaders said the alliance will help Ukraine protect itself against biological, chemical, radiological and other nuclear threats. “This could include detection, protection, and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management,” Stoltenberg said.

He also said the alliance’s top commander has activated NATO’s “chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense elements.” That means that NATO teams equipped to respond to such attacks have been placed on higher alert, according to an allied military source who spoke on the condition of anonymity under NATO ground rules.

During his news conference Thursday, Biden said NATO would respond “in kind” if Russia deploys chemical weapons, but also declined to share any specifics, despite being pressed several times.

Biden said NATO’s response “would depend on the nature of the use.”

“We would respond. We would respond,” Biden said. “If [Putin] uses it, the nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also addressed the NATO leaders via videoconference Thursday, repeating his request for continued Western security assistance, according to a senior U.S. administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details of a private meeting. Notably, Zelensky did not make an explicit plea for a no-fly zone, which he has repeatedly asked Western allies to implement, nor did he press for NATO membership.

In a statement, Biden responded, “We will continue to support him and his government with significant, and increasing, amounts of security assistance to fight Russian aggression and uphold their right to self-defense.”

Biden delivered remarks after Zelensky, laying out Washington’s three-pronged approach to addressing the crisis. He discussed the economic costs the United States has imposed on Russia through sanctions, the country’s support for Ukraine through military and humanitarian assistance, and the United States’ commitment to NATO — particularly the alliance’s eastern flank.

“There was a very strong sense that we are facing a significant historical moment and very strong support from all of the leaders who spoke about the need to defend our democracy, the need to defend our shared values and a strong sense that NATO was appropriately poised to be able to do that,” the senior U.S. administration official said.

The official added: “The mood overall has been sober. It’s been resolute, and it’s been incredibly united.”

Arriving at NATO’s glass-and-steel headquarters Thursday, European leaders described a continent — and an alliance — transformed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

For years, the Baltic nations and some countries in Eastern Europe have warned about Russia, while major economies in Western Europe have sought to cooperate with Putin’s regime. Those who long called for a more assertive approach are now saying that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine proves their argument.

“Nobody can feel safe now,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said Thursday. “Even those countries who are distant from Russia cannot feel safe.”

But there’s still debate over how to prevent the conflict from escalating further and specifically over how to communicate what would constitute red lines for NATO and the consequences for Russia if they are crossed.

NATO has so far focused on what it won’t do, such as implement a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine. But it has been less specific about what Russian actions might trigger an escalated NATO response, short of invading a member of the alliance.

Some countries have expressed frustration at the Biden administration’s declarations of steps it will not take to defend Ukraine, worrying that such public statements simply serve to embolden Putin. Biden and his team, for instance, have repeatedly said they want to avoid anything that would escalate the situation with Russia because they do not want “World War III.”

Asked Thursday whether he had been too quick to rule out direct military intervention with Russia and whether, in doing so, he had emboldened Putin, Biden was concise in his reply: “No and no,” he said.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that Putin “has already crossed the red line into barbarism.” It is now up to NATO, Johnson said, to consider “what more we can do to help the people of Ukraine protect themselves.”

Since Putin launched his full-scale assault last month, the 30-member NATO alliance has reinforced its eastern flank, with about 40,000 troops now under direct NATO command, mostly in the eastern part of the alliance.

At a news conference Wednesday, Stoltenberg said NATO leaders will probably decide to do more. “I expect leaders will agree to strengthen NATO’s posture in all domains,” he said, “with major increases to our forces in the eastern part of the alliance.”

The first step is the deployment of four new NATO battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. In a statement Thursday, Biden said the NATO leaders agreed to bolster their collective defense, mentioning those four battle groups in particular.

“Between now and the NATO summit in June, we will develop plans for additional forces and capabilities to strengthen NATO’s defenses,” Biden said in the statement. “We will adopt an updated Strategic Concept to ensure NATO is ready to meet any challenge in the new and more dangerous security environment.”

The allies also agreed to help Ukraine protect itself against biological, chemical, radiological and other nuclear threats. “This could include detection, protection and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management,” Stoltenberg said Thursday.

In a call last week, Biden warned China’s leader, Xi Jinping, against helping Russia. And in a joint statement Thursday, NATO leaders called on China to condemn Russia and warned the country against offering additional support for Putin’s war.

As Biden lined up for the NATO “family photo” before the meetings in Brussels officially got underway, the U.S. president shook hands with and briefly spoke to Johnson, Turkish President President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, French President Emmanuel Macron and Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.

Then, as the leaders dispersed, Biden, Johnson and Macron huddled offstage before leaving together to attend the formal summit.

It is the second time the 193-member General Assembly has overwhelmingly isolated Russia over its actions in Ukraine. General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding, but they carry political weight. There was a round of applause in the hall after the adoption on Thursday.

The resolution, which was drafted by Ukraine and allies, received 140 votes in favor and five votes against - Russia, Syria, North Korean, Eritrea and Belarus - while 38 countries, including China, abstained. It demands the protection of civilians, medical personnel, aid workers, journalists, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure. It also demands an end to the siege of cities, in particular Mariupol.
