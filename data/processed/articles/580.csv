A tense and fleeting evacuation from Ukraine’s northeastern city of Sumy took place on Tuesday after Russian airstrikes killed 21 people, including two children, the night before, Ukrainian authorities said.

Ukrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow’s invasion on February 24.

The agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday.

One convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city’s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy.

“At the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,” Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. “After 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy.”

The frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians “hostage” in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration.

Ukrainian authorities said that a long-awaited convoy of humanitarian aid to the city appeared to have come under fire on Tuesday. Russian troops are not allowing “children, women and the elderly” out of the city, and have launched an attack “precisely in the direction of the humanitarian corridor,” Ukraine’s Joint Forces Operation said.

CNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response.

A senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been “isolated” by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it “in any significant way.”

CNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days.

Meanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught.

“The main issue today remains humanitarian aid,” Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video.

Residents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are “forced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,” he said, adding that Moscow is preventing “humanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation.”

On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces “violated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,” following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army’s advance in northern Ukraine.

That warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing “several civilians” trying to evacuate the town of Irpin.

Zelensky calls for help as Ukrainians flee west

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the “sidelines” of the Russian invasion.

Addressing the UK’s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that “we will fight to the end,” echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s famous wartime speech.

“We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,” he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to “strengthen the sanctions” against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia “as a terrorist state” and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

NATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a “responsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine” during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits.

“That would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,” said Stoltenberg. “The situation could spiral out of control,” he said.

On the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week.

In the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city.

“In order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,” Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. “If the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.”

The senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling.

The official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country.

In total Russia has launched “nearly 670” missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday.

Almost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, “the other half largely from inside Ukraine,” the official said. “A little bit more than 70” missiles have been fired from Belarus, and “only a half dozen or so” are coming from the Black Sea, the official added.

A humanitarian crisis keeps growing

Meanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia’s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began.

The milestone is a “terrifying” number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries “where they have connections, family,” he added.

“What worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,” said Grandi.

At least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.

Instead of letting your kitchen become a point of contention, you can keep it neat and structured with a few super-simple hacks, from hanging items to investing them in clear containers and labels. Below, we talked to the experts to find the easiest, no-fuss ways to make your kitchen look spotless.

On one side of your stove, do you have a free-for-all dangerous pot? Or maybe in a drawer? There are a pasta drainer, a wooden spoon, spatula and many other random items that you use from time to time. A good way to keep utensils tidy is to think like a chef, says Sarah Nina Heyn, owner and partner Dwellwell Lifestyle management firm.

“Instead of grouping utensils into one large category, divide them by their stage of the cooking process,” she explains. “You can cut your stash to include just one of every item you use and keep them with a drawer organizer. Outside when you’re preparing a big meal Extras can be kept for removal.

This drawer organizer has nine sections so you can keep all your utensils separate and clean.

If you’re in a pint-sized city apartment, counter space may be more of a dream than a reality. And even in larger homes, kitchen cabinetry has limited storage. That’s why it’s essential to maximize the walls of your kitchen, dining, and pantry area as much as possible, suggests Rob Truglia, a senior brand marketing manager at The Storage Company. make space, Think: hanging your fruits and vegetables, adding an attractive floating shelf to display beautiful appliances, and more. Or, if you’re up to the challenge, Instagrammable wire displays for pots and pans are trendy and practical too.

“You can also get a magnetic bar for your knife and place it on top of the counter where you prepare food. This also works for condiments, but you’ll want to put them right on top of the stove,” says Truglia continues. “This will make it much more convenient when cooking in the kitchen without taking up any precious space.”

This organizer gives you a whole new area for storage in your pantry. Available in five- and six-tier options, hide everything from snacks to ingredients for easy access.

This stylish magnetic knife bar not only looks great but also frees up coveted space in your drawer.

It can be difficult to find enough space for everything to stay in a cabinet or drawer, so if you have to leave some items out in the open, Truglia says putting them in clear containers will make things look more uniform and neat. “It’s great for spices or dry goods like pasta and cereals because it keeps them fresh but makes them look more appealing.”

Before you start unpacking everything in social media-worthy bins, be sure to take the time to label them! You don’t want to mix up your type of pasta or the type of rice! “To take it a step further, you can even arrange them alphabetically so you never have a problem finding one again,” Truglia says.

This set keeps your bulk materials organized and comes in sets of 14 and 24.

One of the most effective strategies for making your kitchen an inspiring space instead of stressful is to organize it for use. It sounds simple enough, but as a professional organizer Danielle Heinrichs Reminds us, the knife should be near the counter where you cut. The water glass should be near the water source. The pot and pan should be near the stove and the cooking utensils should be on your prime side. “Appliances you use every day may be on the counter, but all others that get minimal use should be out of the way in a cabinet or pantry, which gives you more useful counter space,” she adds.

The next time you’re preparing a storm, notice when you need to take extra — and perhaps unnecessary — steps to finish a dish, then you can design your strategy. Bonus: Add lighting so you can see exactly what you’re doing (and all the pieces) instead of relying on that stove light.

This lightstrip is a great way to add light to just the places you need it.

If you don’t want to scratch while nesting your pots and pans, check out this rack that can hold five pans at once.

We know everyone has that jam-packed cabinet of endless spices you hope and pray won’t fall out when you open the door. Spices are usually cumbersome for most homes, but they don’t have to be, say interior designers and principals. Jarrett Yoshida, Instead of stashing them in a crowded drawer or cabinet, he recommends investing in a slide-out spice rack.

“Try all your spices at once without turning them round and round that you know nutmeg should be there because you only use it for your spicy mocha in the winter,” he explains.

Never mess with your spices again with this slide-out spice rack that’s easy to use and set up.

Label and organize everything in your fridge and freezer

Our fridge and freezer can be a crystal-clear, clean area where our perishables thrive… or a stinky mess. Instead of wondering how old something is, Yoshida asks to label everything. “Tape and a pen to label your freezer containers mean your food will taste exactly what you desire: less guessing game and more certainty for you and your dinner guests,” he explains. .

Think about size and color when organizing



Personal stylist and closet organizer when you’re organizing your kitchen or pantry lora laprato Calls to take two aspects into account: size and color. This helps you stack and store them appropriately, and depending on the color, you create a more polished, luxury-looking aesthetic for your kitchen. Here she recommends, section by section:

Spices: alphabetical order

Tea and Snack: color coded

Pots, pans and mixing bowls: Largest to smallest rest inside each other

Dishes and refrigerator: Color-code and face your items (psst: facing items means they all have to point in the same direction, with the item or product facing you when you open the door)

For ingredients that take up a lot of space, like flour, rice, and pasta, opt for these extra-large containers.

No matter whether you live alone, with your partner or in a house full of roommates or kids, you’ll probably wash at least one dish a day. A sink full of plates, bowls, pans and more can take a clean kitchen and make it quite messy in an instant. That’s why it’s important to have a dish strategy and regimen you follow so that the task isn’t overwhelming, suggests Heinrich.

“The trick is to rinse them right after you eat them and put them straight in the dishwasher,” she says. “The same applies to hand-washing things like utensils. It’s easiest to clean them right away, plus they don’t pile up in the sink if you take care of them right away.”

Set a time when you unload the dishwasher, such as first thing in the morning, or specify specific dish duty days for household members. A quality drying rack that doesn’t take up a lot of space will also help.

This elegant dish rack includes a drip tray and spout so that the water from your dishes can be funneled directly into the sink.

This tiered drying rack provides enough room to dry up to 17 plates and 18 bowls, with side cups for cutlery.

Doesn’t matter if you’re having dinner or meal preparation lunch For the week ahead, cooking takes a lot of equipment. Not only do you need a cutting board and knife set, but pots, pans, storage containers, maybe an air fryer, spices, mixing bowl… and the list goes on. Many times this requires opening a handful of drawers and cabinets, digging in to find what you need, and then cleaning up and putting it back in its place. Woof.

Heyn suggests cutting some elbow grease and clutter by designating a prep station with essentials. This should include measuring spoons, a can opener, a garlic press, cooking utensils, etc. This is when bins and baskets come in handy as they can ensure that the drawer is maintained and not messy.

These baskets not only keep all your essentials in one place, but they also look good doing it.

This cutting board set includes an expandable frame under it that holds four containers to create a compact and efficient prep station.

When it comes to your pantry, if you don’t look at it, you won’t use it, and thus you’ll lose it, Heinrich says. “Pullout shelves, clear bins and tiered shelving are a few examples that help with the visibility of objects,” she explains.

“If you have to store things like cans far below eye level, it can help to use a permanent marker and on the top lid to quickly write what’s in the can. If space is limited, So objects can be stacked on top of each other or lined up behind each other.”

And one last tip: Putting similar items together makes them easier to find so you don’t end up buying more.

Add another level of storage to any space with this simple rack.

Stop stacking your bins precariously and instead invest in this simple organizer, which can hold up to 36 compartments.

Since it’s unlikely you’ll be adding a new room to your kitchen or pantry, Truglia says whenever you’re organizing, it’s always a good idea to start with any existing “storage space” that’s already in place. is in your house. And one space you probably aren’t using much is the space under your sink. Most people make it a hobby of cleaning supplies, but it can be easily repurposed to make storage bins.

To start, Truglia says to use a small tension rod And keep it inside the cabinet so you can hang spray bottles, rags and dishwashing gloves on it. “Now all your go-to items will be more easily accessible and they won’t be so hard to find,” he says. You can also use a shower caddy or sliding organizer to keep your go-to products all in one place, making them easy to transport while you clean.

These tension rods fit in spaces between 16 and 28 inches, so be sure to measure the width of your cabinets before investing.

You won’t have to go on your hands and knees whenever you need something from under the sink with this pullout shelf.
