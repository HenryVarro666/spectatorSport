Recall that Russia entered the territory of Ukraine early on February 24.

The enemy first fired on military facilities, and then attacked both civilians and activists, in particular, the cities in the east of the Ukrainian state.

On April 6, the head of the military administration of the Lugansk region, Serhiy Gaidai, said the enemy in the region could try to go on the offensive in three or four days.

Russian troops have been withdrawing from around the capital and Ukraine’s north, leaving a trail of destruction, as they prepare for an expected assault on the country’s southeast.

Scenes of carnage that Ukrainian officials have accused retreating troops of leaving behind in towns including Bucha have sparked outrage and led to a wave of fresh sanctions against Moscow.

But on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Russia was undeterred and continued “to accumulate fighting force to realize their ill ambitions in (eastern) Donbas.”

“They are preparing to resume an active offensive,” he said.

Begging civilians to leave the region “while it is still possible,” local officials in Donbas’ Lugansk and Donetsk said the region was already facing constant indiscriminate shelling.

“We can see clearly that before the enemy goes to full attack, they will just destroy places completely,” local governor Sergiy Gaiday in Lugansk told Ukrainian broadcaster Channel 24.

Gaiday said on Facebook that more than 1,200 people had been evacuated from Lugansk on Wednesday, but that efforts were being hampered by artillery fire, with some areas already inaccessible.

For those unable to leave, he said, tons of food, medicine and hygiene products were being delivered as part of a massive humanitarian effort.

The head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration said strikes had targeted aid points.

“The enemy aimed directly there with a goal to destroy the civilians,” Pavlo Kyrylenko wrote on Facebook.

He added that people were heeding calls to flee and he would be coordinating evacuation to make it “faster and more effective.”

Shells and rockets were also slamming into the industrial city of Severodonetsk, the easternmost city held by Ukrainian forces.

“We have nowhere to go, it’s been like this for days,” 38-year-old Volodymyr told AFP, standing opposite a burning building in Severodonetsk.

More than 11 million people have been displaced since Russia invaded on February 24, aiming to seize the capital.

With that goal thwarted, Russia is instead trying to create a land link between occupied Crimea and Moscow-backed separatist statelets in Donbas.

Ukrainian forces are also regrouping for the offensive, including on a two-lane highway through the rolling eastern plains connecting Kharkiv and Donetsk.

Trench positions were being dug, and the road was littered with anti-tank obstacles.

“We’re waiting for them!” said a lieutenant tasked with reinforcing the positions, giving a thumbs up.

As preparations on the ground ramped up, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba demanded NATO members help Ukraine boost its firepower.

“My agenda is very simple. It has only three items on it. It’s weapons, weapons, and weapons,” Kuleba told journalists on Thursday.

“I call on all allies to put aside their hesitations, their reluctance, to provide Ukraine with everything it needs,” he said.

The evacuation calls are being fueled by fears of fresh atrocities, after chilling discoveries in areas from which Moscow’s troops have withdrawn.

US President Joe Biden said “major war crimes” were being committed in Ukraine, where images have emerged in recent days of bodies with their hands bound or in shallow graves.

“Civilians executed in cold blood, bodies dumped into mass graves, the sense of brutality and inhumanity left for all the world to see, unapologetically,” Biden said.

In one of the worst affected towns, Bucha, some residents were still trying to learn the fate of loved ones, while others were hoping to forget.

Tetiana Ustymenko’s son and his two friends were gunned down in the street, and she buried them in the garden of the family home.

“How can I live now?” she said.

The Kremlin denies responsibility for any civilian deaths and President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday accused Ukrainian authorities of “crude and cynical provocations” in Bucha.

But the German government pointed to satellite pictures taken while the town was still under Moscow’s control, which appear to show bodies in the streets.

Russia’s denials “are in our view not tenable,” said German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit.

And Ukrainian officials have warned other areas may have suffered worse than Bucha, including nearby Borodianka.

“Locals talk about how planes came in during the first days of the war and fired rockets at them from low altitudes at these buildings,” Ukraine’s Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky told local media.

Officials have alleged that Russian troops are now trying to cover up atrocities elsewhere to prevent further international outcry, including in the besieged city of Mariupol.

Ukrainian human rights official Lyudmila Denisova said on Telegram Wednesday, citing witness testimony, that Russian forces have brought mobile crematoria to burn bodies and other heavy equipment to clear debris in the city.

Western powers have already pummelled Russia with debilitating economic sanctions, which have forced Moscow to make foreign debt payments on dollar-denominated bonds in rubles, raising the prospect of a potential default.

British energy giant Shell warned Thursday that it would write off up to $5 billion (4.6 billion euros) after signalling its gradual withdrawal from the country last month.

On Wednesday, the White House unveiled further measures targeting Russia’s top banks and two of Putin’s daughters, while Britain sanctioned two banks and vowed to eliminate all Russian oil and gas imports by the end of the year.

The European Union is also poised to implement a fifth round of sanctions cutting off Russian coal imports — and European Council chief Charles Michel said that “sooner or later,” it must also impose oil and gas sanctions.

Elsewhere, the United States and Britain have pressed to have Russia excluded from the UN Human Rights Council, with a vote in the General Assembly scheduled for Thursday.

But in his nightly address, Zelensky said although the sanctions package had “a spectacular look... this is not enough.”

He urged countries to completely cut off Russia’s banks from the international financial system, and to stop buying the country’s oil.

“It is the export of oil that is one of the foundations of Russian aggression,” he said.

“One of the foundations that allows the Russian leadership not to take seriously the negotiations on ending the war.”

Peace talks between the sides have made little progress so far, and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has said there is no sign Putin has dropped “his ambition to control the whole of Ukraine.”",https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2058456/world

On April 7, the mayor of the city of Kharkiv addressed the population to deny reports about any mass evacuation of civilians from the city. His claims once again confirm nazi warfare of the Kiev regime.

On the video, Mr. Terekhov claimed the following:

” Today, the media reported that the Kharkiv region is preparing for evacuation. I want to clarify, this concerns only the Lozovsky and Barvenkovsky districts of the Kharkiv region, where our military is expecting an aggravation of the military situation.”

At the same time, he assured residents left in the city that Kharkiv is ready to fight. Thus, the AFU expect that the battle for Kharkiv may break out in the nearest future. A bug number of Russian troops from the Kiev region have been recently transferred to the Kharkiv front lines.

The mayor of the city openly declares that the fact that the city is armed and ready to meet enemy forces on the streets confirms that there is no need for any centralized evacuation.

“I said it yesterday, and I will repeat it today, Kharkiv is a well–armed and ready-to-defend city. Neither the civil-military administration, nor the military, nor I, as the Kharkiv mayor, see the need for a centralized evacuation from Kharkiv.”

Both “the Kharkiv military-civil administration” and the “military of the Armed Forces of Ukraine” openly stated in the words of the Kharkiv mayor that civilians are obliged to stay in the city, otherwise there will be no human shelter for brave Ukrainian soldiers in case of another assault by the Russian Army on the city.

The mayor of the city, who is directly responsible for the lives of the citizens, declares:

“Yes, we are constantly shelled with artillery from the ground, and bombed from the air. The enemy is fighting with our people. Therefore, to leave or not is the sacred right of everyone!“

Mr. Terekhov confirms that the city is under fire, that there are risks for civilians, especially for those living in eastern districts, but concludes that every resident must save by himself! He left to the mercy of fate all the elderly, the disabled, sick people and pregnant women, who now can only count on the help of volunteers who remained in the city. Hundreds of people were left without housing and without their own transport, and are forced to live in basements, in fear that the fighting will resume with renewed vigor.

Today, even those who can leave the city, and bring their families out, are forced to flee to nowhere, since no refugee camps or even information on evacuation are provided in the region. There are thousands civilians left in the city of Kharkiv as well as in smaller towns, including Akhturka, Konotop, Izyum region where fierce clashes continue.

Everyone who could leave the city fled by their own means weeks ago. Crowds of people tried to take trains from Kharkiv, tried to leave by private car in longue queues. At the same time, many cases of shelling on civilian vehicles by soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and members of the so-called civil defense were registered.

Hoping to inspire civilians to resist armed Russian soldiers by any means, the mayor of the city pathetically ends his speech by praising the Armed Forces of Ukraine, together with the local territorial defense, i.e. civilians who were given weapons and sent to fight with the professional Russian Army.

“I believe in our Army and territorial defense. We will stand, we will defend our city. We’re together.”

Even after receiving expensive weapons from the West for many years, the Kiev regime was unable to prepare a decent army to fight Russia, which it provoked all these years.

As a result, today Kiev is at war with its own population. Continuing to scream about the “genocide” allegedly committed by Russian soldiers in the Kiev region, including in the town of Bucha, Kiev did not secure a single centralized evacuation from cities in the east of the country neither before the start of military operations, nor immediately after the entry of Russian troops, nor weeks later.

On April 6, the Russian Ministry of Defence warned that the AFU a preparing a large provocation with the use of toxic substances in the Kharkiv region.

” According to confirmed information, in the city of Pervomaisky, Kharkiv region, Ukrainian special services are preparing a major provocation using toxic substances. On the territory of the chemical plant “Khimprom” AFU employees mined a storage with 120 tons of chlorine. This storage facility is planned to be blown up to accuse Russia of allegedly creating a chemical.” – the report reads.

Recall, on April 5, the AFU blew up an acid tank in the 1st workshop of the Zarya plant in the town of Rubezhnoye, LPR.

Moreover, on April 6, the Russian Ministry of Defence warned that the Kiev regime is targeting civilians in the Kharkiv region in order to provide the MSM with horrific footage of the Ukrainian towns allegedly destroyed by Russian forces.

“The Kiev regime, in addition, is preparing another provocative materials about the death of civilians, allegedly as a result of the actions of the Russian army. To this end, Ukrainian nationalists fired at the village of Dergachi in the Kharkiv region, after which they filmed destroyed buildings and “numerous dead” to provide them to Western media. Representatives of Western news agencies participated in this action, the leadership was carried out by servicemen of the 72nd Center for Information and Psychological Operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. At the same time, all participants of the staged filming among civilians were paid a reward of $ 25.”

The nazi Kiev regime is deliberately sacrificing the population of the large cities and smaller villages in the east of the country, where the Russian-speaking population lives, largely supporting Russia. A striking example of the inhuman warfare of the Nazi Kiev regime was the fate of the city of Mariupol, which Kharkiv risks repeating.

5,f6010449-c397-4ae7-a116-6643e690b0f1,[],,"Ivan Ilyin was born in 1883 in the noble family while Russia was an Empire. His father was the godson of the Emperor Alexander II. Ilyin received a good education and became a philosopher. He was most interested in teachings of the German scientist Georg Hegel, who paid considerable attention to religion.

Ilyin took the Bolshevik coup of 1917 extremely negatively. He openly opposed the Soviet government and the Bolsheviks, supported the White Movement instead. But the “whites” lost the civil war in Russia, and the USSR was formed. Proponents of “white” ideas became undesirable to the Communists, so the Soviet authorities started to persecute them. In 1922, on the orders of Vladimir Lenin within the Communist program of fighting against dissent, the so-called “philosophersʼ steamboats” went from USSR to Germany with the undesirable expelled public figures on board. Ilyin was among these intellectuals. As one of Leninʼs allies, Lev Trotsky, said at the time, “we sent these people away because there was no reason to kill them, and it was impossible to tolerate them”.

On September 29, 1922 the Oberburgermeister Haken steamer sailed from Russian Petrograd city (nowadays St.Petersberg) to the German Stettin city (now ― Szczecin, Poland). Ilyin and his family were aboard.

Ilyin lived and worked in Germany for a long time, but in 1934 he moved to Switzerland, where he died. The reason for the move was the conflict with the Nazis. His official biography in Russia states that Ilyin refused to become a teacher in the Third Reich, but there are versions that the views of the philosopher and the Nazis differed on key issues: “Jewish” and “Ukrainian”.

While Ilyin opposed the Holocaust and did not accept the Nazisʼ idea of exterminating the Jews, the supporters of the ""whites"" never considered Ukraine an independent state. During the Civil War, the entire White Movement spoke under the slogan “Great, United, and Indivisible Russia”. Of course, they perceived Ukraine exclusively as part of the Russian state.

In 1938, the “white” organization held the congress in Romania and approved resolutions drafted by Ilyin. On the issue of Ukraine, he noted: “Ukraine is recognized as the most threatening part of Russia in terms of secession and conquest. Ukrainian separatism is an artificial phenomenon devoid of real grounds. It arose from the ambition of leaders and international conquest. The “Malorossians” [the Little, Lesser Russians] are a branch of a single Slavic-Russian people. This branch has no reason to be at enmity with other branches of the same people and to be a separate state. In case of separation this state becomes an object of the conquest and plunder of foreigners. Little Russia and Great Russia are united by religion, tribe, historical destiny, geographical location, economy, culture, and politics. Foreigners preparing for dismemberment must remember that they are declaring an age-old struggle for all of Russia”.

Ivan Ilyin, 1883-1954.

Being in exile, Ilyin opposed the Communists and the Soviet Union. He also constantly wondered what Russia should be like after the Soviet Unionʼs fall. All his works are imbued with the ideas of monarchism and special Russian Orthodoxy role. Ilyin believed that Russia could not be a republic (ie, a democracy).

""What form of government will then be possible, necessary, desirable, saving? The answer is clear and simple: non-partisan, supra-class, national, religiously inspired, and vitally creatively flexible dictatorship. Only it will be able to stop any new civil war with a powerful, authoritative hand, suppress party massacres and nationalist pogroms, reduce the period of chaos, urge the population to immediately start peaceful work, to cleanse the country of communist evil, and introduce just, sustainable forms of justice. this, the country will face a new era of progressive disintegration and chaos, with perpetual uprisings of adventurers subsidized from abroad and new attempts at disastrous dismemberment from both outside and inside. No republican form, centrifugal by its nature, will cope with this task”, wrote Ilyin.

The philosopher constantly wrote about Russiaʼs ideological struggle with Western countries. The latter, according to Ilyin, will never be able to understand Russia. It will consider it a “colossus on the clay feet”, and think only about dividing it.

""The West has never really known or understood Russia. Not knowing its language, not feeling its spirit, the West believed every nonsense about Russia and invented and spread this nonsense itself. Europe feared, disliked, and despised Russia. For the past 100 years, Europe has always been prepared to harm, weaken, and slander it. The West was interested in Russia only regarding trade and military. And maybe in what its possible dismemberment or subordination meant for society. Following the secret instructions from European political centers, which will later be established and revealed by historians, Russia was slanderously glorified around the world as a ""reactionist stronghold,"" the nest of despotism and slavery, a hotbed of anti-Semitism, and a colossus on the feet of clay,"" said Ilyin.

Despite being effectively banned during the Soviet era, religion also played an essential role in Ilyinʼs views. The philosopher constantly wrote about the peculiarities of Russian Orthodoxy and believed that it should play an important role in the restoration of national Russia.

""Being Russian means more than just speaking Russian. It means to accept Russia with all your heart, love its precious identity, and unparalleled originality in human history. It means to understand that this uniqueness is a gift of God given to the Russian people, and at the same time, Godʼs sign protecting Russia from the encroachment of other nations. It means to demand freedom and independence on earth for this gift. To be a Russian means to perceive Russia in Godʼs ray, in its eternal fabric, its imperishable substance, and to accept it with love as one of the main, cherished relics of oneʼs personal life"", said Ilyin.

However, there is a moment in Ilyinʼs biography that is rarely mentioned in modern Russia. World War II split Russians that were living abroad into two camps. The first one supported he Third Reich in the confrontation with the USSR. Others, despite their hatred of communism, still chose to side with Russia. Ilyin was in the first group. He generally believed that fascism and Nazism “saved” Europe from the spread of communism. According to him, Adolf Hitler stopped the process of Bolshevism in Europe, doing European countries “the greatest favor.” After the war, Ilyin wrote another piece, analyzing why fascism and Nazism failed and what lessons Russia should take from this.

Nazi Germanyʼs leader Adolf Hitler greets the crowd during a parade in Nuremberg in 1936.

""Fascism appeared as a response to Bolshevism, a concentration of right-wing forces protected by the state. This was a healthy, necessary, and inevitable phenomenon during the onset of left-wing chaos and left-wing totalitarianism. In the future, such concentration will take place even in the most democratic states. In the hour of national danger, the healthy forces of the people will always concentrate in the direction of [the countryʼs] protection and dictatorship. the new Europe, thatʼs what will be happening in the future... [Francisco] Franco and [Antonio] Salazar understood this. They try to avoid such mistakes. They do not call their regime ""fascist."" Letʼs hope that Russian patriots will fully understand the mistakes of fascism and [Nazism] and will not repeat them"", the philosopher wrote.

In Soviet times, no one knew about Ilyin, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union, independent Russia began to restore his “legacy”. The philosopherʼs works have been included in school and university programs. Questions about Ilyin are often asked in the Unified State Exam (Russian state testing for school graduates). In Yekaterinburg, the Institute named after Ilyin was opened, and a monument to him was erected there. A memorial plaque was hung on the building of the Moscow State Institute in Moscow, and the Ilyin Orthodox Law Foundation appeared in St. Petersburg.

Putin quoted Ilyin at least three times in his address to the Federal Assembly: in 2005, 2006, and 2014. “The main source of his [Putinʼs] thoughts were the works of the philosopher Ivan Ilyin. Based on his works, Putin formulated the basic values ​​of the Russian man: God, family, and private property. “Despite all external fluctuations, Russians must defend this conservative order more than other nations. This order is more important to us. We are Orthodox not by chance. If it was not for Orthodoxy, our identity would be different. And by accepting Orthodoxy, we have, one way or another, opposed ourselves to the Western world, repeats after Putin one of his advisers. Another insider says that at some point, Putin himself became the most important ""screpa"" that ""binds"" the Russian people from Kaliningrad to Kamchatka. The president believed that everything would fall apart without him”, Russian journalist Mikhail Zygar wrote in his book All the Kremlinʼs Men.

In 2005, Ilyinʼs ashes were reburied in Russia, on the Don Monastery territory in Moscow. Other well-known representatives of the White Movement, Generals Vladimir Kappel, and Anton Denikin, were reburied there with him. For several years, their graves were neglected, but then Putin addressed the issue himself. According to the Russian Orthodox Church Metropolitan Tikhon, who is often called the Russian presidentʼs deputy, when Putin saw photos of the graves, he was unhappy and ordered to build a memorial there. He personally participated in the sketch approval, and the monument itself was allegedly erected ""at his own expense"". In 2009 a memorial to white warriors was opened there. Putin participated in the opening ceremony.

Memorial to ""white soldiers"" in the Don Monastery in Moscow. Denikin, Ilyin, their wives and General Kappel are buried here. The memorial was opened in 2009 wih the ceremony that included speeches from Russian Patriarch Kirill and Vladimir Putin.

In a conversation with journalists, he also quoted General Denikin. Or, to be more precise, he voiced his views on Ukraine, calling it ""Malorossiya"" [From Russian ""Little Russia""].

Anton Denikin is one of the most famous participants in the Russian Civil War and a member of the White Movement. He was born in 1872 in the Warsaw province and dedicated his life to the Russian army. He participated in the Russo-Japanese War and the First World War. Denikin opposed the Bolsheviks and therefore led the military units of the “whites”. In fact, he was the leader of the White Movement in the south of the Russian Empire, which was its main bridgehead. During the Civil War, the Whites controlled the majority of Kuban, Crimea, and Left-Bank Ukraine. In the summer of 1919, Denikin even took Kyiv but stayed there just for six months.

Anton Denikin, 1872-1947.

The Whites lost, and Denikin was forced to emigrate from the Soviet state. At first, he went to Constantinople, then, after traveling through a number of European countries, he stopped in France. There he faced World War II. Unlike Ilyin, Denikin did not support the Third Reich and was backing the USSR. After the France occupation, the Germans even came to him with an offer to lead Russian military units of the Third Reich army. He refused. After the war in Europe, there was an increase of Soviet influence. Denikin was worried that he might be deported to the USSR. Therefore, he moved to the United States, where he died in 1955. He was buried there until his ashes were transported to modern Russia.

Denikin was an ardent supporter of imperial Russia and denied any possibility of its division. Independent Ukraine for him simply did not exist. After the capture of Kyiv, he signed the so-called “Address to the Population of Malorossiya"", in which he actually stated his attitude to the Ukrainian nation.

""Wanting to weaken the Russian state before declaring war on it, the Germans sought to destroy the united Russian tribe forged in a difficult struggle long before 1914. To do this, they supported and inflated a movement in southern Russia that set itself the goal of separating its nine provinces from Russia under the name ""Ukrainian State.""The desire to separate the Malorossiya branch of the Russian people from Russia has not been abandoned to this day . the foundations for the Russia dismemberment, continue to carry out their evil work of creating an independent “Ukrainian State” and fight against the revival of United Russia”, he wrote.

But Denikin assured that there would be no repression against the Ukrainian language, which he called ""Malorossiyan"". In his address, he said that it would be permitted in schools, courts, and government agencies. He promised that the Ukrainian press would also be allowed. However, Ukrainian historians note that Denikinʼs policy in Ukraine was almost like genocide: the so-called Galician language was banned, all Ukrainian signs were removed, and Shev monumentchenkos disappeared. Denikinʼs subordinates organized killings of Jews and robbed peasants.

""No Russia, whether reactionary or democratic, republican or authoritarian, will ever allow Ukraine to be separated. The senseless, groundless, and externally aggravated dispute between Moscow Rus and Kyivan Rus is our internal dispute, which is not of anyone elseʼs concern and will be resolved among ourselves"", Denikin stated.

Memorial to ""white soldiers"" in the Don Monastery in Moscow. Denikin, Ilyin, their wives and General Kappel are buried here. The memorial was opened in 2009 wih the ceremony that included speeches from Russian Patriarch Kirill and Vladimir Putin.

Back in 2009, during the opening of the White Warriors Memorial, Putin quoted the very last part of this statement to the journalists. At the time, the Western media actively discussed his words. Putin was accused of disrespecting Ukraine and its sovereignty. Viktor Yushchenko, who was the President of Ukraine at that time, even had to respond to such statements. ""We are building our state with respect for the other countriesʼ independence and sovereignty, and we demand the same attitude from our neighbors: itʼs time to forget about the ambitions of the metropolis and perceptions of the colony. They belong in history"", he said.

But Putin continued to stand his ground. A year later, journalists asked him to explain what he meant. What Putin said then only confirmed his views on “Ukraine being inseparable from Russia”.

""Of course, we were a much more powerful force when we were together. That is why sensible and patriotic country politicians never allowed the idea of ​​separating and dividing such unified components of the country like Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. In Soviet times, we liked to blame the leaders of the White Movement. against the Red Army. He categorically rejected any proposals even to discuss the possibility of Russiaʼs division and stressed that this has always been and will remain an internal affair of the Russian people. The indivisible Russian people"", he said.

(NEW YORK) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""special military operation"" into neighboring Ukraine began on Feb. 24, with Russian troops invading from Belarus, to the north, and Russia, to the east. Russian forces have since been met with ""stiff resistance"" from Ukrainians, according to U.S. officials.

In recent days, Russian forces have retreated from northern Ukraine, leaving behind a trail of death and destruction. After graphic images emerged of civilians lying dead in the streets of Bucha, a town northwest of Kyiv, the United States and European countries accused Russia of committing war crimes.

""Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank -- none of it should on hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide half a world away,"" Biden said in Menlo, Iowa, during remarks primarily about the U.S. economy.

Biden was asked by reporters on April 4 if he thought the atrocities in Bucha were a genocide, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had claimed. ""No, I think it is a war crime,"" Biden responded then.

That same day, Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the administration had not yet seen the ""systematic deprivation of life"" necessary to meet the definition of genocide.

Biden confirmed his word choice to the White House pool Tuesday evening before boarding Air Force One, saying that since last week the ""evidence is mounting.""

""Yes, I called it genocide,"" Biden said. ""Because it has become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian.""

He then qualified that the determination of genocide is officially up to legal experts, but that ""it sure seems that way to me.""

White House could announce up to $750M in new Ukrainian military aid, official says

The Biden administration could announce as early as Wednesday upward of $750 million in additional military assistance to Ukraine, a U.S. official told ABC News.

US State Department condemns arrest of Russian opposition activist

The U.S. State Department is condemning the arrest in Russia of Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian opposition activist and critic of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine.

State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Kara-Murza's arrest on Monday is another example of a Russian government ""that is more aggressive beyond its borders and more oppressive within its borders.""

He condemned Kara-Murza's arrest, noting that the activist has previously been arrested by Russian authorities and that he has survived two poisoning incidents.

""The Russian people -- and this is the key point -- like people everywhere, have the right to speak freely, to form peaceful associations, to exercise their freedom of expression and to have their voices heard through free and fair elections,"" Price said.

Kara-Murza, a Washington Post columnist who has testified before Congress, survived poisoning incidents in 2015 and in 2017. At the time of his second poisoning, Kara-Murza's wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, gave an exclusive interview to ABC News in which she pleaded for then-President Donald Trump to support her husband and warned that Putin ""cannot be dealt with on friendly terms.""

Following her husband's arrest this week, Evgenia Kara-Murza posted a message on Twitter calling attention to her husband's arrest.

""Twice have the Russian authorities tried to kill my husband for advocating for sanctions against thieves and murderers, and now they want to throw him in prison for calling their bloody war a WAR. I demand my husband's immediate release!"" Evgenia Kara-Murza, who lives in the Washington, D.C., area, tweeted.

Pro-Russian oligarch captured in Ukraine: Zelenskyy

Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian oligarch and personal friend of Vladimir Putin, has been captured in Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy posted a photo on his official Telegram account of the captured Medvedchuk in handcuffs and wearing military fatigues.

The photo was accompanied by a caption praising the Security Service of Ukraine's ""special operation"" that led to Medvedchuk's capture. ""Well done! Details later. Glory to Ukraine,"" the caption reads.

Medvedchuk is a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician and leader of Ukraine's Opposition Platform.

In May 2021, Ukraine indicted Medvedchuk on charges of treason and attempting to steal natural resources from Russia-annexed Crimea. He was initially placed under house arrest in Ukraine but escaped just days after the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24.

Medvedchuk's detention was also confirmed by Ukraine's Security Service on their official Facebook page. The agency said Medvedchuk was wearing a uniform from the Ukrainian armed forces to disguise himself.

Medvedchuk is a business oligarch in Ukraine with very close ties to Putin. The Ukrainian National News Agency reported that Putin is the godfather of one of Medvedchuk's daughters.

Biden, British prime minister discuss more Ukraine assistance

President Joe Biden spoke with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson by phone Tuesday about the need to accelerate military and economic assistance to Ukraine, according to a spokesperson for Johnson.

""The Prime Minister updated President Biden on his recent visit to Kyiv, and said he had been humbled by President Zelenskyy’s strength and resolve,"" the spokesperson said.

The leaders discussed the need to accelerate assistance to Ukraine, including bolstering military and economic support as Ukrainian forces prepare for another Russian onslaught in the east of the country.

""The prime minister paid tribute to the U.S.’ colossal military contribution to Ukraine, and updated on the U.K.’s new package of support, including anti-ship missiles and military vehicles, which would arrive in the coming days and weeks,"" the spokesperson said. ""Both leaders were clear that Putin would never be able to hold down the spirit of the Ukrainian people, despite his monstrous attempts.""

The most recent $800 million U.S. military aid package for Ukraine has mostly been delivered and will be completed in the coming days, a U.S. defense official said Tuesday.

""Yesterday, two U.S. flights arrived in the region with everything from small-arms ammunition, machine guns, body armor, grenades and other explosives,"" the official said.

So far, the United States has sent 19 out of an expected 20 flights needed to deliver the $800 million package.

Johnson, according to his spokesperson, told Biden that a long-term commitment to Ukraine was needed from the international community to ensure the Ukrainian people’s vision for their country’s freedom can be realized.

“The pair also agreed to continue joint efforts to ratchet up the economic pressure on Putin and decisively end Western reliance on Russian oil and gas,"" Johnson's spokesperson said.

403 bodies recovered in Bucha: Mayor

In a televised announcement on Tuesday, Anatoliy Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, Ukraine, said that the bodies of 403 people presumably killed by Russian forces have been recovered in his city and that he expects the number to rise.

Fedoruk said 16 residents of Bucha remain unaccounted for and are presumed dead.

He said 163 of the 403 bodies recovered have been identified.

Fedoruk alleged last week that nearly all of those killed in Bucha are civilians.

Surviving residents of the besieged town told an ABC News crew in Bucha last week that Russian troops allegedly tortured people before killing them and executed many men under the age of 50.

When ABC News arrived in Bucha on Tuesday, bodies still lay in the streets.

Russia has denied committing atrocities in Ukraine and said it is not targeting civilians.

US concerned Russia could disguise chemical weapons: Official

A senior U.S. defense official said Tuesday that the United States cannot confirm whether Russia used chemical agents in Mariupol or elsewhere in Ukraine but that the Pentagon is concerned Russian forces could disguise such attacks.

The Department of Defense has seen evidence Russia has considered disguising the use of chemical weapons by making them appear to be more benign riot control agents, the official said.

""In the past we've had indications that that could be one thing that the Russians look at is the potential mixing of agents with the idea that they could disguise a more serious attack by using the vehicle and the techniques of riot control agents,"" the official said.

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby released a similar statement Monday night to address social media reports claiming Russia used a chemical weapon in Mariupol.

""These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia’s potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine,"" Kirby said.

Blinken meets with UN refugee chief amid Ukraine crisis

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was meeting Tuesday morning with U.N. refugee agency chief Filippo Grandi amid the crisis in Ukraine and other upheavals that have displaced people around the globe.

""We've only seen that challenge increase and, of course, Ukraine is now added to the mix with Russian aggression displacing, within Ukraine or outside of Ukraine, two-thirds of the children in that country, as well as, of course, many, many adults,"" Blinken said while sitting across the table from Grandi.

There are some 95 million people displaced across the globe, with the number of refugees alone larger than the populations of Spain or South Korea, Blinken said.

Blinken added the United States is ""grateful"" for the work the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is doing to meet the needs of refugees. He said the United States is working with the agency to both resettle refugees in the United States and care for refugee populations overseas.

Grandi praised the United States for being the largest donor and the largest resettlement country for refugees.

But weeks after the Biden administration said it would admit up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, Grandi said the White House has released no details about how the United States will do that.

""This figure that he (Blinken) mentioned -- 95 million -- maybe 96 million by today, who knows?"" Grandi said, adding that the number of refugees had gone up by 12 million in less than two months with the crisis in Ukraine.

Grandi noted other crises from Afghanistan to Africa and Venezuela that have displaced people and said of Russia's war in Ukraine, ""That crisis should not make us forget everything else.""

Putin calls Russia's objectives in Ukraine 'noble'

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that his country's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine would undoubtedly achieve its ""noble"" objectives.""

""On the one hand, we are helping and saving people, and on the other, we are simply taking measures to ensure the security of Russia itself,"" Putin said, according to Russian news agencies. ""It's clear that we didn't have a choice. It was the right decision.""

Putin made the comments while visiting the Vostochny Cosmodrome, a Russian spaceport in the Amur Oblast in the Russian Far East, to mark Russia's annual Cosmonautics Day.

He was joined by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. The two leaders held talks on bilateral relations and the situation in Ukraine, without the participation of Russian or Ukrainian delegations.

Nine humanitarian corridors to open in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday

Nine humanitarian corridors are expected to open in eastern Ukraine again on Tuesday to allow civilians escape heavy fighting, according to Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

She said in a statement via social media Tuesday that evacuation routes were agreed upon for those traveling by private cars from besieged Mariupol in the Donetsk Oblast, as well as from Berdyansk, Tokmak and Enerhodar in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast -- all of which lead to the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.

In the Luhansk Oblast, Vereshchuk said routes were established from the cities of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske and Rubizhne, leading to the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk Oblast.

The same routes were opened Monday, allowing a total of 4,354 people to evacuate via buses and private cars, according to Vereshchuk. However, Vereshchuk said buses carrying people from Berdyansk, Tokmak and Enerhodar to Zaporizhzhia city were being held up by Russian forces at a checkpoint in Vasylivka for a third day in a row.

Ukraine investigating alleged chemical attack in Mariupol

Ukraine announced Tuesday it is investigating claims that chemical weapons were used in an attack against Ukrainian soldiers in besieged Mariupol.

The Azov Regiment, a far-right group now part of the Ukrainian National Guard, alleged in a statement via Telegram on Monday that a Russian drone had dropped ""a poisonous substance of unknown origin"" on its fighters defending a giant metals plant in Mariupol, a southeastern port city in Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast that has been subjected to heavy bombardment since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24. The Azov, which did not provide evidence of the alleged attack, said its fighters had suffered minor injuries.

The claims could not be independently verified by ABC News.

Eduard Basurin, a spokesperson for Russia-backed separatist forces in Donetsk Oblast, denied the allegations, telling Russian news agency Interfax that separatist forces ""haven't used any chemical weapons in Mariupol."" However, on the eve of the alleged attack, Basurin appeared to urge their use, telling Russian state media that Russia-backed forces should seize the Mariupol metals plant from Ukrainian soldiers by blocking all the exits and using ""chemical troops to smoke them out.""

Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Tuesday the government is investigating the claims, adding that preliminary information suggested phosphorous munition had been used.

When deployed as a weapon, phosphorus can inflict excruciating burns and lead to infection, shock and organ failure. Although phosphorus is not classified as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention, its use as an incendiary weapon in civilian areas is forbidden under the Geneva Conventions.

The United Kingdom is ""working urgently"" to investigate the reports, according to U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who noted that any confirmed use of chemical weapons in Mariupol would be a ""callous escalation"" of the war.

U.K. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told Sky News on Tuesday that ""all options are on the table in terms of how the West might respond.""

Meanwhile, the United States said it was ""aware"" of the reports.

""We cannot confirm at this time and will continue to monitor the situation closely,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement Monday. ""These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia's potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine.""
