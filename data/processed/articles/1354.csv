While the Russian army continues to advance in Ukraine on the fifth day of its invasion, new footage from the region continues to emerge. On 27 February, the Ukrainian Armed Forces posted a series of videos on various government social media pages of the successful operations carried out by Ukraine‚Äôs small fleet of Bayraktar TB2 drones against Russian forces.

On 27 February, Ukrainian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi posted the first footage of the Ukrainian Army‚Äôs Bayraktar TB2 on his social media account. The footage showed a TB2 neutralizing some Russian vehicles with the caption, ‚ÄúWhat the life-giving Bayraktar does! Chornobayivka, Kherson region. Welcome to Hell!‚Äù The images show that the vehicle, which was most likely loaded with ammunition, continued to burn and explode for some time.

Later that day, Zaluzhnyi shared a second piece of footage of a TB2 destroying a Buk 3 air defense system in a Russian convoy believed to be in Zhytomyr Oblast‚Äôs Malina region. A statement saying, ‚ÄúBayraktar at work. Our troops are destroying enemy troop convoys. Enemies, be afraid! There will be no peace for you in our world!‚Äù was also included.

On 28 February, one day after the Ukrainian Armed Forces released the first confirmed images, a video showing a second Buk air defense system being neutralized by the Bayraktar TB2 in a wooded region was posted to its social media account. With this, Ukraine has confirmed a total of three videos though others have surfaced.

The Ukrainian Embassy in Ankara tweeted a video of Russian military vehicles that were destroyed by Bayraktar drones with the caption, ‚ÄúThe revenge of 34 Turkish soldiers killed by Russian soldiers in Idlib 2 years ago was exacted in Ukraine. Divine justice!‚Äù After receiving a considerable amount of backlash, the embassy was forced to remove that post. The same footage was published by the embassy in another post during the day, with the caption ‚ÄúRussian invaders must also endure Bayraktar TB2 UCAVs.‚Äù

The Ukrainian Armed Forces‚Äô posts came amid a flurry of speculation on social media and in the press about the role of Bayraktar TB2 drones purchased from Turkey in the war. Despite the fact that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense announced that Bayraktar TB2s were being actively used, stating that a train carrying fuel and ammunition from Russia to the occupying forces in Ukraine was destroyed by a Bayraktar TB2 drone with the message, ‚ÄúBelieve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Death to enemies!‚Äù No confirmed footage of the use of TB2s were published until 27 February, resulting in information pollution and misinformation in the press and on social media.

Some of this misinformation was spread by accounts on social media that backed Russia. According to users and press organizations, the majority of the 12 Bayraktar TB2s in the Ukrainian Armed Forces‚Äô inventory were destroyed as a result of Russia‚Äôs bombing of Ukrainian air bases, citing the Russian Federation‚Äôs report that it had shot down 9 UAVs since the beginning of the war. Later, when Ukraine‚Äôs Ministry of Defense requested in a Facebook post that all citizens with RC planes and drones support Kyiv against the Russian invasion, misinformation about Ukraine losing most of its Bayraktar TB2s at the start of the war spread again on social media and various media outlets ‚Äì with some citing this call for civilian drones.

Faced with the dissemination of this false information, dozens of unsubstantiated Bayraktar TB2 images were shared on social media by various Ukrainian media outlets and users. It was later revealed that the majority of the images showing Bayraktar TB2 systems destroying Russian tanks and armored vehicles, which were shared by hundreds of people, were captured during the Turkish Armed Forces‚Äô Spring Shield Operation in 2020.

One of the images circulated on social media claiming that the Bayraktar TB2 destroyed Russian tanks in Ukraine, but which actually belongs to the Turkish Armed Forces‚Äô Spring Shield Operation in 2020.

In 2019, the Ukrainian Armed Forces purchased six Bayraktar TB2s and three ground control stations as part of their military modernisation program. Following the aircraft‚Äôs successful use, the Ukrainian Navy purchased five Bayraktar TB2s, the first of which arrived in July 2021. In an interview with the Azerbaijani news agency Report last summer, Ukrainian Chief of General Staff Valerii Zaluzhnyi stated that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have 12 Bayraktar TB2s in their inventory.

Last year, the Ukrainian army utilized the Bayraktar TB2 drones for the first time in aerial target demolition exercises near the Belarusian border in the Rivne region. In October 2021, the Ukrainian army announced that it had destroyed a separatist D-30 howitzer with a TB-2 purchased from Turkey, marking the weapon‚Äôs first operational use in Ukraine.

Bayraktar TB2s, which are widely used in Turkish operations, were essential in Azerbaijan‚Äôs success over Armenia. When utilized appropriately, these systems, which were later used in Syria and Libya, demonstrated their strength and effect in global conflict zones by shifting the strategic balance of conflicts.

Soldiers from the Ukrainian Armed Forces Air Force have completed specialized training in the operation and maintenance of the Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aerial vehicle complex in Turkey / From the official site of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine

The Bayraktar TB2 Tactical Armed / UAV System, developed by Baykar, is a network-based, integrated system that provides all of the options that an operator would require. Bayraktar TB2 Armed / UAV Platform, Ground Control Station, Ground Data Terminal, Remote Display Terminal, Advanced Base with Generator, and Trailer modules are all part of the system.

The Bayraktar TB2 Tactical Armed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is a surveillance and intelligence UAV in the medium altitude-long endurance class (MALE). With its triple redundant avionics systems and sensor fusion design, it can perform fully autonomous taxi, takeoff, landing, and normal navigation. The Bayraktar TB2 can fly for up to 27 hours and has a height of 2.2 meters, a wingspan of 12 meters, and a length of 6.5 meters. The TB2 has a 105 horsepower internal combustion injection engine and can fly at a maximum speed of 120 knots at an operational height of 18 thousand feet. With a payload of 150 kg, TB2s can precisely mark the target with the laser target designator on the EO and deliver up to four smart munitions from Roketsan‚Äôs MAM (MAM-L, MAM-C, MAM-T) GPS/INS laser-guided smart munitions family developed for unmanned aerial vehicle platforms to the target.

While Ukraine‚Äôs TB2 fleet seems to have survived the initial invasion and scored some operational success further footage and verification will be needed before opinions on its effectiveness can be drawn. This, however, hasn‚Äôt stopped someone with Ukrainian Land Forces public affairs office apparently composing a musical tribute to the drone, shared on the Ukrainian Land Force‚Äô facebook page.

As Russia pounded Ukraine in the opening days of its invasion, the defenders credited a new piece of equipment with helping them fight back ‚Äî the Bayraktar TB2 drone.

Videos shared by the Ukrainian military showed at least one strike appearing to tear apart a column of Russian tanks and armored vehicles.

One came from Malyn in the Zhytomyr region, about 150 kilometers from Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and shows the destruction of a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile launcher, the Ukrainian military said.

""Bayraktars at work,"" the caption for the same video posted on an official military Facebook page said. ""Be afraid, enemies, there will be no peace for you in our land."" The operators can be heard cheering in the video after the strike lands.

Another was from southern Ukraine's Chornobaivka, an area that experienced heavy fighting from Russian forces pouring in via Crimea, which is occupied by Russia.

Footage from the ground appears to show the aftermath, with charred, smoking metal strewed along a highway. The first video below was shared by the Ukrainian Embassy in Turkey and the second by a staffer at the open-source research collective Bellingcat.

‚ÄîUkraine in Turkey (@UKRinTR) February 27, 2022

The Russian invasion of Ukraine represents the first outing in a major conflict for the Bayraktar, an armed drone with a 12-meter wingspan and a distinctive triangular tail section.

It is produced by the Turkish weapons manufacturer Baykar, which says the drones can reach altitudes of 25,000 feet and fly for 27 continuous hours, operated remotely from up to 300 km away. Each one can carry up to four laser-guided bombs or rockets, for an estimated total payload of 150 kilograms.

The Bayraktar is showing the effectiveness of small drones like this to unleash havoc on invading columns of vehicles. A US MQ-9 Reaper, by comparison, has a 20-meter wingspan and can carry up to 1,701 kilograms of ordnance.

According to The Wall Street Journal, they can also be a powerful aid to artillery strikes by giving laser-pinpointed coordinates for strikes that would otherwise involve some guesswork.

Ukraine received the drones for the first time in 2019 but didn't use them in combat until last year. Its armed forces published a video of the first time one was used, to destroy a separatist piece of artillery in the Donbas:

The drone quickly acquired celebrated status among Ukrainians as war descended, and videos of its prowess went viral on social media: Insider counted more than 5 million views across various iterations of the above videos between Facebook and Twitter posts.

In a widely shared video of an unnamed Ukrainian soldier mocking the Russians, the drones' power was a key point: ""Is everything OK with you, dudes? How do you like our Bayraktars? What do you think ‚Äî oh, what's that flying over you right now?""

On Telegram, the popular channel run by the Ukrainian parliament shared both Bayraktar strike videos on Sunday, the first of which said, ""Let's win together!"" and the second of which concluded, ""Our army, our power!""

The Ukrainian Embassy in Turkey posted videos of the strikes and their aftermath. According to The Journal, one message in Turkish translated to: ""Never a rose without a thorn. Russian invaders have to put up with Bayraktar TB2s.""

It said the embassy also called the strikes ""divine justice,"" framing them as revenge for an airstrike in Syria that killed 34 of its troops, for which some have blamed Russia.",https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-hypes-bayraktar-drone-as-videos-show-destroyed-russia-tanks-2022-2
4,78c6a511-7ec4-4974-9aaf-abc268d51a29,['Billy Perrigo'],,"In a video that went viral on Twitter Sunday night, a massive explosion rips through what appears to be a Russian convoy, scoring a direct hit on a surface-to-air missile system.

The black-and-white footage, posted to the account of the Ukrainian armed forces, is one of several that have emerged on social media in recent days showing the devastating impact of Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian hardware. As the drone‚Äôs payload explodes in the video‚Äîwhich appears to be a cellphone recording of a screen in a Ukrainian drone facility‚Äîpeople at the facility can be heard gasping in awe before breaking out in cheers and applause.

The video racked up more than 3 million views on Twitter in two days. ‚ÄúHave fear, enemies! There will be no peace for you on our earth!‚Äù the Ukrainian armed forces wrote in the video‚Äôs caption.

The star of this video and others circulating on Twitter is the Bayraktar TB2‚Äîa type of Turkish drone that the Ukrainian military has increasingly deployed against Russian forces in recent days. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian military said that Bayraktar drones had destroyed one tank and two surface-to-air missile systems overnight. In other videos shared on Twitter, Bayraktar drones, in use by the military since at least 2021, are shown blowing up what appears to be a Russian fuel convoy and a group of supply trucks.

The drones are small and lightweight, (around seven times lighter than the U.S. military‚Äôs Reaper drone,) with a 12-meter wingspan that allows them to remain in the sky for up to 30 hours at a time. Each drone can each carry four laser-guided missiles, according to promotional material from Baykar Technologies, the company that produces them.

The impact of Bayraktar drones in Ukraine

Ukraine‚Äôs drone campaign has contributed to its early successes in slowing the Russian advance, and is revealing unexpected weaknesses on the part of the Russian army, U.S. and European military analysts say. Perhaps more significantly, analysts add, the videos are also becoming an increasingly prominent part of Ukraine‚Äôs information war ‚Äì giving Russian invaders a reason to fear their enemy, and providing a vital boost for Ukrainian morale amid fears of a coming military onslaught. Even so, the drones are unlikely to change the long-term course of the war, analysts point out.

‚ÄúThe footage released by the Ukraine military shows serious defects in Russian air defense cover, which is a surprise for many observers,‚Äù says Arda Mevl√ºtoƒülu, a Turkish military and aerospace analyst. ‚ÄúThe footage is also very useful for PR and psychological warfare.‚Äù

Reliable and accurate military drones were once the exclusive purview of the U.S. military. But the technology has become more commonplace in recent years, and is now a fixture of many 21st century battlefields. And Turkey is now the preeminent supplier. In the last two years, Turkish Bayraktar drones have appeared not only in Ukraine, but also Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Libya and Syria. Last year in Ethiopia, a rebel force was bearing down on the capital Addis Ababa before the government repelled them with the drones. In the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in 2020, Turkish drones proved decisive in the Azeri victory against Armenia ‚Äì a Russian ally.

‚ÄúIn recent years, the Bayraktars have scored some really famous successes,‚Äù says Tony Osborne, the London bureau chief of Aviation Week, a publication focused on the aerospace industry. ‚ÄúI would argue that it‚Äôs now the most famous drone of them all.‚Äù

The video shared by the Ukrainian armed forces on Sunday reveals one of the drones‚Äô key selling points: that they are capable of inflicting disproportionate damage on enemy hardware, far more cheaply than other drones, and at low risk. Osborne estimates that the Bayraktar drones were sold to Ukraine at a cost in the single-digit millions of dollars each ‚Äì but that the Russian surface-to-air missile system destroyed in the video on Sunday could be worth up to $50 million.

‚ÄúThe crucial thing about these is that they are cheap, and when they‚Äôre cheap you‚Äôre not so worried about losing them,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou can throw them into a fight and if they do score a dramatic hit, like we saw yesterday, suddenly you‚Äôre winning the attritional war.‚Äù

Osborne estimates that Ukraine likely has around 20 Baykar drones in its operational arsenal. In December, Bloomberg reported that Ukraine had placed orders for two dozen more, citing officials. Baykar did not respond to requests for comment.

Turkey‚Äôs growing role as a drone power

For Turkey, a NATO member, the drone sales to Ukraine align with its military interests ‚Äì namely preserving the balance of power in the Black Sea region, according to Galip Dalay, a specialist on Turkish and Middle Eastern politics at Chatham House, a London international affairs think tank.

While Bayraktar drones are manufactured by a private company, Baykar Technologies, the drones are widely seen to be an arm of Turkish foreign policy. The company‚Äôs chief technology officer, Sel√ßuk Bayraktar, is the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ‚ÄúCountries like the U.S., China, Israel, denied to sell Ukraine armed UAVs,‚Äù said Haluk Bayraktar, the company‚Äôs CEO and Sel√ßuk‚Äôs brother, during a webinar in May 2021. ‚ÄúTurkey was the only country to accept to sell Ukraine this technology.‚Äù

Turkish foreign policy has also animated the presence of Bayraktar drones in Syria, Libya and Azerbaijan ‚Äì all battlefields where Russian and Turkish proxies face off. ‚ÄúDrones give Turkey a geopolitical edge,‚Äù Dalay says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing to engage in conventional fighting in places like Libya or Syria, but it‚Äôs another thing to employ drones. Drones make Turkey‚Äôs job easier.‚Äù

In other cases, like Ethiopia, Turkish drone sales are likely motivated more by economic drivers than political ones. Turkey attached no political conditions to its drone exports, unlike the U.S., according to Mevl√ºtoƒülu.

The videos of Bayraktar drones visiting death upon Russian convoys have almost certainly been shared by the Ukrainian military to raise morale. But with a large column of Russian vehicles trundling toward Kyiv, any Ukrainian morale stemming from videos of drone strikes is likely to be short-lived. Baykar, on the other hand, looks set to reap the rewards long into the future. ‚ÄúNow that Turkey has a growing defense industry, you want to showcase your items as battle-tested,‚Äù Dalay says. ‚ÄúThose kinds of conflict zones have become major PR for the Turkish drone industry.‚Äù
