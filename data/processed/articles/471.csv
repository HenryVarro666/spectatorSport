The European Commission’s ‘Freeze and Seize’ Task Force, set up to ensure EU-level coordination to implement sanctions against listed Russian and Belarussian oligarchs, has begun a collaboration with a similar G7 structure.

It will work alongside the newly established ‘Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO)’ Task Force, under which the EU operates together with the G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Australia.

This cooperation will guarantee the efficiency of the sanctions taken on both sides of the Atlantic.

“Such initiatives are vital to achieve the rapid freezing and confiscation of the assets owned by individuals and entities targeted by the sanctions. We must therefore continue to step up our work together to identify oligarchs who help finance or organise actions in Ukraine, or who pursue illegal activities on the territory of the Union,” said Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders.

“Our combined measures are having a significant impact – the Russian economy is in free fall,” said Commissioner for Financial Services, Financial Stability and Capital Markets Union, Mairead McGuinness. “We need to ensure that those who provide services – financial, legal and others – to oligarchs to facilitate sanctions evasion are fully aware of the risks they run. We will investigate any and all efforts to breach our sanctions legislation and there will be consequences for violations. The focus of our work is to stop money flowing to the Russian war machine. Wealthy oligarchs supporting the Russian war machine need to know that they will not find any safe haven in the EU or elsewhere”.

The ‘Freeze and Seize’ Task Force is composed of the European Commission, national contact points from each Member State, Eurojust and Europol as well as other EU agencies and bodies.

Passage of new economic crime legislation

The Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 (the Act) received Royal Assent during the early hours of 15 March, following its expedited passage through the legislative process.

In summary, the Act contains the following key measures:

provision for an expedited procedure under which the UK can impose asset freezing sanctions on designated persons already subject to sanctions in an allied jurisdiction;

the introduction of expanded sanctions enforcement powers for the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI);

introduction of a new Register of Overseas Entities in relation to the ownership of UK property; and

reforms to the unexplained wealth order process.

The press release announcing publication of the Act also noted that the Home Secretary Priti Patel would attend the inaugural ministerial Russian Elites Proxies and Oligarchs Task Force on 16 March, which brought together finance and justice and home affairs ministers from the G7, EU and Australia responsible for the supervision of sanctions and enforcement work. This Task Force “aims to ensure the effective implementation of financial sanctions on Russian elites and oligarchs to further drive collective efforts to tackle Kremlin-linked illicit finance”.

New designations

Following the passage of the Act, OFSI announced the addition of 350 Russia-related entries to the UK’s asset freeze list. The vast majority of these are individuals, designated under the Act’s new “urgent procedure” on the basis of their previous designation by the EU, US, Australia and/or Canada, including a number of Members of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation. The newly-designated entities are: Gas Industry Insurance Company SOGAZ, Geopolitica, Internet Research Agency, New Eastern Outlook, and Oriental Review, all of which have been designated by the EU and/or US.

OFSI also announced the designation of eight further individuals and one entity under the UK’s cyber sanctions regime, all of whom are already subject to US Russia/cyber-related sanctions.

A further round of designations was announced during the evening of 15 March. This comprised the designation of 12 further individuals, and two further entities under the UK’s Russia regime, in all cases based on existing EU designations.

New trade sanctions: export tariffs and export finance support

On 15 March, the UK announced it would deny Russia and Belarus access to Most Favoured Nation tariffs for hundreds of their exports, publishing an initial list of goods which will now face an additional 35% tariff. The affected products are: iron, steel, fertilisers, wood, tyres, railway containers, cement, copper, aluminium, silver, lead, iron ore, residue/food waste products, beverages, spirits and vinegar, glass and glassware, cereals, oil seeds, paper and paperboard, machinery, works of art, antiques, fur skins and artificial fur, ships, and white fish.

The press release reports that the tariff increases will be legislated for using powers under the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018, and will be operationalised in the relevant customs systems next week (w/c 21 March).

On the same day, the UK announced that it would no longer issue any new guarantees, loans and insurance for exports to Russia and Belarus.

The Department for International Trade has expanded its Export Support Service to act as a single point of contact for businesses with questions about trading with Russia or Ukraine.

New export restrictions announced (not yet in force)

On 15 March, the UK also announced further Russian trade sanctions which will take the form of a ban on the export to Russia of listed luxury goods. These measures are not yet in force, and the list of affected items has yet to be published, although the press release notes that the restrictions “will likely affect luxury vehicles, high-end fashion and works of art”. It is anticipated that they will broadly mirror the new EU luxury goods restrictions mentioned below.

The export restrictions are to come into force “shortly”.

FCA statement on Russian divestments

On 13 March, the FCA responded to Chancellor Rishi Sunak's call for firms to stop investing in Russia, noting that there are currently significant practical challenges in terms of disposing of Russian assets and reminding firms to comply with sanctions requirements when carrying out any such transactions.

EU

On 15 March, the Council of the EU announced the formal agreement of a fourth package of EU sanctions against Russia, comprising the following:

a prohibition on any transactions with certain Russian state-owned enterprises (SOEs);

a prohibition on the provision to Russian persons of credit rating services, as well as access to related subscription services;

an expansion of the list of Russian companies on whom specific export restrictions have been imposed regarding dual-use goods;

a ban on new investment in the Russian energy sector and expansion of the existing trade sanctions regarding equipment, technology and services relevant to the energy sector;

trade restrictions on iron and steel products, and luxury goods; and

further designations of additional oligarchs and business elites, as well as military/defence.

Further detail on the new restrictions is contained in the underlying legislation, which was published in the Official Journal on 15 March. We have provided a summary of the key measures below.

The Commission has also published a Q&A on the fourth sanctions package.

Restrictions on dealing with Russian SOEs (in force from 16 March)

The majority of the new restrictions outlined above are contained in Council Regulation (EU) 2022/428 (Regulation 2022/428), amending Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 (the 2014 Russia Regulation). Regulation 2022/428 introduces a new Article 5aa into the 2014 Russia Regulation which prohibits engaging directly or indirectly in any transaction with: (i) the SOEs listed in Annex XIX of the 2014 Russia Regulation, (ii) non-EU entities owned as to more than 50% by an entity falling within (i) above, or (iii) any legal person, entity or body acting on behalf of, or at the direction of, an entity falling within (i) or (ii) above.

The following exemptions apply to this prohibition:

the execution until 15 May 2022 of contracts concluded before 16 March;

transactions which are strictly necessary for the purchase, import or transport of fossil fuels, as well as titanium, aluminium, copper, nickel, palladium and iron ore from or through Russia into the EU; and

transactions related to energy projects outside Russia in which an entity listed in Annex XIX is a minority shareholder.

Annex XIX contains the following: OPK Oboronprom, United Aircraft Corporation, Uralvagonzavod, Rosneft, Transneft, Gazprom Neft, Almaz-Antey, Kamaz, Rostec, JSC PO Sevmash, Sovcomflot, and United Shipbuilding Corporation. Although these entities have not been added to the EU’s designated persons list (such that there is no requirement to freeze their assets), the new measures will likely substantially restrict EU companies’ ability to do business with these entities, in particular after 15 May 2022 when the ‘grandfathering’ of existing contracts ceases to apply.

Credit rating services (in force from 16 March but takes effect as of 15 April)

As of 15 April 2022, the following will be prohibited under Article 5j of the 2014 Russia Regulation:

the provision of credit rating services to any Russian national or natural person residing in Russia, or any entity established in Russia; and

the provision of access to any subscription services in relation to credit rating activities to the same Russian persons.

There is an exemption for nationals or temporary/permanent residents of an EU Member State.

For these purposes, “credit rating” means an opinion regarding the creditworthiness of an entity, a debt or financial obligation, debt security, preferred share or other financial instrument, or of an issuer of such an obligation, security or instrument, issued using an established and defined ranking system of rating categories. “Credit rating activities” mean data and information analysis, and the evaluation, approval, issuing and review of credit ratings.

Dual-use goods (in force from 16 March)

Annex I to Regulation 2022/428 adds a number of additional entities to Annex IV of the 2014 Russia Regulation, bringing them within scope of the existing dual-use goods restrictions. Member State competent authorities may only issue a licence for the supply of dual-use goods (or related technical financial assistance) to Annex IV entities after having determined that such supply is necessary for health and safety grounds, or is due under a contract concluded before 26 February 2022 (provided the licence is sought before 1 May 2022).

Energy sector restrictions (in force from 16 March)

Companies operating in the energy sector will likely be familiar with the “Annex II” restrictions introduced by the 2014 Russia Regulation (these required prior authorisation for the supply to Russia of certain listed oil and gas equipment, with authorisation requests to be denied in respect of certain exploration and production projects). Regulation 2022/428 replaces those restrictions with a prohibition on the supply to Russia of Annex II items, along with related technical assistance, brokering services, financing or financial assistance.

This prohibition is subject to the following exemptions:

supply of goods (or related technical or financial assistance) necessary for: the transport of fossil fuels from or through Russia into the EU; or the urgent prevention or mitigation of an event likely to have a serious and significant impact on human health and safety or the environment;

the execution until 17 September 2022 of an obligation arising from a pre-16 March contract (subject to a requirement to make a prior notification to the relevant Member State competent authority); and

the provision of insurance or reinsurance to any EU entity with regard to its activities outside the energy sector in Russia.

Member State competent authorities may also license the supply of Annex II equipment or relevant technical/financial assistance if: (i) it is necessary for ensuring critical energy supply within the EU; or (ii) it is intended for the exclusive use of entities owned, or solely or jointly controlled by an EU-incorporated entity.

Regulation 2022/428 also prohibits the following:

acquisition of any new, or extension of any existing, participation in any entity incorporated under the law or Russia or any third country and operating in the energy sector in Russia;

granting or being part of any arrangement to grant any new loan or credit, or otherwise providing financing (including equity capital) to any entity incorporated under the law or Russia or any third country and operating in the energy sector in Russia, or for the documented purpose of financing such a person;

creating any new joint venture with any entity incorporated under the law of Russia or any third country and operating in the energy sector in Russia; and

providing investment services in relation to the above activities.

Member States may license such activities if: (i) they are necessary for ensuring critical energy supply within the EU; or (ii) they exclusively concern entities owned by an EU-incorporated entity.

Other trade sanctions (in force from 16 March)

Regulation 2022/428 introduces a new Annex XVII to the 2014 Russia Regulation, listing various iron and steel products. It is now prohibited to:

import Annex XVII products into the EU if they originate in or have been exported from Russia;

purchase Annex XVII products which are located in or originate in Russia;

transport Annex XVII products if they originate in Russia or are being exported from Russia to any other country; and

provide technical assistance, brokering services, financial or financial assistance (including financial derivatives as well as insurance and reinsurance) relating to the above prohibitions.

These restrictions are subject to an exemption in respect of the execution of pre-existing contracts until 17 June 2022.

Regulation 2022/428 also inserts into the 2014 Russia Regulation a new Annex XVIII listing various luxury goods. It is prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export Annex XVIII goods to any natural or legal person, entity or body in Russia or for use in Russia, insofar as their value exceeds €300 per item (unless otherwise specified in Annex XVIII). This is subject to an exemption in respect of goods which are necessary for the official purposes of diplomatic or consular missions of Member States or partner countries, international organisations, or the personal effects of their staff.

Additional designations (in force from 15 March)

The EU has added a further 15 individuals and nine entities to its Russia-related asset freeze list. The full list of names can be found in Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/427.

3,770b4a12-dc98-46eb-b3c2-7c8bbaf4c5be,[],,"Russia Sanctions : The U.S., EU, and UK continue to apply pressure on Russia through the implementation of additional sanctions. The UK instituted the most significant additional sanctions this week, designating more than 350 persons. The EU also prohibited engaging in transactions with an identified list of Russian state-owned companies and their subsidiaries outside of the EU, with limited exceptions. This list includes Rosneft, Transneft, Gazprom Neft, and a number of military companies. Many of the sanctions announced this week were targeted at the same entities and persons previously sanctioned by other jurisdictions.

Oligarch Sanctions : The U.S. partnered with Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Commission, to launch the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) multilateral task force. The task force consists of the Finance Ministry and Justice or Home Ministry in each jurisdiction. Its aim is to enhance coordination between the jurisdictions to enable information sharing that can lead to concrete actions. The U.S. Department of Justice’s KleptoCapture task force will help support this effort.

Additionally, a number of additional oligarchs and prominent businesspeople were sanctioned this week. The UK sanctioned more than 50 oligarchs, many of whom were previously designated by the U.S. or EU. These included Petr Aven, Mikhail Fridman, German Khan, and Andrey Guryev. The EU also sanctioned a handful of additional oligarchs including Roman Abramovich, German Khan, and Marina Sechina.

Export & Import Controls : The U.S. prohibited “new investments in any sector of the Russian Federation economy” as determined by the Department of State and Treasury. Using this authority, the U.S. prohibited the export of “luxury goods” to Russia. The EU implemented a similar measure. The two jurisdictions define luxury goods differently, but both prohibitions cover a large set of goods including everything from perfumes, to expensive cars, to clothing. The U.S. also prohibited the export of U.S. dollar-denominated banknotes, but provided limited general licenses to authorize the export in some circumstances for U.S. persons, or activities for the personal maintenance of individuals located in Russia.

The U.S. also prohibited the importation of Russian-origin fish, seafood, alcoholic beverages, and non-industrial diamonds. Additionally, the EU issued a general trade license permitting the provision of technical assistance, financial services and funds, and brokering services, related to vessels subject to recent regulations in some circumstances.

The U.S., EU, UK and G7 jointly announced an intention to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” trading status, enabling increases on import duties. In the U.S., the House of Representatives voted to strip Russia and Belarus of this status on March 17. The measure will now move to the Senate. The EU prohibited the import of Russian origin iron and steel products.",https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=8407f97a-0b83-4682-9d8d-d75e5a5abc0d
4,770b4a12-dc98-46eb-b3c2-7c8bbaf4c5be,[],,"International Alert

There have been a number of new developments concerning the U.S. economic sanctions and export controls since our previous alert on February 28, 2022, issued in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Over the past three weeks, the United States continues to seek ways to increase the pressure on Russia for its actions in Ukraine, imposing further economic sanctions, import bans, and export controls with respect to Russia as well as some relating to Belarus for its role in supporting Russia's aggression.

A few key highlights, covered in more detail below:

Executive Order (E.O.) 14066, issued on March 8, 2022, imposing an import ban on certain Russian-origin oil and gas products and prohibiting new investment by U.S. persons in Russia's energy sector

E.O. 14068, issued on March 11, 2022, imposing an import ban on Russian-origin fish and seafood (including preparations thereof), alcoholic beverages, and non-industrial diamonds; banning the supply of U.S. dollar-denominated banknotes from the U.S. or by U.S. persons to the Government of the Russian Federation or any person located in Russia; and providing authority for further import bans of any other Russian origin products and for further prohibitions on U.S. person investment in sectors of the Russian economy

The removal of several Russian and a few Belarusian banks from the international Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system

The U.S.'s impending revocation of Russia's and Belarus' Most Favored Nation (MFN) status under the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO)

The issuance of numerous General Licenses and important sanctions guidance in the form of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) by the U.S. Department of State's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)

Numerous new OFAC designations of Russian entities and individuals on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List)

Sweeping new export controls imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) on Belarus, similar to those recently imposed on Russia

Increased and new export controls issued by BIS relating to the oil and gas sector of Russia

New export controls on ""luxury items"" issued by BIS to Russia, Belarus, and certain individuals

Multilateral Russian Oligarch Task Force launched by U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department the Treasury (Treasury)

Key Takeaways

Russia's financial sector on the brink . The actions of the past few weeks have reinforced and expanded the initial wave of economic sanctions aimed at crippling Russia's financial sector and disentangling Russia's largest banks from U.S. and global financial systems. Perhaps more than any other measures, those targeted at Russia's financial sector have put extreme pressure on companies headquartered in the U.S., Europe, and other allied countries to proceed with extreme caution from a compliance risk perspective, as many look to wind down or withdraw from the Russian market. Even those companies currently committed to staying in Russia are experiencing significant difficulties carrying on routine business operations as a function of the proliferation of sanctioned Russian banks and the narrowing options for banking, payments, and related financial services.

Symbolic, as well as economic, costs imposed . Overall, the U.S. continues to seek ways to hold Russia accountable and isolate it from the global economic community for its invasion of Ukraine. Along with sanctions measures with more significant financial consequences for Russia, the U.S. has recently taken measures whose impact is primarily symbolic, such as banning the import of certain Russian origin goods, banning the export of luxury goods to Russia, and the impending revocation of Russia's MFN status, in order to further diminish and erode Russia's position in international community.

Close coordination with U.S. allies continues . The U.S.'s emphasis on international collaboration continues, with a number of the recent measures taken in coordination with other governments, and the U.S. continues to take the lead in implementing many measures: for example, the U.S., G7 members, and several other countries have announced their intentions to revoke Russia's MFN status; the U.S. has imposed an import ban on certain Russian oil and gas products, with the U.K. announcing its intention to do the same under a phased approach; the U.S., U.K., and EU have announced export bans on luxury goods to Russia; and South Korea has joined the list of countries that will impose stricter export controls with respect to Russia generally.

Impact on Russia's energy sector . The Russian energy sector continues to be a relatively divisive issue for the U.S. and its allies. With E.O 14066, the Biden administration seeks to further target Russia's energy sector while still avoiding collateral damage to U.S. allies, particularly Germany and other members of the EU. Although some countries such as the U.K. have joined the U.S. effort to further sanction this sector, a key source of revenue for Russia, others like Germany and Hungary have been less willing to do so.

Import ban on Russian crude oil and related products leaves important question open . The import ban under E.O. 14066 prohibits importation of Russian-origin crude oil, unless the crude oil has been substantially transformed in a different country. However, OFAC did not define substantial transformation whichmay become a critical issue for importers. Without a definition from OFAC, importers should rely on CBP's guidance on substantial transformation and be aware that recent court cases on substantial transformation indicate a potential shift in CBP guidance regarding what constitutes a substantial transformation.

E.O. 14068 leaves a few open-ended issues that U.S. companies with any investments, customers, or operations involving Russia and Belarus will need to monitor (if they are not already). The E.O. provides authority for imposing import bans on any Russian-origin products, so this area seems like a possible avenue for increasing pressure on Russia that the U.S. may pursue by expanding the list of prohibited items. As we've seen thus far, a key component of the Biden administration's economic strategy towards Russia is ensuring it has the option to escalate sanctions and export restrictions as it sees fit. Similarly, the E.O. provides authority for prohibiting U.S. person investment in additional sectors of the Russian economy. Once again, this provision is open-ended by design to give the U.S. flexibility to carefully target and cut off additional sectors of the Russian economy from U.S. foreign investment. Many companies have already paused investments or joint ventures in Russia or exited the region entirely in the wake of the expanded U.S. sanctions currently in place – we have seen first-hand that these exits can be complicated and may raise their own U.S. sanctions compliance challenges. U.S. companies seeking to remain in Russia despite the open-ended potential restrictions would be wise to proceed with caution and adopt measures (both financially and operationally) to enable a swift and smooth exit if necessary. This may include modifying contracts it has with its vendors, customers, and other Russia-based partners.

. E.O. 14068 leaves a few open-ended issues that U.S. companies with any investments, customers, or operations involving Russia and Belarus will need to monitor (if they are not already). Exporters of luxury goods should exercise care. U.S. companies involved in the export of luxury goods (including vehicles, alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and non-industrial diamonds) should carefully look through the list of items covered by the new licensing requirement and ensure they do not attempt to export such items to Russia or Belarus (or to newly sanctioned Russian and Belarusian oligarchs and ""malign actors"") without a license from BIS. The term ""luxury goods"" is broad in scope and exporters should be sure to check all of Supplement No. 5 to Part 746 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) for the full list. We envision a very narrow set of circumstances that will allow companies to successfully obtain a license under these new restrictions, given the present situation and BIS's stated licensing policy.

Overview of New U.S. Economic Sanctions

Executive Order 14066

On March 8, 2022, President Biden issued E.O. 14066, ""Prohibiting Certain Imports and New Investments with Respect to Continued Russian Federation Efforts to Undermine the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine."" This E.O. (1) imposes an import ban on certain Russian-origin oil and gas products; (2) prohibits ""new investments"" by U.S. persons in Russia's energy sector, and (3) prohibits U.S. persons from approving financing, facilitating, or guaranteeing transactions which, if conducted by a U.S. person, would be prohibited by the E.O.

The E.O. prohibits importation into the U.S. of the following Russian origin products: Crude oil Petroleum Petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation Liquefied natural gas Coal Coal products Notably, as confirmed in OFAC guidance in FAQ 1014, other Russian-origin energy products are not subject to this import prohibition.

Notably, as confirmed in OFAC guidance in FAQ 1014, other Russian-origin energy products are subject to this import prohibition. OFAC issued guidance in the numerous FAQs relating to E.O. 14066 In order to determine which products are considered of Russian origin, FAQ 1019 clarifies that Russian-origin products are those ""produced, manufactured, extracted, or processed"" in Russia. Russian-origin goods that have been ""incorporated into"" or ""substantially transformed"" into a new article of commerce outside of Russia are not considered to be Russian-origin for purposes of this import ban. OFAC guidance in FAQ 1019 also clarifies that ""new investment in the energy sector of the Russian Federation"" refers to a transaction that ""constitutes a commitment or contribution of funds or other assets for, or a loan or extension of credit to, new energy sector activities (not including maintenance or repair) located or occurring"" in Russia beginning on or after March 8, 2022. OFAC's FAQs on this E.O. indicate that for purposes of the new investment prohibition, the ""energy sector"" covers more than just the products covered by the import ban.

On the same day, OFAC issued General License 16 under the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions Regulations, which is a wind down license authorizing, certain transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to the import of products covered by the import ban pursuant to written contracts or written agreement entered prior to March 8, 2022 until 12:01 am EDT April 22, 2022.

Executive Order 14068

On March 11, 2022, President Biden issued an E.O. 14068, ""Prohibiting Certain Imports, Exports, and New Investment with Respect to Continued Russian Federation Aggression,"" that imposes additional restrictions on trade with Russia and Belarus. This E.O. prohibits the following:

The importation into the U.S. of the following products of Russian origin: fish, seafood, and preparations thereof; alcoholic beverages; non-industrial diamonds; and ""any other products"" of Russian origin ""as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce""

The exportation, re-exportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the U.S., or by a U.S. person wherever located, of ""luxury goods"" and ""any other items"" as may be determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, to any person located in Russia

""New investment in any sector"" of the Russian economy as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, by a U.S. person wherever located

The exportation, re-exportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the U.S., or by a U.S. person wherever located, of U.S. dollar-denominated banknotes to the Government of the Russian Federation or any person located in Russia

Any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a U.S. person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by this section if performed by a U.S. person or within the U.S.

On the same day, OFAC provided guidance relating to E.O. 14068, including with regard to the scope of items covered by the import ban in FAQ 1027.

As described in more detail below, BIS issued export controls detailing the scope of ""luxury goods"" subject to the export ban under E.O. 14068.

Revocation of Russia's and Belarus' MFN Status

On March 11, 2022, the President Biden announced that the U.S. – along with the G7 countries – will revoke Russia's MFN status, effectively denying Russia the benefits of its membership in the WTO. Since then, several other countries have announced their intentions to do so as well. U.S. legislation to this effect passed by the House of Representatives yesterday and is expected to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Biden quickly. Notably, the current version of the legislation targets not only Russia but also Belarus. While this measure seems primarily symbolic to indicate that Russia and Belarus are no longer economic partners of the U.S., it would prevent Russian and Belarusian imports into the U.S. from receiving MFN treatment (e.g., low tariffs, few barriers, and quantity of imports allowed), allow the president to increase tariffs of products from these countries, and require the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to seek the suspension of Russia's participation in the WTO and the halt of Belarus' WTO accession. Revoking Russia's MFN status means that Russian imports would be subject to the significantly higher tariffs found in Column 2 of the Harmonized Tarif Schedule of the United States. These heightened tariffs (and consequent increase in price of Russian products) will put products from MFN countries at a significant competitive advantage over Russian products.

General Licenses and Sanctions Guidance

OFAC has issued a number General Licenses related to the recent sanctions under the Russia Harmful Foreign Activities sanctions program (GL 9A through GL19), which are primarily wind down licenses, as well as another General License (GL 23) related to the Ukraine/Russia-related sanctions program.

OFAC has also issued a number of important new FAQs (see FAQs 998 through 1028) relating to the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions, including FAQ 1021 which clarifies that the prohibitions under E.O. 14024 and other Russia-related sanctions do extend to virtual currency. Relatedly, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) relatedly issued guidance on Russia and sanctions evasion, particularly for the financial sector.

New Parties Added to the SDN List

On March 11, 2022, OFAC designated additional identified persons who were involved in three categories of actions that supported Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The first category involves certain ""Russian and Kremlin elites, oligarchs, and Russia's political and national security leaders who have supported Russian President Vladimir Putin's brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine."" The second category took further steps against VTB Bank, Russia's second largest bank, by designating 10 individuals who are part of the bank's management board. The third category designated various members of Russia's legislature, the Duma, who allegedly lobbied for Russia's recognition of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LNR). In addition, the U.S. Department of State sanctioned several more parties, here and here, which resulted in those parties being added to OFAC's SDN List or redesignated under new sanctions authorities.

Prior to those actions, on March 3, OFAC designated nearly 90 newly sanctioned parties. These designations target Russian elites (and their family members) and seven Russian intelligence-directed disinformation outlets, which further includes 26 Russia- and Ukraine-based individuals connected to disinformation efforts. The latter sanctions were due to the persons' alleged efforts ""to spread false narratives that advance Russian strategic objectives to destabilize Ukraine and falsely justify the Kremlin's activities.""

Perhaps most notably among the March 3 updates, as it relates to designating Russian elites, OFAC designated Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, who is recognized as ""one of Russia's wealthiest billionaires"" and who ""holds significant interests in the metals and mining, telecommunications, and information technology sectors."" OFAC well understood the impact and breadth of sanctioning Usmanov, as it immediately issued General License 15 to permit transactions and unblocking of property involving unlisted entities on the SDN List that are owned 50 percent or more by Usmanov.

Further, the U.S. Department of State sanctioned a number of parties, including 22 Russian defense-related entities, which resulted in the addition of those parties to OFAC's SDN List.

SWIFT Removes Several Russian and Belarusian Banks

In our previous alert on February 28, 2022, we noted that the White House announced it would remove certain Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system, although the specific banks to be removed were not announced at that time. On March 2, 2022, it was announced that the following seven Russian banks would be removed from the SWIFT system on March 12, 2022:

Bank Otkritie

Bank Rossiya

Novikombank

Promsvyazbank

Sovcombank

VNESHECONOMBANK (VEB)

VTB BANK

Additionally, three Belarusian banks will be removed from the SWIFT system on March 20, 2022, which are:

Belagroprombank

Bank Dabrabyt

Development Bank of the Republic of Belarus

The removals from the SWIFT payment system are in addition to other U.S. sanctions that were imposed previously on most of these banks.

Overview of New U.S. Export Controls

Since February 28, 2022, BIS has imposed further export controls with respect to Russia and Belarus:

On March 2, 2022, the U.S. imposed similarly sweeping export controls with respect to Belarus for its role in enabling Russia's further invasion of Ukraine. Effective as of March 2, 2022, these new controls are particularly aimed at preventing the diversion of items in the defense, aerospace, and maritime sectors from Belarus to Russia. To that end, BIS has added license requirements for all Export Control Classification Number (ECCNs) in Categories 3-9 of the Commerce Control List (CCL) for Belarus, with license applications subject to a policy of denial (with limited exceptions). Moreover, EAR license exceptions for Belarus are significantly restricted. Belarus is also added to the two new Foreign Direct Product (FDP) rules recently imposed on Russia, which are now renamed the ""Russia/Belarus FDP Rule"" and the ""Russia/Belarus MEU FDP Rule,"" respectively. Relatedly, BIS added two Belarusian entities to the Entity List with the footnote 3 designation, indicating that they are subject to the new Russia/Belarus MEU FDP.

On March 4, 2022, in an effort to impede Russia's ability to raise revenue, BIS issued new export controls targeting Russia's oil refining sector and adding numerous entities to the Entity List. The new rules, which took effect on March 3, 2022, expand on those imposed in 2014 by adding new restrictions on a wider variety of items necessary for refining oil, which are listed in the new Supplement No. 4 to Part 746 of the EAR. Notably, the new rule for these items does not include a ""knowledge"" requirement like that the 2014 rule, which applies to items in Supplement No. 2 to Part 746 and specific ECCNs where a person has ""knowledge"" that the item would be used directly or indirectly in certain prohibited Russian oil and gas projects. In addition, the new rule has a licensing policy of denial and it changes the licensing policy of the 2014 rule from a presumption of denial to a policy of denial, with limited exceptions. BIS also added 91 entities from 10 different countries to the Entity List for their involvement, contributions, or support relating to Russia's military and defense. Many of these entities are involved in engineering, ship building, aerospace, or scientific research.

Many of these entities are involved in engineering, ship building, aerospace, or scientific research. On March 7, 2022, BIS added South Korea to the list of countries in the new Exclusion Rule which are not subject to the license requirements under the new FDP rules for Russia and Belarus, as South Korea has joined the coalition of nations that are implementing stringent export control policies with respect to Russia in response to its aggression.

On March 11, 2022, BIS imposed further export controls restricting ""luxury goods"" to Russia and Belarus as well as certain Russian and Belarusian individuals regardless of their location, effective March 11, 2022. Items that constitute ""luxury goods"" under the new rule are identified in Supplement No. 5 to Part 746 of the EAR. Very few license exceptions are available for these goods, and license applications are subject to a policy of denial. The individuals subject to the worldwide license requirement are certain oligarchs and malign actors that have been designated on the SDN List.

The Department of Commerce has added a Fact Sheet on the new Russia and Belarus rules and BIS has also provided country guidance in a new resources page on the export controls implemented in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Multilateral Russian Oligarch Task Force

To expand and coordinate the enforcement resources at the disposal of U.S. and allied governments to combat sanctions evasion, money laundering, and other related tactics by sanctioned Russian individuals, the DOJ and Treasury held the first meeting of the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) multilateral task force on March 16, 2022. Representatives from Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the U.K., and the European Commission attended the virtual meeting. The task force was first announced by the White House on February 26, 2022 and will be aimed at ensuring the effective implementation of applicable economic sanctions by identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies within the various represented jurisdictions.

The UK instituted the most significant additional sanctions this week, designating more than 350 persons. The EU also prohibited engaging in transactions with an identified list of Russian state-owned companies and their subsidiaries outside of the EU, with limited exceptions. This list includes Rosneft, Transneft, Gazprom Neft, and a number of military companies. Many of the sanctions announced this week were targeted at the same entities and persons previously sanctioned by other jurisdictions.

Oligarch Sanctions : The U.S. partnered with Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Commission, to launch the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) multilateral task force. The task force consists of the Finance Ministry and Justice or Home Ministry in each jurisdiction. Its aim is to enhance coordination between the jurisdictions to enable information sharing that can lead to concrete actions. The U.S. Department of Justice’s KleptoCapture task force will help support this effort.

Additionally, a number of additional oligarchs and prominent businesspeople were sanctioned this week. The UK sanctioned more than 50 oligarchs, many of whom were previously designated by the U.S. or EU. These included Petr Aven, Mikhail Fridman, German Khan, and Andrey Guryev. The EU also sanctioned a handful of additional oligarchs including Roman Abramovich, German Khan, and Marina Sechina.

Export & Import Controls : The U.S. prohibited “new investments in any sector of the Russian Federation economy” as determined by the Department of State and Treasury. Using this authority, the U.S. prohibited the export of “luxury goods” to Russia. The EU implemented a similar measure. The two jurisdictions define luxury goods differently, but both prohibitions cover a large set of goods including everything from perfumes, to expensive cars, to clothing. The U.S. also prohibited the export of U.S. dollar-denominated banknotes, but provided limited general licenses to authorize the export in some circumstances for U.S. persons, or activities for the personal maintenance of individuals located in Russia.

The U.S. also prohibited the importation of Russian-origin fish, seafood, alcoholic beverages, and non-industrial diamonds. Additionally, the EU issued a general trade license permitting the provision of technical assistance, financial services and funds, and brokering services, related to vessels subject to recent regulations in some circumstances.

The U.S., EU, UK and G7 jointly announced an intention to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” trading status, enabling increases on import duties. In the U.S., the House of Representatives voted to strip Russia and Belarus of this status on March 17. The measure will now move to the Senate. The EU prohibited the import of Russian origin iron and steel products.",https://www.cmtradelaw.com/2022/03/sanctions-export-highlights-as-of-march-17-2022/
6,770b4a12-dc98-46eb-b3c2-7c8bbaf4c5be,[],,"EU allied nations and the United States have been considering using the confiscated assets worth $2 million and € 300 million sanctioned from the Russian Oligarchs to fund Ukraine’s war recovery efforts, sources have revealed to the agencies on Friday. The United States, meanwhile, also plans to use the seized financial assets of the sanctioned Russians for monetary aid to Kyiv under the Ukraine Reconstruction Act. The help would also include funding war reparations. While the decision as of March 18 was in the early stages, the ultimate plan would be drafted by the EU member states.

Russian assets to be diverted 'for benefit of Ukraine'

According to sources familiar with the matter, the legislation that is in the making will stipulate the sale of the oligarch assets and would then be used ""for the benefit of the people of Ukraine,"" including refugee support, bolstering Ukraine’s cybersecurity capabilities, post-conflict reconstruction, humanitarian and military assistance. The funding will also be allocated to curb the Russian censorship, and towards the technologies that would deter Russia’s campaign of shutting down internet or communication services.

I also informed President @ZelenskyyUa of the disbursement of a second tranche of around €300 million of macro-financial assistance to Ukraine.



The brave people of Ukraine need this money now.



It will support the country's finances, as this senseless war still rages on. pic.twitter.com/g7y3OoZr80 — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) March 18, 2022

The United States Treasury Department, in a statement on Friday, also clarified that people who would help the EU and Washington with any information that leads to the seizure of Russian assets will be entitled to cash rewards. Though the bill, specifically, would not mention such a provision or the amount of the cash.

“Russian President [Vladimir Putin] and his oligarchs stow their dirty money in rule-of-law nations by purchasing mansions, mega-yachts, artwork, and other high-value assets,"" Sen. Whitehouse said in a statement published by Congress. ""We ought to seize those ill-gotten luxuries and put them to use helping the Ukrainian people.""

Following the launch meeting of the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force, the members from participating countries released the following joint statement:https://t.co/egeydvqY32 — Treasury Department (@USTreasury) March 17, 2022

The bill would, in accordance with the terms, authorize the “confiscation of property of certain Russian persons subject to sanctions and the use of that property for the benefit of the people of Ukraine, and for other purposes.” It will be enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the US in Congress. The Act may be cited as the ‘'Asset Seizure for 5 Ukraine Reconstruction Act’ and will hold all legal clauses for the US government to liquidate or sell sanctioned Russian property or assets. It determines that the sanctioned wealth, according to credible information, has been derived in part through corruption linked to or political support for the regime of the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin.

The document will give the US Department of Justice ""increased latitude to act swiftly in preventing the liquidation of assets by Russian oligarchs,” Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) explains in the Act (still in the making) which has been co-sponsored by the Senate.

EU appoints ‘Freeze and Seize' Task Force

The European Commission's ‘Freeze and Seize' Task Force, last week set up EU-level coordination to implement sanctions against listed Russian and Belarussian oligarchs. It operates alongside the newly established 'Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO)' Task Force, under which the EU operates together with the G7 countries Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as Australia. European ‘Freeze and Seize' Task Force in coordination with the international ‘REPO' Task Force, and the G7 Justice and Finance Ministers identified Russian entities and individuals who provide services— financial, legal, and others—to oligarchs to facilitate sanctions against them.

The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also separately issued a new round of sanctions targeting Russian and Kremlin elites, oligarchs, and Russia’s political and national security leaders who were partisan, directly or indirectly, to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s what the OFAC describes “brutal and illegal invasion of Ukraine.” The EU and the US sanctioned the facilitators of the Russian regime, including three immediate family members of President Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitriy Sergeevich Peskov; Russian tycoon and Kremlin insider Viktor Vekselberg; and the Management Board of the sanctioned VTB Bank.

OFAC also designated 12 members of the Russian State Duma, including Vyacheslav Victorovich Volodin, who is also a permanent member of Russia’s Security Council. Dmitriy Sergeevich Peskov (Peskov) was identified as the “lead propagandist and spokesperson of the Russian Federation.”

Bloc’s 27 justice ministers appointed a cross-border team to coordinate the efforts of national authorities to freeze the assets of sanctioned oligarchs. Member states have an unidentified person serving as an EU “contact point” to track the assets of Russia shortly after the US’ establishment of a federal interagency “KleptoCapture” task force to take economic measures against Russia for Ukraine’s invasion. EU and US’ economic retaliation against Russia thus far involves more than 680 entities listed under travel bans and asset freezes. Russian banks have also been barred from the Swift international payments system, and the Russian Central Bank has been devoid of accessing their assets, which may be used to compensate Ukrainians for the damages.",https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/us-eu-allies-considering-using-russian-oligarchs-confiscated-assets-to-restore-ukraine-articleshow.html
