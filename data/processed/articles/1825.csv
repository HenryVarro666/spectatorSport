ANKARA

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said Istanbul may host a leaders’ summit in the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a bid to solve the issue of the status of Donbass and Crimea as part of a peace deal between the warring sides.

“We, as Turkey, will be very happy if we can hold the leaders’ summit in Istanbul, and as a result, if we can realize a decision of the two leaders which will turn the negative trend into a positive one,” Erdoğan told reporters on April 1.

The president also had a phone conversation with Putin late afternoon on April 1 to discuss his proposed summit.

A statement from Erdoğan’s office said he and Putin also discussed the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia that were held in Istanbul earlier in the week.

Erdoğan’s office said the Turkish leader told Putin that the Istanbul talks had “raised hopes for peace.” Erdoğan said Turkey wanted to cap off those efforts by bringing Putin and Zelenskyy together, according to the statement.

The statement said Erdoğan told Putin that it was important for the sides “to act with common sense and to maintain the dialogue.”

During the call, Putin thanked Erdoğan for hosting the meeting between the delegations, according to the Erdoğan’s office.

Referring to his phone conversation with Zelensky on March 31, Erdoğan said his Ukrainian counterpart was positive about such a meeting. “Mr. Putin also had a positive attitude before,” he added.

Erdoğan, Zelensky discuss over phone

Erdoğan told Zelensky that the meeting in Istanbul had added meaningful momentum to the process carried out for the termination of the war and the establishment of peace given its outcomes, the Presidential Communications Directorate said in a statement with regards to the phone conversation.



Noting that it was important for the negotiations held in Istanbul to yield various signs of de-escalation of the tension, the president reiterated his proposal to bring together Zelensky and Putin, with Turkey hosting that meeting.



Zelensky, for his part, thanked Erdoğan for having hosted the meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Istanbul, the statement said.



“I am determined to hold conversations with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky as soon as I return. In these talks, we will say, ‘Our goal now is to bring you together as soon as possible. We are ready to host the meeting at the level of heads of state,” Erdoğan told a group of reporters during his visit to Uzbekistan on March 29.



“But in the meantime, it is of great importance to ensure a temporary ceasefire,” the president added.



Erdoğan also said Turkey welcomes any possible guarantor role for the security of Ukraine if the warring sides could reach a peace deal.

During the conversation, Zelensky thanked Turkey on April 1 for its readiness to be a guarantor of his country’s security in case of a peace deal with Russia.

“Had another conversation with a real friend, President Erdoğan. Noted the high level of organization of negotiations of delegations in Istanbul. Agreed on further steps towards peace. Thanked for the readiness of Turkey to become the guarantor of security of our state!” he tweeted.

Ukraine wants Turkey, Germany and the members of the U.N. Security Council to act as guarantors in any potential peace deal, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said on March 31.

Diplomatic efforts for Ukraine continue: Turkish FM

Ukraine and Russia have made “meaningful progress” in the talks in Istanbul and Turkey makes efforts for another meeting at the ministerial level, Çavuşoğlu said on April 1.

Referring to the face-to-face meetings of Russian and Ukrainian negotiation teams in Istanbul on March 29, Çavuşoğlu said, “This needs to continue and conclude. There are decisions to be taken at the level of leaders. There is an agreement that is likely to be initialed at the ministerial level. Therefore, we continue our contacts at all levels without interruption.”

The minister was speaking at a press conference with Colombian Vice President and Foreign Minister Marta Lucia Ramirez.

Stating that there are a total of 87 Turkish citizens in Ukraine and approximately 30 Turkish citizens in Mariupol, Çavuşoğlu said Ankara was making efforts to evacuate its citizens.

“We have made efforts for humanitarian issues as much as ceasefire and lasting peace. Especially on the opening of humanitarian corridors. It was Mariupol that we had the most difficulty with. So we welcome yesterday’s silence,” he said, referring to relatively calming down in clashes.

International Committee of the Red Cross asked Ankara about the number of Turks in the city on April 1. The citizens will be evacuated from Mariupol by buses, Çavuşoğlu said, noting that they have talks also for the injured to be taken out of there and treated.

Turkey to introduce social media regulation ‘as soon as possible’

President Erdoğan also on April 1 said the government will soon introduce a new social media regulation.

“We will implement the necessary arrangements as soon as possible,” Erdoğan said, addressing a youth event in Istanbul.

Turkey’s young generation is “very lucky in terms of infrastructure and technological opportunities,” Erdoğan said but also warned against the disadvantages of social media.

“Besides the convenience they provide, they also contain dangers if not used correctly. As Turkey, we have started preparations for similar studies to protect all of our citizens,” he said.

The government took the first step regarding social media policies last year and asked social media providers to open representative offices in Turkey.

Erdoğan also urged young people to read books and said, “We want our young people to stay in touch with real life while making use of the internet and social media.”

The research shows that the number of books published per capita and the number of books read are increasing in Turkey, Erdoğan added.

Pointing out that the 13 libraries being opened in Istanbul’s Fatih district contain 150,000 books, Erdoğan stated that these facilities have the capacity to serve a total of 1,800 people.

Stating that Turkey’s largest library has been put into operation within the Presidential Complex in Ankara, Erdoğan said: “Our National Library serves our youth and researchers day and night. I am pleased to see that the entrance door functions like a beehive when we pass by the library.”

Erdoğan also underlined that electronic book applications are also gaining popularity.",https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/erdogan-renews-offer-to-host-meeting-between-russian-ukrainian-leaders-172647

Turkey will once again urge Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an in-person meeting in Turkey to have a peace deal, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said, adding he has planned to hold phone conversations with both leaders after returning from Uzbekistan.

“I am determined to hold conversations with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky as soon as I return. In these talks, we will say, ‘Our goal now is to bring you together as soon as possible. We are ready to host the meeting at the level of heads of state,” Erdoğan told a group of reporters during his visit to Uzbekistan.

“But in the meantime, it is of great importance to ensure a temporary ceasefire,” the president added.

Erdoğan also said Turkey welcomes any possible guarantor role for the security of Ukraine if the warring sides could reach a peace deal.

“We can be one of the guarantor countries in terms of guaranteeing the security of Ukraine. We welcome this in principle. But of course, the details need to be clarified,” he stated.

Asked about Turkey’s position on the international embargoes against Russia, Erdoğan said Ankara would not join these sanctions.

“We also attach importance to maintaining our dialogue while we express our reaction to Russia’s military activities. This dialogue is important and necessary not only in the context of Ukraine but also in many geographies that are closely related to us, such as Syria, Libya and the South Caucasus,” he said.

Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was included in the Russian delegation when the negotiation teams met in Istanbul on March 29, Erdoğan said.

“If Russia and Mr. Putin preferred to include Abramovich in their delegation, it means that he believed and trusted. We greeted him as well as everyone else at that meeting,” the president said.

Turkey’s role in mediation between Russia and Ukraine has changed the perceptions in the West towards Turkey, he also said.

“The pro-peace, principled and at the same time balanced policy pursued by our country in the Ukraine issue is appreciated by all parties,” the president stated.

Recalling his meetings on the sidelines of the NATO summit, Erdoğan said he observed a “positive approach” toward Turkey.

“Many leaders brought up the importance of Turkey’s responsibility and the importance of these bilateral dialogues. Especially after the meeting in Istanbul, the result of the meeting led many European Union member states and NATO member states to a different perspective toward Turkey. I mean the whole west,” he said.

“Now, our wish is this, I hope that Turkey’s place in the eyes of all leaders will be very different,” Erdoğan added.",https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-to-urge-russian-ukrainian-leaders-again-for-in-person-meeting-erdogan-172644

""We can be one of the guarantor countries in terms of guaranteeing the security of Ukraine. We welcome this in principle. But of course, the details need to be clarified,"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters accompanying him during an official visit to Uzbekistan.

He will have phone conversations with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging them to meet in Turkey for a final peace agreement, semi-official Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.

""I am determined to hold talks with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky as soon as I return (to Turkey). In these talks, I will say, 'Our goal now is to bring you together as soon as possible'. We are ready to host the meeting at the level of heads of state,"" he said.

Erdogan several times expressed his willingness to bring together Russian and Ukrainian leaders in Turkey for face-to-face talks.

Most recently, Turkey hosted a meeting of Russian and Ukrainian negotiation teams in Istanbul on Tuesday.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov met in a small resort town of Turkey's southern province of Antalya on March 10 on the sidelines of an international diplomacy forum, but failed to make progress on a ceasefire.

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan answered journalists' questions regarding the agenda on his return from his two-day official visit to Uzbekistan and said, ""I am determined about holding talks with Mr Putin and Mr Zelensky. We'll tell them both, 'Now, our goal is to bring you together as soon as possible.'""

Stating that they successfully completed the visit, President Erdoğan said that they were pleased to visit their ancestral homeland once again after four years and fulfil their longing with the Uzbeks.

Noting that they had fruitful meetings with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan, President Erdoğan stated that he and Mirziyoyev also chaired the second meeting of the Türkiye-Uzbekistan High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council and that they have now promoted Türkiye-Uzbekistan relations to the level of ""Comprehensive Strategic Partnership"".

Pointing out that Türkiye was the first country to recognise Uzbekistan and open the first embassy and consulate general there, President Erdoğan said: ""Now, we have added a new ring to the chain of firsts with the 'Comprehensive Strategic Partnership'. We discussed joint steps that can be taken to further develop our relations in all areas. I am pleased to see that the will on this issue is mutual.""

Stating that they also exchanged views on regional and international issues during their meetings, President Erdoğan said, ""At this point, I underlined our support for the peace, tranquillity and stability of friendly and brotherly Uzbekistan. We have reached a consensus on increasing the communication and coordination between our international organisations, particularly the Organisation of Turkic States. Hopefully, we will hand over the term presidency of the Organisation of Turkic States, which is currently being held by our country, to Uzbekistan in November.""

Noting that ten agreements, memorandums of understanding and protocols were signed in various fields on the occasion of the visit, President Erdoğan added:

""The Preferential Trade Agreement will have a multiplier effect in our bilateral trade and will be instrumental in the establishment of new co-operations. We have demonstrated our resolve and will to increase our trade from its current level of 3.6 billion dollars to 5 billion dollars first, and subsequently to 10 billion dollars, with the agreement's contribution. With the Military Framework Agreement, we paved the way for steps to improve our cooperation in the field of defence and security. With the instruments signed in areas to which we attach importance, such as health, transportation, construction, justice and employment, the contractual basis of our relations with Uzbekistan has been strengthened. At the conclusion of the Council meeting, we established our roadmap for the next period with the Joint Declaration signed with Mr Mirziyoyev.

Last year, we had the pleasure of hosting 270 thousand Uzbek brothers and sisters in our country. We hope that the number of mutual tourists will increase this year with the easing of the pandemic, and we have set a target of 500 thousand. We are also pleased with the increased investment in Uzbekistan by Turkish businesspeople. In terms of the number of businesses established in the previous year, our entrepreneurs rank first in Uzbekistan.""

Noting that they also visited the historical city of Khiva, the Cultural Capital of the Turkic World in 2020, and made observations, President Erdoğan said:

""Erkin Samandar, one of the prominent poets of Uzbekistan, describes this beautiful city as: 'Khiva is the city of these domes, minarets and embroideries. It is the city of the books on the shelves, of humanity.' When we saw Khiva and wandered through the streets of Khiva, where every corner was rich with history, we understood much better how true and accurate these lines of the poet were. It is such a rich city that it has 130 madrasas within the city walls. This year, we are moving the title of Cultural Capital of the Turkic World to our Bursa, another stop on the Silk Road, like Khiva. Thus, we promote the integration and greater recognition of our ancient civilisation's landmark cities. 'We may take a step on the issue of package tourism between Khiva and Bursa.' we said during our conversation.""

Reiterating his belief that the visit, which coincided with a critical period, will contribute to peace, stability and cooperation in the region as well as relations with Uzbekistan, President Erdoğan said: ""I wish the meetings and agreements we have signed to be auspicious. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all my Uzbek brothers and sisters in the person of Mr Mirziyoyev for the sincere hospitality shown to me, my wife and my delegation. I would like to thank our Ministers who accompanied me on our visit, as well as all my fellow members of parliament and delegation members, for their contribution.”

“I believe that the meetings lent a considerable boost to the peace process”

Upon being asked, “I would like to ask about the partial ceasefire decision reached at the meeting of Russia’s and Ukraine’s negotiating delegations in Dolmabahçe. The trust that Türkiye instilled in both parties, as well as your position in leader-to-leader diplomacy, allowed for quick results. Following this stage, the most intriguing topic is whether the two leaders, Putin and Zelensky, would meet in Türkiye. Are you going to invite them again?” President Erdoğan replied, “I believe that the meetings between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul lent a considerable boost to the peace process.”

President Erdoğan emphasised the critical nature of Russia’s decision to considerably downsize military operations in Kyiv and Chernihiv and added:

“Similarly, the heads of state’s declarations that they can come together once an agreement is reached demonstrates how critical this step is. We expect them to be implemented and the war to be brought to an end before further casualties and destruction emerge. Naturally, we were pleased to host such an important meeting thanks to our active diplomacy and balanced approach. I am determined about holding talks with both Mr Putin and Mr Zelensky right after my return. I will convey my gratitude to both of them on behalf of myself and my nation during these talks and state, ‘Now, our goal is to bring you together as soon as possible.’ I’m hoping we can elicit a specific date for their meeting from them. In this regard, we are prepared to host the meeting at the heads of state level. In the meantime, having achieved a temporary ceasefire is also crucial.”

“Ukraine is not overly insistent on the NATO membership”

When reminded of Ukraine’s statement, “We may abandon our pursuit of NATO membership, but we will never abandon our pursuit of European Union membership”, and asked, “When we delved deeper, we learned that Russia took a favourable attitude toward this scenario. A fresh security assurance was also requested in this regard by the Ukrainian delegation. Naturally, a meeting at which the US, China, Poland, as well as Canada, the UK, and Türkiye are the guarantor states... There is an idea that a system similar to that outlined in NATO’s fifth article might function. How would you evaluate this situation?” President Erdoğan said that Ukraine was not overly insistent on NATO membership, adding:

“Indeed, I believe that Ukraine will not be overly insistent on the European Union membership, either. Because, with the exception of a few, the European Union’s member states lacked a meaningful commitment to this effort during this process. Despite this, I have heard Mr Putin’s favourable attitude toward Ukraine’s EU accession. Surely, we will learn about the recent situation during these meetings. Hearing this directly from Mr Putin during my talk with him will enable us to more precisely analyse the steps that need to be taken in this regard. You are all aware of the European Union’s treatment of us since 1963. It stalled us and continues to do so. We may be one of the guarantor countries in terms of ensuring Ukraine’s security; we lean toward this in principle, but the details need to be clarified.”

“This reality cannot be ignored”

Upon the question, “According to some, one can now speak of two distinct worlds before and after Ukraine, and that we are on the verge of establishing a new world order. How would you evaluate this situation; do you agree with this statement?” President Erdoğan responded:

“Naturally, the war between Russia and Ukraine was a process that the world had not witnessed or experienced in recent memory. Today, Russia is a power and force, ranking among the top three countries in terms of area, population, military, political, economic, and cultural strength. This reality cannot be ignored. Ukraine is not a typical country, either. Ukraine has a population of roughly 45 million people now and is not a small country in terms of area. Currently, the world, particularly the West, has backed and sided with Ukraine. Such a structure exists. On this basis, several judgments were made. And there is also this; there were those who said: 'This war will end in a week or ten days.' As you can see, this war did not end in a week or ten days. It is not over, but there were many casualties regardless of whether it was over or not. There were significant casualties, particularly children and women. These cannot be ignored. Even the strong Russia has had significant losses in this picture. It is necessary to evaluate this thoroughly in terms of the winner and loser of the war. In this regard, I believe that peace is the most important solution and way out. Inshallah, from this point of view, it will please us if we can be instrumental in bringing an end to this matter. As Türkiye, we will be pleased to have finished with this matter with both Mr Putin and Mr Zelensky's confidence in us during such time.""

""Türkiye's policy is appreciated by all parties""

After one reporter said, ""In fact, as a result of Türkiye's significant role, it is observed that there is an awareness about Türkiye in the European Union's and the US' attitudes and outlooks. Türkiye, after all, is the organiser at the table; now, it is setting the table. Indeed, it can be observed that the European Union and the US view it differently."" President Erdoğan pointed out that Türkiye's pro-peace, principled, and balanced policy on the Ukraine crisis was appreciated by all parties.

Expressing that he saw the positive approaches of NATO member countries to Türkiye during all his meetings at the NATO Extraordinary Leaders' Summit, President Erdoğan said: ""Numerous leaders brought up the importance of Türkiye's responsibility and these bilateral dialogues. Particularly after the meeting in Istanbul, the result of the meeting shifted many European Union member states and NATO member states' perspectives towards Türkiye. I am referring to the entire western world with this; now, inshallah, Türkiye's position in the eyes of all leaders will be markedly different. We can also observe this with the feedback we receive.""

""We are committed to continuing our dialogue""

In response to the question, ""Europe imposes sanctions on oligarchs, and nowadays, because Türkiye does not impose any sanctions, it is expressed that Russian capital might migrate from Europe to Türkiye, effectively imposing the implementation of sanctions. I'm curious about your opinion on this. And one of the oligarchs, despite being labelled as a bit of a bad guy in Europe, was at the table in Dolmabahçe the day before; in the photographs, Roman Abramovich was seen speaking to you. How do you evaluate his participation in these meetings?"" President Erdoğan reiterated that they would not participate in the sanctions against Russia and that they had previously explained the reasons for this many times.

Stating that they are committed to continuing the dialogue while reacting to Russia's military activities, President Erdoğan stated, ""This dialogue is critical and necessary not only in the context of Ukraine, but also in a number of closely connected geographies such as Syria, Libya, and the South Caucasus. On the other hand, Abramovich participated in the negotiations as a member of the Russian delegation. More than who comes to the table, it is important to heed on behalf of whom they come. If Russia and Mr Putin chose to include Abramovich in their delegation, it means that he believed in and trusted him. I greeted him as well as everyone else at that meeting. I wish success to all the members of the delegations participating in this meeting. I hope that we will see the results of these efforts as soon as possible.""

Answering the question, ""Is it correct to believe there has been no change in Türkiye's stance regarding sanctions?"" President Erdoğan said, ""So far, we have not changed our stance regarding sanctions, and Russia has taken no action against Türkiye as part of this chain of sanctions.""

""I am extremely hopeful about this""

One reporter expressed that one of the most important agenda topics in the world and Türkiye was energy and asked, ""Recently, Iraq and Israel have come under the spotlight with some projects related to natural gas. Türkiye is also widely regarded as the leading player in Europe's energy security. In this context, can we say that the way for Türkiye's energy diplomacy is open? Additionally, you made a statement upon your return from Brussels, saying, 'Several new areas of energy will become available to us, and when you hear about them, you will wonder, 'Where did this come from?', Can you give any details on that?"" President Erdoğan, in response, said:

""As you know, Mr Herzog paid a visit to Türkiye. We covered several subjects in depth during his visit, most notably the energy issue. In the past, Israel-Türkiye had relations, contacts on energy as well. It was almost concluded back then when Netanyahu was in office; however, everything suddenly turned upside down because Israel's opinion of energy export was unfavourable in light of the costs involved. As you see, constructing pipelines beneath the sea from Israel to Greece, transporting it from here to there, and then to Europe, is clearly not possible. Cost calculations indicate that the best way for this job is to transport natural gas through Türkiye. Of course, they have been already discussing it among themselves. As a result, they also have stated that the most appropriate way for this job is through Türkiye. During my meeting with Mr Herzog, I stated that I would immediately send our Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Energy and Natural Resources to Israel. If you discuss the energy issue in-depth with our Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, as well as the evaluations regarding the region with our Minister of Foreign Affairs, we are prepared for anything. As long as you sincerely say, 'All right, we're going to take this step.' 'With pleasure,' Mr Herzog said, implying that he is prepared to do so. 'I will inform Mr Prime Minister of the same. It would be appropriate if you discussed this matter with Mr Prime Minister on his visit to Türkiye,' he continued. 'With pleasure,' I said. They must have already begun working on this issue. If we meet with Bennett after Ramadan and take steps immediately, the cooperation between Israel and Türkiye will accelerate the Eastern Mediterranean oil and natural gas process. I am extremely hopeful about this.

On the other hand, as you are aware, each year during Ramadan, we experience sorrow and distress over Masjid al-Aqsa. I conveyed this to Mr President as well. I told him, 'Every year, there is an issue. During this year's Eid al-Fitr, Muslims should be able to visit the Masjid al-Aqsa in peace. Provide the necessary support in this respect so that we do not have any issues during this Ramadan. Thus, we can have a peaceful Ramadan.'""

As an answer to a question, ""Previously, you stated, 'Several new areas of energy will become available to us, and when you hear about them, you will wonder, 'Where did this come from?' Can you give any details on that?"", President Erdoğan said, ""Exactly as I said. Can it be put any better than that?""

When asked about the tension between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Karabakh, President Erdoğan stated that Azerbaijan completely adhered to the Tripartite Declaration's provisions and committed no violations.

President Erdoğan stressed that this was a defensive response since there was an attack on Azerbaijan, stating, ""The overall concern is to ensure that Armenian armed elements are completely removed from internationally recognised Azerbaijani territory, in accordance with the Tripartite Declaration's provisions.""",https://www.iletisim.gov.tr/English/Haberler/detay/president-erdogan-our-goal-is-to-bring-putin-and-zelensky-together

Shear', 'Rick Gladstone', 'Daniel Berehulak']",2022-03-31 00:00:00,"KRAKOW, Poland — Facing deeper isolation by the day over the Ukraine war, Russia seemed to slightly recalibrate its stance Thursday, allowing greater humanitarian access to the devastated port city of Mariupol and apparently retreating from a payment confrontation with European gas customers.

But Western officials said they saw little evidence to support Russia’s claims that it was greatly reducing its military presence around Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and fighting continued unabated in areas around the city on Thursday. In Dnipro, the central city that has become a hub for humanitarian aid to other parts of Ukraine, a Russian attack overnight destroyed an oil terminal, a local official said.

“Russia maintains pressure on Kyiv and other cities, so we can expect additional offensive actions, bringing even more suffering,” the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said at a news conference.

Whatever Moscow’s real intentions on the battlefield, Russian officials scoffed Thursday at American claims a day earlier that subordinates of President Vladimir V. Putin, fearing his wrath, were misleading him about how the war was going.

“They do not understand President Putin,” said the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov. “They do not understand the decision-making mechanism and they do not understand the efforts of our work.”

In Mariupol, where the population has, for weeks, been cut off from the outside world by heavy Russian bombardment and intense fighting, a respite appeared possible amid reports that a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross was preparing to try to enter the city. The group hoped to deliver emergency humanitarian aid and begin evacuating residents on Friday.

“There seems to be a glimmer of hope we might be able to go, so we need to be close,” said Crystal Wells, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Geneva.

Thousands of civilians are believed to have died, and survivors have been trapped in basements without heat or electricity, and desperately short of food, water and other essentials.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said Thursday that a convoy of 45 buses had departed for Mariupol to reach trapped civilians, and that an agreement had been reached on a passageway for evacuating people from the city of Melitopol, farther west.

People from both cities were expected to make their way to Zaporizhzhia, a city farther north that remains under Ukrainian control, although evacuations in previous days have been sporadic and have often been scrapped at the last minute because of fighting.

The Russians also appeared to show some leeway on Mr. Putin’s demand that European customers of his country’s natural gas now pay in rubles, or risk a cutoff. European governments, which rely heavily on Russian gas imports, had rejected this new condition, arguing that it violated purchase contracts.

After speaking with the Russian leader, the prime minister of Italy, Mario Draghi, said he did not believe that Europe was “in danger” of having its gas supply halted. He said that he understood that the Russian president would grant a “concession” to European countries, and that the conversion of payments from dollars or euros into rubles was “an internal matter of the Russian Federation.”

Russia also said Thursday that its forces were leaving the defunct Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, according to a statement from Ukraine’s state-run energy company. Chernobyl, site of the worst nuclear accident in history, had been occupied by Russian forces since the war’s early days.

Asked about unconfirmed reports that some Russian soldiers had suffered radiation sickness, the Pentagon press secretary, John F. Kirby, said the troop movement appeared to be part of a broader repositioning and not from “health hazards or some sort of emergency or a crisis at Chernobyl.”

Both Ukrainian and Russian officials signaled a willingness to keep negotiating over how to end the war, now in its sixth week. A member of Ukraine’s negotiating team said that discussions would resume via video link on Friday, and the foreign minister of Turkey, which hosted talks this week, said that his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts could meet within weeks.

And on Thursday, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, offered cautious backing to a proposal circulating in European corridors of power that might help bring about a peace agreement. In principle, Mr. Erdogan said, Turkey could help guarantee Ukraine’s security.

During peace talks earlier this week in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials said their country was ready to concede a key demand from Moscow and declare itself permanently neutral, forsaking hopes of joining NATO. Ukrainian negotiators also said they were willing to discuss Russian territorial claims.

But the Ukrainians said they would make the concessions only in return for security guarantees from a group of other nations.

Ukrainian officials envision an arrangement in which a group of countries — potentially including NATO members like the United States, Britain, Turkey, France and Germany — would commit to defending Ukraine.

On Thursday, a Ukrainian negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, suggested to a Turkish broadcaster that the so-called guarantor countries would have legal obligations to provide weapons, military personnel or financial help if conflict involving Ukraine erupted again.

“This is the meaning of this pact: A country that considers an attack will know that Ukraine is not alone,” he said.

The big question was whether Moscow, which has repeatedly objected to what it calls NATO encroachment, finds this palatable.

Despite Russian claims that the war was proceeding according to plan, the Kremlin is said to be struggling with problems in its military, which has made far less headway in Ukraine than Western experts had once expected.

On Thursday, the director of Britain’s electronic surveillance agency, Jeremy Fleming, said the Russian forces, hampered by low morale and weapons shortages, had accidentally shot down their own aircraft and had refused to carry out orders.

But in Russia itself, Mr. Putin’s approval ratings have reached levels unseen in years, according to a Russian poll released on Thursday, as many Russians rally around the flag in the face of sanctions and other international pressure.

Although the credibility of the poll might be questionable — especially since Mr. Putin has severely limited free expression since the war — it was conducted by the Levada Center, one of the few independent pollster groups left in Russia.

“The confrontation with the West has consolidated people,” said Denis Volkov, the center’s director.

While they generally did not support Mr. Putin, some respondents said that now was the time to do so.

People believe that “everyone is against us” and that “Putin defends us; otherwise, we would be eaten alive,” Mr. Volkov said.

The war’s destructive ripple effects have spilled over into marketplaces around the world.

Both Ukraine and Russia are major providers of the world’s wheat, corn and barley, but Ukrainian agricultural officials said Thursday that more than 16 million tons of grain had been stranded in the country, and that Ukraine had missed out on at least $1.5 billion in exports. Earlier in the week, the U.S. State Department’s No. 2 official warned at a U.N. Security Council meeting that the war posed “immediate and dangerous implications for global food security.”

With fuel costs soaring over sanctions on Russian oil, the U.S. government announced a plan to release up to 180 million barrels from strategic reserves over the next six months to enlarge the supply and ease prices.

Still, the Biden administration made clear that it would expand the sanctions on Russia as part of the American-led effort to cripple the Russian economy as punishment for the Ukraine invasion.

In Washington, the Treasury Department on Thursday leveled new sanctions on Russian technology companies and what it called illicit procurement networks that Russia is using to evade existing sanctions.

“We will continue to target Putin’s war machine with sanctions from every angle until this senseless war of choice is over,” the Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, said in a statement.

""I don't even know if it still exists at this point... They never really accomplished their mission,"" said Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby.

The stalled convoy became a symbol of Russia's battlefield difficulties and had been repeatedly attacked by Ukrainian forces during the first weeks of the more than month-long invasion.

Earlier, President Joe Biden said that Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be self-isolating in Russia and may have fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers.""

He seems to be self-isolated and there's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,"" Mr Biden said without citing evidence. ""But I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time.""
