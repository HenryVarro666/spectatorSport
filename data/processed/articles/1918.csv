As the war in Ukraine enters another week, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Elisabeth Braw, has provided her thoughts on the current situation.

This morning, Ukrainian forces in the besieged city of Mariupol were ordered to lay down their arms by Russia's defence ministry.

However, Braw said the ultimatum was a ""window of humiliation"" for Ukraine and it was ""extremely unlikely"" to happen.

""If they respond affirmatively to this ultimatum by surrendering then that sends a message that Russia can issue more ultimatums,"" she said.

""We are not likely to see Ukrainians surrender in the next 24 hours or indeed any time frame which then raises the question what will happen to these remaining Ukrainian soldiers who are holding out in Mariupol.""

Braw went on to say ""the biggest need"" for Ukrainians at the moment were more weapons.

Vitali Klitschko, Kyiv’s mayor, warned that the “risk of dying” in the city was still “pretty high” as he urged residents who had fled the fighting in recent weeks not to risk returning yet, despite Moscow’s pledge this week to scale back its offensive in the region.

“My advice to anyone who wants to come back is: Please, take a little bit more time,” he said.

Elsewhere, shifting battle lines suggested Russia was moving troops away from some areas.

Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said Russian forces are not withdrawing but regrouping, and Ukrainian officials say Russian troops are losing ground rather than retreating of their own accord.

Kyiv's regional governor said earlier in the day that Russian forces were pulling back from positions around Kyiv while fortifying its strongholds in others.

Oleksandr Pavlyuk, wrote on the Telegram messaging app that some enemy troops had moved back and were heading towards the border with Belarus.

""Our troops are chasing them both to the northwest and northeast [of Kyiv], pushing the enemy away from Kyiv,"" said Oleksiy Arestovych, a political adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Mr Arestovych said Russia was carrying out a partial troop rotation and sending some of its forces to fight in eastern Ukraine.

Others appeared to be staying put. At a church northwest of the city, Russian forces had set up a staging ground as part of their assault on the capital, a US official claimed.

""Military personnel are situated both on the grounds of the church and the surrounding residential area,"" the official said, without citing evidence.

""We believe the Russian military is using this staging point as part of its assault on Kyiv,"" they said.

A UK military intelligence assessment said the Kremlin was continuing to order attacks on the city.

In its daily update on the war, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Kyiv and Chernihiv, also in the north of the country, had been “subjected to continued air and missile strikes despite Russian claims of reducing activity in these areas”.

Ukrainian forces are having more luck pushing back Russian forces outside of those cities.

Villages to the south of Chernihiv, such as Sloboda and Lukashivka, which are located along one of the main supply routes between the city and Kyiv, have been retaken by Kyiv’s troops, the MoD said.

“Ukraine has also continued to make successful but limited counter attacks to the east and north east of Kyiv,” the assessment added.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/kyiv-russia-battles-vitaliy-klitschko-b2049056.html

April 2 (UPI) -- Russian forces broadly retreated from the Kyiv region Saturday, Ukrainian military officials said. The Russian military left behind dead soldiers and burned vehicles in its retreat, according to to witnesses, Ukrainian officials, satellite images and military analysts, signaling a potential major turn in the war which is in its sixth week, The New York Times reported.

""The initial Russian operation was a failure and one of its central goals -- the capture of Kyiv -- proved unobtainable for Russian forces,"" Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at C.N.A., a research institute in Arlington, Va., told the Times in a telephone interview Saturday.

Ukraine's military also announced that Russian forces have retreated from other areas.

""Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the whole Kyiv region -- liberated from the enemy,"" Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Anna Malyar said Saturday in a Twitter post.

Still, attacks on other cities have continued, and the Pentagon has cautioned that Russian forces near Kyiv could be repositioning for renewed assaults.

Meanwhile, Russian forces attacked a major oil refinery Saturday in Kremenchuk, Ukraine, Russian officials announced.

The Russian military targeted the major oil refinery in the central Ukrainian city in a series of strikes, including ""high-precision long-range and sea-based weapons,"" Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told CNN. The strikes destroyed storage facilities holding gasoline and diesel fuels for Ukrainian troops in the country's eastern and central regions.

Russian forces also used high precision air-based missiles to hit military airfields in cities to the east of Kremenchuk, including Poltava and Dnipro, Konashenkov added.

Since Russian forces seized the central Ukrainian town of Enerhodar, close to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, last month, there have been sporadic protests, according to CNN.

On Saturday, Russian forces dispersed these protesters with gunfire and explosions, National Nuclear Energy Generating Company of Ukraine Energoatom posted on Telegram on Saturday.

""The occupiers dispersed the protesters with explosions and shootings,"" a Telegram post read, according to CNN's English translation of the social media post.

""A series of loud explosions has taken place in Enerhodar,"" another Energoatom post read, Ukrinform reported. ""This morning, the town residents gathered for a peaceful rally in support of Ukraine. They sang the anthem and talked to each other. Russcist occupiers were watching them. When Enerhodar residents started to go away, paddy wagons approached, in which the invaders began to pack locals.""

The explosions injured about four people, according to Energoatom's posts on Telegram.

In Mykolaiv state, the death toll from an explosion that destroyed the regional state administration building on Tuesday has risen to 31, Ukraine's States Emergency Service said Saturday, adding that 34 were injured in the blast.

On Friday, a fire broke out at a fuel terminal in Belgorod, a Russian city near the Ukrainian border, which Russian officials blamed on a strike by two Ukrainian helicopters.

Firefighters have since put out the blaze engulfing half of the fuel tanks at the terminal, according to the Russian News Agency TASS, and no casualties resulted from the incident.

""Ukrainian forces continue to advance against withdrawing forces in the vicinity of Kyiv,"" according to the British Ministry of Defense update earlier Saturday. ""Along the northwestern axis, Ukrainian forces' attempts to advance from Irpin towards Bucha and Hostomel are ongoing. Russian forces are reported to have withdrawn from Hostomel airport, which has been subject to fighting since the first day of the conflict. Along the eastern axis, Ukraine has re-taken several villages.""

""In the east of Ukraine, Ukrainian forces have secured a key route in eastern Kharkhiv after heavy fighting,"" the update added. ""This follows the liberation of Trostyanets, in the vicinity of Sumy, earlier this week.""

Since the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 1,325 civilians have been killed and 2,017 have been injured, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights' latest update.

The OHCHR warned actual casualties could be even higher as receipt of information from some locations of intense fighting has been ""delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.""
