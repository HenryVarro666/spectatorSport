0,780bc922-d0e4-461e-bf5c-2a06eaa274aa,"['Jennifer Rankin', 'Daniel Boffey']",2022-04-03,"Russia stands accused of “terrible” war crimes, as western leaders condemned the killings of unarmed civilians in Bucha and the surrounding areas of Kyiv in alleged atrocities that prompted fresh demands for tougher action against Moscow.

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Kremlin-ordered attack on his country amounted to genocide, after local officials reported scores of civilians had been killed in the towns of Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel near the capital.

Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s refusal to be subdued to Russia was the reason “we are being destroyed and exterminated”, describing the war to the US network CBS as “the torture of the whole nation”.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dymtro Kuleba, said Russia was “worse than Isis”.

Witnesses of alleged atrocities in Bucha told the Guardian that Russian soldiers, who have now withdrawn from the area, had fired on men fleeing the town, and had killed civilians at will.

Taras Schevchenko, 43, said Russian soldiers had refused to allow men to leave through a humanitarian corridor, instead shooting at them as they fled across an open field. Bodies, he said, were scattered on the pavements, with some of those killed having been “squashed by tanks … like animal skin rugs”.

Shevchenko’s mother, Yevdokia, 77, said she had witnessed an elderly man who had challenged a Russian soldier being shot dead as his wife stood next to him. “They shot him dead, and ordered the woman to leave,” she said. The accounts could not be independently verified.

Reporters from Agence France-Presse saw at least 20 bodies, all in civilian clothing, strewn across a single street in the town of Bucha on Friday. One had his hands tied behind his back with a white cloth, and his Ukrainian passport left open beside his body. “All these people were shot,” Bucha’s mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, told AFP, adding that a further 280 bodies had been buried in mass graves in the town.

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said: “I am deeply shocked by the images of civilians killed in Bucha, Ukraine. It is essential that an independent investigation leads to effective accountability.”

The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the killings added to evidence of Russian war crimes, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, expressed shock about the “terrible and horrifying” footage from Bucha. “Streets littered with bodies. Bodies buried in makeshift conditions. There is talk of women, children and the elderly among the victims,” Scholz said.

The British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, said it was clear that rape had been used as a weapon of war by Russian forces. She said: “Women raped in front of their kids, girls in front of their families, as a deliberate act of subjugation. Rape is a war crime.”

Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, condemned the killings of civilians in the town of Bucha as a “terrible war crime [that] cannot go unanswered” and called for a strengthening of sanctions. The country’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the images from Bucha were “unbearable”.

“Putin’s frantic violence is wiping out innocent families and knows no bounds,” she wrote on Twitter, adding that those responsible for war crimes must be held to account.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, described the killings at Bucha as “a punch to the gut” and joined western allies in vowing to document the atrocities to hold the perpetrators to account.

The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said he was shocked by “haunting images of atrocities committed by [the] Russian army in liberated region of Kyiv”, adding that “further EU sanctions and support are on their way”.

The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said she was “appalled by reports of unspeakable horrors in areas from which Russia is withdrawing”. An independent investigation was urgently needed, she said, and “perpetrators of war crimes will be held accountable”.

Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minister, pledged France would work with Ukrainian authorities and the international criminal court (ICC) “to ensure these acts don’t go unpunished and that those responsible are being sent to trial and convicted”.

Johnson, who spoke on Saturday to Zelenskiy, said the UK “will continue to step up military, economic and diplomatic support, including further ramping up sanctions to increase the economic pressure on Putin’s war machine, while Russian troops remain on Ukrainian territory”.

He said the murder of innocent civilians in Irpin and Bucha was “yet more evidence that Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine”. The Russian president’s invasion was failing, Johnson added, and Ukrainian forces’ resolve had “never been stronger”.

Russia for its part tried to paint the situation in Bucha as somehow representing a “provocation” by Ukraine intended to disrupt peace talks. The Kremlin’s foreign ministry said Russia was seeking a UN security council meeting on the matter. Russia denied responsibility for the Bucha killing of civilians. Its defence ministry described the photos and videos as “another staged performance by the Kyiv regime”, echoing a similar claim made after the bombing of a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol.

Russia has repeatedly claimed, without proof, that Ukraine has staged such atrocities, but the Kremlin line is starkly contradicted by conditions on the ground and ample evidence of Russian attacks on civilian targets.

Kuleba urged the ICC and international organisations to come to the region to collect evidence of Russian war crimes.

Speaking on Times Radio on Sunday, he said Bucha was a “deliberate massacre”. Describing Russia as “worse than Isis”, he said Russian forces were guilty of murder, torture, rape and looting. He also urged G7 countries to impose “devastating” sanctions immediately.

Another senior Ukrainian official, Mykhailo Podolyak, who is leading Kyiv’s negotiating team in talks with the Russians, condemned the lack of western response as further horrific images emerged. “Today’s ‘leaders of Europe’, hundreds of current European politicians, [are] eating well and sleeping peacefully in their beds now, do you not want to look closely at this photo archive of hell arranged by Russians in the Kiev region?”

At a Brussels summit last week, the EU’s 27 leaders agreed to “move quickly with further coordinated robust sanctions” against Russia and its ally Belarus, but they have been divided about next steps.

Germany, whose industrial economy is heavily dependent on Russian gas, has resisted calls for an immediate ban on Russian fossil fuels, angering Poland and the Baltic states, which would like the most stringent measures against the Kremlin’s war machine.

Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who cruised to victory in parliamentary elections on Sunday, has also faced criticism from Ukraine for his past support for Russia. Over the weekend, Zelenskiy renewed his attack on Orbán, saying he had failed to show moral leadership and lacked honesty. “He is virtually the only one in Europe to openly support Mr Putin,” Zelenskiy said.

On Saturday, Latvian authorities announced that all three Baltic states had stopped importing Russian gas since 1 April. Lithuania’s president, Gitanes Nausėda, said his country was no longer importing Russian gas. ”If we can do it, the rest of Europe can too,” he wrote on Twitter.

Nausėda said the “photo and video evidence from Irpin [and] Bucha unveil the brutal reality of horrific war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine”.

Russia’s actions in Bucha were consistent with more than a century of military practice, said Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. “Anyone saying that Bucha is the result of brutalisation or rogue behaviour is wrong. This was the plan. It was premeditated,” he wrote on Twitter. “And if the Russian military had been more successful there would have been many more towns like it.

“Now that the Ukrainians have pushed the Russians out of Kyiv… we are in this kind of dangerous inflection point, where the Russians have a more credible concept of operation,” he told the Guardian, referring to Russia’s decision to focus on southern Ukraine and the Donbas.

“The Russians could regroup and rebuild momentum and start taking ground again, but they are currently on the back foot and they are somewhat disorganised and morale is very low. If Ukrainians can capitalise on that they can potentially roll back the Russians.”

He added that the next couple of weeks “are a critical turning point in terms of whether the Ukrainians can keep the momentum”.

Western countries needed to prioritise military equipment, such as anti-tank weapons, air defence missiles and portable air defence systems that would allow Ukraine “to start attriting the Russian air defence systems command posts, electronic warfare systems, high-value targets”.

“Not all western countries have those systems and those that don’t should help resource those that do.”

The evidence of atrocities emerged against a backdrop of faltering peace negotiations. Russia’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said talks on an agreement were not advanced enough to allow a meeting between Zelenskiy and Putin, contradicting a more optimistic statement from his Ukrainian opposite number, David Arakhamia. Ukraine has offered to relinquish its goal to join Nato, a key Russian demand, but the two sides have not agreed on the status of Russia-annexed Crimea and two self-declared republics in the Donbas.

2:17 pm: Kremlin says rouble-for-gas scheme is the 'prototype'

The Kremlin has warned the West that Russian President Vladimir Putin's rouble payment scheme for natural gas is the prototype that Russia will extend to other major exports because the West has sealed the decline of the US dollar by freezing Russian assets.

""It is the prototype of the system,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia's Channel One state television on Sunday. ""I have no doubt that it will be extended to new groups of goods,"" he added. Peskov gave no timeframe for such a move.

Western capitals slapped Russia with unprecedented economic sanctions after Moscow moved troops into Ukraine on February 24.

The Kremlin on Sunday said it's not possible to completely isolate Russia. ""There can be no complete vacuum or isolation of Russia, it is technologically impossible in the modern world,"" said Peskov.

The German musician has played on Kyiv's Maidan Square and Istanbul's Taksim Square, as well as in front of the Bataclan concert hall after the November 2015 Paris attacks.

“Someone who could come up with this idea is someone who has a big heart, because music makes you emotional and I think that it's a big support for all of these people who have had to leave their homes,” a woman at the border crossing said to FRANCE 24.

1:20 pm: Human Rights Watch accuses Russian forces of ‘apparent war crimes’

7:45 am: Loud explosions heard in Odesa

""Odesa was attacked from the air,"" Ukraine interior minister advisor Anton Herashchenko wrote on his Telegram account. ""Fires were reported in some areas. Some of the missiles were shot down by air defence.""

An AFP reporter heard explosions in the southwestern city at around 6:00 am local time (0300 GMT). The blasts sent up at least three columns of black smoke with flames apparently visible in an industrial area. A soldier near the site of one of the strikes said it was likely a rocket or a missile.

The attack comes as Russian forces appeared to be withdrawing from the country's north. On Friday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Russia was consolidating its forces and preparing ""powerful strikes"" in the south, joining a chorus of Western assessments that Moscow's troops were regrouping.

The EU has imposed several waves of punishing sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.

But the 27-nation bloc has stopped short of imposing an embargo on the Kremlin's oil and gas exports as some member states still rely heavily on Russian fossil fuels.

France could come under greater pressure to accelerate weapons deliveries to Ukraine in the wake of the apparent execution of civilians and discovery of mass graves in Bucha.

Macron has spoken repeatedly with Russian leader Vladimir Putin since the February 24 invasion of Ukraine and has been wary of provoking the Kremlin, calling deliveries of tanks or aircraft to Ukraine ""red lines"".

Journalists from international media over the weekend found corpses in civilian clothes – some with their hands bound – in Bucha after Ukrainian forces retook the town on the outskirts of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, from the Russian army.

Ukrainian authorities said on Sunday they were investigating possible war crimes, while Western leaders erupted in outrage over the deaths.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the facts and chronology of the events in Bucha did not support Ukraine’s version of events.

He said Russian “experts at the Ministry of Defence have identified signs of video fakes and various fakes”, without elaborating.

“We would demand that many international leaders do not rush to sweeping accusations and at least listen to our arguments,” he added.

Peskov also said Russia’s diplomats would press on with their efforts to convene a United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss what Moscow has called “Ukrainian provocations” in Bucha despite their first effort to arrange such a meeting being blocked.

Peskov declined to comment on whether the furore over Bucha would affect peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, which had been set to resume via video conference on Monday.

On Monday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called for an international investigation into what he termed a “genocide” carried out by Russian troops in Ukraine, including in Bucha.

“These bloody massacres committed by Russians, by Russian soldiers, deserve to be called what they are. This is genocide and it must be judged,” Morawiecki told reporters.

“This is why we are proposing an international commission to investigate this crime of genocide.”

Such a commission “is essential if we want to find out the truth on the extent of Russian fascist crimes”.

Morawiecki also called for new Western sanctions against Russia and compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to autocrats from the past.

“Clear and determined sanctions are necessary. These sanctions are not working,” Morawiecki said.

He also addressed French President Emmanuel Macron, saying: “How many times have you negotiated with Putin and what have you achieved? We do not discuss, we do not negotiate with criminals. Criminals have to be fought against.”

“Nobody negotiated with Hitler. Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot?”

Addressing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Morawiecki said: “It is not the voices of German business leaders, of German billionaires who are probably stopping you from taking action, that should be listened to in Berlin today but the voices of innocent women and children.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/4/kremlin-rejects-accusation-russian-forces-killed-bucha-civilians

Ukrainian officials said they have asked the International Criminal Court (ICC) to visit the mass graves seen in Bucha, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, so experts can gather evidence of possible Russian war crimes. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The request comes as Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said the discovery of the graves — made as Ukrainian troops recaptured territory and Russian forces pulled back from towns they had seized in the war’s earliest days — could “only be described as genocide.”

Condemnation of the alleged assault on civilians resounded around the world, with numerous countries demanding investigations and accountability. Russia’s Defense Ministry, however, questioned the authenticity of some of the photos from Bucha.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in a tweet Sunday accusing Russia of carrying out a “massacre,” requested that the ICC visit the scene “to collect all the evidence of these war crimes” and use it to prosecute those responsible.

On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian attacks on Ukraine amounted to a genocide.

“This is genocide,” Zelensky said in an interview on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” “We are the citizens of Ukraine; we have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities.”

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” said “you can’t help but see these images [out of Bucha] as a punch to the gut,” but he avoided calling it genocide.

“The most important thing is we can’t become numb to this. We can’t normalize this,” Blinken said, noting that the United States will help ensure that relevant institutions have the evidence they need to determine what happened.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, on the same show, said the Bucha scenes reflected “brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades. And it’s horrific and it’s absolutely unacceptable that civilians are targeted and killed.”

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, “Russia’s despicable attacks against innocent civilians in Irpin and Bucha are yet more evidence that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine.” Irpin, another suburb of Kyiv, also was the scene of fierce battles.

Britain also called for a probe and said it would support any investigations by the ICC. “As Russian troops are forced into retreat, we are seeing increasing evidence of appalling acts by the invading forces in towns such as Irpin and Bucha,” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Sunday.

“Their indiscriminate attacks against innocent civilians during Russia’s illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine must be investigated as war crimes,” Truss said, adding that Britain would “not allow Russia to cover up their involvement in these atrocities through cynical disinformation.”

Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry reposted a Telegram message in its channel that claimed some of the footage of bodies in Bucha was “fake” and accused Ukrainian forces of killing people by shelling Bucha.

Ukraine’s leaders forcefully condemned what they characterized as Russian war crimes in Bucha. Klitschko, the Kyiv mayor, told Germany’s Bild news outlet on Sunday that Putin was responsible for “cruel war crimes,” including the shooting of civilians with their hands bound, in Bucha.

Bucha’s mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, told The Washington Post that about 270 residents had been buried in two mass graves, and he estimated that 40 people were lying dead in the streets. Some, he said, had been bound and executed — shot in the back of the head.

Human Rights Watch said in a statement Sunday that it had “documented several cases of Russian military forces committing laws-of-war violations against civilians in occupied areas of the Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv regions of Ukraine.”

In Bucha, the human rights advocacy group said, it spoke to a teacher who reported witnessing Russian forces executing a man on March 4.

Video posted to social media Saturday and verified by The Post showed at least nine people, including one child, lying on the street of a residential area. They appear to be dead.

Condemnation of the scenes rippled through Europe.

European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said she was “appalled by reports of unspeakable horrors in areas from which Russia is withdrawing” and called for an “independent investigation.”

“Perpetrators of war crimes will be held accountable,” she said.

European Council President Charles Michel said the European Union would support Ukraine in gathering evidence to pursue charges against Russia in international courts. He said he was “shocked by haunting images of atrocities committed by Russian army in Kyiv liberated region.”

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said he was “deeply shocked” by the images from Bucha. He said it is “essential that an independent investigation leads to effective accountability.”

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called the images “unbearable” and said those responsible should be held accountable. French President Emmanuel Macron said that “Russian authorities will have to answer for these crimes.”

Others called for fresh sanctions against Russia and more support for Ukraine.

Latvia’s foreign minister, Edgars Rinkevics, said Russian troops committed “genocide” and “war crimes” in Bucha that “must be met with new sanctions & increased military assistance to Ukraine.” Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis argued that the E.U. should stop buying Russian oil and gas.

Russian army of mass murderers retreat from Bucha reveals full scale of atrocities. We can only imagine what is going on in other occupied territories. No other way arround - buying 🇷🇺 oil&gas is financing war crimes. Dear EU friends, pull the plug. Don't be an accomplice. — Gabrielius Landsbergis (@GLandsbergis) April 3, 2022

Earlier, Republic Media Network accessed horrifying visuals from the city, where several dead bodies of those killed in the war are seen lying on the streets. French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday condemned Moscow for such bone-chilling war crimes, and has sought an answer from the Russian authorities on the same.

The French President tweeted, ""The images that come to us from Bucha, a liberated city near Kyiv, are unbearable. On the streets, hundreds of civilians are cowardly murdered.

Hours earlier, European Council President Charles Michel despised Russia for the horrendous devastation by Moscow's troops in the embattled nation. In a tweet, the EU Council President condemned the horrific killings of civilians in Bucha. He pressed world leaders to issue bolder sanctions against Moscow for committing such atrocities on civilians.

France derides Russia's ‘massive abuses’ in northwest of Kyiv

French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Sunday also lashed out at the horrifying war crimes committed against Kyiv's civilians by the invading Russian forces. Labelling the killings as the “massive abuses” by Russian forces”, Jean-Yves Le Drian said that France will work with Ukrainian authorities and the International Criminal Court to launch an investigation and hold accountable those responsible for what the Ukrainian Foreign Minister described as 'a massacre' in Ukraine.

Mentioning the town of Bucha outside Kyiv, where the Ukrainian Army said that it dug mass graves of more than 300 civilians, the French Foreign Affairs Minister said that such abuses during the conflicts amount to ""war crimes.""

BUCHA, Ukraine, April 3 (Reuters) - Ukraine on Sunday accused Russian forces of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha, while Western nations reacted to images of dead bodies there with calls for new sanctions against Moscow.

Russia's defence ministry denied the Ukrainian allegations, saying footage and photographs showing bodies in Bucha were ""yet another provocation"" by the Ukrainian government.

The images from the town, 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv's city centre, emerged after Ukraine said on Saturday its forces had reclaimed control of the whole Kyiv region and liberated towns from Russian troops.

They prompted outrage in Ukraine and abroad, adding to pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin by increasing the likelihood of further Western sanctions. Western nations have already sought to isolate Russia economically and punish it for the invasion, which began on Feb. 24.

""Bucha massacre was deliberate,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the images as ""a punch in the gut,"" while United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent investigation.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Russia must pay for ""war crimes."" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government would step up sanctions, as well as military and humanitarian support for Ukraine.

""Putin and his supporters will feel the consequences,"" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, adding that Western allies would agree on further sanctions in the coming days.

FIGHTING IN SEVERAL AREAS

Russia has pulled back forces that had threatened Kyiv from the north, saying it intends to focus on eastern Ukraine.

Fighting was reported on Sunday in several parts of Ukraine.

The governor of the eastern Donetsk region said shelling had continued throughout the night and day. Russian shelling killed seven people in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, according to the regional prosecutor's office.

Missiles struck near the southern port of Odesa, with Russia saying it had destroyed an oil refinery used by the Ukrainian military. The Odesa city council said ""critical infrastructure facilities"" were hit. read more

There was little sign of a breakthrough in efforts to negotiate an end to the war, although Russia's chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said talks were due to resume on Monday via videoconference.

Medinsky said that while Ukraine was showing more realism by agreeing to be neutral, renouncing nuclear weapons, not joining a military bloc and refusing to host military bases, there had been no progress on other key Russia demands. read more

""I repeat again and again: Russia's position on Crimea and Donbas remains UNCHANGED,"" he said on Telegram.

Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has recognised declarations of independence by the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine which rose up against Kyiv's rule.

BUCHA, Ukraine, April 4 (Reuters) - The United States and European countries pledged on Monday to punish Moscow over civilian killings in northern Ukraine, where a mass grave and tied bodies of people shot at close range were found in a town seized back from Russian forces.

The deaths in Bucha, outside Kyiv, drew pledges of further sanctions against Moscow from the West, possibly including some restrictions on the billions of dollars in energy that Europe still imports from Russia. read more

The discoveries came against a backdrop of artillery barrages in Ukraine's south and east, where Russia says it is now focusing after it fell short in attempts to take major cities in the heart of the country.

Russia denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha. Its envoy to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, said Russia will present ""empirical evidence"" to the Security Council on Tuesday showing its forces were not involved in atrocities.

Zelenskiy said the killings had made it harder for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia. Neither side offered updates on peace talks that had been set to resume on Monday.

Taras Shapravskyi, Bucha's deputy mayor, said around 50 victims of extra-judicial killings by Russian troops had been found there after Kremlin forces withdrew late last week.

Ukrainian authorities said they had found 421 civilian casualties near Kyiv by Sunday and were investigating possible war crimes in Bucha, a description also used by French President Emmanuel Macron and, in reference to Russia's broader offensive, by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Reuters saw more makeshift burials elsewhere but could not independently verify the number of dead or who was responsible.

Zelenskiy has used the term genocide at various times during the war, decrying what he calls an intent to eliminate the nation by Putin, who has questioned Ukraine's legitimate, independent history from Russia.

Washington, at Kyiv's request, was backing a multinational team of prosecutors who would help collect and analyse evidence of atrocities with a view towards pursuing accountability, the U.S. State Department said.

FLATTENED BY SHELLING

On the other side of the country in Mariupol, a southeastern port that has been under siege for weeks, Reuters images showed three bodies in civilian clothes lying in the street, one against a wall sprayed with blood.

Outside a damaged apartment building, residents buried other dead in a shell crater. ""It is easier to dig here,"" a resident said, saying four bodies were in the improvised grave.

Ukraine says it has evacuated thousands of civilians in the past few days from Mariupol, which is surrounded by areas held by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region.

A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross was stopped during an attempt to reach Mariupol to evacuate civilians, and is now being held in a nearby town, a spokesperson said. Several previous ICRC attempts to reach the city were unsuccessful. read more

RUSSIAN REDEPLOYMENTS

Ukraine is preparing for what its general staff said were about 60,000 Russian reservists called in to reinforce Moscow's offensive in the east, after Russian forces became bogged down elsewhere in the face of unexpectedly lethal and mobile Ukrainian resistance using Western anti-tank weaponry.

Officials in Ukraine's northern regions, nearest Russia, said Russian troops there had fully withdrawn or significantly scaled back in number. read more

Over the weekend Ukraine said its forces had wrested back all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since Russia launched its onslaught. It has since warned of attacks on Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, which abuts the Russian border.

Some lie face down on the pavement while others are collapsed on their backs, mouths open in a tragic testament to the horrors of Russian occupation .

The hands of one man are tied behind his back with a piece of white cloth. Another man lies alone, tangled up in a bicycle by a grassy bank. A third man lies in the middle of the road, near the charred remains of a burned-out car.

The shocking images of the carnage in Bucha were captured by Agence France-Presse on Saturday, the same day Ukraine declared the town liberated from Russian troops. Accounts of alleged Russian atrocities are emerging as its forces retreat from areas near Kyiv following a failed bid to encircle the capital.

The town of Bucha has endured five weeks of near-constant firefights. Now officials and human rights groups are blaming the civilian deaths on the departed Russian forces.

""Corpses of executed people still line the Yabluska street in Bucha. Their hands are tied behind their backs with white 'civilian' rags, they were shot in the back of their heads. So you can imagine what kind of lawlessness they perpetrated here,"" Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk told Reuters on Saturday.

Ukrainian soldiers are pictured in Bucha on Saturday, after Russian troops retreated from the area.

In a video address Sunday after the reports out of Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for an end of Russian ""war crimes.""

""The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything possible to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth,"" he said.

Zelensky called on Russian leaders to be held accountable for the actions of the nation's military.

""I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being fulfilled. Such orders. Such a fulfillment. And joint responsibility. For these murders, for these tortures, for these arms torn off by explosions that lie on the streets. For shots in the back of the head of tied people. This is how the Russian state will now be perceived. This is your image,"" Zelensky said.

The alleged atrocities in Bucha have drawn international outrage, with Western leaders, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken , calling for war crimes investigations and increasing sanctions on Russia.

CNN has not been able to independently confirm the details around the men's deaths.

In his address, Zelensky announced a ""mechanism of justice"" would be established to investigate crimes committed by Russian soldiers in Ukrainian territory. The mechanism would be supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Prosecutor General's Office, the National Police, the Security Service, the Intelligence Service and other government branches, he said.

""This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world bring to concrete justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said.

Zelensky said he will provide more information on the state of Ukrainian territory that was occupied by Russian forces.

""All partners of Ukraine will be informed in detail about what happened in the temporarily occupied territory of our state. War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the (United Nations) Security Council on Tuesday,"" he said.

He also noted that efforts are underway to restore electricity and water to Bucha, as well as reestablishing medical institutions and infrastructure.

Zelensky once again invoked the need for stronger sanctions against Russia.

""There will definitely be a new package of sanctions against Russia. But I'm sure that's not enough. More conclusions are needed. Not only about Russia, but also about the political behavior that actually allowed this evil to come to our land,"" he said.

Asked during an appearance earlier Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" if Russia was carrying out genocide in his country, Zelensky said: ""Indeed. This is genocide.""

""The elimination of the whole nation, and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities,"" he said.

The Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed the extensive footage of Bucha was ""fake,"" saying ""not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions"" during Russia's occupation of the city. ""In the settlements of the Kiev region, Russian military personnel delivered and issued 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians,"" it said in a statement.

A separate statement claimed the footage was staged. ""Stories about Bucha appeared in several foreign media outlets at once, which looks like a planned media campaign,"" the statement said. ""Taking into account that the troops left the city on March 30, where was the footage for four days? Their absence only confirms the fake.""

The Russian government has consistently responded to allegations of civilian casualties inflicted by Russian forces with blanket denials. After the Russian air force bombed a maternity hospital on March 9, Russian officials attempted to cast doubt on widespread media reports, with one Russian diplomat accusing a victim of the bombing -- a woman who escaped from the bombing, bloodied and still pregnant -- of being an actor and not a real victim.

Mass grave

The toll of the Russian invasion was apparent at a mass grave in Bucha. People cried as they attempted to locate the bodies of lost loved ones at a grave located in the grounds of the Church of St. Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints on Sunday, according to a CNN team at the scene.

Bucha residents told CNN that bodies were first buried in the grave in the first few days of the war. They believe 150 people are buried in the site, many of whom were civilians killed in the fighting around Bucha.

CNN saw at least a dozen bodies in body bags piled inside the grave. Some were already partially covered.

The mayor of Bucha said in public remarks Saturday that up to 300 victims could be buried at the site.

CNN was unable to independently verify those numbers or the identities and nationalities of those buried in the grave.

The earth on the church grounds appeared to have been recently moved so it is feasible that more bodies could be buried there.

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said Sunday that reports emerging from towns in the Kyiv region revealed a ""post-apocalyptic picture"" of life under Russian occupation.

""This is a special appeal aimed at drawing the world's attention to those war crimes, crimes against humanity, which were committed by Russian troops in Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel,"" Arestovych said. ""These are liberated cities, a picture from horror movies, a post-apocalyptic picture.""

""Victims of these war crimes have already been found, including raped women who they tried to burn, local government officials killed, children killed, elderly people killed, men killed, many of them with tied hands, traces of torture and shot in the back of the head. Robberies, attempts to take gold, valuables, carpets, washing machines. It, of course, will be taken into account by the Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine and law enforcement agencies and international criminal courts.""

Bodies lie in a street in Bucha on Saturday. A portion of this photo has been blurred to protect the victim's identity.

The evidence of apparent atrocities in Bucha came as Human Rights Watch (HRW) announced it had documented allegations of war crimes in the occupied areas of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Kharkiv regions.

HRW said Sunday that the allegations include ""a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14, 2022.""

In Bucha, Russian forces ""rounded up five men and summarily executed one of them"" on March 4, HRW wrote. A witness told the group that soldiers forced the men to kneel on the road and pulled their shirts over their heads, before shooting one of the men in the back of the head.

HRW also alleges that on February 27, six men were rounded up in the village of Staryi Bykiv in the Chernihiv region and later executed.

In Malaya Rohan, a village in the Kharkiv region, a Russian soldier repeatedly raped a woman in a school where she was sheltering with her family on March 13, the victim told HRW. ""She said that he beat her and cut her face, neck, and hair with a knife,"" HRW wrote. The woman fled to Kharkiv the following day, ""where she was able to get medical treatment and other services.""

And in the village of Vorzel, 31 miles northwest of Kyiv, Russian soldiers ""threw a smoke grenade into a basement, then shot a woman and a 14-year-old child as they emerged from the basement, where they had been sheltering,"" HRW said.

""The cases we documented amount to unspeakable, deliberate cruelty and violence against Ukrainian civilians,"" Hugh Williamson, HRW's Europe and Central Asia director, said in the statement. ""Rape, murder, and other violent acts against people in the Russian forces' custody should be investigated as war crimes.""

CNN has not independently verified the details of the HRW report and has requested comment from the Russian defense ministry.

Sunday's developments in Ukraine have hastened calls for war crimes investigations.

Blinken said the State Department would help document any atrocities the Russian military committed against Ukrainian civilians.

""You can't help but see these images as a punch to the gut,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union"" Sunday, when asked about the civilian killings in Bucha.

""Since the aggression, we've come out and said that we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes, and we've been working to document that, to provide the information we have to the relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together. And there needs to be accountability for it.""
