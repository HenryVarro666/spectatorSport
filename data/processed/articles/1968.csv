The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

The conflict halted plans for the Kharkiv Music Fest, an annual international classical music festival in Ukraine’s second-largest city. So the organisers said they scrambled to improvise amid war - descending into a subway station and the basement of a business, hoping for safety from the assaults overhead.

""Music can unite,"" art director Vitali Alekseenok said. ""It’s important now for those who stay in Kharkiv to be united.""

The original concert would have included a recital by French pianist Lucas Debargue and was to be held in the grand hall of the Kharkiv Philharmonic on Saturday.

Instead, the ""concert between explosions"" - as it was called on social media - started with the Ukrainian national anthem, prompting audience members to put their hands over their hearts.

The program included the music of Bach, Dvorak and other composers, as well as arrangements of Ukrainian folk songs. Hundreds of all ages watched, sometimes holding one another.

The program was adapted to highlight the connections between Ukrainian and Western European culture, Mr Alekseenok said.

Music teacher and violinist Olha Pyshchyta told The Washington Post on Sunday that performing in the subway sparked a range of emotions, after a month of war.

She said she was angry - and tired - ""but at the concert … we felt unity.""

""I, like all Ukrainians, are waiting for victory,"" Ms Pyshchyta said.

Fellow violinist Stanislav Kucherenko told The Post that the concert was unlike any other he’d played. ""There was no stage excitement that usually happens when performing for people,"" he said, but ""I knew that I was where I should be.""

Mr Kucherenko said music has a ""strong influence on the psycho-emotional state of a person"" and could, ""in the conditions of war,"" help people to cope with fear and stress and inspire ""faith and optimism.""

Sergiy Politutchy, director of the Kharkiv Music Fest, said the underground concert showed that ""amid the darkness … there are eternal values and a future in our country,"" Sky News reported. The concert proved that ""our country is melodious, beautiful, intellectual and will overcome all these difficulties,"" he added, according to the report.

The concert was among a handful of musical moments for Kharkiv since the Russian invasion.

Before the war, Kharkiv was known as Ukraine’s intellectual capital. With more than 30 universities, it brimmed with students and was a well-known scientific and cultural hub. Today, missile strikes have ravaged the 19th-century architectural gems in its centre. Around half the population of about 700,000 people have fled according to the regional administration, and those who have stayed regularly seek shelter underground from airstrikes.

Last week, Ukrainian cellist Denys Karachevtsev caught global attention as he played a somber Bach melody in the streets of Kharkiv, surrounded by broken windows, bombed-out buildings and rubble.

Mr Karachevtsev posted a video on social media to raise awareness about the destruction of Kharkiv as well as funds to restore his hometown.

Working as a volunteer in the war effort by day, assisting with evacuations and distributing humanitarian aid, Mr Karachevtsev, 30, told The Post that he decided to stay in the city despite the heavy shelling to support the people of his hometown and lift their spirits. He said music encouraged people ""to keep fighting.""

Last month, as Russian troops were closing in on Kharkiv and people were attempting to flee, a young boy sat at a glossy white piano in a hotel lobby and began to play.

A video of him captured by a Post correspondent went viral online, attracting the attention of the world, including composers Philip Glass and Paul Leonard-Morgan, who said they never imagined their music would become the evocative soundtrack to a war.

Elsewhere, a video of a seven-year-old Ukrainian girl, Amelia Anisovych, singing ""Let It Go"" from the Disney movie ""Frozen"" inside a bomb shelter in Kyiv catapulted her to fame. Anisovych first sang in front of Ukrainians huddled together in a dimly lit bomb shelter in Kyiv.

Like millions of others, she has since fled to Poland. Amelia performed Ukraine’s national anthem at an event this month to raise funds for those fleeing the war.

Several of their trucks are peppered with shrapnel holes from shells that landed during their rounds. The bins they empty are packed with the shattered, twisted remains of homes destroyed by explosions.

But still, every morning they go out to keep Kharkiv clean. Ukraine’s second city is perhaps the most-shelled target in the country after besieged Mariupol. Every day brings a hail of Grad rockets, cluster bombs, shells and missiles.

Hundreds are dead, thousands injured. The morgues cannot cope with the daily toll inflicted by Russia. At one city-centre facility, dozens of bodies, wrapped only in plastic bags or blankets, are stacked in a courtyard. Yet Kharkiv’s people are determined that their city will stand, that life must continue among the ruins, even if for now it is a terrifying half-existence in the shadow of sudden death. And that means keeping the city clean.

“They can bomb us for as long as they want: we will withstand it,” said Ihor Aponchuk, a driver whose collection round now takes in ghostly neighbourhoods of empty playgrounds and a shelled school just short of the front line.

A few hours after Aponchuk emptied the first set of bins near the Heroes of Labour metro station in eastern Kharkiv, a rocket hit people queuing for aid about 500 metres away, killing six and leaving the pavement smeared with blood. The next day the city’s main Barabashovo market was set alight, and four died when a shell landed outside a clinic.

In Ukrainian cities less directly touched – or less terribly ravaged – by the war, there is a cheery defiance. In Kharkiv, death is too close and too frequent for that.

Men and women who are drawing on extraordinary reserves of courage to go about their lives, openly admit that the situation is terrifying.

Yet they and hundreds of thousands of others have chosen to stay in their “hero city” – a title first awarded to Kharkiv for its resistance to Nazi troops in the second world war, and bestowed again by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this month for its courage standing up to Russia’s invasion.

“We are scared, but we need to show people that the situation is under control and every day we are getting closer to victory,” said governor Oleh Synyehubov, who spoke to the Observer while walking in a city centre park under light police guard.

Aponchuk, who has had a couple of near misses with Russian rockets, said: “I understand the fear.” But Kharkiv has a reputation as a “clean city”, and he believes keeping it that way is vital for morale, as well as public hygiene.

So he and over 250 others head out each day, risking their lives with a matter-of-fact dedication similar to that displayed by Londoners who kept milk deliveries going during the second world war’s blitz.

“A driver came under heavy shelling the other day, so he drove back to base here, had a cup of tea, then went out on another route,” said Oleksii Artikulenko, a city employee seconded a month ago to keep waste collection operating through the war.

Less than 40 miles from the Russian border, Kharkiv is traditionally a Russian-speaking town, and Moscow apparently expected its forces to be welcomed there. Instead they met heavy resistance.

Pinned into the city’s north and east, they began targeting civilians and the centre, inflicting damage on everything from the zoo to the cathedral and a Holocaust memorial. A missile hollowed out Kharkiv’s city hall. Rockets punched holes in apartment blocks and destroyed smaller homes. “When it was clear that they weren’t going to be able to take it, they started a campaign of terror,” Synyehubov said.

“Kharkiv will be even more beautiful, with better buildings and infrastructure, I have no doubt. The thing that upsets me is deaths. It is straightforward to restore things, but not to restore families.”

Officials estimate that well over half of the city’s 1.4 million population has left. Trains alone carried nearly half of them, 600,000 people, to the west, and many more left by car. But that still leaves a city of hundreds of thousands, living mostly inside, or underground, who have refused to go.

They want to keep the city’s spirit alive for themselves, and to support soldiers on the front lines nearby, and they want to start rebuilding, or at least clearing up the wreckage of recent strikes, so that Kharkiv doesn’t feel abandoned.

Serhiy, a fireman, spent his 29th birthday last Thursday clearing the shattered remains of the imposing Soviet-era city hall: 30 bodies have been pulled from the wreckage.

By evening, he said, he would be back on duty putting out fires:“I’ll celebrate my birthday with a cup of tea. We haven’t had a day off in a month. They have offered us a break but we don’t want to take it.”

Nearby, teams were sandbagging a 10 metre-high statue of poet and Ukrainian hero Taras Shevchenko. “For me the city was wonderful,” said Yevhen Yurgens, 56, as he helped fill the sandbags. “Look how the Russians destroyed it. We want to protect it as much as we can.”

The city feels like the end of the line for Ukraine’s war. The highway from the industrial hub of Dnipro, which sweeps through rich farmland, is now virtually empty. You can drive for miles without seeing a car or lorry.

Reports of Russian ambush groups and shelling, even on the relatively safe southern approach to the town, make the journey tense, and people organising aid say they have trouble recruiting drivers to make the run.

So while the city is not officially under siege, it is running low on food and medicine. International organisations such as the UN and the Red Cross seem conspicuous mostly by their absence.

“We’ve been left to ourselves here essentially,” says Synyehubov. “We get 100 tonnes of humanitarian aid each day, but 40 tonnes of it are clothes, which we don’t need.” They need five times as much food and medicine as they are getting.

For now, the city’s more vulnerable residents are being kept alive largely by informal networks of volunteers like Tetiana Medveyeva, 33, and Stanislav Manilov, 28. The couple went to the station on the first day of the war, planning to head west, but ended up staying.

“We saw so many people trying to get on the train with their pets and families,” Manilov said. “We looked each other in the eyes, and agreed that others needed to leave more than us. And at that point we decided not to go, and to be useful here.”

They connected with some activists they knew before the war, and began preparing food packages for the old and disabled who might struggle to leave home or afford food, paid for by private donations raised online.

“We have been doing this since 26 February, and it feels like it has been going on forever.” They spend their mornings buying and packing food bags, and the afternoons handing them out. With most jobs vanished overnight, and old people unable to get their pensions from closed post offices, the scale of the need is terrifying.

When their van draws up, people will come running to secure a bag containing pasta and a couple of cans of fish and meat. “In other areas, people are more desperate,” Medveyeva said. “They attack the van, and shout at us if they don’t get food.”

A month ago she was an administrator and he worked in an architectural design company. Now they live off dwindling savings and, increasingly, the food packages they prepare for other vulnerable locals. They are so used to driving around under bombardment they don’t flinch even when shells land nearby.

Tass issued the report shortly after a senior local official reported a series of explosions outside the city of Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine.

Video posted online from two local Belgorod news outlets appeared to show ammunition blowing up in the distance but Reuters was not immediately able to confirm this was the case.

Tass cited an emergency services source as saying four people had been injured in the blast.

Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov earlier said in an online post that the blasts occurred near the village of Krasny Oktyabr, about 30 km (19 miles) southwest of Belgorod. He did not give a reason for the blasts and promised an update later.

Belgorod is 80 km (50 miles) north of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, which Russian forces have bombarded heavily in recent weeks.

One man, in one particular place — a place that was bombed three separate times.

What citizen-turned-soldier Oleg Supereka experienced this month as he stood guard over the regional administration building in the northeast city of Kharkiv is extraordinary — yet in the surreal context of this war, almost banal.

With Russian troops training battlefield weaponry on cities and towns across Ukraine, combatants and noncombatants alike have found themselves enduring close-range encounters with heavy armaments designed to pulverize military targets and level large infrastructure.

Some people survive; many do not.

“We want to defend our country, after each explosion,” said Supereka, 53, who worked as a portrait photographer before the war.

The portrait he sees daily now is the face of a beloved city disfigured. More than 600 buildings in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest metropolis, were destroyed in the three weeks ending in mid-March, the city’s mayor reported, and hundreds more have been hit since.

Every day, unrelenting rocket fire, missile strikes and artillery shells pour down on what was a city of 1.4 million people. The regional administrative building Supereka was assigned to help guard — now in ruins — was an enormous Stalinist-style structure situated on Freedom Square, the country’s largest public plaza.

The square was once named for Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Bolshevik-era secret police, but was renamed by a now-sovereign Ukraine after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.

To many, the targeting of a landmark square in Kharkiv’s densely populated city center, less than a week after the invasion’s start on Feb. 24, marked the crossing of a frontier: a clear signal that in this war, nothing was out of bounds — not homes or hospitals, not schools and shops, not cafes and parks.

When a missile hit directly in front of the administrative building on March 1, Supereka was on the fifth floor. The blast was enormously powerful. Dazed, he tried to make his way downstairs. As he did, he realized he’d somehow lost his shoes.

“There was so much glass, so much smoke, dust, you can’t see,” he recounted on a recent day, from his sandbagged guard position in front of the building. “So much blood — on the floor, on the wall, on the faces of the victims.”

It was five or 10 minutes later, he said, that the second explosion occurred, as he and others were trying to render aid to those hurt in the initial blast. Civilians and soldiers joined in the effort, he said, even knowing that yet another explosion might strike at any moment.

“I was helping victims down the stairs, and into the backyard and into the ambulances,” he said. “People were helping the wounded, taking out the dead, gathering their belongings.”

Weeks later, the building’s entire interior still looks like a shaken-up snow globe. On the structure’s southern end, all the floors have collapsed into the basement level, and firefighters have used makeshift planks to try to navigate between what were once separate rooms.

At the basement level, the smell of rotting flesh lingers, and debris still covers areas not yet excavated.

The day after the dual strikes, Supereka was back at his post, even with a concussion and minor injuries, helping clear rubble and debris. The next bombardment came the day after that, on March 3, hitting the courtyard just behind the building.

His memories of that blast are more scrambled. At some point afterward, he came to himself and realized he was clutching a piece of paper in his hand, but couldn’t remember where he’d been and what he was doing just beforehand.

“I didn’t understand why I was holding this paper,” he said. “Later, my friend told me I was with him in the moment the explosion hit.”

One thing he remembers is not being scared. He says he’s still not.

“I feel anger,” he said. “Everyone who was alive, and everyone who was wounded, felt the same anger and determination to protect their Ukraine. There was no fear.”

Supereka says Russia may not have realized it was targeting some of its own. He said when the building first came under attack there were prisoners of war inside, but he doesn’t know what happened to them.

After the third strike, he again returned to duty.

“Because it’s my country. It’s my city. My family lives in this town,” he said. “I don’t understand what I could do if I’m not in the army. What must I do if the war starts in my country?”

After the latest attack, Supereka started to have recurring dreams. “At night when I’m sleeping, I can see it again,” he said.

In the building’s courtyard where the third blast hit, there was still a large crater, but debris had been bulldozed aside, into neat piles.

He didn’t know how this war would end, but Supereka said he believed his compatriots had already showed the world their courage.

“We have not had a war for a long time; we are a peaceful country,” he said. “But if someone attacks us, as recent events show, we unite and fight back.”
