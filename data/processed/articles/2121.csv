Good afternoon.



Russia has attacked Ukraine.

This is a brutal act of war.

Our thoughts are with the brave people of Ukraine.

Sadly, what we have warned against for months has come to pass.

Despite all calls on Russia to change course and tireless efforts to seek a diplomatic solution.

Peace in our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on a scale and of a type we thought belong to history.

We have just finished an emergency meeting of the North Atlantic Council to discuss the situation.

The Council also addressed the request by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia to hold urgent consultations under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty.

This is a grave moment for the security of Europe.



Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is putting countless innocent lives at risk.

With air and missile attacks.

Ground forces and special forces from multiple directions.

Targeting military infrastructure and major urban centres.

This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion.

Despite its litany of lies, denials, and disinformation,

the Kremlin’s intentions are clear for the world to see.

Russia’s leaders bear full responsibility for their reckless actions and the lives lost.

NATO Allies condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms.

This is a blatant violation of international law.

An act of aggression against a sovereign, independent and peaceful country.

And a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.

We call on Russia to immediately cease its military action.

Withdraw its forces from Ukraine.

And choose diplomacy.

We fully support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

And Ukraine’s right of self-defence.

Russia is using force to try to rewrite history.

And deny Ukraine its free and independent path.

NATO’s core task is to protect and defend all Allies.

There must be no room for miscalculation or misunderstanding.

An attack on one will be regarded as an attack on all.

This is our collective security guarantee.

Today, the North Atlantic Council decided to activate our defence plans,

At the request of our top military commander, General Tod Wolters.

This is a prudent and defensive step to protect and shield Allied nations during this crisis.

And it will enable us to deploy capabilities and forces, including the NATO Response Force, to where they are needed.

In response to Russia’s massive military build-up,

we have already strengthened our collective defence.

On land, at sea, and in the air.

In the last weeks, Allies from North America and Europe have deployed thousands of more troops to the eastern part of the Alliance.

And placed more on standby.

We have over 100 jets at high alert, protecting our airspace.

And more than 120 Allied ships at sea, from the High North to the Mediterranean.

All this shows that our collective defence commitment Article 5 is ironclad.

And we will continue to do whatever is necessary to shield the Alliance from aggression.

I have called a virtual Summit of NATO leaders tomorrow, to address the way forward.

Russia is now facing severe costs and consequences imposed by the whole international community.

The Kremlin’s aim is to re-establish its sphere of influence.

Rip up the global rules that have kept us all safe for decades.

And subvert the values that we hold dear.

This is the new normal for our security.

Peace cannot be taken for granted.

Freedom and democracy are contested by authoritarian regimes.

And strategic competition is on the rise.

We must respond.

With renewed resolve.

And even stronger unity.

North America and Europe, together in NATO.

We are an Alliance of 30 democracies. Standing as one,

We will protect our people and our values.

Democracy will always prevail over autocracy.

Freedom will always prevail over oppression.

And then, I am ready to take your questions.

NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu: Interfax Ukraine.

Irina Somer (Interfax Ukraine): Thank you Oana. Secretary General, we all know that NATO will not fight for Ukraine. But don't you think it's time for NATO to build anti-Hitler sorry, anti-Putin coalition? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: NATO stands in solidarity with Ukraine and NATO allies are imposing severe costs on Russia for the reckless invasion of Ukraine.

NATO allies, in close coordination with the European Union and other partners all over the world, are now imposing severe economic sanctions on Russia. To demonstrate that, we follow up on what we said, and that is that it will be a high price for Russia to pay.

NATO allies have also over a long period of time provided support, practical support, military support to Ukraine and helped them to build a much stronger, much better equipped, much better trained armed force today than the Ukraine had in 2014. I would like to recognize the professionalism and the bravery of the Ukrainian men and women in uniform who are now standing up against the Russian invasion.

We continue to stand together, condemning the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Allies stand together also in sending a message that we will never accept the brutal violation of international law that we see taking place as Russia now invades Ukraine.

NATO Spokesperson: We'll go to Bloomberg.

Natalia Drozdiak (Bloomberg): (Inaudible) Do you have any information that shows that NATO Allies face a direct threat from Russia at the moment, and would NATO reconsider military intervention in Ukraine? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: NATO is the strongest alliance in history, and make no mistake; we will defend and protect every ally against any attack and every inch of NATO territory. And that's the reason also we have increased our presence in the eastern part of the alliance with thousands of more troops, ships and planes over the last weeks to send a very clear message; an attack on one ally will trigger the response of the whole Alliance. And we do so not to provoke a conflict but to prevent a conflict. What we do is defensive, it's prudent, its measured, but it is necessary, because we see the aggressive actions of Russia against Ukraine, and therefore allies also how to make sure that there is no room for any misunderstanding about that Russia can’t do anything like that against a NATO allied country.

NATO Spokesperson: National Public Radio.

Teri Schultz (NPR): Thank you. Teri Schultz with NPR and DW. Mr. Secretary General, in the in the NAC statement, you say that we're deploying additional defensive land and air forces to the eastern part of the Alliance additional maritime assets and increase the readiness of forces. Is this now today, more forces being sent as a result of the fact that the invasion has now happened, or are you there referring to what has already been done as reinforcements? I understand SACEUR will now have the ability to assemble the VJTF without coming back to the NAC for approval. Finally, are you still willing to sit down with President Putin or other representatives of the Russian government after this, or are you suspending your offer to hold talks on other issues and the NATO Russia Council? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: This invasion does not come as a surprise. We have warned against this for months and sadly what happened this morning during the night was something that allied security and intelligence services have predicted for a long time. We have tried to prevent it by calling Russia to engage in diplomatic efforts, by telling Russia that there will be severe costs or economic sanctions if they invade Ukraine further. But what happened over the last hours demonstrates that Russia, despite our diplomatic efforts and despite our clear messages of economic sanctions, decided to once again invade Ukraine.

But since we have been warning against this for a long period of time, we are also taking prudent measures to prepare ourselves. That is the reason why we, over the last months and weeks, have significantly increased the presence of NATO troops in the eastern part of the Alliance. More land troops, ground forces, but also air and naval forces. In the coming days and weeks, they will come even more.

We will further increase, and we are increasing, our presence in the Eastern part of the Alliance and today we activated NATO's defence plans that gives our military commanders more authority to move forces and to deploy forces when needed, and of course this could also be elements of the NATO Response Force. So we are ready, we are adjusting our posture, but what we do is defensive, is measured and we do not seek confrontation. We want to prevent a conflict and any attack against any NATO allied country.

(Inaudible follow up question from reporter)

Well, we have reached out to Russia for weeks and months and what we have seen is that the Russian message has been that they actually have never taken these talks seriously. Because while we were trying to find a political solution, they were planning for this invasion. While we were trying to find a political solution, they were actually day by day, week by week, increasing their military presence and readiness on the borders of Ukraine, and now the launched invasion. Russia has shut the door to a political solution. We regret that, but that's sadly the reality, which has severe and very serious consequences for the people of Ukraine, but also actually impacts the security for all of us. And that's the reason why we step up our presence in eastern part of the Alliance.

NATO Spokesperson: FAZ.

Thomas Gutschker (FAZ): Thanks a lot for taking the question. Secretary General, I have actually two questions. The first one I'd like to hear your reaction to what President Putin said this morning when he announced the military operations. He said that any country that interferes with them would face consequences greater than you have seen in your history, which I take as a veiled threat with a nuclear attack. So please, what is your response to that? He did not specify what interference means. And the second question, very simple; can the NATO Russia Founding Act be upheld under these circumstances? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: The threatening rhetoric by President Putin and the aggressive actions by Russia, of course is the reason why we are saying that we're now faced with a new normal for our security.

We need to consult closely all allies, and we will also do that tomorrow when the leaders meet at the virtual Summit. What does this mean for our longer-term relationship with Russia? How shall we continue to defend and protect Allies in this new security reality? How can we make sure that we uphold the values we believe in; freedom, democracy, faced with a more aggressive authoritarian regime in Moscow? A regime which is willing to openly contest our values and to threat and actually also to use force to try to coerce other nations. This will have some long term effects on our security, on how we respond, on how NATO is reacting and also on how our relationship with Russia can evolve.

We don't have all the answers today, but there will be a new reality, it will be in New Europe after the invasion we saw today. Therefore I welcome the fact that we are so closely coordinating, so closely working together in NATO. We stood together in warning against the Russian aggression, the plans, we stood together in reaching out to Russia and tried to prevent the attack and now we need to stand together in responding to the attack and that's exactly what we are doing. That was the first question the second question?

(Inaudible question from reporter).

Well, that's part of this new reality we have to look into, and there will be a different reality and we need to respond but this is not the day to draw the conclusions. We will have an important discussion among leaders tomorrow.

NATO Spokesperson: NRK.

Simen Ekern (NRK): Thank you for the question. Mr. Secretary General, today Ukraine has called on Turkey to close the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles straits for Russian vessels, is that an action that was discussed in this morning's meeting and are there other similar actions that have been discussed today?

NATO Secretary General: That was not discussed in the meeting today. Turkey is of course a NATO ally, Turkey has a special role when it comes to the Bosphorus straits. But this was not an issue in the meeting this morning.

What we discussed this morning was the need to activate the defence plans. We made the decision to activate those plans, which enables to move forces more quickly, to where they are needed. And also to agree a statement where we express a very strong condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and also announced that we are going to have a virtual NATO summit tomorrow.

NATO Spokesperson: Wall Street Journal.

Dan Michaels (The Wall Street Journal): Could you talk a little bit more about the activation of the defence plan? What exactly does this change? And when was the last time this was done? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: These plans are plans we have developed over the years to make sure that we have plans in place to react to crisis like the crisis we are faced with now. They are defensive plans. They are prudent plans and they are plans that covers the whole east of our Alliance; from the Bering Sea down to the Mediterranean and they give our military commanders some more authorities within politically defined guidelines and frameworks to deploy forces where they deem it needed and that's exactly what we have agreed today. These again are defensive plans, ensuring that we have forces at sufficient readiness at the right places throughout Europe.

NATO Spokesperson: Associated Press.

WSJ reporter intervenes with a follow up question: Have they ever been activated before?

I don't know whether it's right for me to answer that question, because I don't know whether it has been made public before, so I only said that we activated them today.

NATO Spokesperson: Associated Press.

Mark Carlson (Associated Press): Is the NATO Response Force inside Ukraine right now?

NATO Secretary General: No, there are no NATO combat troops inside Ukraine at all. We have made it clear that we do not have any plans and intentional deploying NATO troops to Ukraine. What we have made clear is that we have already increased and we are increasing the presence of NATO troops in the Eastern part of the Alliance on NATO territory.

Ukraine is a highly valued partner. We have supported Ukraine for many, many years. We helped them to build a more modern capable armed force. Militarily, we have helped them to train equip, and in many different ways to strengthen their armed forces. We helped them with cyber defences with NATO Allies in different ways. But we don't have NATO troops in Ukraine, and we don't have any plans to send NATO troops into Ukraine. But we are there to protect and defend all NATO Allies. So we support Ukraine. We provide absolute security guarantees for NATO Allies. And we demonstrate that commitment by increasing the presence in the Eastern part of the Alliance.

NATO Spokesperson: We will try to take a couple of questions online before we come back to the Press Room. We will go to Steven Erlanger from New York Times.

Steven Erlanger (New York Times): spill over Thank you, Secretary General, two quick questions. One, does NATO still have military deconfliction contacts with Russian forces today, are those ongoing? And secondly, a lot of NATO countries are going to want to keep supplying weapons to Ukraine. Do you foresee this as a major risk of a NATO-Russia conflict? And where else do you see risk of conflict now between Russia and NATO countries that could spill over into something worse? Thank you, Sir.

NATO Secretary General: We have increased the presence in Eastern part of the Alliance and we have activated NATO defence plans today to make sure that we do not see any spill over to NATO territory. Because as long as Russia knows that an attack on a NATO Ally will trigger a response from the whole Alliance, they will not attack because we are the strongest Alliance in history and as long as we stand together and make clear that we are committed by our collective defence commitments. That is the best way to prevent any attack, any spill over from the tragedy, the heinous attack we see in Ukraine, a spill over onto any NATO Allied country.

NATO Allies have provided support to Ukraine in many different ways over the last years. Especially since 2014, NATO has helped them with cyber defences, we have also helped them with some different trust funds, with different activities and then on top of that, with different capacity building measures to help them to strengthen, including their naval forces and other elements of their armed forces. But then on top of what NATO has done, as an Alliance, NATO Allies have also provided military equipment, including defensive weapons and other types of support and training. It will be a national decision in what way Allies continue to provide support. So that is for individual NATO Allies to decide. Deconfliction is extremely important for us. There has been contacts between our military commanders and Russia. We will continue to reach out to them to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure deconfliction.

NATO Spokesperson: We will next go to Helsingin Sanomat - Teija Sutinen.

Teija Sutinen (Helsingin Sanomat): Yes, this is Teija Sutinen from the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. What is your message to the Partnership countries Finland and Sweden in the situation? At least in Finland, this discussion about the possible NATO membership, is this realistic during a crisis? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: Finland and Sweden are very close partners and I have taken careful note of the very clear message, both from Finland and Sweden. That even though they don't apply for membership now, they strongly believe that NATO should not sign any kind of agreement with Russia, based on what Russia has proposed for us to sign a legally binding agreement ending any enlargement of NATO in the future. So I have seen that Sweden and Finland state that for them this is a question of self-determination and the sovereign right to choose your own path and then potentially in the future, also to apply for NATO membership.

So for me, the very clear messages from Finland or Sweden just has underpinned how important it is that NATO Allies do not compromise on core values, including the right for every nation to choose its own path, meaning whether it wants to belong to NATO or not belong to NATO. NATO respects those decisions regardless if it's yes or no to joining NATO.

We very much value the close partnership with Finland and Sweden. It is important for NATO, it is important for Finland and Sweden. I visited Finland and Sweden this fall, together with the North Atlantic Council and we see how closely we work together, exercise together, increase our ability to operate together for interoperability, and we have very close political consultations. Therefore, I have invited Sweden and Finland to the virtual NATO Summit tomorrow. At the NATO Summit tomorrow, we will have Sweden and Finland, and the two EU presidents present showing in a way, the very strong unity with demonstration of transatlantic NATO and also our close partnership with EU, Finland and Sweden.

NATO Spokesperson: We will go to Polish Radio.

Beata Płomecka (Polish Radio): If I may, a follow up question to Terry’s question; when exactly these high readiness element of the NATO Response Force may be deployed? Is that up to the leaders if you conveyed the summit for tomorrow, thank you.

NATO Secretary General: First of all, we have already deployed thousands of troops. For instance to Poland there are more US forces, there are more forces from the United Kingdom and there are also other nations deploying more forces to Poland and also to other countries in the eastern part of the Alliance. More ships in the Baltic Sea and more planes conducting air policing and protecting our airspace. So, this is going on and there will be more forces in the east of the Alliance over the next days and weeks. This could include elements of the NATO Response Force, but the most important thing is not exactly which elements or which forces, but the most important thing for Poland and for the other allies in Eastern part of the Alliance, is that there are more NATO forces in the East and there is and there will be even more NATO forces in the East in the coming days and weeks.

NATO Spokesperson: Final question to TV2.

Elin Sørsdahl (TV2 Norway): Thank you for the question. Secretary General, you have received apparently very good intelligence in recent weeks, you have shared it, you have been open about it. Do you have any information of the Russian plans ahead?

NATO Secretary General: Our intelligence has been very precise because it has predicted the over now several months the military buildup, but also the intentions, the plans for Russia to attack Ukraine. But of course those plans could always be changed and we continue to call on Russia to change this course and to not attack. And then you saw this morning that they attacked. That was no surprise because that was exactly what our intelligence services have predicted over several months. We have shared that intelligence to mainly try to prevent Russia from attacking. We have shared intelligence not only about the military buildup, but also about all the different attempts by Russia to create a pretext, staged situations that they can use as an excuse. These absolutely false claims of genocide against Russians or the alleged sabotage actions inside Russia and so on. It is false. It is staged. But we expose those attempts because we hoped that that could reduce the risk of a military invasion.

We have seen that they have sticked to their plans, they have done as they actually planned for a long time ago. And we need to understand that throughout all these weeks and months, when they said that they had no plans of invading Ukraine, they had plans and they were not only having plans but they actually built up all these forces with one clear aim and that was to invade Ukraine. And despite that, they were telling us, and the world and the public, that we have no plans to invade Ukraine. Yes, they had plans and now we are seeing that actually they were serious about invading Ukraine all the time. Never serious about really engaging in diplomatic efforts.

What we see now is a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine from many multiple directions. We see air, land and naval forces taking part in those attacks. It's too early, we don't have a full damage assessment yet, but this is extremely serious. It's an attack on a peaceful, sovereign, independent nation. It is a war of a type and a scale that we actually thought was part of history in Europe, but now it's back in real and it's imposing enormous suffering on innocent people in Ukraine.

NATO Spokesperson: Thank you very much. This concludes this press conference. Thank you",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_192408.htm

Vladimir Putin keeps moving his pieces in a very dangerous chess game that is putting Ukrainian lives in in mortal danger. During a what appears to be a previously recorded speech on Russian state television, the president of Russia announced that his country is set to undertake a special military operation to demilitarise the area. He also claimed that the Ukrainian government has been supporting nazis and he has a clear objective of eliminating all nazi sympathizers. Although Putin did say that Russia doesn't plan to occupy the country of Ukraine, he did call on all soldiers to lay down their weapons and head home if they don't want to suffer the consequences. Putin also sent a stern warning to all outside countries to not interfere in his decision or this could escalate to an even greater conflict.

15:53/ 23:53 GMT - Zelensky: ""Ukraine ahs been left alone"".

In an address to his people, President Zelensky confirmed that no country wants to offer military aid to Ukraine. He also said that NATO is afraid of making them part of the coalition due to fears of a global war. ""Who is ready to guarantee Ukraine's accession to NATO? Honestly, everyone is afraid. I asked all the partners of the state if they are with us. They are with us, but they are not ready to take us into an alliance with them. No matter how many conversations I had with foreign leaders, I heard a few things. The first is that we are supported. I am grateful to each state that helps us concretely, not just in words. But there is a second - we are left alone to defend our state. Who is ready to fight with us? Honestly - I do not see. Today I asked the 27 leaders of Europe whether Ukraine will be in NATO, I asked directly. Everyone is afraid, does not answer. And we are not afraid, we are not afraid of anything.""

Presiden Joe Biden's response to Russia's attack on Ukraine.

In a quick response to this attack on Ukraine, here is President Joe Biden's full statement directly from the White House press core: ""The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.""

""I will be monitoring the situation from the White House this evening and will continue to get regular updates from my national security team. Tomorrow, I will meet with my G7 counterparts in the morning and then speak to the American people to announce the further consequences the United States and our Allies and partners will impose on Russia for this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security. We will also coordinate with our NATO Allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the Alliance. Tonight, Jill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of Ukraine.""

19:20 PT - Russia drops the first bombs in central Kyiv.

At around 19:20 Pacific Standard time, Vladimir Putin ordered the first major strikes that were heard all over the major city of Kyiv. This CNN reporter was close to the first bangs that were heard.

What does Russia want from Ukraine?

Putin has said that the expansion of NATO is ""menacing"", so the fact that Ukraine could join the European Union and join NATO is a concern for the Russian president. In December of 2021, Russia demanded a guarantee that Ukraine would never join NATO and that NATO would order forces in other Eastern European countries to back down, but this hasn't happened. Furthermore, the USA has sold hundreds of anti-tank Javelin missiles to Ukraine in recent years and Turkey has supplied the Ukrainian army with armed drones. (Read more)

What sanctions can the US impose on Russia?

The United States and its allies are coordinating new sanctions on Russia after Moscow's movement recognizing two Ukrainian regions as independent.

European members, including Germany, began considering sanctions in response to Putin's actions:

Banks and Financial Firms

Natural Gas

Individuals

When did Ukraine separate from Russia?

Crimea was originally part of Russia from 1783 until 1954 when the Soviet government transferred the region to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

However no further information of the transfer was made available for the remainder of the Soviet Union, becoming available to the public in 1992 when the Union dissolved.

Since that time Crimea has become a disputed region in its own sense, peaking in interest between Ukraine and Russia in 2014 when Crimea declared itself independent before being annexed by Russia. (Read more)",https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/world-news/2022/02/24/6216fca2ca4741a0458b4599.html
3,efc9318d-a49c-4bae-8316-6def8ba4f8ed,[],2022-02-24 19:20:00+00:00,"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that Russia has launched war on Ukraine and shattered peace on the European continent. “Russia has attacked Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said. “This is a brutal act of war. Our thoughts are with the brave people of Ukraine.”

What Is an Act of War?

An act of war is an aggressive act committed by one state against another. It is most commonly used to refer to hostile actions by a government during peacetime that give other states a justification for declaring war, or casus belli.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg following an extraordinary meeting of the North Atlantic Council (As delivered):

Russia has attacked Ukraine. This is a brutal act of war. Our thoughts are with the brave people of Ukraine.

Sadly, what we have warned against for months has come to pass. Despite all calls on Russia to change course and tireless efforts to seek a diplomatic solution. Peace in our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe, on a scale and of a type we thought belong to history. We have just finished an emergency meeting of the North Atlantic Council to discuss the situation. The Council also addressed the request by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia to hold urgent consultations under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty.

This is a grave moment for the security of Europe.

Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is putting countless innocent lives at risk. With air and missile attacks. Ground forces and special forces from multiple directions. Targeting military infrastructure and major urban centres. This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion. Despite its litany of lies, denials, and disinformation, the Kremlin’s intentions are clear for the world to see. Russia’s leaders bear full responsibility for their reckless actions and the lives lost.

NATO Allies condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms.

This is a blatant violation of international law. An act of aggression against a sovereign, independent and peaceful country. And a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on Russia to immediately cease its military action. Withdraw its forces from Ukraine. And choose diplomacy. We fully support Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. And Ukraine’s right of self-defence. Russia is using force to try to rewrite history. And deny Ukraine its free and independent path.

NATO’s core task is to protect and defend all Allies.

There must be no room for miscalculation or misunderstanding. An attack on one will be regarded as an attack on all. This is our collective security guarantee. Today, the North Atlantic Council decided to activate our defence plans, At the request of our top military commander, General Tod Wolters. This is a prudent and defensive step to protect and shield Allied nations during this crisis. And it will enable us to deploy capabilities and forces, including the NATO Response Force, to where they are needed.

In response to Russia’s massive military build-up, we have already strengthened our collective defence. On land, at sea, and in the air.

In the last weeks, Allies from North America and Europe have deployed thousands of more troops to the eastern part of the Alliance. And placed more on standby. We have over 100 jets at high alert, protecting our airspace. And more than 120 Allied ships at sea, from the High North to the Mediterranean.

All this shows that our collective defence commitment Article 5 is ironclad. And we will continue to do whatever is necessary to shield the Alliance from aggression. I have called a virtual Summit of NATO leaders tomorrow, to address the way forward. Russia is now facing severe costs and consequences imposed by the whole international community.

The Kremlin’s aim is to re-establish its sphere of influence. Rip up the global rules that have kept us all safe for decades. And subvert the values that we hold dear. This is the new normal for our security.

Peace cannot be taken for granted.

Freedom and democracy are contested by authoritarian regimes.

And strategic competition is on the rise.

We must respond.

With renewed resolve.

And even stronger unity.

North America and Europe, together in NATO.

We are an Alliance of 30 democracies. Standing as one,

We will protect our people and our values.

Democracy will always prevail over autocracy.

Freedom will always prevail over oppression.

We are NATO #WEARENATO

4,efc9318d-a49c-4bae-8316-6def8ba4f8ed,[],2022-02-24 13:08:51+00:00,"Russian troops launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Thursday as President Vladimir Putin warned the world that any attempt to interfere would lead to “consequences you have never seen”.

Kremlin soldiers have now broken through into the Kyiv region and launched artillery strikes on the capital, according to Ukrainian officials.

Air raid sirens rang across the capital this afternoon as Kyiv braces for bombardment. Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless involved in essential work and to be ready to evacuate the city.

It comes after Russian troops landed in the southern port cities of Odessa and Mariupol in the early hours of Thursday morning to launch a full-scale invasion.

Kremlin border guards released security camera footage showing a line of Russian military vehicles entering Ukrainian territory from Russian-annexed Crimea in the dead of night.

Attacks were also launched from neighbouring Belarus to the north of Ukraine and the Black Sea to the south, in a planned offensive on Ukraine from all sides.

President Putin addressed the nation shortly before 6am Moscow time, telling the Russian public that he was launching a “military operation” in Ukraine.

The address is widely thought to have been pre-recorded, coinciding with explosions just outside the major cities of Ukraine — which is one hour behind Moscow — at around 5am (3am GMT).

Kyivites were awoken shortly after 5am with the sound of at least seven distant explosions, thought to be directed at Ukraine’s military assets and infrastructure.

Russia attacked Ukraine

There were reports of sunrise missile strikes across Ukraine, including at military command centres in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol at around 5.45am local time.

Ukraine’s military stated that Russia launched more than 30 strikes on civilian and military infrastructure on Thursday morning using a range of weaponry including Kalibr cruise missiles.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter at around 6.30am that Russia had launched a “full-scale invasion” of Ukraine and was targeting cities with weapons strikes.

All passengers and staff were evacuated from Kyiv’s Boryspil International Airport and all flights from the country have now been cancelled.

Mr Kuleba said: “Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”

The Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine’s entire air defence system by the early morning as European authorities declared Ukrainian air space an active conflict zone.

The Russian claims could not be independently verified but Ukraine’s air-defence system dates back to the Soviet era and is little match for Russia’s large inventory of high-powered precision weapons.

The attacks consolidated fears that Mr Putin has his eyes set on the whole country, though fighting remains heaviest in eastern Ukraine, which has been the centre of fighting in recent weeks — and indeed years.

Images showing an attack on a military airbase in Chuguev in eastern Ukraine have been verified by Sky News and the BBC.

Russian-backed separatists said at around 7am that they had launched major offensives on the Ukrainian-controlled town of Shchastia in the Luhansk province and against Ukrainian forces along line of contact in Donetsk, the two regions that Mr Putin earlier this week declared as independent republics.

Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, announced shortly afterwards that the country had cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law.

He issued a call to arms to Ukrainians on Thursday morning, announcing that weapons would be issued to any Ukrainian who wants one and appealing for blood donations for wounded soldiers.

Mr Zelensky said at least 40 people have already died in combat, including three Ukrainian border guards. A young boy is also reported to have died following intense shelling on an apartment block in the Kharkiv region in the east of the country.

At around 7am Kyiv time, Russia’s ambassador to the UN told an emergency Security Council meeting that Moscow’s military operation against Ukraine was targeting “the junta” in power in Ukraine.

“I wanted to say in conclusion that we aren’t being aggressive against the Ukrainian people but against the junta that is in power in Kyiv,” said Vassily Nebenzia.

Ukraine’s Border Guard Service announced an hour later that it appeared the Russian military was attacking from Belarus as well as the Russian border and the Black Sea in the south.

The announcement sent shockwaves across former Soviet neighbours in Europe. A Polish government spokesperson said the country was seeking reassurances from Nato that the alliance would reinforce its eastern flank.

Black smoke was seen rising over the Ukrainian defence ministry’s intelligence headquarters in central Kyiv shortly after lunchtime on Thursday, although the building appeared intact.

Mr Putin has insisted that his intention is to destabilise Ukraine’s military defences and that he is not seeking an occupation of the country.

However, Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary-General of Nato, said this afternoon that it appeared Russia was attacking “urban centres” across Ukraine and would soon attempt a nationwide takeover.

“Peace on our continent has been shattered. We now have war in Europe on a scale and of a type we thought belonged to history,” he said in an emergency address.

“This is a grave moment for the security of Europe. Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is putting innocent lives at risk,” said Mr Stoltenberg.

He confirmed that Russia is utilising air, land and missile attacks from multiple sites to wreak havoc on the country.

“This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion,” he said. “Despite its litany of lies… the Kremlin’s intentions are clear for the world to see.

“This is a blatant violation of international law. We call on Russia to immediately cease military action and withdraw its forces from Ukraine.”",https://inews.co.uk/news/world/ukraine-invasion-map-where-russia-troops-attack-war-putin-kyiv-explained-1480175
5,efc9318d-a49c-4bae-8316-6def8ba4f8ed,[],,"AFP: China has consistently refrained from condemning Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine. Now that President Putin has begun an invasion. Will China finally condemn Russia’s actions?

Hua Chunying: China is closely monitoring the latest developments. We call on all sides to exercise restraint and prevent the situation from getting out of control.

Global Times: According to reports, Beijing-based Qi An Pangu lab released a report on February 23. It found that Equation, the hacking group under the US National Security Agency (NSA), has been creating a top-of-the-line backdoor and conducting a decade-long cyber attack operation called “Telescreen” (Bvp47) against 45 countries and regions, including China, Russia, Japan, the ROK, India, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Thailand, Egypt and Brazil. The operation covers such industries as communications, universities, research institutions, economic and military sectors. Some of the attacks even use Japan as a springboard to attack other countries. As we understand, this is the first time that a Chinese cybersecurity lab has publicly exposed the complete chain of technical evidence about the cyber attack launched by the NSA. Do you have any comment?

Hua Chunying: We noted relevant news reports and the technical report. We express grave concern over the irresponsible, malicious cyber activities exposed by the report and strongly urge the US to offer an explanation and immediately stop such activities. China will take necessary measures to uphold China’s cybersecurity and interests.

According to the report, Equation, a hacking group affiliated with the NSA, has conducted cyber attacks against Chinese communications, scientific research departments and economic sectors for more than a decade. Previously, Chinese cybersecurity company 360 also released a report to expose that APT-C-39, a cyber attack organization of the US government, has launched large-scale attacks on China, which could cause serious leak of massive personal information and data, business secrets and intellectual property and undermine the security of China’s critical infrastructure. It is worth noticing that relevant attacks date back to as early as 2005, and last until 2015 and beyond. We cannot help but ask whether the US is sincere about implementing the consensus on cybersecurity reached with China in 2015.

The US intelligence law allows the US government to carry out massive and indiscriminate information and data theft including on its allies. Edward Snowden and Wikileaks have exposed how the US government engaged in large-scale surveillance and theft of secrets all around the world. The revelations from this report show that besides China and other major developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, the US doesn’t even spare its allies and partners, and its cyber attacks even cover its European allies, its fellow members of the Quad and the Five Eyes. At present, the US is actively seeking bilateral and multilateral cybersecurity cooperation globally in the name of helping other countries to improve capability. One cannot help but wonder what is its real intention.

Cyberspace is a shared homeland for humanity and cybersecurity is a common challenge faced by all countries. We hope the US will take a responsible attitude and uphold peace and security in cyberspace through dialogue and cooperation with all parties.

Bloomberg: Can you say then China considers Russia’s action an invasion? Is it an invasion? Is it a violation of the UN Charter?

Hua Chunying: We have stated China’s principled position on the Ukraine issue. There is a complex historical background and context on this issue. The current situation is the result of the interplay of various factors.

We noted that today Russia announced its launch of a special military operation in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s defense ministry said that its armed forces will not conduct missile, air or artillery strikes on cities. China is closely monitoring the latest developments and calls on all sides to exercise restraint and prevent the situation from getting out of control.

I would like to stress once again China’s consistent position. We should pursue common, cooperative and sustainable security for all countries. The legitimate security concerns of all sides should be respected and resolved. We hope all sides will keep the door to peace open and continue to work for deescalation through dialogue, consultation and negotiation and prevent further escalation.

CCTV: Speaking on the Ukraine issue, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that China should respect the principle of state sovereignty and territorial integrity and that China has an obligation to urge Russia to “back down”. He also said the growing relationship between China and Russia is concerning. The two sides’ joint statement shows that China is trying to use its influence on Russia to create a world order both want. Do you have any comment?

Hua Chunying: I noted the remarks by the US State Department spokesperson.

First, when it comes to respect for state sovereignty and territorial integrity, I’m afraid the US is in no position to tell China off. The Chinese people have deep understanding and strong feelings about state sovereignty and territorial integrity through first-hand experience. Recent history saw China invaded by the Eight-Power Allied Forces and other colonialist powers, which left behind indelible poignant memories of national humiliation. Just a little more than 20 years ago, the Chinese embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was hit by NATO bombing, which killed three Chinese journalists and injured many more. NATO still owes the Chinese people a debt of blood. Even today, China still faces a realistic threat from the US flanked by its several allies as they wantonly and grossly meddle in China’s domestic affairs and undermine China’s sovereignty and security on issues including Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan. China remains the only permanent member of the Security Council that has yet to realize complete national reunification. It is because of all these that China consistently and firmly uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and basic norms governing international relations, firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and territorial integrity, and firmly defend international equity and justice.

If we look at the US, during its nearly 250 years of history, there were only 20 years when it was not conducting military operations overseas. The pretexts it used can be democracy or human rights or simply a test tube of laundry powder or even fake news. Such a country’s understanding of respect for state sovereignty and territorial integrity is definitely different from ours. The international community can see this very clearly.

The US side suggests that Russia acted with complicit support from China. I don’t believe Russia would be too pleased to hear that. Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and an independent major power. It is fully capable of formulating and implementing its diplomatic strategy independently based on its judgement and national interests.

I must also stress that China-Russia relations are based on the foundation of non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of any third party. This differs fundamentally and essentially from the practice of the US, which is, ganging up to form small cliques and pursuing bloc politics to create confrontation and division based on ideology. China has no interest in the friend-or-foe dichotomous Cold War thinking and the patchwork of so-called allies and small cliques and has no intention to follow such a path.

As to the China-Russia joint statement, I suggest the US side give it some further study. China and Russia aim to strengthen strategic communication and coordination, firmly uphold the international system with the UN’s central coordinating role in international affairs, and firmly safeguard the international order based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law. This shows exactly that China and Russia are acting responsibly and positively maintaining international strategic security and stability.

ITV News: Despite the scenes that we have seen from Ukraine this morning, you seem to suggest that peace is still possible. Does President Xi plan to phone his close friend President Putin and appeal for some calm and potential diplomatic solution?

Hua Chunying: The door to peace should never be shut casually. Even with the latest developments in Ukraine, we still call on all sides concerned to exercise restraint and take constructive steps to ease the situation as soon as possible and prevent the situation from getting out of control.

China consistently holds that all sides should respect and take seriously each other’s legitimate security concerns and strive to resolve regional hotspot issues peacefully through negotiation and consultation. Yesterday I shared the efforts made by China to promote a peaceful settlement of the Ukraine issue. President Xi Jinping, during a phone call with French President Macron, called on all sides to adhere to the direction of political resolution, assume their responsibility and work for peace. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi also stressed the importance of this.

CCTV: ROK Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong reportedly expressed deep concerns over Japan’s move to have a group of gold mines on Sado Island listed as a world heritage site in a meeting with UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay in Paris on February 22, stressing that the island is linked to the forced labor of Koreans. Director-General Azoulay said UNESCO fully understood Seoul’s concerns and will continue to follow how Japan honors its pledge made in a previous bid. Does China have any comment?

Hua Chunying: China’s position on Japan’s forced recruitment of laborers is consistent and clear. We fully understand and support the ROK’s attitude. Forced recruitment and enslavement of laborers is a grave crime committed by the Japanese militarism during its overseas aggression and colonial rule. It shall not be denied or whitewashed in any way. In a similar bid previously, Japan admitted that there was forced labor at some of the sites involving workers from China, the Korean Peninsula and other Asian countries, and promised to set up an information center to display historical records and honor the victims, but it never fulfilled the promise. Now again ignoring the painful memories of its neighbors, Japan is trying to make a similar new bid. Naturally other sides will question its true intention.

Japan should face up to and reflect upon history, adopt an honest and responsible attitude and take concrete actions to properly handle issues left over from history, lest it should further lose the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community.

AFP: During yesterday’s press conference, the Foreign Ministry criticized the United States for raising tensions and creating panic. Do the events of the last 24 hours show that Americans’ warnings are justified? And should China have heeded such warnings and asked its citizens to leave Ukraine?

Hua Chunying: The US has been increasing tensions and hyping up war for some time. Do you know how many arms and ammunition the US has sent to Ukraine?

If all parties had done more to promote peace, showed more respect and accommodation for each other’s security concerns, and reasonably and properly resolved the issue to enable a soft landing, what the situation would have been today? The US signaled that Russia would launch large-scale invasion on February 16, and Russia dismissed that as disinformation. Would you like to see the false alarm of the US become a reality, or to see the problems nipped in the bud and not develop to the current point with true care for the Ukrainian people and regional peace and security?

From the very beginning, China has taken a responsible attitude and persuaded all parties not to escalate tensions or incite war. I think what China is doing is very responsible. Those who follow the US’ lead in fanning up flames and then shifting the blame onto others are truly irresponsible. As the culprit, the person who started the fire should think about how to put it out as soon as possible.

CGTN: According to reports, Chinese students in the US have reported being subjected to harassment and interrogation for extended periods of time, and even deportation in some cases. They said that the US side rudely questioned whether they are CPC members, restricted their personal freedom for long periods of time, and refused their requests to contact families and local Chinese embassy and consulates. Do you have any comment on that?

Hua Chunying: China deplores and rejects the US’ vile act of continuous interrogation, harassment and repatriation of Chinese students and discrimination against CPC members. The Chinese side lodged stern representations with the US side every time it learned of such incidents.

The discriminatory and malignant practice of the US gravely violates the basic human rights, fundamental freedoms and lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens pursuing studies in the US and severely undermines the normal people-to-people, cultural and educational cooperation between the two countries. And yet the US styles itself as a “human rights defender” and a “beacon of freedom”. Nothing could be more ironic. Such actions run counter to its statements that “the US welcomes Chinese students” and “we should encourage the younger generation to interact more and be more exposed to each other’s culture”. They also run counter to the shared aspiration of the Chinese and American people for friendly exchanges. The frequent acts by the US aimed at suppressing Chinese students reflect its sinister psyche and are symptoms of its loss of confidence. They will not make the US safer or stronger, but will only hurt its interests, image and reputation.

We urge the US to immediately rectify its mistakes, stop creating ideological confrontation, or even attempt to use it as a pretext to suppress and harass Chinese students and harm the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of the Chinese personnel concerned.

Bloomberg: A question on oil prices. Given the oil prices are rising amid the Ukraine crisis, will China be on board with releasing strategic oil reserves in sync with the United States to quell the gains?

Hua Chunying: We believe that under the current circumstances, all parties should exercise restraint and ease tensions through dialogue and negotiation. Only when the situation stabilizes can spillover effects of various types be prevented. And I also want to say that the world today is not peaceful and there have been enough problems. Truly responsible countries should take responsible actions to jointly safeguard global energy security, maintain security and stability of the global supply and industry chain, and avoid regional tensions that impact the security and stability of the international energy market.

Beijing Youth Daily: China said earlier this month that this year marks the 50th anniversary of Richard Nixon’s visit to China and the signing of the China-US Shanghai Communiqué. China and the US will hold a series of commemorative activities in the near future. We have noticed that the US government has not made any comment on the 50th anniversary of Richard Nixon’s visit to China. US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said on February 23 that the US has no plans at the moment for a statement on the 50th anniversary of Nixon’s visit to China. Do you have any comment? Could you give us more details on what commemorative activities China plans to hold?

Hua Chunying: As to whether the US would issue a statement or why they wouldn’t, you should ask the US side.

Yesterday, I reviewed with you at this podium the main content of the Shanghai Communiqué issued by China and the United States during President Nixon’s visit to China 50 years ago. The one-China principle affirmed in the Shanghai Communiqué, as well as the principles of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, constitute the political foundation for the normalization of China-US relations and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Certain details you are interested in are somehow interesting. It is understandable that the attitude of the US has caused some speculation and associations by correspondents. However, I believe it is all the more necessary and relevant for the US to revisit the spirit and inspiration of the Shanghai Communiqué today when China-US relations are facing difficulties and challenges.

As far as I know, the two sides will hold some commemorative activities together in the near future, and some representatives and guests from both sides will attend. Relevant activities are still being scheduled. If there is any information on the specifics, we will release it in a timely manner.

Hubei Media Group: According to reports, Member of the European Parliament Herve Juvin said that on the crisis between Russia and Ukraine, the US is a fomenter of the conflict and hopes to take advantage of it to control Europe and obstruct European independence on security affairs. He believes that the US wants to sabotage the relations between Russia and the EU and rope the latter in onto the track of confrontation against Russia. Do you have any comment?

Hua Chunying: With regard to the role of the US in the current situation in Ukraine, I noticed that apart from this MEP, some European media have also made their reflections and observations.

Recently the EU, France and Germany have made a lot of efforts through diplomatic mediation in order to ease the tension. The current situation is certainly contrary to Europe’s interests. The European side should indeed think seriously about what is truly conducive to maintaining peace and stability in Europe, and what is the best way to uphold long-term peace and stability in Europe.

AFP: The Russians said they would not attack cities and they announced they were clearly targeting military targets. So is it okay for you to invade another country as long as they are hitting on military targets and not cities? And then you also said that the US has been supplying ammunition to Ukraine. But is it not the right of any sovereign country to buy arms and ammunition wherever it wants in order to protect itself?

Hua Chunying: I’m sure you have noticed that Russia stated that in its special military operation in Ukraine, its armed forces will not conduct any missile of artillery strikes on any Ukrainian city.

As to the definition of “invasion”, it brings us back to how we view the current situation in Ukraine. As we have stated repeatedly, the Ukraine issue has a very complicated historical background and context. The current state of affairs is not what we would hope to see. It’s hoped that all sides will work in concert to give peace a chance and strive to ease the situation as soon as possible through dialogue, consultation and negotiation.

As to the right of sovereign countries to buy arms, I have a question for you. If two people near you are arguing and a fist fight seems to be coming next, what will you do? Hand one of them a gun, a knife or some other sorts of weapon? Or break up the fight with persuasion first and then get to know the whole story leading to the argument and helping them resolve the issue peacefully? It’s as simple as that. Weapons can never solve all problems. This is not the time to pour oil on the flame, but to put our heads together to come up with a way to put out the fire and safeguard peace.

Here is another question. Western media used the word “invasion” for Russia’s operation. When the US took illegal unilateral military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan without the mandate of the UN and caused massive civilian casualties, did you use the word “invasion” or some other word?

Anadolu Agency: But according to Russian Defense Ministry’s statement, Russian army targeted air defenses of Ukraine this morning. So it’s usually considered as the start of an invasion. If this happens, will China see this as an aggression and an attack on a sovereign state?

Hua Chunying: China is closely following the development of the situation. The current situation in Ukraine is not what we wish to see. So we continue to call on all parties to exercise restraint and resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation as soon as possible so as to ease the tension.

Beijing Daily: It is reported that Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen said that the China Initiative is “not the right approach”. The Initiative lowers the threshold of the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute China-related criminal acts, and applies different standards based on race, ethnicity or family relations. The DOJ is ending the China Initiative, but will continue to prioritize handling and proactively fight back any actions that harm US citizens and institutions, which requires a new set of comprehensive counter measures. Do you have any comment?

Hua Chunying: The so-called China Initiative is the poisonous legacy of the previous administration, and should have been abolished long ago.

Facts have proven that the Initiative is in essence a tool for a handful of anti-China forces in the US to abuse the concept of national security and go all out to contain and suppress China. It exacerbates racial discrimination in the US, severely harms Asian-American groups, and also poisons the atmosphere of China-US mutual trust and cooperation. The Foreign Ministry of China and the Chinese Embassy in the US lodged multiple solemn representations on different levels from the very beginning to urge the US side to stop implementing the Initiative.

The US media have revealed repeatedly that the so-called China Initiative set targets first and carried out investigation accordingly. Such acts, in total disregard of judicial justice, will only result in wrongful convictions. It is reported that over the past two years, most of the so-called China-Related Cases Examples under this initiative did not involve intellectual property or commercial theft. Most of the charges range from fraud to misrepresentation to tax evasion. Nearly 2,000 university scholars across the US signed an open letter to the US Department of Justice in protest of this initiative. More than 20 Asian-American groups in the US sent a joint letter to the US President demanding the end of this Initiative. Not long ago, the United Chinese Americans protested outside the US DOJ demanding the end of China Initiative. A total of 192 Yale professors wrote and signed a letter to the Attorney General pointing out that the strategy has “fundamental flaws”. With all these voices against this initiative, it is clear that the initiative finds no support and will hurt the interests of all.

We urge the US side to stop hyping up the so-called China threat, stop seeing China as an imaginary enemy, stop smearing and suppressing China with fabricated pretexts, and stop disrupting and undermining normal China-US exchange and cooperation in all sectors, to root out the poisonous legacy of the former administration and do more to promote the steady development of China-US relations, and mutual trust and cooperation.

CNBC: China is a trading partner of Ukraine and Russia. On Tuesday, I saw an announcement that due to the overseas market conditions, China may be buying more edible oils. And also we just saw the Customs bureau said China can import wheat from Russia. Given the current situation, does China have any plans to increase or decrease trade with each of these countries?

Hua Chunying: China will continue to carry out normal trade cooperation with Russia and Ukraine in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.

AFP: Has China spoken to the Ukrainian side in the last 24 hours or so since military operations began? Specifically, has China spoken to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, or does it plan to do so?

Hua Chunying: All parties are very busy now. We are closely following the development of the situation and continue to call on all parties to exercise restraint and commit to easing the tension through dialogue and negotiation as soon as possible to prevent the situation from getting out of control.

Reuters: Has China provided Russia with any military equipment, or does it plan on providing any military or otherwise support for Russia during this conflict?

Hua Chunying: On this issue, there is a fundamental difference between China and the US. When we see the risk of conflict, we won’t do the same as the US, who has offered Ukraine a large amount of military equipment. I believe that as a strong country, Russia doesn’t need China or other countries to provide weapons to it.

AFP: Just earlier, you mentioned the mediation efforts by France and Germany in this dispute. Now these two countries have very clearly condemned Russia’s action. Don’t you think this is proof that negotiating efforts are useless, and the only thing to make Russia move back is the very strong condemnation from the whole international community, including China?

Hua Chunying: For some time, some European countries including France and Germany have conducted mediation. The Ukraine issue is very complex. Dr. Kissinger made some public observations on Ukraine more than seven years ago. He said, if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it must not be either side’s outpost against the other — it should function as a bridge between the East and the West.

An outsider is clear-minded. All parties of the international community should calmly learn about the historical merits of the evolving Ukraine issue. On this basis, they should work to ease the situation as soon as possible through dialogue and negotiation, prevent the situation from getting out of control and peacefully resolve the issue. Europe should think over what kind of security landscape best meets its interests.

You mentioned condemning Russia. I’m not sure whether the friends of a certain country have done their best to prevent it from going down the wrong path before there was no turning back when it set the fire and fanned the flames. No one wishes to see or stands to benefit from the current situation. We hope all parties can work together, and call on relevant parties to exercise restraint to prevent the situation from further spiraling out of control.

Reuters: You just said we hope for all sides to calm down and prevent escalation. We know China has said this many times. Will China call on Russia to withdraw?

Hua Chunying: We call on all relevant parties concerned to exercise restraint.

AFP: You mentioned the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. I’m quite sure my agency at that time spoke about invasion. So yesterday you mentioned what has happened in Iraq was the US violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. Now how come you are not able to say the same thing about Ukraine? Can you explain to us what’s the difference between the situation in Ukraine and the situation in Iraq? Is there a case of double standard? Is it okay for Russia to invade Ukraine and not okay for the US to invade Iraq?

Hua Chunying: “Double standard” can never be pinned on China because our position is aboveboard. China always believes that all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be jointly upheld. These are our longstanding principles and basic norms governing international relations that should be followed by all countries.

At the same time, China believes that one country’s security cannot be at the expense of others’ security; still less should one country flagrantly undermine others’ sovereign security for his absolute security advantage. All countries’ legitimate security concerns should be respected.

You should know the whole story of Iraq. The then US Secretary of State launched military attacks on Iraq with a vial of detergent and a trumped-up charge and plunged the Iraqi people into grave disasters. This constitutes out-and-out invasion, which is a consensus of the international community.

You must have read President Putin’s remarks. I’m not the Spokesperson for Russian Foreign Ministry, and will not speak for their position. But I suppose, outsiders should uphold objectivity and fairness, and see the complex historical merits as well as their interplay and evolution on the Ukraine issue.

An unbiased mediator should not only see what is happening at the moment but also the whole story. He should not only treat the symptom but also the root cause. That is why China has been calling on all parties concerned to exercise restraint and stay committed to resolving the issue through dialogue and negotiation.

Reuters: Does China believe Ukraine is a sovereign country?

Hua Chunying: Ukraine is for sure a sovereign country. China and Ukraine conduct friendly cooperation on the basis of mutual respect.

Reuters: How many Chinese citizens are currently in Ukraine? And what is the latest instruction that China is planning on giving them?

Hua Chunying: I don’t have the specific number of Chinese citizens in Ukraine at the moment. China’s Embassy in Ukraine has issued a security alert. Given the current situation, we remind Chinese citizens and companies to protect their own safety and prevent accidents and injuries. The Chinese Embassy in Ukraine is also in touch with our students and the Chinese business council in Ukraine, reminds them to keep following information from the embassy, and alerts Chinese citizens in Ukraine not to travel to unstable regions. Besides, the embassy also calls on Chinese citizens in Ukraine to demonstrate Chinese people’s fine tradition of working in solidarity and offering each other help. If anyone is in trouble, we hope others can lend a helping hand and give each other warmth during trying times. The embassy also reminds Chinese citizens not to panic. Anyone in trouble will receive all-out assistance from the Chinese embassy.

Reuters: Did Vladimir Putin tell China that he will invade Ukraine when he visited China a few weeks ago?

Hua Chunying: On February 4, President Putin visited China for the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics and held a meeting with President Xi Jinping. The readout has been released, which you may refer to carefully.

As I said just now, Russia is an independent major country. It independently decides and implements its diplomacy and strategy based on its strategic judgement and interests. Russia does not need to get others’ consent before making diplomatic decisions and taking actions.

AFP: Are there any other circumstances whatsoever under which China would condemn Russia’s actions in Ukraine? Specifically, what will Russia do to see condemnation from China?

Hua Chunying: Why are you obsessed with China’s condemnation?

We have said that the historical merits of the Ukraine issue are very complex. The current situation after evolution is the result of multiple factors at play. The correct way is to learn the whole story and the evolving process objectively before resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation. The security of all countries should be common, comprehensive and sustainable. And only security like this is lasting.

You keep asking when will China join the US and some European countries to condemn Russia. This reminds me that it is the handful of countries you raised, including the US, that have been interfering in China’s internal affairs and attacking China based on disinformation.

In international relations, the last thing one should do is to impose his will on others. One should instead allow all countries to make independent judgement based on the merits of the matter itself.

AFP: China has been accused of committing genocide in Xinjiang, an accusation that has been called “lie of the century”. Now Russia is saying that the genocide of Russians happening in Ukraine is one of the justifications for its invasion in Ukraine. Has Russia showed you any evidence that genocide is happening in Ukraine? And if it’s not the case, are you prepared to say that this is also a lie of the century?

Hua Chunying: I can tell you, I cannot make any comparison between what happens in China’s Xinjiang and eastern Ukraine because I don’t know what happened in the latter. So we’re not going to rush to any conclusions. But I can tell you very clearly, please stop using the word “genocide” when it comes to Xinjiang the next time you write your reports because it is an out-and-out lie of the century. And I have a better right and I am in a better position to brief you on the situation of my own country.

The Chinese government has for numerous times proved to you with facts that the so-called genocide in Xinjiang is the biggest lie of the century. I hope you can listen to what we said. In recent years, more than 2,000 government officials, religious personnel and journalists, including resident foreign correspondents in China, from over 100 countries and organizations have visited Xinjiang. What they see is a peaceful and harmonious Xinjiang with steady development, where people of all ethnic groups enjoy freedom of religious belief in Xinjiang. This are the facts and truth about Xinjiang. I also need to tell you that some preventive deradicalization measures in Xinjiang are similar to the counterterrorism and deradicalization measures like “community correction” in France.

Therefore, I hope that you will not have any prejudice against China on this issue or make groundless accusations against China based on disinformation. It is because some of you have always condemned China on this issue that I am very unhappy to hear you use the word “condemn”. Accusations must be based on facts, and should be used with caution before the full picture is known.

I also hope that after the epidemic, I can find a right opportunity to take you to Xinjiang to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Xinjiang and see what kind of life people there are leading with your own eyes. I think when the truth of Xinjiang and people’s life there spread around the world through your reports, ethnic minorities in many other countries will be very envious of the ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.

AFP: Is there a coincidence between the fact that President Putin was here for the opening of the Olympics and then it seemed that he’s waited until the Olympics to be over to launch offensive acts against Ukraine? Do you think Russia should wait until the end of the Paralympic Games on March 13 before targeting its neighbor?

Hua Chunying: AFP’s imagination is as rich as ever. I can tell you that more than 30 international dignitaries attended the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics in China, including President Putin. The two heads of state exchanged views on China-Russia relations and issues of common concern. We have released relevant information in a timely and detailed manner.

Russia is an independent major country, and it decides its policy and actions independently according to its own strategic judgment and interests. As to the question concerning the timing of Russia’s move, you might have to ask Russia.

The Beijing Winter Olympics was splendid, safe and successful. We believe the Beijing Winter Paralympics will be equally splendid, safe and successful.

Dragon TV: The Washington Post reported on February 23 that the Beijing Winter Olympics was a disaster for broadcaster NBC and the sponsors. Prime-time viewership plummeted more than 40 percent from four years ago, hitting record lows. Do you have any comment?

Hua Chunying: That was according to the Washington Post. I’m not sure NBC would agree. What I have noted is that the CEO of Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) said that the Beijing Winter Olympics is the most watched Winter Olympics with new records in terms of broadcast hours, technology and content. It is also the most viewed Winter Olympics on NBC’s digital platforms. The IOC said that the Games set many records with the widest digital interaction, the longest broadcast hours and the highest viewership at the opening ceremony. The Games saw billions of interactions on digital platforms. During the Games, a record 64 million people followed the events through the Olympic website and APP. The Olympic channel on YouTube was watched by 58 percent more views than the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. On TikTok, hashtag OlympicSpirit videos tallied more than 2.1 billion views.

Against the backdrop of the lingering global pandemic, especially with the rampant Omicron variant, China has honored its commitment as scheduled and presented a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympics to the world. This is a success for the Chinese people and the people of the whole world. We noted that the international community has spoken positively of the Games. IOC President Bach awarded the Olympic Cup to the Chinese people. His deeply moving address at the closing ceremony was received with rounds of applause from the audience. He described Beijing 2022 as a truly exceptional Olympic Winter Games.

If a handful of media outlets or individuals choose deliberately to ignore the excellent events for political reasons and to ignore the uplifting spirit and message for solidarity, peace and cooperation conveyed by the Games, then it’s their loss.

Reuters: Does China think Russia’s action is an invasion of Ukraine? If not, why not?

Hua Chunying: A suggestion for you. You may go ask the US: they started the fire and fanned the flames, how are they going to put out the fire now?

Reuters: Is China satisfied that it’s proactively enough in the effort to achieve peace in Ukraine?

Hua Chunying: We want peace in Ukraine and do not want to see the situation in Ukraine evolve to what it is today. We call on all parties to ease tension through dialogue and exercise restraint. In the meantime, we have to bear in mind that everything happens for a reason. Not only the symptom but also the root cause should be addressed, which calls for the joint efforts of all parties concerned.

You have been latching on to China today. Is China a party directly concerned? Who is the one that started the fire, fanned the flames and added fuel to it? There is a Chinese saying that whoever started the trouble should end it. The Ukraine issue needs to be resolved by the parties directly concerned through negotiations. Some of the words you used could easily remind us of those groundless accusations against China based on a lot of disinformation and rumors, which made us feel uncomfortable and offended.

So I want you to be calm, sensible and restrained. I hope you will join China in calling on all parties to exercise restraint, do more to help put out the fire, and not to let the situation get further out of control.

Reuters: Did the Chinese leader give his blessing for President Putin to attack Ukraine?

Hua Chunying: I find such a way of questioning quite offensive frankly speaking. It exposes a certain stereotype of looking at China with preconceived notions, bias, arrogance and malicious characterization. China is not a direct party to this issue. All we have been doing is promoting peace talks.

Yesterday I shared our observations about all the ins and outs on this matter. President Putin also delivered a detail-rich speech. Why don’t you take some time to read them? Why not cool down, cast aside your entrenched notions, and look at matters from a rational and objective perspective? Who started the fire? Who fanned the flames? Who keeps pouring oil on the flame? It takes the person who started the trouble to end it. The parties directly concerned should be the ones to resolve the issue through negotiation.

Russia is an independent major power and a permanent member of the UN Security Council. It makes foreign policy decisions independently. China’s position is very clear. On regional hotspot issues, we consistently call for peaceful resolution through dialogue, consultation and negotiation.

When countries like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan were hit by illegal military operations, and when the seven billion US dollars of assets of the Afghan people were illegally plundered by the US recently, did you condemn any of it? Did you speak up for fairness and justice? Did you question the US government? That’s why I don’t think your question has the objectivity that a professional journalist’s question should possess. You are not neutral. You subscribe to preconceived notions. As a journalist, you shouldn’t impose your presuppositions on others.

AFP: I understand you feel we are all very emotional about the issue. But I believe when there is war, there is bound to be casualties. What I meant to say is that Albania and the US are preparing a resolution at the UN Security Council, that will be put out tomorrow I guess New York Time, and put to a vote on Friday. Would you mind telling us what China’s vote will be on this resolution?

Hua Chunying: We will handle relevant issues based on China’s consistent position and in keeping with the principles of the UN Charter.",https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/2511_665403/202202/t20220224_10645282.html

27 February 2022

Masks are off. Students have returned to school. Workers are returning to offices. On Monday, university students will return to face to face classes. We are hoping to emerge from a once in a century pandemic. Some of us have been sustained by prayer, having realised daily our mortality and the whole of humanity’s dependence on nature taking its course whatever that might be. We have been grateful for the human ingenuity which has produced the vaccines. We have been grateful for the human organisation which has permitted such a concerted response to the health and economic crisis. Human industry and dependence on our God have seen us through with faith, hope and love.

On Thursday we confronted a new and daunting reality: war across national borders in Europe. The NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced, “We now have war in Europe, on a scale and of a type we thought belonged to history.” Stoltenberg said, “This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion. Despite its litany of lies, denials, and disinformation, the Kremlin’s intentions are clear for the world to see.”[1] Russia’s President Putin had given the order for the invasion of Ukraine. None of us under 73 years of age has lived in a world where there is war between European nations, the initial actors in the two World Wars of last century. We have lived under a world order which set rules for respecting national sovereignty and the integrity of national borders. It has been an imperfect order, but nonetheless, an order which has helped to restrain national aggressions, maintaining peace across national borders, if not always within those borders.

When a country like Iraq invaded a country like Kuwait, there was a prompt international response. Even a leader like Saddam Hussein could be constrained, not because he was a good man, but because there were checks and balances which restrained or punished him. But there are different rules, or perhaps no rules, when the aggressive leader is an autocrat armed not only with nuclear arms but also with a power of veto at the UN Security Council. This week we have heard that such an aggressive leader might be kept in check but only at a distance.

Some nation-states will not be afforded the same international protection from his aggression as others. At least for the moment, the 26 European members of NATO trust that their national borders will be respected. This is the way Stoltenberg put it: “[A]s long as Russia knows that an attack on a NATO Ally will trigger a response from the whole Alliance, they will not attack because we are the strongest Alliance in history and as long as we stand together and make clear that we are committed by our collective defence commitments. That is the best way to prevent any attack, any spill over from the tragedy, the heinous attack we see in Ukraine, a spill over onto any NATO Allied country.” But these words offer absolutely no solace to Ukraine.

The Kenyan UN Ambassador Martin Kimani who holds a doctorate in War Studies from King’s College London gave the whole of Europe and the world a lesson in the immorality of different rules for different nations whether they be the aggressors or the attacked. Reflecting on the Russian attack on Ukraine, he told the UN Security Council: “This situation echoes our history. Kenya and almost every African country was birthed by the ending of empire. Our borders were not of our own drawing. They were drawn in the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris and Lisbon, with no regard for the ancient nations that they cleaved apart.”

Kenya had been under British control since 1895 gaining independence in 1963. Kimani said, “At independence, had we chosen to pursue states on the basis of ethnic, racial or religious homogeneity, we would still be waging bloody wars these many decades later. Instead, we agreed that we would settle for the borders that we inherited, but we would still pursue continental political, economic and legal integration. Rather than form nations that looked ever backwards into history with a dangerous nostalgia, we chose to look forward to a greatness none of our many nations and peoples had ever known.”

He laid down the challenge to all peoples with this declaration: “We believe that all states formed from empires that have collapsed or retreated have many peoples in them yearning for integration with peoples in neighbouring states. This is normal and understandable. After all, who does not want to be joined to their brethren and to make common purpose with them? However, Kenya rejects such a yearning from being pursued by force. We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression.”[2]

Hearing Kimani speak to the UN Security Council and seeing the images of Putin declaring his aggressive intentions behind ever larger, empty desks, I was reminded of Jesus’ words in today’s gospel:

“There is no sound tree that produces rotten fruit, nor again a rotten tree that produces sound fruit. For every tree can be told by its own fruit: people do not pick figs from thorns, nor gather grapes from brambles. A good person draws what is good from the store of goodness in their heart; a bad person draws what is bad from the store of badness. For a person’s words flow out of what fills their heart.”

Scripture scholar Brendan Byrne says, “The image of a tree and its yield of fruit illustrates the continuity that must prevail between heart (the ultimate seat of human quality) and external action. The continuity must flow in the other direction too. Good intentions are no use if not put into practice.”[3]

Seeing peace threatened by partisan interests, Pope Francis has appealed “to those with political responsibility to examine their consciences seriously before God, who is the God of peace and not of war; who is the Father of all, not just of some, who wants us to be brothers and sisters and not enemies”. He prayed “that all the parties involved refrain from any action that would cause even more suffering to the people, destabilising coexistence between nations and bringing international law into disrepute.”[4]

With war, as with a pandemic, we daily face our mortality and the whole of humanity’s dependence on events taking their course whatever that might be. As we confront the real prospect of an expanding theatre of war in Europe across national borders, let’s be assured that human industry and dependence on our God will once again see us through with faith, hope and love.

In international affairs and in our own personal dealings with others, there are many situations that can be kept on track with checks and balances, rules and regulations. But at the edges where the rule of law does not run, there are always situations which will be determined by what is in our hearts, regardless of what others might control or determine. What each of us thinks matters. What each of us says matters. What each of us does matters. The Book of Ecclesiasticus puts it well:

In a shaken sieve the rubbish is left behind,

so too the defects of a person appear in their talk.

The kiln tests the work of the potter,

the test of a person is in their conversation.

The orchard where a tree grows is judged on the quality of its fruit,

similarly a person’s words betray what they feel.

We pray for those who will be killed on both sides of this unjust war. We pray for the families who will suffer needlessly from the consequences of this war, in the wake of the aggression and any necessary responses to it including suffocating sanctions. We pray that our Australian leaders will be generous to those seeking refuge from war not of their making.

Let’s think peace. Let’s talk peace. Let’s pray for peace. Let’s make peace, together in faith, hope and love.
