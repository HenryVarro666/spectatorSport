Mr Obama was making his first public speech at the executive mansion since he left office. He participated in a celebration of the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, as Mr Biden announced changes to the healthcare programme that could see as many as 200,000 uninsured Americans become eligible for new coverage.

The visit has many Democrats hoping that Mr Biden can benefit from his former boss‚Äôs still-high approval rating among the Democratic base. Mr Biden has lately struggled to raise his poor standing in the polls and there are serious worries that apathy and disappointment among Democratic voters could give an opening to Republicans in this year‚Äôs midterm elections. Mr Obama says that to win in the midterms, Democrats have a story to tell, they ‚Äújust got to tell it.‚Äù

ICYMI: Biden extends student loan freeze a sixth time

15:44 , Andrew Naughtie

As Joe Biden remains under pressure from his party to cancel as much federal student loan debt as possible, his administration has once again pushed back the deadline for the resumption of payments frozen during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is the sixth time the deadline‚Äôs been moved, and will give debtors until at least 31 August.

Mr Biden has previously said he supports cancelling the debt altogether through congressional action, but his critics on the left say he has the power to do so unilaterally via executive action.

ICYMI: Cruz bizarrely blames Biden for Ukraine war

The Republican line on Ukraine, Russia and Vladimir Putin is still somewhat unclear, but the party‚Äôs more pugilistic members are sticking to one predictable version of events: blaming the unilateral Russian attack on an American ally on Joe Biden.

Ted Cruz took that line this week on Fox News, telling Sean Hannity that Mr Biden ‚Äúcaused this war‚Äù by waiving sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline ‚Äì which in fact never became operational.

Dire economic warning from major bank

Deutsche Bank has issued a stark forecast for the near future of the US economy, predicting that the country will fall into recession next year. Stocks will fall 20 per cent by next summer, says the bank, and unemployment ‚Äì currently at a remarkable low ‚Äì will rise by more than a percentage point in the next two years.

Coming from a bank, these specific predictions are unlikely to cut through the news cycle to everyday Americans, but the electorate‚Äôs attitude to the economy is hardly optimistic as things stand.

Will Obama and Biden‚Äôs bromance do anything for the Democrats?

10:01 , Andrew Naughtie

The Independent‚Äôs Holly Baxter takes a look at yesterday‚Äôs White House appearance by Barack Obama, writing that it at least provided some welcome emotional warmth at a deeply negative moment...

there is something genuinely touching about the friendship. When Obama surprised Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2017 and Biden became overwhelmed with emotion, it would‚Äôve taken a heart of stone not to be moved. Biden is the kind of man for whom America and its pageantry really does mean everything, a man who spent most of his life shuttling between Scranton, Delaware and DC. Obama gave him the best gift he could ever have received ‚Äî until the country did one better and voted him president, of course. Yet Obama was mostly silent during Biden‚Äôs presidential run, endorsing him late and staying out of the conversation when he was busy debating fellow Democrats. The world was hungry for more from the old bromance, back when politics felt a little simpler. And this week, Uncle Joe and Barack did some fan service.

At the same time, though, she ponders whether the visit can really offer much to Democrats as the president struggles around the 40 per cent approval mark and his agenda faces ongoing obstruction in Congress.

Read her take below.

Obama is doing bromance fan service with Biden. But is it enough?

Analysis: the worst of the KBJ hearings

As the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson draws near, Andrew Feinberg has this look back on the depths that were plumbed at her hearings by the Judiciary Committee‚Äôs Republican contingent and their colleagues on the Senate floor.

‚ÄúRepublican senators,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúspent the majority of their speaking time in both settings airing grievances regarding Democrats‚Äô treatment of prior nominees going back to the Senate‚Äôs rejection of Judge Robert Bork more than three decades ago. They also subjected Jackson, a Harvard Law School graduate who has thrice been confirmed by the upper chamber (twice to court seats and once to a seat on the US Sentencing Commission), to some of the most bizarre inquiries ever directed at a nominee for the highest court in the land.‚Äù
