The Polish president stated: “I am confident that we’ll contribute to the restoration of normalcy and freedom in Ukraine and for Ukraine, for our neighbours.”

The B9 brings together nine NATO countries from Central and Eastern Europe: Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The group was set up in 2015 as an initiative by Poland and Romania.

The Warsaw summit, hosted by the Polish president, was attended by his Lithuanian counterpart Gitanas Nausėda, Estonia's Alar Karis, Slovakia's Zuzana Čaputová, Bulgaria's Rumen Radev, Latvia's Egils Levits, and Hungary's János Áder.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also took part in the Warsaw meeting on Friday.

Czech President Miloš Zeman and Romania’s Klaus Iohannis participated via video link.

NATO leaders call on Russia to withdraw troops from Ukraine

Earlier on Friday, the B9 leaders and the EU's von der Leyen took part in a virtual summit of NATO heads of state and government on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

After the summit, the Western military alliance issued a statement calling the events in Ukraine “the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades.”

The NATO leaders said: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, enabled by Belarus. We call on Russia to immediately cease its military assault, to withdraw all its forces from Ukraine and to turn back from the path of aggression it has chosen.”

They vowed that ""the world will hold Russia, as well as Belarus, accountable for their actions.""

Statement by #NATO Heads of State and Government on Russia's attack on #Ukraine 🇺🇦#StandWithUkraine — NATO (@NATO) February 25, 2022

“We stand in full solidarity with the democratically elected president, parliament and government of Ukraine and with the brave people of Ukraine who are now defending their homeland,” the NATO leaders said in their statement.

They declared: “In light of Russia’s actions, we will draw all the necessary consequences for NATO’s deterrence and defence posture ... We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the Alliance. We will make all deployments necessary to ensure strong and credible deterrence and defence across the Alliance, now and in the future.”

'Freedom will always win over oppression'

“Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory,” the alliance’s leaders also said, adding that their ""commitment to Article 5 of the Washington Treaty is iron-clad.""

Article 5 of the Washington Treaty guarantees collective defence by stating that an armed attack against one NATO member state “shall be considered an attack against them all.”

""We stand united to protect and defend all Allies,"" the NATO leaders further said in their statement.

""Freedom will always win over oppression,” they concluded.

EU sanctions Putin, Lavrov

Also on Friday, European Union foreign ministers, including Poland’s Zbigniew Rau, gathered for an emergency meeting in Brussels to discuss Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and EU sanctions against Moscow, the Polish foreign ministry said.

In the evening, news emerged that EU states agreed to freeze any European assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for swifter and more powerful action to punish Russia's invasion of his country, the Reuters news agency reported.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to take a similar step “imminently,” according to news outlets.

Ukraine-Russia talks?

All these developments came as Russia pressed on with its multi-pronged and full-blown assault on Ukraine, with Russian missiles pounding the capital Kyiv, news agencies reported.

At the same time, there was some indication that both countries could be willing to sit down for talks, according to news reports.

The proposal came from Zelensky, who urged Russia to come to the negotiating table in order “to stop people’s deaths,” the PAP news agency reported.

“Ukraine wants peace and is ready for talks with Russia, including on neutral status regarding NATO,” the Ukrainian president’s advisor, Mykhailo Podolyak, was quoted as saying by Reuters.

The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced later in the day that Russia had accepted the offer, suggesting Minsk, Belarus as the venue for negotiations.

Ukraine had proposed to meet in the Polish capital Warsaw, officials told reporters.

Earlier, Zelensky warned that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine marked the start of “a war against Europe.""

Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin called on the Ukrainian army to overthrow its government and take power into its own hands, nbcnews.com reported.

Council of Europe suspends Russia

The Council of Europe human rights group said on Friday it was suspending Russia’s membership of the organisation, the PAP news agency reported.

According to Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, the move came at the request of Warsaw and Kyiv.

A day earlier, the Council of Europe’s Secretary-General Marija Pejčinović Burić condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The organisation is based in Strasbourg, France and brings together 47 countries, including most European states.

25 Feb 2022 01.35 Ukraine officials expect Russian attack on Kyiv later today Ukraine expects a Russian tank attack on its capital, Kyiv, later on Friday which could become the hardest day in the war, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister said. Anton Herashchenko said the defenders of Kyiv were ready with anti-tank missiles supplied by foreign allies. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister also agreed with the assessment that Russian forces may enter areas just outside Kyiv today. The minister added that Ukrainian army units are defending positions on four fronts despite being outnumbered. A Ukrainian military official also said Ukrainian forces managed to repel Russian troops near Chernihiv.

This coincides with a report from Ukraine’s defence ministry which earlier said airborne assault troops have blown up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, located about 50km (31 miles) north of Kyiv, in an effort to prevent a Russian column of forces from advancing toward the capital. The ministry said the Russian advance was stopped. Київ↘️

25 Feb 2022 00.59 Peter Beaumont The Guardian’s Peter Beaumont in Ukraine’s western city of Lviv has given his report on the current crisis unfolding around Kyiv. On the second day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has become increasingly clear what the Kremlin’s military tactics are: which is very quickly to put pressure on the capital Kyiv. Kyiv is facing threats both from its eastern edges, from the west more generally since the capture of the Chernobyl nuclear plant site, and now, according to Ukrainian officials, from the threat of infiltration into the city. While it’s unclear whether the Russian military intends to capture the Ukrainian capital or force it’s capitulation, a combination of missile attacks, a rapid airborne advance using helicopters to the outskirts, and the continuing advance by Russian armour is putting Kyiv in an increasingly difficult position. The latest update from Ukraine’s General Staff claims that the key Hostomel air base, just outside Kyiv is controlled by Kyiv forces again, however heavy fighting is going on north west of the capital. There are also reports that the Ukrainian military has destroyed at least one bridge to slow the Russian advance, although we know that Russian forces have bridge laying companies. This morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the government had information that “subversive groups” were encroaching on the city, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege” in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime. While Zelinskiy said this morning that Russian troops had been halted in most places but even if that is the case, which seems to contradict his comments on encroachment, the situation is serious. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call Thursday evening that Russian mechanised forces that entered from Belarus were about 20 miles from Kyiv. While there has been some focus on Russian losses inflicted by Ukrainian defenders – including helicopters, soldiers and armoured vehicles – it’s worth pointing out these are so far at the level the Russian military would have priced in for such a quick and aggressive advance and not evidence necessarily any sign so far that the Russian operation is struggling.

Russia will have to talk to us sooner or later about how to end hostilities and stop this invasion. The sooner the conversation begins, the smaller Russia’s losses will be.” Zelenskiy added that world is continuing to observe what is going on in Ukraine from afar while new sanctions have not convinced Russia to withdraw from an attack. This morning we are defending our state alone. Like yesterday, the world’s most powerful forces are watching from afar. Was Russia convinced by yesterday’s sanctions? We hear in our sky and see on our earth that this was not enough.” He added that until the attacks stop, “we will be defending our country until then”.

US defence official says Russian forces have lost momentum amid stiff resistance

Russia’s drive to seize control of Ukraine has lost momentum amid stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces, both on the ground and in the air, a senior US defence official says.

“Their momentum, particularly as it comes to Kyiv, has slowed over the last 24 hours,” the official told reporters at a Pentagon briefing on condition of anonymity.

Russian forces have yet to seize any of Ukraine’s major cities, or achieve air superiority over the country, the official said.

“They have not achieved the progress that we believe they anticipated they would … [and] are meeting more resistance than they expected” the official added. “A good indicator of that is no population centers have been taken. None.”

Russia puts ‘partial restriction’ on Facebook access

Russian authorities have announced access to Facebook will be partially restricted after the social media network banned the accounts of several Kremlin-backed news outlets over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Russian state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it had demanded that Facebook lift the bans it had on Thursday placed on state news agency RIA Novosti, state TV channel Zvezda, and pro-Kremlin news sites Lenta.Ru and Gazeta.Ru. The agency said Facebook didn’t reinstate the media outlets.

Roskomnadzor cast its action as a move “to protect Russian media.” It said Russia’s Foreign Ministry and the Prosecutor General’s office found Facebook “complicit in violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as the rights and freedoms of Russian nationals”.

It did not clarify what exactly the move means.

Russia claims Kyiv has gone silent on talks

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said there is a “pause” in contact between Moscow and Kyiv over possible in-person talks between the two sides following a discussion over where any such meeting should take place.

Peskov said Moscow had offered to hold the talks in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, but Kyiv had instead proposed Warsaw as a venue.

He said the Ukrainians had then taken what he described as quite a long time-out. During that pause, he claimed Ukrainian “nationalists” had deployed missile systems in residential areas within the country’s big cities, mirroring claims made by Putin.

Peskov did not provide evidence to support his assertion but said it was a very dangerous development. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities.

Ukrainians build makeshift roadblocks to stall Russian advance

Some Ukrainians are building makeshift roadblocks in a bid to stall Russian troops.

Vladimir, a former coalmine owner who fled Ukraine’s eastern region of Luhansk for Kyiv in 2014, when Russian-backed separatists took control of swaths of territory there, is among them.

The 47-year-old’s fortification, which features several concrete slabs and about a dozen sandbags, stands in the town of Rzhyshchiv, on the outskirts of Kyiv.

It is manned by six men, including Vladimir, who declined to give his surname. Two of those guarding the site are armed with hunting rifles.

“We won’t stop tanks with it, but we can stop other vehicles,” he told Al Jazeera, adding he had paid for the supplies from his own pocket.

Dozens of similar roadblocks have reportedly sprung up around the capital and elsewhere in Ukraine.

‘The problem for the Kremlin is Zelenskyy’

Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith, reporting from Moscow, says Russia’s suggestions it is ready for talks with Ukraine in Minsk were made after Moscow called for Kyiv to “lay down its arms” and warned it could never recognise Zelenskyy’s government as democratic.

“It is worth reminding people that the current Ukrainian president was elected in 2019 with a landslide 73 percent share of the vote, so he was democratically elected,” Smith said.

“But clearly, the problem for the Kremlin is Zelenskyy, and whether they will be able to have talks while he remains in power is unclear,” he added.

Zelenskyy had appealed for talks with Putin prior to the Kremlin’s suggestions of a summit in the Belarusian capital, which has hosted previous rounds of discussions between officials from Ukraine and Russia.

“I would like to address the President of the Russian Federation once again. There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let’s sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people’s deaths,” Zelenskyy said in a video message to the nation.
