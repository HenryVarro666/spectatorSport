An analysis of satellite images by The New York Times rebuts claims by Russia that the killing of civilians in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, occurred after its soldiers had left the town.

When images emerged over the weekend of the bodies of dead civilians lying on the streets of Bucha — some with their hands bound, some with gunshot wounds to the head — Russia’s Ministry of Defense denied responsibility. In a Telegram post on Sunday, the ministry suggested that the bodies had been recently placed on the streets after “all Russian units withdrew completely from Bucha” around March 30.

Russia claimed that the images were “another hoax” and called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting on what it called “provocations of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.

But a review of videos and satellite imagery by The Times shows that many of the civilians were killed more than three weeks ago, when Russia’s military was in control of the town.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html

Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other world leaders condemned Russia on Sunday for its recent attack on the Ukrainian town of Bucha, where reportedly 300 civilians were killed.

The Associated Press reported that brutalized bodies were found by Ukrainian troops in Bucha, a small city northwest of Kyiv as Russian soldiers withdrew and focused their attacks elsewhere.

Missile strikes targeted fuel supplies in Odessa and ammunition supplies near the city of Mykolaiv on Sunday.

“Those responsible for these egregious and appalling attacks will be brought to justice,” he added.

Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly released a statement on Twitter calling the soldiers’ actions “shocking” and a “senseless murder of innocent civilians.”

“Canada will not spare any effort, including investigations of war crimes, to ensure that those responsible are held to account,” Joly said.

Ukraine also said they found 410 bodies in towns near Kyiv as part of an investigation into possible war crimes by Russia. Some witnesses were so traumatized they are unable to speak.

Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venedyktova said, “We need to work with witnesses.”

“People today are so stressed that they are physically unable to speak.”

She said 140 of the bodies had been examined so far. She will be asking the health ministry to provide as many forensic experts as possible to staff a field hospital in Kyiv region.

Ukraine’s Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskiy said it was clear hundreds of civilians had been killed, but he did not want to say exactly how many there were. Efforts were still under way to clear mines in the area.

“Many local residents are considered missing. We cannot give an exact figure, but there are a lot of people,” he said.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also said on Sunday he was “deeply shocked” by images of dead civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, and he called for an independent investigation that “leads to effective accountability.”

Russia, however, denied its forces were responsible for the deaths of civilians in the town of Bucha and said that Ukraine had staged it as a performance for the western media.

“All the photos and videos published by the Kyiv regime, allegedly testifying to the ‘crimes’ of Russian servicemen in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region, are another provocation,” Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement.

The Russian defence ministry said that all Russian military units had left Bucha on March 30, and that civilians had been free to move around the town or evacuate while it was under Russian control.

“During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions,” it said.

“In light of the blatant provocation by Ukrainian radicals in Bucha, Russia has demanded that a meeting of the U.N. security council be convened,” Dmitry Polansky, Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, wrote on the Telegram messenger app.

Global outrage is mounting over the discovery of dozens of bodies, some with their hands bound, in towns near the Ukrainian capital after invading Russian troops retreated from the area.

Ukraine has accused Russia of carrying out the killings in towns near Kyiv, including in Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy branding Russian forces as “murderers, torturers and rapists” who were committing “genocide” in his country.

Russia, however, has denied the claims.

Its defence ministry accused Ukraine of falsifying the images of corpses in “another production” for Western media.

Western nations have voiced horror at the images, with some calling for more sanctions against Russia and others backing a war crimes inquiry by the International Criminal Court (ICC).

Here is a roundup of world reactions:

United Nations

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply shocked” by images of dead civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

An independent investigation that “leads to effective accountability” is essential, he said.

I am deeply shocked by the images of civilians killed in Bucha, Ukraine. It is essential that an independent investigation leads to effective accountability. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) April 3, 2022

United States

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the images coming out of Bucha were “a punch to the gut” and promised to help Ukraine document “war crimes” being committed by the Russian troops.

“There needs to be accountability,” he told CNN. “But I think the most important thing is we can’t become numb to this. We can’t normalise this. This is the reality of what’s going on every single day as long as Russia’s brutality against Ukraine continues.”

UN rights chief

The UN human rights chief has expressed her horror at the images of dead bodies in the town of Bucha.

“I am horrified by the images of civilians lying dead on the streets and in improvised graves in the town of Bucha in Ukraine,” Michelle Bachelet said in a statement on Monday.

“Reports emerging from this and other areas raise serious and disturbing questions about possible war crimes, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human rights law,” she said.

NATO

Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, said the graphic images coming out of Bucha show “a brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades”.

He told CNN’s State of the Union that “it’s absolutely unacceptable that civilians are targeted and killed” and that it was Russian President Vladimir Putin’s responsibility to stop the war.

Stoltenberg said it was “extremely important” that the ICC opens an investigation into potential war crimes in Ukraine and that those responsible are held to account.

European Union

President of the European Council Charles Michel pledged further sanctions on Moscow as he condemned “atrocities” carried out by Russian forces outside Ukraine’s capital Kyiv.

“Shocked by haunting images of atrocities committed by Russian army in Kyiv liberated region #BuchaMassacre,” he wrote on Twitter.

“EU is assisting Ukraine & NGO’s in gathering of necessary evidence for pursuit in international courts.”

The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, also expressed shock at the news of “atrocities committed by Russian forces” and said the bloc will assist Ukraine in documenting war crimes.

I congratulate #Ukraine on liberation of most of Kyiv region. Shocked by news of atrocities committed by Russian forces. EU assists Ukraine in documenting war crimes.

United Kingdom

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Russia’s alleged attacks on Ukrainian civilians in towns on the outskirts of Kyiv “are yet more evidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his army are committing war crimes in Ukraine”.

Johnson called the attacks in the towns of Irpin and Bucha “despicable” and said he “will do everything in my power to starve Putin’s war machine”.

Johnson added that the UK will step up its sanctions and military support for Ukraine, but did not provide details.

Germany

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised further sanctions on Russia over the “atrocities” in Bucha.

“Putin and his supporters will feel the consequences” of their actions, Scholz said in a statement, adding that Germany will “continue to make weapons available to Ukraine so the country can defend itself against the Russian invasion”.

He also called for international organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to be allowed access to the affected areas to independently document the “atrocities”.

German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht also called for a “response”, saying “such crimes must not remain unanswered”. She said the EU must discuss the banning of Russian gas.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the “images from Bucha are unbearable” and added that “Putin’s uninhibited violence is extinguishing innocent families and knows no boundaries”.

France

French President Emmanuel Macron expressed solidarity with Ukrainians, while describing the images coming out of Bucha as “unbearable”.

“The Russian authorities will have to answer for these crimes,” he said in a Twitter post.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also issued a statement saying he firmly condemned the “massive abuses” committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.

Poland

Polish President Andrzej Duda called on Western allies to provide more weapons to Ukraine, saying the “pictures from Bucha disprove the belief that we have to seek a compromise at any cost”.

“In fact, the Defenders of Ukraine need three things above all: weapons, weapons and more weapons,” he wrote on Twitter.

Italy

Italy’s Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio told Italy’s Rai 3 channel that the events in Bucha were “unleashing a wave of indignation that will lead to new sanctions”.

He said there “could be a debate on the issue of imports of hydrocarbons from Russia” and that Italy would not veto a fifth package of sanctions.

Canada

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the killings in Bucha “egregious and appalling” and said Russia must be held to account.

“We strongly condemn the murder of civilians in Ukraine, remain committed to holding the Russian regime accountable,” Trudeau wrote on Twitter.

Kishida said “Japan will firmly carry out what it should do” while cooperating with the international community in possible further sanctions against Russia.

New Zealand

New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described the reports of rape and other atrocities by Russian troops in Ukraine as “reprehensible”.

“Russia must answer to the world for what they’ve done,” she told reporters in the New Zealand capital, Wellington.

She said her cabinet is considering further measures New Zealand could take to support Ukraine and send a strong message to Russia.

“Certainly, what we as an international community are seeing are evidence of war crimes at the hands of Russia,” Ardern said.

“Ultimately it is for the International Criminal Court to make that determination, but the evidence is there and New Zealand is supporting the prosecutors in gathering that evidence and making sure that Russia is held to account,” she added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/4/4/unbearable-world-reacts-to-civilian-killings-in-bucha-ukraine

8:39 am: Russia says peace talks not advanced enough for Putin-Zelensky meeting

Russia said on Sunday that peace talks had not progressed enough for a leaders' meeting and that Moscow's position on the status of the Crimea peninsula and the eastern Donbas region remained unchanged.

""The draft agreement is not ready for submission to a meeting at the top,"" Russian chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said on Telegram. ""I repeat again and again: Russia's position on Crimea and Donbas remains UNCHANGED.""

7:45 am: Loud explosions heard in Odesa

""Odesa was attacked from the air,"" Ukraine interior minister advisor Anton Herashchenko wrote on his Telegram account. ""Fires were reported in some areas. Some of the missiles were shot down by air defence.""

An AFP reporter heard explosions in the southwestern city at around 6:00 am local time (0300 GMT). The blasts sent up at least three columns of black smoke with flames apparently visible in an industrial area. A soldier near the site of one of the strikes said it was likely a rocket or a missile.

The attack comes as Russian forces appeared to be withdrawing from the country's north. On Friday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Russia was consolidating its forces and preparing ""powerful strikes"" in the south, joining a chorus of Western assessments that Moscow's troops were regrouping.

Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, says on Facebook that the bodies were removed on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Zelenskyy decries war atrocities in new address, saying, 'Evil will be punished' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered his harshest rebuke yet Sunday as Russian forces retreated from the war-torn city of Bucha, Ukraine, leaving in their wake a mass of what appeared to be civilian fatalities. ""Today this appeal will be without congratulations. I do not want any extra words. Presidents do not usually record appeals like this. But today I have to say just that. To say after what opened in Bucha and our other cities, from which the occupiers were chased out. Hundreds of people were killed. Tortured, shot — civilians. Bodies on the streets. Mined territory,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The bodies of the dead were mined."" Zelenskyy switched from speaking Ukrainian and made a direct appeal in Russian, saying: ""I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel. What did they do? Why were they killed? What did the man who was riding his bicycle down the street do? Why were ordinary civilians tortured to death in an ordinary peaceful city? Why were women strangled after their earrings were torn out of their ears? How could women be raped and killed in front of children? Their bodies were mocked even after death. Why did they crush the bodies of people with tanks? What did the Ukrainian city of Bucha do to your Russia? How did all this become possible?"" He added: ""Russian mothers! Even if you raised marauders, how did they also become executioners? You couldn't help but know what's inside your children. You could not help but notice that they are deprived of everything human. No soul. No heart. They killed deliberately and with pleasure."" Speaking again in Ukrainian, Zelenskyy said that ""evil will be punished"" and that he had created a ""special mechanism of justice"" in Ukraine to investigate and prosecute every crime of Russian occupiers in the country. ""The essence of this mechanism is the joint work of national and international experts: investigators, prosecutors and judges. This mechanism will help Ukraine and the world to bring to justice those who unleashed or in any way participated in this terrible war against the Ukrainian people and in crimes against our people,"" he said.

NATO chief: This is 'not a real withdrawal' NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday said Russia is shifting its strategy in Ukraine, explaining that Putin's retreat from Kyiv is not a sign that he is withdrawing from the country. “What we see is not a real withdrawal,"" Stoltenberg said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""What we see is that Russia is repositioning its troops, and they are taking some of them back to rearm them, to reinforce them, to resupply them. But we should not in a way be too optimistic because the attacks will continue."" His remarks came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned of a Russian buildup of forces in the east of his war-torn country, in a video posted to Telegram on Saturday. In an intelligence briefing, British defense officials said Moscow's naval forces have continued to blockade areas on Ukraine's southern coast, preventing resupply by sea.

Russian naval forces block Ukraine's resupply by Black Sea, U.K. military intelligence says Russian naval forces continue to blockade the Ukrainian coast on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, preventing resupply by sea, British military intelligence said Sunday.

""Reported mines within the Black Sea pose a serious risk to maritime activity,"" it added. The report said the origin of the mines was unclear and disputed, but their presence was almost certainly the result of Russian naval activity in the area, demonstrating how its invasion of Ukraine is affecting neutral and civilian interests.

NASA astronaut says Russian crew 'blindsided' by response to yellow and blue flight suit

NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei on how Ukraine crisis impacted partnership with Russians April 5, 2022 01:26 HOUSTON — NASA’s record-setting astronaut Mark Vande Hei says he and his Russian crewmates focused on their mission, not the “heartbreaking” news unfolding in Ukraine, while serving aboard the International Space Station. His 355-day spaceflight ended last Wednesday with a landing in Kazakhstan. He returned to Earth in a Russian Soyuz capsule with cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov, the latter of whom also spent a year in orbit. In his first news conference back on Earth, Vande Hei said Tuesday that he did not shy away from the topic with his Russian crewmates while aboard the space station. “They weren’t very long discussions, but I did ask them how they were feeling and sometimes I asked pointed questions. But our focus really was on our mission together.” Vande Hei also cleared up any misunderstandings about the yellow-with-blue-trim flight suits worn by their Russian replacements when arriving at the space station last month. Those were the school colors of their university, Vande Hei said from NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, and not meant as a political statement. “The folks who wore them had no idea that people would perceive that as having anything to do with Ukraine ... I think they were kind of blindsided by it.” Share this -

British PM to Russians: 'History will remember' who looked away British Prime Minister Boris Johnson decried the savagery of Vladimir Putin's forces and appealed directly to the Russian people to ""share"" the truth in a video message Tuesday. ""The reports are so shocking, so sickening, it’s no wonder your government is seeking to hide them from you,"" Johnson said to Russian citizens, referring to the horrific wave of killings in Bucha, Irpin and elsewhere in Ukraine. ""Your president knows that if you could see what was happening, you would not support his war,"" Johnson said. ""He knows that these crimes betray the trust of every Russian mother who proudly waves goodbye to her son as he heads off to join the military, and he knows they are a stain on the honor of Russia itself — a stain that will only grow larger and more indelible every day this war continues."" He urged Russian civilians to ""access independent information"" — ""and when you find the truth,"" he said, ""share it."" ""Those responsible will be held to account,"" the prime minister added, ""and history will remember who looked the other way. "" Share this -







U.S., allies to impose more sweeping sanctions against Russia The Biden administration plans to announce an additional sweeping sanctions package targeting Russia on Wednesday, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The package was organized in coordination with the G-7 and the European Union, the source said. Under the new measures, the U.S. will ban all new investment in Russia, increase sanctions on financial institutions and state-owned enterprises in Russia and sanctions on its government officials and their family members. Sources said the sanctions seek to inflict significant economic harm on Russia, and comes after U.S. officials and President Biden have recognized new evidence of further war crimes in Ukraine, particularly in the city of Bucha.

Joint Chiefs chairman says Ukraine war could last 'years' In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee Tuesday, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the U.S. and its allies should be prepared to counter Russian aggression in Eastern Europe for ""quite some time."" “I do think this a very protracted conflict and I think it’s at least measured in years. I don’t know about a decade, but at least years, for sure,"" said Gen. Mark Milley, the nation's top military commander. ""This is a very extended conflict that Russia has initiated. And I think that NATO, the United States, Ukraine and all of the allies and partners that are supporting Ukraine are going to be involved in this for quite some time."" Milley said it's still too soon to tell how Ukraine's fiercer than expected resistance might influence Moscow's plans in the future, but said the U.S. must be prepared to counter future Russian aggression as Moscow tries to expand its sphere of influence in Ukraine and other Eastern European nations. ""We are witness to the greatest threat to peace and security of Europe, and perhaps the world, in my 42 years of service in uniform,"" Milley said in his opening remarks at the hearing on the Defense Department's budget. ""The Russian invasion of Ukraine is threatening to undermine not only European peace and stability, but the global peace and stability that my parents and a generation of Americans fought so hard to defend.""

Zelenskyy slams U.N. for inaction, details atrocities Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday laid out atrocities committed by Russia in Ukraine in a powerful speech to the U.N. Security Council from Kyiv. Zelenskyy said he visited the city of Bucha near Kyiv on Monday and said the Russian military there “searched for and purposely killed anyone who served our country.” “They shot and killed women outside their houses,” Zelenskyy said. “They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.” The Ukrainian leader said civilians were fatally shot in the back of the head after being tortured. Some were shot in the streets and thrown into wells and others were killed in their own apartments by grenades, he said. “The civilians were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road,” he continued. “They cut off limbs, cut their throats, slashed their throats. Women were raped and killed in front of their children. Their tongues were pulled out only because the aggressor did not hear what they wanted to hear from them.” Read the full story here.

European Commission proposes new sanctions against Russia The European Commission has proposed new sanctions against Russia, including an import ban on coal worth 4 billion euros per year (about $4.4 billion). The proposed fifth package of sanctions comes as Russia faces widespread condemnation over atrocities it has been accused of committing in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. ""We all saw the gruesome pictures from Bucha and other areas from which Russian troops have recently left,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. ""The perpetrators of these heinous crimes must not go unpunished."" The proposed package has six pillars, she said. In addition to the import ban on coal from Russia, it would also include a full transaction ban on four key Russian banks, with VTB, the second-largest Russian banks among them. It would further block Russian vessels and Russian-operated vessels from accessing E.U. ports, with some exemptions, including for agricultural food products, humanitarian aid and energy, along with other measures aimed at cutting ""the money stream of Russia and its oligarchs."" Von der Leyen said the E.U. would also propose further penalties against individuals and was working on additional sanctions, including on oil imports. Share this -

In a statement Tuesday, the prosecutor's office said it was investigating possible war crimes allegedly committed in Mariupol, Chernihiv and Gostomel since the invasion began on Feb. 24 until March 16. ""The facts referred to by the investigations were allegedly committed to the detriment of French nationals,"" it said.

Russia accused of blocking Egypt-bound ship carrying Ukrainian wheat The Ukrainian embassy in Cairo has accused Russia of blocking a ship loaded with Ukrainian wheat from moving after the goods were purchased by Egypt. The ship, EMMAKRIS III, remains docked in the Ukrainian port of Chernomorsk in the Black Sea, according to ship tracking information verified by NBC News on Tuesday. The Russian embassy in the Egyptian capital denied the claims, instead accusing Ukrainian authorities of preventing ships from leaving the port. Egypt is one of three countries, along with Indonesia and Bangladesh, that import about a third of the wheat that Ukraine exports, according to the International Grains Council. Share this -







Sweden to expel 3 Russian diplomats for spying, foreign minister says Sweden will expel three Russian diplomats for spying, Foreign Minister Ann Linde said on Tuesday, joining a number of European countries that have expelled Russian diplomats in recent days. “It is because they are not following the Vienna Convention and they are undertaking illegal intelligence-gathering operations,” Linde told reporters. France, Belgium and the Netherlands have recently expelled Russian diplomats over alleged spying activity. The moves coincide with outrage across the continent over reports of the discovery of mass graves and of civilian killings in the Ukrainian town of Bucha following the retreat of Russian soldiers, conducting what Moscow calls its “special operation” in Ukraine. “It is obvious that war crimes have been committed,” Linde said. The Kremlin denies any accusations related to the murder of civilians, including in Bucha. Share this -







Japan’s top envoy brings back 20 Ukrainians from Poland Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi returned from Poland on Tuesday with 20 Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s ongoing war on their country as Tokyo seeks to play a greater role in international support for Ukraine. During three days in Poland, Hayashi visited facilities for Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw and held talks with Polish officials, international humanitarian organizations and civil groups to assess how Japan can provide support. He said the visit ""renewed my resolve"" that Japan should ""cooperate with international society and provide the utmost assistance."" Japan has an extremely strict refugee policy and has been reluctant to fully accept migrant workers, making its offer to accept Ukrainians unusual. However, the government has carefully called them evacuees and it is still unclear if the Ukrainian situation will change its immigration policy. Tokyo expects the 20 evacuees will stay in Japan for at least six months, and will provide further support if needed, said Deputy Justice Minister Jun Tsushima, who was traveling with Hayashi. Tokyo has previously accepted about 300 other Ukrainians, all relatives of about 2,000 Ukrainian residents in Japan who arrived on their own since the Russian invasion began. Share this -

Zelenskyy says negotiations with Russia still necessary despite events in Bucha Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that the country still needed to negotiate an end to the war, even after the reports of atrocities and attacks on civilians in Bucha and other cities around the capital. “I think I have no other choice,” he told journalists in a press conference aired on Ukrainian television. “We cannot fight constantly,” he added. “It does not suit us, and we need security guarantees.” Still, he said, ""I think this is a great tragedy in general, because all of us, as I consider myself a part of society, will see even the possibility of negotiations as a challenge."" He also said “Russia may return,” and the country must prepare for that. Any agreement must include security guarantees from other countries, as well as clear sanctions policies in the event of further aggression after this war ends, he said, echoing comments he’s made in previous weeks. Zelenskyy on Monday visited Bucha, where he claimed that at least 300 civilians had been killed. Share this -

However, Vereshchuk said that despite Russia's agreement to open humanitarian corridors, Russian forces have been blocking those trying to reach Mariupol to help facilitate evacuations and provide aid. The ICRC said Monday's incident showed just how ""volatile and complex the operation to facilitate safe passage around Mariupol has been."" Share this -

Seven humanitarian corridors to open Tuesday, Ukraine says Seven humanitarian corridors to evacuate residents from cities in the south and east of Ukraine were set to open Tuesday, the country’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said in a message posted on Telegram. The besieged southern port city of Mariupol was included in the list, with residents scheduled to go to Zaporizhzhia in their own vehicles rather than buses. However, safe routes out of the city have come under fire or been blocked in recent weeks making evacuations difficult or impossible, and Vereshchuk offered little reason for hope Tuesday. “Despite the promises of its leadership, the occupying forces do not allow anyone to travel to Mariupol,” she wrote on the Telegram post. Seven buses were planned to help evacuate residents of Manhush, just east of Mariupol. Russian forces blocked Red Cross representatives on Monday, according to Vereshchuk. “After negotiations, they were released at night and sent to Zaporizhia,” Vereshchuk said. Share this -

Ukraine and Western nations on Sunday accused Russian troops of war crimes after the discovery of a mass grave and “executed” civilians in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv.

The buried corpses of 57 people were found behind a church in the town's centre, according to the chief of local rescue efforts, Serhiy Kaplychniy, who showed AFP the trench where the bodies lay.

On Saturday, AFP saw the bodies of at least 22 people in civilian clothes on a single street in Bucha, one with his hands tied behind his back.

Speaking from Uzhhorod, Ukraine, in an interview that aired Sunday on Rosemary Barton Live, Matilda Bogner warned of a dire situation in the country five weeks after it was invaded by Russia.

""Unfortunately, every day the civilian casualties are increasing,"" she said. ""It's very high levels of civilian casualties in the country.""

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has documented more than 3,000 civilian casualties, with 1,417 deaths.

But as tragic as that is, Bogner says the true number is likely far higher.

""The numbers that we record don't show the full picture, because we have to fully verify each individual casualty, and we know that there are more than those we've verified so far,"" she said.

It's particularly difficult for her team to get information from regions and cities under heavy fire, such as the southeastern city of Mariupol.

""It's a bit like a black hole. It's very difficult to get information from these areas,"" Bogner said.

""There's no electricity, communications have been cut off, and so it's difficult to collect and to fully verify the casualties from those areas — and we know that the casualties are high in those areas.""

Experts told CBC it could take years to determine an accurate number of civilian casualties.

Bogner added that even in some areas not under siege, the UN team can run into difficulties collecting information on civilian casualties.

""It's also difficult to reach out to people in areas that have been occupied by the Russian Federation, because people are often fearful to speak and to speak openly,"" she said.

But in areas the team can reach, the fact that the UN's human rights monitoring mission has had a presence since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2014 has been an advantage.

""We have solid networks across the country, a lot of people know about our work and trust our work and therefore do speak to us,"" Bogner said.

Her team has also been visiting with prisoners of war to ensure that international laws and human rights are upheld.

Canada, officials condemn civilian deaths

In an open letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday, Ukrainian Canadian Congress president Alexandra Chyczij called on Canada and its allies to provide Ukraine with military aid — including fighter jets and tanks — to prevent civilian casualties in Ukraine.

""The international community is signalling to Russia that the world is prepared to stand by as Russia commits genocide. And should our policy continue to be guided by a desire not to 'provoke' Russia — rather than a desire to help Ukraine win this war — the next days and weeks will bring more Buchas,"" she said.

Bogner said local authorities in Ukraine have resorted to digging mass graves to lay the dead to rest.

""We have documented evidence of improvised graves. These are graves that have been organized by local authorities and volunteers and so on to deal with people who are dying there but who they can't bury in the ordinary graveyards because it's too dangerous to take them there,"" she said.

""We are aware of at least three of these larger graves, but we know that people have been burying the dead also in gardens, in other spaces, with one, two, maybe three bodies.""

Bogner said the best solution right now would be humanitarian corridors so that civilians in cities like Mariupol can reach safety.

Many who are still in the city are especially vulnerable, she says.

""Unfortunately, it's the most vulnerable people who remain in a city like Mariupol,"" she said.

""Others have found ways, often dangerous, but they have found ways to leave, and those who remain behind are the elderly, people with disabilities or people who for other reasons just have not been able to make use of transport and so on to leave the city.""

While the UN's documentation of civilian casualties is partly about holding Russia to account, Bogner says preventing harm to civilians in the first place can't be forgotten in the team's work.
