""As is known, there is almost a consensus regarding such issues as NATO, disarmament, collective security and using Russian as official language in the technical infrastructure works during the ongoing process in Belarus,"" the Turkish president added. ""However, there is the issue of Crimea and Donbass, which is impossible for Ukraine to consent to.""

""I think Mr. Zelensky has displayed wise leadership with an understanding to take the issue to referendum by saying ‘That is a decision that must be made by the entire Ukrainian people',"" Erdoğan added.

Ragip Soylu, Turkey bureau chief for Middle-East Eye, claimed that the Turkish president plans to tell Putin, ""Make an honourable exit in Ukraine and become an architect of peace.""

In a speech commemorating the 30th day of the war early Friday, Zelenskyy said, ""With each day of our defense, we are bringing the peace we need so much closer. We are bringing victory closer.

Ragıp Soylu, Turkey bureau chief of Middle East Eye, reported the news in a tweet on Friday. However, there is still no agreement on Crimea and Donbas, two eastern areas of Ukraine that Russia sees as its own territory. In 2014, Russian troops annexed Crimea before claiming it as Russian land.

Newsweek has contacted the ministries of foreign affairs of both Russia and Ukraine for comment on the peace talks.

Turkey has been in contact with the negotiating teams from the two countries. The NATO member shares a maritime border with Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has a strong relationship with both states. Although it has imposed some sanctions on Moscow since the war started on February 24, it has also offered to mediate the conflict.

Erdogan was speaking press conference following the extraordinary summit of NATO leaders on Thursday and Friday.

“We will continue our talks with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky from now on as well,” Erdoğan said, according to a statement from his office. “All our efforts aim to create an atmosphere of peace by bringing together the two leaders.”

“As is known, there is almost a consensus regarding such issues as NATO, disarmament, collective security and using Russian as official language in the technical infrastructure works during the ongoing process in Belarus,” Erdogan added. “However, there is the issue of Crimea and Donbas, which is impossible for Ukraine to consent to.”

The Turkish leader called Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky‘s move on Monday to declare that Ukrainian compromises with Russia will be decided on by a referendum was “wise leadership.”

“Turkey’s strong support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty since 2014 is known by everyone. We have stated at every opportunity that we never have and never will recognize Crimea’s annexation, and we continue to do so,” Erdogan said.

“The destruction and humanitarian tragedy caused by the war are evident. The war-torn cities, hospitals, schools and houses that have nearly turned into wrecks, and weeping refugees, who packed all their assets in one suitcase, have all reminded us once again of the bitter face of wars.”

Erdogan is due to tell Russian President Vladimir Putin: “Make an honorable exit in Ukraine and become an architect of peace,” Soylu reported.

The Turkish president met with U.S. counterpart Joe Biden and other NATO leaders in Brussels on Thursday to discuss further sanctions on Russia and bolstering the alliance’s eastern flank. Biden will travel to a Polish town near the border of Ukraine later on Friday to show solidarity and show Western resolve against the Russian invasion.

Shear', 'Michael Levenson', 'Alexandra Petri', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs', 'Jim Mckinley', 'Megan Specia', 'Aurelien Breeden', 'Eric Schmitt', 'Farnaz Fassihi']",2022-03-25 00:00:00,"Russian-backed forces in Dokuchaievsk, in the eastern Donestsk region of Ukraine, on Friday.

Russia signaled a possible recalibration of its war aims in Ukraine on Friday as the Kremlin faced spreading global ostracism for the brutal invasion, hardened Western economic punishments and a determined Ukrainian resistance that appeared to be making some gains on the ground.

A statement by Russia’s Defense Ministry said the goals of the “first stage of the operation” had been “mainly accomplished,” with Ukraine’s combat capabilities “significantly reduced,” and that it would now focus on securing Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years.

The Defense Ministry statement was ambiguous about further possible Russian territorial ambitions in Ukraine, where its ground forces have been mostly stymied by the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian military response.

But on a day when President Biden was visiting U.S. soldiers in Poland near the Ukrainian border, the statement suggested the possibility that the Russians were looking for a way to salvage some kind of achievement before the costs of the war they launched a month ago became impossibly onerous.

While Russia “does not exclude” that its forces will storm major Ukrainian cities such as Chernihiv, Mykolaiv and the capital, Kyiv, the Defense Ministry statement said that taking them over was not the primary objective.

“As individual units carry out their tasks — and they are being solved successfully — our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing: the complete liberation of the Donbas,” Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, a senior Russian military commander, said in the statement, his first since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24.

Whether General Rudskoi’s statement was sincere or simply strategic misdirection was difficult to assess. But the statement amounted to the most direct acknowledgment yet that Russia may be unable to take full control of Ukraine and would instead target the Donbas region, where Russia has recognized the independence of two Kremlin-backed separatist areas that it calls the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic.”

Russia has also insisted that Ukraine recognize its control of Crimea, which President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces seized from Ukraine in 2014.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has ruled out ceding those regions to stop the war.

Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst, cautioned that the public pronouncements of Russian military commanders should be regarded skeptically. While Russia could indeed be narrowing its war aims, he said, General Rudskoi’s statement could also be a feint as Russia regroups for a new offensive.

“We could say that this is a signal that we’re no longer insisting on dismantling Ukrainian statehood,” Mr. Luzin said. “But I would rather see it as a distracting maneuver.”

General Rudskoi’s statement came as Ukraine acknowledged that Russian forces had been “partially successful” in achieving one of their key objectives — securing a land corridor from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula.

While Russia already controlled much of the area, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the route allowed Russian troops and supplies to flow between Crimea and Russia.

But some Ukrainian officials said the significance of such a route might be overstated. Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine under Mr. Zelensky, described the land bridge as a minor Russian victory and said the Kremlin was moving to secure Donetsk and Luhansk to “sell to the Russian public as a potential victory.”

In Moscow, Mr. Putin, who has made any criticism of the war a potential crime, used a televised videoconference with the winners of a presidential arts prize on Friday to deliver a diatribe about “cancel culture” that made no mention of the war in Ukraine.

In embracing a term that has become a favorite of the American political right to reprise his contention that the West is trying to erase Russian culture and history, Mr. Putin cited J.K. Rowling, author of the “Harry Potter” books, whose comments about transgender women have been criticized as transphobic.

“Not so long ago, the children’s writer J.K. Rowling was also ‘canceled’ for the fact that she — the author of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies around the world — did not please fans of so-called gender freedoms,” Mr. Putin said.

Ms. Rowling responded on Twitter that, “Critiques of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics.” She added the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine.

As Mr. Putin spoke, there were indications that Ukrainian forces were making some progress in the second week of their counteroffensive. A senior Pentagon official said that Russian forces no longer had full control of the southern port of Kherson and that the city, the first major urban center to be captured in the Russian invasion, was now “contested territory.”

The Pentagon assessment contradicted General Rudskoi’s claim on Friday that the Kherson region was “under full control.”

In another sign of the bloody stalemate in Ukraine, Russian soldiers have adopted “defensive positions” near Kyiv, the Pentagon official said, adding that Russia appeared to be “prioritizing” the fight in eastern Ukraine, as General Rudskoi had indicated.

“Clearly, they overestimated their ability to take Kyiv and overestimated their ability to take any population center,” the Pentagon official said.

Mr. Biden, on the second day of his three-day visit to Europe because of the Ukraine crisis, traveled to Rzeszow, Poland, about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border, where he met with members of the 82nd Airborne Division who are serving as part of NATO’s efforts to protect Poland and other member states from Russian aggression.

Greeting American service members who were eating pizza in a cafeteria, Mr. Biden called them “the finest fighting force in the history of the world,” and added, “I personally thank you for what you do.”

Later, Mr. Biden met with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and officials managing the humanitarian response to the more than two million Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland to escape the shelling and deprivation.

Mr. Biden also announced a deal to increase U.S. shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. But it remained unclear exactly how the administration would achieve its goals.

The deal calls for the United States to send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. But it does not address the lack of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic.

Still, American gas executives welcomed a renewed emphasis on exports as a sign that the Biden administration was now seeking to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry rather than punish it for contributions to climate change.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Robert Habeck, the vice chancellor and economic minister of Germany, said his country expected to halve imports of Russian oil by midsummer and nearly end them by year’s end — sooner than many thought possible. He estimated that Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, could be free of Russian gas by mid-2024.

Images and videos from Ukraine that emerged on Friday underscored the escalating death toll and destruction.

Newly surfaced security camera footage, verified by The New York Times, showed an attack on people in line for emergency aid outside a post office and shopping center in the battered northeastern city of Kharkiv on Thursday. Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the regional government there, said that at least six civilians had been killed and 15 wounded.

Photographs out of Kharkiv on Friday also showed a large fireball and nearby cars and buildings on fire, as residents fled on foot and bicycle, carrying whatever belongings they could grab in the aftermath of the attack.

In the central city of Dnipro, Russian missile strikes on a military facility destroyed buildings late Thursday night, according to Ukrainian officials, who said that casualties were still being assessed.

And in Mariupol, the southern port savaged by Russian attacks, Ukrainian officials said that an estimated 300 people had been killed in a March 16 strike on a theater used as a bomb shelter.

It was unclear how officials had arrived at that estimate. Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the theater, which was attacked even though “children” had been written in giant letters on the pavement on both sides of the building.

The United Nations said on Friday that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, including 93 children, since Russia’s invasion began, many in what appeared to have been indiscriminate bombardments that could constitute war crimes.

The United Nations cautioned that it had not been able to verify the death toll in areas of intense conflict, including Mariupol, and said the actual number of injured and dead was likely to be considerably higher.

In a sign that diplomatic efforts were struggling, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rejected comments by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had suggested that Ukraine was open to concessions in four key areas.

In an interview released Friday, Mr. Erdogan, who is hosting talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, said that Ukraine was willing to drop its bid for NATO membership, accept Russian as an official language, make “certain concessions” about disarmament and agree to “collective security.”

But Mr. Kuleba said the negotiations had proved “very difficult” and that Ukraine had “taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands.”

“We insist, first of all, on a cease-fire, security guarantees and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he said, adding that there was “no consensus with Russia on the four points mentioned by the president of Turkey.”

“In particular,” he said, “the Ukrainian language is and will be the only one state language in Ukraine.”

(Evan Vucci/AP)

US President Joe Biden announced a new initiative meant to deprive Russian President Vladimir Putin of European energy profits used to “drive his war machine.”

Speaking in Brussels alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Biden said Russia was using its hold on providing Europe with oil and gas to “coerce and manipulate its neighbors.”

Biden said the United States would help Europe reduce its dependence on Russian oil and gas, and would ensure the continent had enough supplies for the next two winters.

“It's going to take some time to adjust gas supply chains and infrastructure that was built for the last decade so we're going to have to make sure the families in Europe can get through this winter and the next while we're building an infrastructure for a diversified, resilient and clean energy future,” Biden said.

The panel, chaired by representatives from the White House and the European Commission, will be aimed toward finding alternative supplies of liquefied natural gas and reducing overall demand for natural gas moving forward.

Europe’s dependence on Russian gas and oil has proved a major sticking point in Western efforts to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. While the US banned Russian energy imports, Europe found it far more difficult to cut off its supplies.

“I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe, but it's not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it's going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing,” Biden said.

The United States will work toward supplying Europe with at least 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas in 2022, in partnership with other nations, the White House said.

Senior administration officials said the 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas being sent to Europe is coming from multiple sources, including the United States and nations in Asia. But officials did not have an exact breakdown on where the gas was coming from.

The announcement Friday was the culmination of a US effort over the past months to identify alternate sources of energy for Europe, particularly in Asia. Officials said those efforts would continue through this year to hit the 15 billion cubic meter target.

One official said weaning Europe from Russian energy amounted to ""replacing an unreliable supplier of LNG with a much more reliable supplier in the US.""

The group will also work toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions through reducing methane emissions and using clean energy to power operations.

“This crisis also presents an opportunity. It's a catalyst,” Biden said. “A catalyst that will drive the investments we need to double down on our clean energy goals and accelerate progress towards our net zeroes emissions future.”

Von der Leyen has hailed the joint energy task force as a ""big step"" in efforts to diversify gas supplies away from Russia.

""We want as Europeans to diversify away from Russia, towards suppliers that we trust that are friends and that are reliable and therefore, the US commitment to provide the European Union with additional at least 15 billion cubic meters of LNG this year is a big step in this direction, because this will replace the LNG supply we currently receive from Russia,"" von der Leyen told the press conference.

The US has also committed to ensuring stable demand and supply for an additional 50 billion cubic meters of US liquefied natural gas until 2030, which von der Leyen said will replace one third of Russian gas supply to Europe.

This puts the bloc ""right on track now,"" she said, stressing the need for the EU to secure supplies ""not just for next winter, but also for the years ahead.""

Furthermore, as the current gas infrastructure may be used in future for clean hydrogen, it plays a part in the ""decarbonizing of our economy,"" she continued.

The cooperation between the EU and US ""shows the power of our democracies,” and Biden’s presence in Europe sends a “powerful message to the world,” she added.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-25-22/h_ddf7103f39a989f545105e2df16927b1

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is making a new attempt to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. There are prospects of an agreement on four out of six issues between the two countries, Erdogan told Turkish journalists on the return trip from the NATO special summit in Brussels.

According to the Turkish Information Office, he called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday to explore the possibility of ending the war. Zelenskyj’s government, however, denied Erdogan’s optimistic assessment of a rapprochement on important points.

According to Turkish reporters, Erdogan also wants to talk to Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin in the coming days. He wants to try to persuade Putin to take an “honorable initiative” for peace.

Like other NATO members, Turkey condemns the Russian attack on the neighboring country, but does not take part in sanctions against Russia. Erdogan and his ministers have been trying for weeks to organize a summit meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy in Turkey in personal talks and telephone calls with top Russian and Ukrainian politicians.

The Turkish head of state has developed a good personal relationship with Putin over the past few years; Russia and Turkey are cooperating on energy and armaments issues and on the Syrian conflict.

The focus is on the future of Donbass and Crimea

On the return flight from Brussels, Erdogan said there were no insurmountable problems on four contentious issues between Moscow and Kyiv. These included Russian demands for Ukraine to renounce future NATO membership, for the recognition of Russian as an official language of Ukraine and for a partial disarmament of Ukraine, as well as questions of “collective security”.

On the other hand, the positions in the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which are ruled by pro-Russian separatists, and on the question of the future of the Crimean peninsula annexed by Russia are currently unbridgeable.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba contradicted Erdogan. The minister said his country was grateful to Turkey and Erdogan. But there is no agreement with Russia on the points mentioned by Erdogan. In addition, Erdogan’s description of the issues in dispute is incorrect. “The negotiation process is very difficult.” Ukraine insists on a ceasefire, security guarantees and the territorial integrity of the country.

Erdogan wants to speak to Putin again by the beginning of next week at the latest. “In doing so, we must say to him: ‘You must be the architect of the steps towards peace.’ We must find a way to an amicable end by telling him: ‘Take an honorable initiative for this.'”

However, Erdogan did not directly call on Putin to withdraw troops from Ukraine, as some reports have misinterpreted.

More on the Ukraine war on Tagesspiegel Plus:

Two weeks ago, the Turkish government brought Kuleba and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov together for their first personal talks since the outbreak of war, but was unable to make any substantive progress. Visits by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to Russia and Ukraine did not yield any concrete results either.

However, the fact that Erdogan is publicly announcing a new mediation campaign at the level of the president shows that Turkey sees opportunities for rapprochement. On the sidelines of the NATO summit in Brussels, Erdogan spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron, who has also acted as a mediator in the Ukraine conflict.",https://globalhappenings.com/politics/135031.html
