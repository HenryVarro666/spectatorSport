Besieged Mariupol still stands, but supplies are running out.

Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are preparing for another round of negotiations.

Mariupol

The siege of Mariupol continues with over 100,000 civilians trapped inside it. The Russian forces have been bombarding the southern Ukrainian city for weeks in an attempt to bend the will of the defenders.

“The task was to wipe the city off the face of the earth along with its inhabitants. This is genocide, there is no other way to call what is happening,” the mayor of Mariupol Vadym Boychenko said of the Russian assault against his city.

In a report published over the weekend, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) confirmed 2,909 civilian casualties (1,119 killed and 1,790 injured) in Ukraine since the start of the war.

“In the last 24 hours there has been no significant change to Russian Forces dispositions in occupied Ukraine. Ongoing logistical shortages have been compounded by a continued lack of momentum and morale amongst the Russian military, and aggressive fighting by the Ukrainians. Russia has gained most ground in the south in the vicinity of Mariupol where heavy fighting continues as Russia attempts to capture the port,” the British Ministry of Defense stated in its daily assessment of the war.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense claimed that as of Monday, Ukrainian forces have killed approximately 17,000 Russian troops (and wounded approximately thrice that number), destroyed 123 fighter, attack, and transport jets, 127 helicopters, 586 tanks, 302 artillery pieces, 1,694 armored personnel carriers, 95 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), seven boats, 1,150 vehicles, 73 fuel tanks, 54 anti-aircraft batteries, 66 unmanned aerial systems, 21 special equipment platforms, such as bridging vehicles, and four mobile Iskander ballistic missile systems.

Another Round of Negotiations

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are meeting in Turkey on Monday for the latest round of negotiations. Previous rounds of talks had failed to produce any concrete outcomes, resulting in a week-long break in negotiations. But the situation now is different.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and his advisers have seen that the Russian military is incapable of achieving the primary objectives set out at the start of “special military operation,” namely to topple the Ukrainian government and capture key urban centers, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odesa.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is open to discussions about Ukrainian neutrality. What that would look like isn’t clear yet, though. At the beginning of the war, the Ukrainian government was adamant that application for membership in the European Union and NATO were very much on the table.

But as the weeks of fighting started taking their toll on Ukraine and its population, Zelensky publicly acknowledged that joining NATO might be a bridge too far. Now Zelensky says that he is open to discussing a neutral status for Ukraine, with potentially lifting restrictions imposed on the Russian language (in many parts of Ukraine, people speak Russian, but after the Russian invasion and annexation of Crimea, the Ukrainian government-imposed restrictions on the teaching, learning, and speaking of Russian). Zelensky, however, insists that any decision would have to be approved by the Ukrainian people through a referendum that would take place after Russian troops have left Ukraine. He also wants security guarantees from third countries.

Russia’s 4th Guards Tank Division (GTD) was considered one of it’s “elite” units, headquartered near Moscow.

The division's units participated in the First Chechen War of 1994-1996, and personnel took part in peacekeeping operations in South Ossetia during 1997, in Kosovo in 1998 to 2002, later participating in the Second Chechen War of 1999-2009. During this period, it was one of the Russian Army's ""constant readiness"" divisions, with at least 80% manpower and 100% equipment holdings at all times.

In other words, this unit was kept at maximum readiness, unlike other army units pilfered and plundered for dachas and vodka. It 2008, it had 12,000 soldiers, 320 tanks, armored personnel carriers, 130 howitzer artillery, and 12 GRAD rocket artillery. In 2012, Russia did away with the divisions as its main maneuver unit, replaced with Battalion Tactical Groups, in large part, because of the great grift opportunities they offered. (They have proven woefully inadequate for their task.) Still, for whatever reason, Russia rebuilt the division in 2015, outfitting it with 228 battle tanks, 300 armored personnel carriers, 90 artillery guns, and 19 MLRS GRAD rocket artillery.

This was one of the best funded and equipped units in the entire Russian Army, with their latest generation armor. The structure of the division would theoretically render it more resistant to the kind of rampant grift that affected BTGs. This thing was fearful, designed to punch through enemy lines and wreak havoc in the enemy’s rear. And that’s exactly what 4 GTD tried to do just the first week of March.

Deployed in the Sumy axis, in between that city and Kharkiv, the 4th GTD punched deep, getting as far as Myrhorod:

Status of Russian advances, March 22, 2022.

The first contact with Myrhorod was March 9, with Ukrainian forces repelling the attack. It was the first sighting of Russia’s most modern tanks on the Ukrainian battlefield. At least three abandoned T80Us are seen abandoned in this video.

The tweet says “more abandoned ...” which means Ukraine captured or destroyed even more of them. Over the next two days, Ukrainian forces hacked away at the division, forcing its retreat back toward the direction it came. In those two days, the division lost around 50 of its tanks. It was easy to track because 4th GTD was the only unit in the entire Russian Army to have T80Us. And to add insult to Russia’s injury, most of these were abandoned, not destroyed. Of the 46 T-80Us in Oryx’s database of visually verified Russian equipment losses, 38 were captured, and only four seemed destroyed in combat. (The rest were abandoned and destroyed by locals.) Other T-80 variants in the Oryx database show similar rates of captured-to-destroyed.

Regardless, the division had lost around 50 of its tanks out of 228, so things got quiet for the 4th GTD. From all indications, they set up shop in Trostyanets, where their howitzer and rocket artillery could pummel Sumy. And so it was until this weekend, when Ukrainian forces swept into town, essentially wiping the division off the face of the map.

I wrote about the attack on Saturday, still not quite understanding how monumental the victory was. Initial reports said “dozens” of Russian vehicles had been captured or destroyed, but you always account for a little hyperbole in these matters. Well, visual confirmation has been streaming out over the last few days, and it’s … voluminous.

Here are links to captured and destroyed equipment: here, here, here, here, here, here (ammo cache), here (GRAD ammo), here, here, here, here (pontoon bridge layer), here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here. The claims of “dozens” of vehicles might actually be true. In all, Oryx has documented 77 destroyed T-80 variants, which is a third of the entire division. And remember, these are just visually confirmed losses. That’s the baseline number. And on top of that, dozens of Russians surrendered.

Reports state that the remnants of Russia’s forces in the region have retreated to the other side of their border. Likely, they’ll try and salvage what survived, and “reconstitute” the unit, either by reinforcing it with conscripts and remnants of other shattered units, or raw conscripts. Either way, the division’s most effective days are behind it. As a result, Russia has lost one of its most capable units, with its most modern equipment. Furthermore, it lost a base of attack to rain death and misery from above on Sumy. And it opened roads from Sumy to Poltava to its south, breaking the siege of that city, allowing it to be resupplied. And for added satisfaction, here’s what its destruction means on the map:

All that red territory between Sumy and Kharkiv, in the map above, is gone. That big chunk of land south of Sumy has been cleansed, as Russia’s best could not take these two cities on Russia’s own border. How pathetic is that? Ukrainian forces are likely conducting mop-up operations in that remaining orange territory, but given that Russia doesn’t hold any cities in that area, odds are good that Sumy’s supply lines to Poltava are secure for the time being.

The scope of 4th GTD’s destruction is so massive, the evisceration so complete, that you’d think Ukraine massed a considerable force to take it out. Yet no details have been forthcoming. Ukrainian General Staff doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to detail its successful strategies to Russian generals. Even in the video above, we only see small snippets of what had to have been a larger operation. Given the proliferation of drone footage of even small activities, we’ll no doubt get a clear picture of the battle after the war concludes. I’m certainly eager to learn how these scrappy Ukrainians pulled off a coup of this magnitude,

Postscript: The commander of one of the division’s regiments reportedly died of suicide when it was discovered that only one in 10 of its tanks in deep storage were usable. Many had engines missing. You know, for dachas and vodka. So much for resupply. Meanwhile, the commander of Russia’s 1st Tank Army, of which the 4th GTD was part of, was relieved of his command.",https://www.dailykos.com/story/2022/3/29/2088757/-Ukraine-update-The-story-of-Russia-s-4th-Armored-division-and-Ukraine-s-biggest-victory-to-date
2,1f70d956-09c6-4fde-a71a-e637283749a5,[],2022-03-28 00:00:00,"Hot off the presses:

x New: Ukraine’s Finance Minister says the Ukrainian government will not accept any loss of territory to Russia. “We will not accept any losses of our country. We will fight against any possible scenario which moves us toward this,” Marchenko told @jchatterleyCNN — Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) March 28, 2022

The most likely end to this war would include losing territory—either the Donbas separatist region, the Crimean peninsula, or both. But that analysis is based on a determination that Ukraine doesn’t have the military capabilities to engage in large-scale offensive operations. (Here is what they would need.) But Ukraine is wily and creative, and it has found a temporary short-term solution for the lack of the ground-attack and heavy armor it would need to quickly recapture lost ground.

I covered Ukraine’s new small-unit combined-arms tactics this weekend.

The battlefield is buzzing with drones, giving Ukraine’s forces intelligence into what they’re facing up the road. Ukrainian artillery takes out exposed Russian positions. Infantry speeds up the road in civilian SUVs, stopping when the drones see danger up ahead, and letting armored personnel carriers clear out defensive positions in the approach to the village.

In videos, we see these small-unit approaches with a single tank, several armored personnel carriers, and infantry in civilian vehicles. That’s it! There is a shocking lack of Russian close-air support and artillery targeting these small offensive operations. But let’s say Russia suddenly found some of those capabilities under a seat cushion: The damage to Ukraine’s military would be relatively small. Thus, with Russian forces shut down everywhere but the eastern Donbas front, the defenders can afford to take some risks.

Kyiv axis

Irpin’s mayor announced that Russian forces had been completely expelled from this city, where its namesake river marked the front lines of Kyiv’s northwestern approach. (If you missed it this weekend, I wrote a lengthy piece on the importance of rivers to Ukraine’s defense.)

Red: Russian held. Orange: Russian contested. Yellow-green lines: Railroad lines.

Clearing Irpin of Russians opens up Bucha to counterattack, which is of particular importance since it’s the only Russian-held area remaining within artillery range of Kyiv. Indeed, other than some scattered missile attacks, Kyiv has been spared much damage in the past weeks, in large part because of this offensive.

But there’s another objective here that is even more important than pushing some MLRS GRAD rocket artillery launchers a few kilometers back: logistics. Ukraine is within reach of reopening two critical east-west routes.

Note the highway network from Kyiv to western Ukraine. The most direct routes are blocked by Russian forces.

You can see that orange shading around Makariv—that means the territory is still contested. Right now, supply routes to Kyiv require a circuitous southern route. Russia has done little to disrupt those lines, so as of now, the problem isn’t so much security as it is expending valuable diesel to run those supply trucks. There are several rail lines still feeding into Kyiv, which is of incalculable worth, but opening the highway through the Makariv area would dramatically simplify resupply logistics not just to Kyiv, but the rest of the country’s embattled east.

The next major Ukrainian target is Borodyanka, which I highlighted on the first map above. The town runs through yet another major east-west highway, but also through another rail line. And, if you look closely at that map, Borodyanka is also at the intersection of the roads coming down from the Belarus border. In other words, taking that city would complete the encirclement of the remaining troops in Bucha and Hostomel salient (where the famous airfield is located). NASA FIRMS satellite imagery shows that entire front northwest of Kyiv remains under serious assault.

You can see the highway running directly west of Kyiv is on fire, literally. There are reports that Russia made some moves near Brovary on Kyiv’s eastern front, but FIRMS shows it fairly quiet. It’s clear that the main effort is that western and northwestern flank. Not a single fire is burning in Kyiv, confirming it has been spared recent attack. And we’ve got fires in Borodyanka, confirming it is under attack. That mass of fires west of Borodyanka? That’s behind the front lines, and thus likely Russian artillery trying to hit Ukrainian forces coming in that direction.

Ukraine’s push into northwest Kyiv, like everywhere else, is slow and methodical. Imagine large Ukrainian formations trying to maneuver through that mass artillery fire. Small units are nimble, quick, and harder to hit. The minimal amount of equipment used means that even a direct hit is more likely to take out some civilian SUVs (and there are plenty of those) than more valuable armored vehicles. And as we discussed over the weekend, these small-scale offensives are well-placed and time for very specific, important objectives—open up a road here, grab a railhead there, push Russians to the other side of a strategic river, or eliminate a source of artillery fire. If Ukraine regains land, then great! But that’s not the purpose. Victory and defeat have nothing to do with how much of the map is shaded red.

Later today I’ll dig more into what’s happening near Kherson, Kharkiv, Sumy, and the Donbas front. Lots of fog of war to sift through. But if I was Ukrainian high command, my next major military objective after clearing out Bucha, Hostomel, and Borodyanka in northeastern Kyiv to open up that highway and railhead would be to push hard through northeastern Kyiv to break the siege of Chernihiv, which was just encircled this weekend. Ukraine can’t allow it to become the next Mariupol—surrounded, destroyed, massacred.",https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2022/3/28/2088648/-Ukraine-Update-Ukraine-s-small-unit-offensive-makes-gains-in-northwestern-Kyiv
