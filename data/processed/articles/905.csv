“I think it’s fairly obvious not just to us, but to the world that Russian forces are responsible for the atrocities in Bucha,” said Pentagon Spokesman John Kirby.

“Now exactly who, what units, whether they’re contractors or Chechens. I don’t think we’re able to say right now,”

Moscow faced global revulsion and accusations of war crimes Monday after the Russian pullout from Bucha revealed streets strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians, some of whom had seemingly been killed at close range.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed the scenes outside Kyiv as a “stage-managed anti-Russian provocation.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the images contained “signs of video forgery and various fakes.”

Russia has similarly rejected previous allegations of atrocities as fabrications on Ukraine’s part.

Ukrainian officials said the bodies of at least 410 civilians have been found in towns around Kyiv that were recaptured from Russian forces in recent days.

Russia withdrew many of its forces from the capital area in recent days after being thwarted in its bid to swiftly capture Kyiv.

It has instead poured troops and mercenaries into the country’s east in a stepped-up bid to gain control of the Donbas, the largely Russian-speaking industrial region that includes Mariupol, which has seen some of the heaviest fighting and worst suffering of the war.

About two-thirds of the Russian troops around Kyiv have left and are either in Belarus or on their way there, probably getting more supplies and reinforcements, said a senior U.S. defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an intelligence assessment.",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-pentagon-press-secretary-john-kirby-holds-news-briefing-amid-russian-attacks-on-ukraine-6

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Spurred by reports of Russian atrocities outside Ukraine’s capital, and alarmed at signs that Russia’s invasion force is about to escalate assaults in eastern Ukraine, many civilians in that region are fleeing while they can, officials said Wednesday.

“The cities of the Luhansk region are in ruins,” warned one eastern governor. “Thousands of residents have not yet left. Get out of the way!”

The exodus accelerated as Western nations moved to provide more weapons to Ukraine’s military and further ostracize Russia economically with new sanctions, including restrictions on its leading banks and on the assets of President Vladimir V. Putin’s children.

The new sanctions are a response to outrage and revulsion over the atrocities, including executions and torture, that appear to have been carried out by Russian forces before they retreated from areas outside Kyiv in the past few weeks. Russia has denied responsibility, saying the atrocities were fabricated or were committed by the Ukrainians themselves.

The European Union also was weighing a ban on coal from Russia, the leading provider of fossil-fuel energy to Europe, and Russia appeared to move closer to default on its foreign debt because of U.S. currency restrictions.

“Together with our allies and our partners, we’re going to keep raising the economic costs and ratchet up the pain for Putin, and further increase Russia’s economic isolation,” said President Biden, who has described Mr. Putin as a war criminal and suggested he should not remain in power.

More than 11 million Ukrainians — roughly one in four — have fled their homes since the Feb. 24 invasion, according to the United Nations, including more than four million who have fled the country. It is the biggest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The Russian military announced last week that it would focus its campaign on eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. The redeployment came as the Russians, hampered by botched planning and fierce Ukrainian military resistance, retreated from the Kyiv area and apparently abandoned — at least for now — any effort to capture the capital in their war to subjugate the former Soviet republic.

Western military analysts have said the Russians vastly underestimated the challenges in Ukraine and that their initial invasion force of more than 150,000 has been weakened by losses, exhaustion and low morale. But that does not mean Russia’s military cannot undertake a powerful new assault in eastern Ukraine.

The shift has accelerated civilian displacement in the east. Thousands of people have been leaving, according to Ukrainian officials, and photos and videos posted online. Ukrainian officials say Russian troops have been massing in the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions.

In Kramatorsk, a city in the north of the Donetsk region, photos showed crowds of people huddled at a platform in a central train station.

At least two people were killed and five injured when Russian forces launched a strike on a humanitarian aid site in the town of Vugledar in the Donetsk region, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk governor.

Russian forces now control 60 percent of the town of Rubizhne, in the Luhansk region, according to the governor there, Serhiy Haidai, who said the attackers had scaled up their offensive this week.

“Evacuations are taking place under the roar of enemy guns,” Mr. Haidai wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying that approximately 30,000 people had left the region since Russia invaded. He urged remaining residents to flee before Russia scaled up attacks.

Oleg Synegubov, the state administrator for the Kharkiv military region, said Wednesday in a post on Telegram that the army would evacuate two towns in the eastern part of the country because fighting was escalating there.

The towns, Lozova and Barvinkove, are southwest of Izium, a city Russian forces seized as part of an apparent drive toward Sloviansk, which military analysts say is strategically critical to Russia’s plan to gain full control of eastern Ukraine.

Earlier this week, Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, speaking on national television, said “large groupings of Russian troops” had been massing in the region.

“They are not going to stop,” he said. “They have a great desire to create big problems for our armed forces in this direction, and we also expect that fierce battles will be fought there for our territory in the near future.”

The Pentagon’s assessment of Russian deployments appeared to corroborate what Ukrainian officials were saying. Pentagon officials said Russia had withdrawn all of its troops arrayed against Kyiv and another city in the north, Chernihiv, and sent them back to Russia or to its ally Belarus to rearm, resupply and possibly redeploy in eastern Ukraine.

The Pentagon officials said those forces included as many as 40,000 troops that, in many cases, had departed under fierce attack from the Ukrainian military units that retook the territory.

“We believe they are all out,” one senior Pentagon official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational issues.

Russia now has about 30 battalion tactical groups — as many as 30,000 troops — in the east, the senior Pentagon official said. Earlier this week, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, said Russia would most likely send “tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in Ukraine’s east” in the coming weeks.

Largely in anticipation of this next major phase of the war, the Pentagon announced late Tuesday that it was sending $100 million worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles — roughly several hundred missiles — to Ukraine, where the weapon has been used with high success in destroying Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.

NATO foreign ministers, meeting this week, have been discussing how to further help Ukraine prosecute the war without entangling the alliance in direct combat with Russian forces.

The war, they said, is far from over, noting that however badly Russia’s forces have performed, and their retreat from areas around Kyiv notwithstanding, they are making slow and brutal progress in the east.

“Moscow is not giving up its ambitions in Ukraine,” said Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general.

Ukrainian officials in a number of areas, including Mykolayiv in the south and the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in the east, have been sharing schedules of planned evacuations or links to online portals for people to sign up to join buses and trains that are transporting residents to safer places.

But in some besieged cities in the south, like Mariupol, it is already nearly impossible to leave, making evacuations sporadic and risky.

Attempts by the Red Cross to enter Mariupol to supervise civilian departures have repeatedly been scrubbed, leaving fearful residents to fend for themselves. On Wednesday, 500 people who had escaped Mariupol to join a Red Cross convoy in the nearby city of Berdyansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia, about 100 miles away.

The climate of fear gripping Mariupol has spread to the region of Kherson, near the Black Sea, where people have lived under occupation by Russian forces since they encircled and entered the city and its suburbs on March 2.

“Anyone who did not leave early is now stuck here,” said Evgeniya Selivantseva, a doctor from Velyka Lepetyka, a village on the Dnipro River, in the Kherson region.

Dr. Selivantseva, 38, described a deepening humanitarian crisis in the village: Gasoline stations have run out of fuel, and food and medical supplies are running low. Food is so scarce that local leaders have started a makeshift flour mill.

“We feel helpless and totally defenseless,” she said. “People are afraid to leave their homes.”

The proposed European Union ban on Russian coal, part of the bloc’s effort to further penalize Russia over atrocities in Ukraine, reflected a choice of an imported energy source that would be the easiest to replace.

Deliberations over the ban and other sanctions were set to continue into Thursday, and European Union officials and diplomats anticipated that the measures would be approved. The process reflected the challenges of reaching agreement among all 27 member nations on the penalties, which would also include banning Russian ships from E.U. ports.

If approved, the sanctions would be the harshest enforced by the bloc since the invasion.

Though the European Union depends on Russian coal, the bloc could find substitute imports more easily than for natural gas and oil.

But banning coal from Russia could send energy prices soaring for European consumers, given the existing shortages in the bloc, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm. Carlos Torres Diaz, a senior vice president at Rystad, called the potential sanctions “a double-edged sword.”

A 12-year-old boy who carved a wooden bowl to raffle for Ukrainians affected by the war has raised more than £200,000 for Save the Children's Ukraine appeal.

Gabriel Clark, from Cumbria, went viral last month after his father Richard issued a plea on social media for people to follow his son's woodwork Instagram account and shared pictures of his handcrafted creations.

Within 48 hours, Gabriel’s Instagram account went from having six followers to 225,000.

The schoolboy soon decided to create one special bowl for Ukraine in an effort to raise funds for those affected by the ongoing war.

The Bowl For Ukraine appeal has now raised £215,822 and will end today when one winner will be chosen at random to win Gabriel's wooden bowl.

In a message on social media, Gabriel's father Richard wrote: ""How it ends is up to you. It's your story. Certainly we could all pat ourselves on the back for a job well done.

""Save the Children are already enormously grateful for the very real difference this money will make. But what if there was another ending?

""What if we threw caution to the wind and let go of our cynicism and really went for it?

A small number of Ukrainians who have been in the U.S. since the fall in professional military education programs have received rudimentary training on weapons systems that are new to the Ukrainian military, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said in a press briefing Wednesday.

The U.S. has taken advantage of having a small number of Ukrainians in the country and pulled them aside for a couple of days to receive training on how to operate switchblade drones. Kirby said training on the drones only takes a couple of days.

The small number of individuals are expected to go back to Ukraine relatively soon, as was initially planned and can train additional Ukrainian soldiers on the weapons.

The $800 million in assistance President Biden approved in March included 100 switchblade drones. Kirby on Wednesday said that all 100 of those drones have shipped to the region and are on their way to Ukraine, if they're not in Ukraine already.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley told the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the new equipment heading over to Ukraine does require some additional training and some of that training is occurring in the U.S.

There are two versions of the switchblade, one goes after personnel and another after armored vehicles, like tanks. Austin told the House committee on Tuesday that Ukraine will receive both versions.

Overall, the U.S. has committed $1.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion started. The U.S. has two coordination cells that are assisting in making sure the weapons the Ukrainians need from the U.S. and other allies get into the hands of the Ukrainian military.

Since Mr. Biden has said no U.S. troops will be sent into Ukraine, the U.S. is coordinating the shipments to go into Ukraine mostly by land. Kirby said Wednesday that on average, it takes between four to six days after an announcement of assistance for the first shipment to arrive in Ukraine, which is unprecedented speed, according to Kirby.

Russian forces have withdrawn from the area around Kyiv after a disastrous six weeks of fighting in which they failed to capture Ukraine's capital city, the Pentagon confirmed on Wednesday.

""If you look at what they've been able to do just thus far — [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine,"" Press Secretary John Kirby said during a briefing, adding that Putin ""moved his forces out of Kyiv.""

Putin ""didn't take Kyiv, he didn't topple the government, he didn't remove Ukraine as a nation-state — and he's really only taking control of a small number of population centers, and even they weren't the ones he was really going after,"" Kirby said.

The Pentagon spokesperson listed a handful of other cities around Ukraine — like Mariupol, Kharkiv, and Mykolaiv — that have still yet to fall into the hands of Russian forces.

""I think the proof is literally in the outcomes you're seeing every day. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting for their country and they have denied Mr. Putin so many of his strategic objectives,"" Kirby said.

CIA Director Bill Burns said in March that Putin originally believed he could take Kyiv within days of his February 24 televised war declaration on Ukraine.

But from the start, Russian forces made significant errors in their assault on the city: underestimating Ukraine's resistance, failing to establish secure supply lines, and botching attempts to disable Ukraine's air defense.

Kirby's remarks come as NATO and other Western officials have said that Russian forces are now repositioning to focus on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, after starting to move away from the northern Kyiv region the last week.

But as Russian forces scale back and retreat from cities near Kyiv that were under occupation since the early days of the war, the grisly civilian cost of the war is being revealed.

In Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, hundreds of civilians were found dead — some in partially excavated mass graves, and some lying in the streets. Many exhibited signs of torture and indiscriminate execution, according to Ukrainian authorities and media reports from the area.

Kirby said the fact that Russian forces are refocusing on the Donbas ""certainly presents the possibility that the violence will continue"" — and might ""even intensify"" — in that region of Ukraine.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned earlier, however, that he believes Putin still wants to capture all of Ukraine, despite the troop repositioning.

""We have seen no indication that President Putin has changed his ambition to control the whole of Ukraine and also to rewrite the international order,"" Stoltenberg told reporters before meeting with foreign ministers in Brussels on Wednesday.",https://www.businessinsider.com/russian-forces-withdraw-kyiv-failure-capture-ukraine-capital-city-war-2022-4

Such deliveries have ""never been done that fast before,"" the Pentagon's top spokesman said Wednesday.

The billions of dollars in security assistance, including weaponry, that the US has delivered to Ukraine in recent weeks have arrived at unprecedented speed, a Pentagon official said on Wednesday.

The latest aid package, worth $100 million, was announced on Tuesday. It is meant ""to meet an urgent Ukrainian need for additional Javelin anti-armor systems,"" the US Defense Department said.

That followed a $300 million package of security assistance announced on April 1 and an $800 million package announced on March 16.

In total, the US has provided $1.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia's invasion began on February 24 and more than $2.4 billion since the Biden administration took office.

At a press conference Wednesday, chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby emphasized the speed with which that assistance has been delivered.

For the recent aid packages, Kirby said, ""from the time the president signs it to it actually arriving in the region it can be as little as four days, and then it's not like it's sitting in storage for a week or two.""

At a briefing on March 31, a senior US defense official, speaking anonymously to describe developments in Ukraine, said that the first delivery from a $200 million package approved on March 12 arrived six days later and that first delivery from the $800 million package approved on March 16 arrived on March 20.

""We're able to get this material because we're being so careful and so nimble in how these ground shipments are going,"" Kirby said Wednesday. ""We're able to get it into Ukraine and often into the fight within 48 hours sometimes. I mean, that's incredibly fast.""

Kirby added that a $350 million package of security assistance that was approved on February 26 was ""completed in about three weeks.""

Such deliveries have ""never been done that fast before,"" Kirby said.

The April 1 package was authorized under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, through which the US procures items from US firms. Other packages have been approved as drawdowns directly from US stocks.

The US has hastened to provide anti-aircraft and anti-armor weapons, such as Stinger and Javelin missiles, which US officials say are best suited for the threats faced by Ukrainian forces. The March 16 package included 800 Stingers and 2,000 Javelins, bringing the total of each provided by the US to 1,400 and 4,600, respectively.

The $300 million package announced on April 1 included machine guns and ammunition, medical supplies, secure communications systems, armored vehicles, night-vision devices, drones, and counter-drone systems.

Among the drones in the April 1 package were Switchblade tactical unmanned systems, a loitering munition, or ""kamikaze drone.""

Kirby said Wednesday that ""a very small number"" of Ukrainian soldiers who have been training in the US since the fall have received training with the Switchblades.

""We took the opportunity, having them still in the country, to give them a couple of days' worth of training on the Switchblade so that they can go back — and they will be going back soon, back home — to train others in the Ukrainian military,"" Kirby said, adding that a person could be ""suitably trained"" on the Switchblade in about two days.

Switchblades come in two variants, a lighter one designed to destroy infantry and artillery targets and a heavier version designed to take out tanks and armored vehicles.

Speaking to lawmakers on Tuesday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin indicated that both variants were headed to Ukraine, saying they ""will move as quickly as they possibly can.""

On Wednesday, Kirby declined to confirm both variants were being sent but said the US would continue discussions with the Ukrainians ""and helping them get additional ones if they need it.""

""We're going to keep doing it as much as we can, as fast as we can,"" Kirby said, ""and we're going to be as careful as we can so that that flow can continue, because obviously they're in a very, very active fight.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/pentagon-military-aid-to-ukraine-never-been-done-that-fast-2022-4

7 Apr 2022 22.29 Italy will “follow the decisions of the European Union” on new sanctions against Russia, including a possible gas embargo, prime minister Mario Draghi has said. The growing number of “massacres” in Ukraine “is prompting us to adopt even tougher sanctions,” he told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. All the allied countries are wondering what can be done to stop Russia... We are following what the European Union decides. If we are offered a gas embargo, we will follow the EU down this path, we want the most effective instrument to achieve peace.” While a gas embargo is “not a possibility being discussed at the moment” the situation is “constantly evolving” Draghi added. Italy is highly dependent on Russian gas, importing 95% of the gas it consumes, of which around 40% comes from Russia.

“Today the gas embargo is not yet... on the table,” Draghi said.



7 Apr 2022 22.02 The UN General Assembly will vote today on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. The move was initiated by the United States in response to the discovery of hundreds of bodies after Russian troops withdrew from towns near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, sparking calls for its forces to be tried for war crimes. US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the call for Russia to be stripped of its seat on the 47-member council in the wake of videos and photos of streets in the town of Bucha strewn with corpses of what appeared to be civilians. “We believe that the members of the Russian forces committed war crimes in Ukraine, and we believe that Russia needs to be held accountable,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce.” While the Human Rights Council is based in Geneva, its members are elected by the 193-nation General Assembly for three-year terms. The March 2006 resolution that established the Human Rights Council states that the assembly may suspend membership rights of a country “that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights.” To be approved, the resolution requires a two-thirds majority of assembly members that vote “yes” or “no.” Abstentions don’t count.



7 Apr 2022 21.37 Ukraine could 'absolutely' win the war against Russia, Pentagon says The Pentagon has said Ukraine could “absolutely” win the war against Russia, even as US officials speak of the risk of a protracted conflict. “Of course they can win this,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing. “The proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing everyday ... absolutely they can win.” Of course, they can win this. And if you look at what they’ve been able to do just thus far, Mr. Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine. He didn’t take Kyiv. He didn’t topple the government. He didn’t remove Ukraine as a nation state. And he’s really only taken control of a small number of population centres. And even they weren’t the ones that he was really going after. So, you know, Mariupol is still not taken. He’s moved his forces out of Kyiv. He’s moved his forces out of Cherniniv. They haven’t taken Kharkiv. They haven’t taken Mykolayiv in the south. So, I think the proof is literally in the outcomes that you’re seeing every day. The Ukrainians are bravely fighting for their country. And they have denied Mr. Putin so many of his strategic objectives. So absolutely, they can win.”



7 Apr 2022 21.27 US says China could face sanctions if it supports Russia's war in Ukraine Sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine should give China a “good understanding” of the consequences it could face if it provides material support to Moscow, US deputy secretary of state has said. Wendy Sherman, while speaking at a House of Representatives foreign affairs committee hearing on Wednesday, said the “range of sanctions” and export controls coordinated among US allies and partners against Russian President Vladimir Putin, the country’s economy, and oligarchs, should serve as an example for China’s leader Xi Jinping. It gives President Xi, I think, a pretty good understanding of what might come his way should he, in fact, support Putin in any material fashion.” She said Beijing should “take away the right lessons” from the coordinated western response over Ukraine that any moves by China to take the democratically governed island of Taiwan by force would not be acceptable. “We hope that the PRC understands that any such action would see a response from the international community, not just from the United States,” she said, referring to the People’s Republic of China. China has refused to condemn Russia’s action in Ukraine or call it an invasion and has criticised Western sanctions on Moscow, although a senior Chinese diplomat said last week that Beijing is not deliberately circumventing those sanctions.

7 Apr 2022 20.59 Russian troops 'changed their tactics' and are now hiding evidence, Zelenskiy says Zelenskiy maintained that alleged atrocities committed by Russian forces in Bucha would be repeated in other cities, this time with Russia hiding the evidence of any crimes.

We have information that the Russian troops have changed their tactics and are trying to remove the killed people from the streets and basements of the occupied territory. Killed Ukrainians. This is just an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more. However, the president remained optimistic that they would not succeed. “Responsibility cannot be avoided,” he added. We already know about thousands of missing people. We already know about thousands of people who could be either deported to Russia or killed. There are no other options for their fate. The situation now is that thanks to an objective investigation, thanks to witnesses, thanks to satellite surveillance of events on earth, thanks to other tools that help establish the truth we will find out all the circumstances regarding the majority of our missing citizens. Regarding most of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine.” “The search for truth can no longer be stopped,” he added.



7 Apr 2022 20.45 Hesitation to agree on oil embargo is costing Ukrainian lives, Zelenskiy says Zelenskiy described Russia’s export of oil as “one of the foundations of Russia’s aggression” that allows it to not take peace negotiations seriously. Some politicians are still unable to decide how to limit the flow of dollars and euros to Russia from the oil trade, so as not to jeopardise their own economies... The embargo on Russian oil supplies will be applied anyway. The format will be found. The only question is how many more Ukrainian men and women the Russian military will have time to kill, so that you, some politicians - and we know you, can borrow a little determination somewhere.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine will also continue to insist on a complete blockade of the Russian banking system from international finance.

7 Apr 2022 20.33 Russia will regard weak sanctions as 'permission to attack', says Zelenskiy Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the new package of western sanctions against Russia is “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia will view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack.

New investments in Russia are blocked, restrictions are applied against several systemic banks in Russia, personal sanctions are added, as well as other restrictions. This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough.” In his signature nightly national address the Ukrainian president added: If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons we really need and have applied for many times, it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to go further. A permission to attack. A permission to start a new bloody wave in Donbas.” However, Zelenskiy remained optimistic saying “it is still possible to prevent this”. It is still possible to impose such sanctions, which Ukraine insists on, our people insist on. It is still possible to give us weapons that will really stop this aggression. The west can do it. Just as it could have applied preventive sanctions last year to prevent this invasion. If the mistake is made again, if there is no preventive action again, it will be a historic mistake for the whole western world.”

7 Apr 2022 20.04 Britain is drawing up plans to send armoured vehicles to Ukraine, according to The Times. Options under consideration include sending a protected patrol vehicle, such as the Mastiff, or a vehicle like the Jackal, which can be used as a reconnaissance or long-range patrol vehicle, a ministry of defence report said. The vehicles would be stripped of sensitive equipment and British troops would be sent to a country neighbouring Ukraine to carry out training, the newspaper reported, citing a defence source. Further support, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, would be announced by Britain in the coming days, the report said.
