Since Russia invaded Ukraine a month ago, International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi has called on both countries to urgently agree a framework to ensure Ukraine's nuclear facilities, including the radioactive waste facilities at Chernobyl and Europe's biggest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia, are safe and secure.

Grossi has, however, so far failed to obtain that agreement. In a video statement on Wednesday he said it would include assistance such as ""on-site presence of IAEA experts at different facilities"". He has declined to provide specifics of his agency's plans.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

European Union leaders have urged Russia to fully respect its obligations under international law and abide by the recent order by the International Court of Justice that told Moscow to withdraw from Ukraine.

“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine grossly violates international law and is causing massive loss of life and injury to civilians,” the leaders of the 27-nation EU said in a joint statement.

No reason to accept demands for rouble payments for Russian gas: France’s Macron

French President Emmanuel Macron has said there was no reason for his country to accept a demand from Russia to pay in Russian roubles for Russian gas.

Putin had said earlier this week that Russia will seek payment in roubles for gas sold to “unfriendly” countries, raising alarm about a possible gas crunch in Europe.

Chernobyl staff members have not been rotated in four days, IAEA says

Staff on duty at Chernobyl’s Russian-held radioactive waste facilities have not been rotated in four days, and Ukraine cannot say when that will change because of fighting in the town where many of them live, the UN nuclear watchdog has said.

Pope leads global prayer for peace between Russia and Ukraine

Pope Francis has led the world’s Catholic bishops in praying for peace between Russia and Ukraine, saying the world had forgotten the tragedies of the 20th century and was still menaced by nuclear war.

Francis presided at a service in St Peter’s Basilica where he prayed for the protection of all humanity, “especially Russia and Ukraine”.

In a separate homily before reciting the prayer, Francis spoke of “scenes of death” in which “bombs are destroying the homes of many of our defenceless Ukrainian brothers and sisters” and of “a cruel and senseless war that threatens our world”.

The pope posted several messages in English, Russian and Ukrainian on Twitter on Friday stressing peace and forgiveness.

“Mexico is a free, independent, sovereign country … We’re not going to Moscow to spy on anybody, nor to Beijing … nor to Washington,” he said on Friday.

US Air Force General Glen VanHerck had told a Senate hearing on Thursday that Russia’s military intelligence service has its “largest portion” of members in Mexico.

Biden has left the Polish city of Rzeszow, after meeting with US troops and representatives of aid organisations, to fly to the capital Warsaw.

Biden’s visit to Poland gave him a chance to underscore the US commitment to protect a key NATO member on Ukraine’s doorstep and to thank Poles for welcoming refugees fleeing Russia’s invasion.

“Hundreds of thousands of people are being cut off from help by Russian forces and are besieged in places like Mariupol,” Biden said earlier. “It’s like something out of a science fiction movie.”

US sees Russia focusing on eastern Ukraine: Official

The United States assesses that Russia is prioritising eastern Ukraine’s Donbas, as opposed to Kyiv, in what could be an effort to build leverage in negotiations and cut off Ukrainian forces in the east from the rest of the country, a senior US defence official has said.

Russia said earlier that the first phase of its military operation was mostly complete and it would focus on completely “liberating” Ukraine’s breakaway eastern Donbas region.

The US defence official also said Russia was looking to send reinforcements from Georgia.

Biden suggests he wanted to visit Ukraine

Biden has suggested that he wanted to visit Ukraine but was unable to because of the security situation there.

“I’m here in Poland to see firsthand the humanitarian crisis, and quite frankly, part of my disappointment is that I can’t see it firsthand, like I have in other places,” Biden, speaking alongside his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda, said.

“They will not let me – understandably I guess – cross the border and take a look at what’s going on in Ukraine.”

Ukraine, Russia voice pessimism over talks

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says negotiations with Russia aimed at ending the conflict are “very difficult” and vowed Kyiv would not back down on its demands.

“The Ukrainian delegation has taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands. We insist, first of all, on a ceasefire, security guarantees, and [the] territorial integrity of Ukraine,” Kuleba said.

Meanwhile, Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky as saying the two sides were making little progress on key issues.

Medinsky also said Moscow believed Kyiv was trying to stretch out the negotiations.

Earlier, Turkish broadcaster NTV and others cited President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as saying progress had been made on several key points. Ankara, which enjoys good relations with both Moscow and Kyiv, has been attempting to position itself as a mediator between the two sides.

The Russian embassy in Paris on Thursday posted a picture depicting a body lying on a table called “Europe” with characters representing the US and EU jabbing needles into it. It later deleted the tweet, but also appeared to have liked other tweets highlighting its original post.

“These posts are unacceptable. We made that clear today to the Russian Ambassador,” France’s foreign ministry said in a statement sent to the Reuters news agency.

“We are trying to maintain a demanding channel of dialogue with Russia and these actions are completely inappropriate.”

Switzerland adopts more EU sanctions against Russia

Switzerland’s government says it has adopted more EU sanctions against Russia after pledging to act in step with the bloc as it moves to financially punish Moscow.

“This means that all measures contained in the EU’s fourth package of sanctions have been implemented,” the country’s cabinet said in a statement.

However, the cabinet said it had decided not to implement the EU measure of March 1 suspending the broadcasting of Russian media outlets Sputnik and Russia Today.

“Despite the fact that these outlets are used to spread targeted propaganda and disinformation by the Russian Federation, the Federal Council is of the opinion that it is more effective to counter untrue and harmful statements with facts instead of preventing them from being broadcast,” it added.

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists detained, disappeared: UN

Dozens of Ukrainian officials, journalists and activists have been detained or forcibly disappeared by invading Russian forces, the UN has warned, saying that some cases resembled “hostage-taking”.

The UN’s human rights office (OHCHR) said it had documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of 22 local Ukrainian officials, 13 of whom had subsequently been released, since Moscow launched its attack.

At least 15 journalists and civil society activists “who vocally opposed the invasion” in several regions had also been taken, Matilda Bogner, OHCHR’s representative in Ukraine, said in a statement.

“This does seem to be a pattern that is occurring in areas that are occupied by the Russian Federation,” she said.

“Forces of the Russian Federation are going specifically to detain, and do not inform relatives and others where they are taking people … That does in some cases appear to be a form of hostage-taking.”

The UN’s human rights office says it has confirmed at least 1,081 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia started its offensive, with the real toll expected to be significantly higher.

In its latest update on casualties, OHCHR also said that 1,707 people had been wounded amid Moscow’s onslaught.

It added that UN human rights monitors are working to verify reports of additional deaths in places of intense clashes in the regions of Sumy, Kharkiv and Donetsk, where the city of Mariupol is located.

Moscow updates troop death toll, says 1,351 killed

Russia’s army has updated its troop death toll, saying 1,351 soldiers have been killed and 3,825 others wounded since the start of its offensive in Ukraine.

The new toll, announced at a Moscow briefing delivered by senior military officials, came several weeks after Moscow gave its first assessment of losses in the conflict on March 2.

At the time, Russia put the number of its forces killed at 498.

Kyiv says more than 16,000 Russian troops have been killed, while NATO officials have told Al Jazeera they believe the death toll on the Russian side amounts to between 7,000-15,000 personnel.

Russia says first phase of Ukraine ‘operation’ mostly complete

Russia has said the first phase of its “military operation” in Ukraine is mostly complete and that it will now focus on completely “liberating” eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.

The Russian defence ministry said Russian-backed separatists now controlled 93 percent of Ukraine’s Luhansk region and 54 percent of the Donetsk region – the two areas that jointly make up the Donbas.

“The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which … makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbas,” Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff’s Main Operational Directorate, said.

The defence ministry added that it did not rule out storming Ukrainian cities that had been blockaded and said that Russia would react immediately to any attempt to close the airspace over Ukraine – something Kyiv has asked NATO to do, but NATO has resisted.

It said that Moscow’s offensive would continue until Russian forces had completed the tasks that had been set by Russian President Vladimir Putin, without saying what those tasks were.

Russia’s military had considered two options for its operation in Ukraine, one confined to the Donbas and the other on the whole territory of Ukraine, before opting for the latter, according to Rudskoi.

Local authorities had earlier said the town was “completely isolated”, with Russian forces just beyond its limits.

The Kyiv region administration said in a statement that Moscow’s troops were stationed about 1.5km (one mile) away.

The Chernobyl plant was seized by Russian forces on February 24, the first day of Russia’s invasion.

Ukrainian officials say elderly couple shot dead by Russian forces in Sumy

Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s Office says two elderly Ukrainians have been killed by Russian forces in their own home in the country’s northeastern Sumy region.

“According to the investigation, on March 24, 2022, servicemen of the armed forces of the Russian Federation shot two residents in their own yard in Veliky Sambir village,” the Interfax-Ukraine news agency quoted the office as saying in a Telegram post.

The office reportedly said the victims, a man and woman, were both aged 62. There was no immediate reaction from Russia and Al Jazeera could not independently verify the report.

The US has said it is in favour of Russia being pushed out of the group, but Peskov said Washington’s efforts to isolate Moscow had so far only been partially effective and would ultimately fail.

Local officials say 300 killed in Mariupol theatre bombing

Mariupol’s local government, citing witnesses, has said about 300 people were killed last week when Russian forces struck a theatre in the besieged city that was being used as a makeshift bomb shelter.

The southeastern port city’s authorities provided the toll in a Telegram post. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the figures provided.

It was not immediately clear whether emergency workers had finished excavating the site.

When the theatre was struck on March 16, an enormous inscription reading “CHILDREN” was posted outside in Russian, intended to be visible from the skies above.

Soon after the bombing, Ludmyla Denisova, the Ukrainian Parliament’s human rights commissioner, said more than 1,300 people had been sheltering in the building. Russia has denied attacking the theatre and targeting civilians amid its offensive.

EU pens new deal with US aimed at reducing reliance on Russian gas

The US and EU have announced a new deal on liquefied natural gas (LNG) aimed at reducing Europe’s reliance on Russian energy imports.

The agreement, unveiled by Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a news conference in Brussels, will see the US supply the bloc with at least 15 billion additional cubic metres of the fuel this year.

“This will replace the LNG supply we currently receive from Russia,” von der Leyen said.

She added the EU will work with member states to also ensure they can receive at least 50 bcm of additional LNG until 2030.

About 10 percent of the EU’s gas needs are met by production within the bloc. Russia typically supplies about 41 percent of the rest of the LNG used by its member states.

59 percent of Russian missiles malfunctioned, downed or missed: Ukraine

Russia has launched some 1,200 cruise missiles since its invasion began, but 59 percent of them did not explode, were shot down or missed, Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces has said.

5,382c7d1a-5278-4a24-91af-707124b3ef58,[],,"Zohar Palti, a former senior Mossad official who wrapped up a stint as head of the military’s political-military bureau this week, is speaking to the media for the first time, opening up about his opposition to Israel attacking Iran a decade ago, and his current opposition to a new nuclear deal which may be nearing finalization.

Speaking to Haaretz, he says he led opposition to Israel taking military action against Iran in 2012, when then-prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-defense minister Ehud Barak were pushing for a strike.

“During the spring-summer of 2012, the operational preparations reached a peak. In my understanding, they [Netanyahu and Barak] were truly preparing to attack,” he tells Haaretz.

“I am not claiming to read the secrets of the heart. But when the IDF is instructed to deploy for ‘P+16’ [possible attack within 16 days], when air force aerial refueling planes are brought back from long-term servicing, it’s an emergency situation. The air force put all its planes into the air in order to prepare. Quite a few risks were taken in that period.”

“But what are you going to attack in Iran? An enrichment facility? I am in favor of attacking if there is an urgent need, if a sword is held to your throat, as [former Mossad head Meir] Dagan put it. But that was not the situation in 2012 or in the preceding years,” he adds.

Speaking to Channel 13, he claims Israel will be given free rein to act against Iran if it does build a bomb.

“If they go for the bomb, in my opinion there will be no limitations on us. If the Iranians build a bomb and continue on their current path, I don’t know a single democratic state on earth, and certainly none that is allied with us, that would stop us. To the contrary. They would greatly respect our right to make our own decisions, on the basis of our capabilities.”

Palti describes the new nuclear deal as “crap.”

“From the moment the agreement is signed, billions of dollars will flow into Iran. That money will not reach the civilian population, it will go first of all toward financing the terrorism of the Revolutionary Guards,” he tells Haaretz.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-march-24-2022/

In regards to ongoing diplomatic negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, he said it was ultimately up to Kyiv to determine whether it would like to give up territory to Russia.

He vowed the US would respond if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine.

Biden said Russia should be removed from the G20. At the same time, he said Ukraine should be able to attend G20 meetings.

German Chancellor Scholz vows more support for Ukraine

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said further sanctions will be imposed on Russia as they become necessary. Current sanctions appeared to be very effective. He said everyone was already feeling the effects of the war on energy and food prices and that energy sanctions had been deliberately avoided.

He also stated the need for a constant flow of weapons into Ukraine and pledged further humanitarian support as well as readiness to take in more Ukrainian refugees.

Germany will also provide troops for a new NATO battle group to be deployed in Slovakia, the chancellor said. He also warned that the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine by Russia would be a violation of international law.

Scholz and various other EU leaders all rejected Russia's demands to pay for gas in rubles, saying it would be a breach of contract.

UN General Assembly blames Russia for humanitarian crisis

The UN General Assembly passed a resolution putting the blame for the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine on Russia and calling for an immediate cease-fire.

The resolution was passed with a majority of 140 votes in favor and just five votes against. Some 38 members abstained from the vote.

The text was written up by Ukraine and its partners, criticizing Russia for the ""dire"" humanitarian situation in Ukraine.

China and India, key partners for Russia, once again abstained.

Russian defense chief makes first appearance in weeks

Sergei Shoigu, Russia's defense minister and close-ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, resurfaced on Thursday after having been out of the public eye for several weeks.

However, the 66-year-old's appearance was limited to a small section of Putin's computer screen during a split-screen video call along with other Russian officials.

The video, taken from within Putin's office by the RIA news agency, zoomed in on the section of the screen where Shoigu was. The video is believed to be the first public sighting of the minister since March 11.

""The defence minister has a lot on his mind right now. A special military operation is under way. Now is not really the time for media activity,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

However, the original disappearance of Shoigu, and the claims that the invasion has not been going as well as Moscow has expected, led to speculation over the fate of the defense chief.

Ukraine and Russia swap prisoners

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Facebook that Ukraine and Russia carried out their first prisoner exchange on Thursday.

China denies prior knowledge of invasion

China's Ministry of National Defense rejected claims that Beijing knew about Moscow's plan to invade Ukraine ahead of time, the state-backed newspaper Global Times said on Twitter.

The statement called the claims ""totally false information, which intended to shirk responsibility and smear China.""

Beijing has not condemned Russia's invasion and Washington has warned that it may be providing Moscow with financial and military support. However, China abstained from a UN vote condemning the invasion, rather than voting against it as some had expected.

Ukraine accuses Russia of 'forced deportation'

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry released a statement on Thursday claiming that Russian forces have ""forcibly deported about 6,000 Mariupol residents to Russian filtration camps.""

It said that Russia is also trying to do the same to the 15,000 residents in the Left Bank region of the city.

""The Russian occupiers are forcing them to move to Russia. The invaders confiscate people's passports and other identity documents,"" the statement said, adding that it was ""in order to use them as hostages and put more political pressure on Ukraine.""

The statement also accused Russian forces of firing on columns of civilians fleeing from the city that was the subject of intense bombardment by the Russian military and a siege that left thousands of people without access to food, water and power for days.

NATO activates chemical and nuclear defense elements

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance was concerned Russia may be preparing a pretext to use chemical weapons. ""We see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext accusing Ukraine, the United States and NATO allies of preparing to use chemical and biological weapons,"" he told reporters after a NATO summit in Brussels.

""Our top military commander ... has activated NATO's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense elements and allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defenses,"" he said.

He reiterated the significant impact any use of chemical weapons would have on the course of events, not just in Ukraine, but also in neighboring countries. He also stressed the continuity of NATO's Open Door policy, which has been one of Moscow's main complaints and justifications for its invasion of Ukraine.

Asked whether NATO would provide Ukraine with the list of weapons and equipment requested by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Stoltenberg said that alliance members are already supplying weapons and equipment, but ""at the same time, we have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe.""

NATO pledges more support for Ukraine

Stoltenberg said that the alliance will increase its support for Ukraine as well as its deployments in Eastern Europe during a press conference that came after an emergency session of NATO member-state leaders.

Stoltenberg's comments coincided with the release of a statement from the alliance as well as the announcement that he will stay on for an extra year due to the invasion, delaying his plan to step down from the position.

NATO members are ""equipping Ukraine with significant military supplies including anti-tank and air defense systems and drones, which are proving highly effective, as well as substantial financial and humanitarian aid,"" Stoltenberg said.

""Today we agreed to do more, including cyber security assistance and equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear threats,"" he added.

The NATO chief warned against escalating the war and pledged more support for other countries facing threats from Russia, namely Georgia and Bosnia.

US to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees

The US is expected to announce a plan to take in up to 100,000 Ukrainians who have fled the war, news agencies reported on Thursday.

More than 3.5 million people have fled the country so far, mainly into neighboring Poland.

Not all the Ukrainians would go through the US refugee program, Reuters reported, some would be taken in on family-based visas.

Red Cross chief holds talks with Russia's Lavrov

The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, has held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, saying afterward they had discussed the need to protect civilians during Moscow's operations in Ukraine.

""We certainly also discussed the international humanitarian law and provisions of the Geneva Convention in regard to conduct of hostilities ... that civilians must be protected,"" Maurer told a news conference.

""We think we are confronted with a very complex front line at the present moment in Ukraine which sees a lot of people trapped and people caught people in between front lines,"" Maurer added.

""It's not possible to think about access or evacuation, either in Mariupol or another place, if we don't have a solid ... and detailed agreement between the militaries on the ground,"" he said.

The southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol has been particularly devastated by street fighting and bombardments, with hundreds of thousands of people believed to be trapped inside buildings, with no access to food, water, power or heat. Numerous attempts to create humanitarian corridors for evacuation have been thwarted by continued fighting.

Prior to the talks, Maurer had said he would raise the issues of prisoners of war, missing people and detained civilians in his talks with Lavrov in Moscow.

Lavrov said, ""We hope the efforts of the ICRC will bear fruit"" and called the organization an ""impartial and independent intermediary"".

""Unfortunately we don't have any particular basis to rely on conscientious fulfillment by the Kyiv authorities,"" he added.

Zelenskyy requests further military aid from NATO

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on NATO to provide ""unrestricted"" military aid while speaking to representatives of the alliance over video-link.

""To save people and our cities, Ukraine needs military assistance without restrictions. In the same way that Russia is using its full arsenal without restrictions against us,"" he said.

He thanked the members of the alliance for the support they have already provided, but said it was not enough. ""You can give us one percent of all your planes. One percent of your tanks. One percent!""

During the call, Zelenskyy also accused Russia of using phosphorus weapons — which ignite in contact with air and can burn for a long time as well as causing severe burns on people it comes into contact with.

""This morning, by the way, phosphorus bombs were used. Russian phosphorus bombs. Adults were killed again and children were killed again,"" Zelensky said.

""The Alliance can once more prevent the death of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from Russian occupation, by giving us all the weapons we need.""

Thousands of tons of German aid sent to Ukraine by train

Around 10,000 metric tons of essential aid has been sent to Ukraine from Germany via the ""rail bridge"" between the two countries, German Transport Minister Volker Wissing told Funke Media Group.

The trains that have been shuttling back and forth are delivering essential goods such as food, water and hygiene products, many of which had been donated according to Wissing.

""We hope this war is over soon and will do everything to ease the suffering,"" the minister said from the Berlin cargo terminal.

Zelenskyy calls for help in rebuilding in call to Swedish parliament

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to the Swedish parliament via video link on Thursday, calling on the Scandinavian country to help Ukraine rebuild after the war.

He asked for ""Swedish companies and state to come rebuild"" his country, large parts of which have been destroyed by a month of bombardments and airstrikes.

""This is a month now,"" Zelenskyy said. ""We have not seen a destruction of this scale since World War II.""

Mariupol authorities say 15,000 civilians illegally deported to Russia

Ukrainian officials say Russian forces have illegally carried some 15,000 of the besieged city's residents across the border to Russia.

""Residents of the Left Bank district are beginning to be deported en masse to Russia. In total, about 15,000 Mariupol residents have been subjected to illegal deportation,"" Mariupol city council said in a statement.

Local authorities had said on Sunday that thousands had been forced across the border but did not give a precise figure. Russian news agencies said at the time that several hundred ""refugees"" from the stricken city had been transported to Russia in buses in recent days.

The allegations of illegal deportations come as Ukrainian officials say civilians in Mariupol remain in dire conditions with no food, water, power or heat as Russian forces subject the city to constant bombardment.

Mariupol has suffered devastation at the hands of Russian troops

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address to Italy's parliament on Tuesday that there was ""nothing left"" in Mariupol after weeks of Russian bombs and shells falling on the city.

""We need to do more and so we need to do more economically,"" Johnson told LBC radio ahead of his attendance at a NATO summit in Brussels.

""Can we do more to stop him using his gold reserves, for instance, in addition to his cash reserves? What can we do more to sanction SWIFT?"" he said.

""My message today in NATO will be that there are ways in which the world can continue to intensify the pressure on Putin,"" he said.

Russia likely looking to send in reservists, conscripts and mercenaries

The UK Ministry of Defence said in its morning intelligence update on Thursday that it believes the Russian military has ""almost certainly suffered thousands of casualties"" during the invasion.

Therefore, Russia is probably turning to ""its reservist and conscript manpower, as well as private military companies and foreign mercenaries,"" according to the ministry.

There have already been reports of Russian mercenaries fighting in Ukraine, including the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group that has been involved in various African conflicts in recent years.

""I urge relevant countries to make a wise and responsible choice,"" he added.

Putin on Wednesday called on his government and gas giant Gazprom to make the necessary changes in a week for payment of oil and gas to be made in the faltering Russian currency instead of dollars and euros as is currently the case.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has committed a major error by invading Ukraine, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said.

Speaking ahead of an alliance summit in Brussels, Stoltenberg said, ""President Putin has made a big mistake and that is to launch a war against an independent sovereign nation. He has underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian people, the bravery of the Ukrainian people and their armed forces.""

A US defence official said Russian control in Kherson appeared to be waning as Ukrainian troops fight back.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ""The Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson back, and we would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again.

""We can't corroborate exactly who is in control of Kherson but the point is, it doesn't appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before.""

They added that if Ukrainian forces manage to regain control of the city, which is located at the mouth of the Dnieper river, Russian troops around Mikolaiv would be ""sandwiched"" between Ukrainian forces defending Mikolaiv and those in Kherson.

The official said: ""That would make it very, very difficult for them to make any kind of ground movement on Odesa. That would be a significant development, no question about that, in terms of the southern part of the war.""
