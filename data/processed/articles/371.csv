It's very unclear. Some reports are that about 20% of forces have been withdrawn, some suggest almost everything made it out in an orderly retreat. It would be somewhat ironic if the only thing the Russians did properly all war was retreat. UA is probably weakest in the kind of mobile spearhead units you need to cut off such a retreat though, and likewise air power would be lethal. It's very unclear.

Kinda hard to believe that their equipment was in poor enough shape it couldn't advance but good enough shape to reliably retreat in good order. Kinda hard to believe that their equipment was in poor enough shape it couldn't advance but good enough shape to reliably retreat in good order.

When someone is forcing you to do something dangerous, you're not very engaged in getting it done.

When you suddenly have a way out, you're working for your own goals again and motivation is no longer anathema.
