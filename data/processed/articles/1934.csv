What they did not encounter was the Russian army in any organized state. After a month of savage street fighting, one of the most pivotal battles in the war so far ended this week — at least for now — with an improbable victory in Irpin for Ukraine’s outgunned and outnumbered military. By Tuesday, Ukrainian forces had quashed any significant Russian resistance in this strategic outlying town near Kyiv, the capital.

Ukrainian counterattacks around Kyiv reportedly retook more ground, with the mayor of Irpin, a fiercely contested suburb on the northwestern edge of the capital, saying that most Russian troops had retreated, though fighting continued in some districts. If Ukrainian soldiers can maintain control of Irpin, it would be strategically important to keeping their hold on Kyiv.

“Our Irpin is liberated from Moscow’s evil,” Mayor Oleksandr Markushin of Irpin posted on Telegram on Monday. But the deputy police chief, Oleksandr Bogai, offered a more skeptical account in a telephone interview, noting that fighting continued even as most Russian troops appeared to have pulled back, and that the Russians continued to shell the town.

Diplomacy between the warring countries continued, with Russian and Ukrainian delegations arriving in Istanbul for another round of talks set to begin on Tuesday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/world/europe/irpin-donbas-poison.html

Ukraine says its forces have retaken a key suburb west of the capital Kyiv from Russian control after weeks of fierce fighting, as negotiators from both sides met for the first peace talks in two weeks in the Turkish city of Istanbul.

Troops “liberated” the suburban town of Irpin, interior minister Denys Monastyrsky said late on Monday, as Ukrainian forces clung on to the eastern port city of Mariupol in the face of the Russian onslaught.

There was no confirmation from the Russian side.

AFP journalists witnessed continued heavy shelling in the area and met fleeing residents who described hellish scenes of bombs raining from the sky and people killed while trying to escape.

“We saw those cars which tried to get out on their own, they were crushed by tanks, with people inside,” said 55-year-old Roman Molchanov, his voice cracking.

His sister added that the “Russian orcs” had “shot dead people sitting in their cars”.

Thousands of people have left Irpin since Russia began shelling the town, which is home to about 60,000 people.

Multiple Ukrainian cities remained under Russian bombardment on the eve of new face-to-face peace negotiations on Tuesday in Turkey, as Kyiv and its allies in the West seek to end the month-long war that has forced more than 10 million from their homes. About 1,119 civilians have been killed in the fighting, according to UN figures.

Western experts described the loss of Irpin as a significant setback for Russian forces, who are still trying to regroup after a failed first attempt to encircle the capital.

It is now more than a month since Russian President Vladimir Putin’s tanks rolled into Ukraine, hoping to cripple or remove the democratic government in Kyiv.

The prospects of a peaceful end to the war – or an imminent victory for either side – appear faint.

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators resumed peace talks on Tuesday, under the shadow of shock allegations that delegates were poisoned at a previous round of negotiations.

Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators suffered suspected poisoning earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The negotiators later recovered.

Sources blamed “hard-liners in Moscow who they said wanted to sabotage talks to end the war,” according to the WSJ report.

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday that the Istanbul talks would focus on easing the humanitarian situation, and sounded a note of scepticism about the hopes for success.

“If we see that the mood has changed and they are ready for a serious, substantive conversation and balanced arrangements, then things will move forward,” he said.

“If it is a repetition of their propaganda” then, he said, talks will fail again.

Putin has demanded the imposition of neutral status and recognition of the Donbas and Crimea as being no longer part of Ukraine. He is no longer repeating earlier claims that Ukraine needs to be “denazified“.

Kuleba indicated there was little room for agreement there: “We do not trade people, land and sovereignty. Our position is concrete.”

Fighting rages

On the battlefield, both sides appear determined to press where they can.

Ukrainian officials still believe Russia wants to take the capital Kyiv, dismissing suggestions the Kremlin is focused on the eastern Donbas region.

Capturing “Kyiv is essentially a captured Ukraine, and this is their goal”, said deputy defence minister Ganna Malyar, insisting Russia was still “trying to break through the corridor around Kyiv and block transport routes.”

On Monday, Russian attacks near Kyiv cut power to more than 80,000 homes, officials said, underscoring the continued peril facing the capital.

While Ukraine’s forces are counterattacking in the north, they are struggling to retain control of the southern port city of Mariupol.

Russian forces have encircled the city and embarked on a steady and indiscriminate bombardment, trapping an estimated 160,000 people with little food, water or medicine.

Ukraine’s foreign ministry called the situation “catastrophic”, saying Russia’s assault from land, sea and air had turned a city once home to 450,000 people “into dust”.

At least 5,000 people have already died, according to one senior Ukrainian official who estimated the real toll may be closer to 10,000 when all the bodies are accounted for.

“The burials stopped 10 days ago because of continued shelling,” Tetyana Lomakina, a presidential adviser now in charge of humanitarian corridors, told AFP by phone Monday.

France, Greece and Turkey are hoping to launch a mass evacuation of civilians from Mariupol within days, according to French President Emmanuel Macron, who is seeking agreement from Putin.

Western powers say they have seen evidence of war crimes, which are already being investigated by the International Criminal Court.

On Monday, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there was proof that Russian forces have used banned cluster bombs in the southern Odesa and Kherson areas.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/29/ukraine-retakes-kyiv-suburb-as-talks-resume-under-shadow

US to move troops and aircraft to Eastern Europe

US armed forces are moving aircraft and soldiers to Eastern Europe, Defense Department spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.

This includes a unit of around 200 marines which has been moved to Lithuania from Norway, Kirby said.

Ten F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets and a few C-130 Hercules transport planes, as well as some 200 associated soldiers, will be brought to Eastern Europe from the US. Kirby said that they would be moved shortly but that their precise destination remained unclear.

US says some Russian troops leaving Kyiv region

Following the announcement earlier on Tuesday that Russia would cut back on its military actions around Kyiv and Chernihiv, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that the US believed some Russian troops had already left.

""Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yes, we think so. Small numbers,"" Kirby told reporters.

""But we believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine. It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over,"" he added.

Biden voices skepticism over Russia's pledge to cut activities

US President Joe Biden said he wasn't convinced that Russia's promise to cut back military operations around Kyiv will lead to a significant change in the conflict.

""We'll see if they follow through,"" he told reporters after holding a phone call with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy.

""There seems to be a consensus that let's just see what they have to offer.""

Russian negotiators pledged to scale back hostilities near Kyiv and the city of Chernihiv during talks with Ukraine in Turkey on Tuesday.

France says no Mariupol humanitarian mission possible 'at this stage'

The conditions for carrying out a humanitarian operation sought by France to help civilians in the besieged port city of Mariupol have not been met ""at this stage,"" French President Emmanuel Macron's office said.

The French leader spoke to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in a phone call on Tuesday.

Macron had outlined the mission sought alongside Turkey and Greece to Putin, who said ""he was going to think about it"" before responding, an Elysee Palace official said.

Mariupol has been one of the worst struck cities since the start of the Ukraine war with the local mayor saying it is now ""on the brink of humanitarian catastrophe.""

The Russian president also told Macron that Ukrainian ""nationalists"" in besieged Mariupol must lay down their arms.

""It was stressed that in order to resolve the difficult humanitarian situation in this city (Mariupol), Ukrainian nationalist militants must stop resisting and lay down their arms,"" the Kremlin said in a statement about the call.

The two presidents also discussed Russia's decision to request payments in rubles for Russian gas supplies to the EU, the statement added.

Russia-backed Donetsk considers joining Russia

The head of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic — a part of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists since 2014 — has said the region will consider joining Russia, according to the Donetsk News Agency.

""As for joining the Russian Federation, as for this wish and drive, they have been obvious since 2014 — the wish to be in Russia,"" Denis Pushilin said.

Moscow recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics on February 24, just days before Russian troops invaded Ukraine.

Pushilin's comments come two days after Russian-backed rebels in Luhansk said they may hold a referendum on joining Russia. Kyiv said such a move would not have legal basis and warned of an international response.

Snake Island soldier receives medal

The Ukrainian soldier, whose comments to a Russian warship went viral, has returned home.

Roman Hrybov was taken prisoner by Russian forces while he was serving on the so-called Snake Island (Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian), a small island in the Black Sea.

A recording of Hrybov telling a Russian warship to ""go f*** yourself"" went viral.

The Ukrainian troops stationed on the island were at first presumed to have been killed in an attack. It later turned out they had been taken captive and were exchanged for Russian prisoners.

The Ukrainian military shared a picture of the soldier receiving a medal on social media. They said he has returned to ""his native Cherkasy region.""

Russia files two cases against Google over banned content

Russia has filed two legal cases against Alphabet Inc, which owns Google, for failure to remove banned information from its YouTube video-sharing platform, the country's communication regulator said on Tuesday.

Roskomnadzor accused the tech giant of blatantly promoting false content about Russia's invasion, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation.""

It said YouTube had become one of the key platforms in the ""information war"" against Moscow.

The regulator added that Google could be fined up to 8 million rubles ($91,533; €82,500), or as much as 20% of the company's annual revenue in Russia for repeat offenses.

Russia has blocked Google News and restricted access to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram

US skeptical of Russian gestures

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken questioned the seriousness of Russia's claims of progress at the Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey on Tuesday.

""I've not seen anything to suggest that this is moving forward in an effective way because we have not seen signs of real seriousness"" from Russia, Blinken said during an official visit to Morocco.

""There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does. We're focussed on the latter,"" he added.

""If they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate ""only,"" in quotation marks, the eastern part of Ukraine and the southern part of Ukraine can succeed, then once again they are profoundly fooling themselves,"" CNN quoted Blinken as saying.

He once again called on Russia to end the fighting and said the Ukrainians were engaged in negotiations ""with a gun literally to their heads.""

Asked about Russia's promise to scale back their armed forces around the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv, the spokesman said: ""We will judge [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his regime by his actions, not by his words.""

""There has been some reduction in Russian bombardment around Kyiv, largely because Ukrainian forces have been successfully pushing back the Russian offensives in the northwest of the city,"" he told reporters.

""But fighting continues. There's heavy bombardment in Mariupol and other areas. So we don't want to see anything less than a complete withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.""

Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said the Netherlands has expelled 17 Russian ""intelligence officers"" who were ""undercover as diplomats.""

""These intelligence officers are a threat to the security of [the Netherlands],"" Hoekstra wrote on Twitter.

""Experience shows that Russia does not leave such measures unanswered. We cannot speculate on that, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared for various scenarios that may occur in the near future,"" he said in a statement.

Shortly after the Dutch announcement, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes said Belgium was also expelling 21 Russian diplomats for actions related to espionage or unlawful influence peddling.

Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney later said Ireland was expelling four Russian diplomats whose activities have not been ""in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behavior.""

Poland approves law to ban Russian coal imports

Polish government spokesman Piotr Muller said the Cabinet has adopted draft legislation that will allow a ban on imports of Russian coal.

""We don't want these imports to be possible any longer, although we realize that there's a risk related to the fact that the European Union has not approved such actions to date,"" Muller told reporters in Warsaw.

Generally, the whole EU has to agree on sanctions imposed in the bloc, and Brussels could potentially punish members states acting unilaterally.

Russian representatives not welcome at Buchenwald commemoration

German officials have told Russian and Belarusian diplomatic representatives that they are not welcome at the commemoration for the 77th anniversary of the liberation of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Nazi concentration camps.

""We have informed the consular representations in writing that they are not welcome at the events,"" director of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation, Jens-Christian Wagner, said on Tuesday.

One reason for the move was the death of the 96-year-old Buchenwald camp survivor Boris Romanchenko.

Romanchenko, who had previously served as vice-president for the international committee of survivors for the two camps, was killed by Russian bombardments in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in mid-March.

The Nazi camps were liberated by US troops on April 11, 1945, shortly before the end of the Second World War.

UK detains Russian-owned superyacht

Britain has detained a Russian-owned superyacht in what it called a ""warning"" to Moscow of the consequences of invading Ukraine.

Phi is a 58.5-meter (192-foot) vessel worth $50 million (€45 million), boasting a fresh-water swimming pool. It was docked at Canary Wharf in London.

The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) said the ship is registered to a company based in the Caribbean country of St Kitts and Nevis and sails under a Maltese flag.

""The ownership of the yacht was deliberately well-hidden,"" the agency said in a statement, adding that it had ultimately uncovered that its owner was a Russian businessman.

Amnesty International accuses Russia of war crimes in Ukraine

Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of the human rights organization, told DW that Amnesty has been ""documenting an escalation of human rights and humanitarian law violations, including the indiscriminate or deliberate targeting of civilians.""

""Russia's crackdown on freedom of speech started before the aggression against Ukraine,"" Callamard said. She pointed to ""the shrinking space for independent media and dissenting voices,"" which she said goes back to at least 2021.

She added that disinformation and propaganda are part of the war, making it difficult to keep track of what is actually going on.

Russia-Ukraine talks conclude in Istanbul

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators concluded face-to-face peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday, with the Ukrainian side saying that there have been enough developments to have a meeting between the presidents of the two countries.

Russia said the talks were ""constructive,"" raising hopes that there could be progress toward ending the war.

However, Russian top negotiator Medinsky said a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is possible only if a deal has been approved by the foreign ministries of both countries.

Following the talks, Ukrainian negotiators told reporters that Kyiv would agree to a neutral status if a security guarantee system is put in place. They said, under the new system, Israel, Poland, Canada and Turkey could be among Ukraine’s security guarantors.

The neutral status would include not hosting any foreign military bases on Ukrainian territory.

There needs to be full peace across Ukraine for any final agreement with Russia to come into force, the Ukrainian side stressed, adding that a referendum would be needed in Ukraine on the terms of any final deal.

They also proposed holding consultations with Russia on the status of Crimea.

The talks on Tuesday lasted around four hours with occasional breaks. It is unclear if the discussions will continue for a second day.

Russia says rules for gas payments in rubles will be ready in days

""No one will supply gas for free, it is simply impossible, and you can pay for it only in rubles,"" Peskov told reporters on Tuesday.

He added that ""all modalities are being developed so that this system is simple, understandable and feasible for respected European and international buyers.""

Peskov's remarks came a day after Germany said the G7 nations rejected Putin's demand to pay for Russian gas in rubles. Berlin said the demand was a breach of the pre-agreed terms and conditions.

Russia says the military's main task is now to 'liberate' Donbas

Russia's defense minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that Ukraine's military capacity had been seriously degraded, the Interfax news agency reported. ""The combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus the main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas.""

Shoigu's assertion came despite Ukraine's unexpectedly strong resistance since the war began last month, which has seen Russia fail to take any major cities, and stall in advancing along multiple fronts.

However, Shoigu reiterated statements made last week by officials that the Russian military had completed the main objective of the first phase of its invasion.

The minister also stressed the change in Russia's war aims, underlining that the main task of the Russian military is now to ""liberate"" Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, part of which has been under the control of Russian proxies since 2014.

Furthermore, he warned the West that Moscow will respond appropriately if NATO supplies fighter aircraft and air defense systems to Ukraine.

""The restrictions have been in place for roughly a month, a little bit over a month, and we certainly haven't seen any indication that there's non-compliance, in fact, we've seen the reverse,"" he said.

""I think there's also a fair amount of additional self-sanctioning, if you will, by multinational companies operating in Russia,"" the official added.

""We know that Russia is quite dependent upon foreign supplies for some key inputs like semiconductors so I think it will be relatively readily apparent if there is non-compliance and the task will be to trace that back to its origin.""

IAEA: Kharkiv nuclear facility intact despite shelling

The Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi said that the ""small amount of nuclear material"" at the Kharkiv nuclear research facility ""remained intact"" despite shelling.

In a statement, Grossi said, ""Ukraine said the building, its thermal insulation and the experimental hall were damaged, but the neutron source, that contains nuclear material used to generate neutrons for research and isotope production, was not.""

Australia announces first Magnitsky sanctions

Australia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Marise Payne announced the country's first Magnitsky-style sanctions.

The newest sanctions will target ""Russian individuals responsible for the corruption that Sergei Magnitsky uncovered and those complicit in his subsequent mistreatment and death.""

In a press release, the Australian government explained Magnitsky was ""a Ukrainian-born Russian lawyer and tax advisor,"" who ""uncovered widespread corruption by Russian tax and law enforcement officials. He was imprisoned and mistreated, and died in custody in November 2009, after being refused medical treatment.""

The Australian Foreign Ministry said, ""In this first tranche, the Government will honour Mr Magnitsky and all who defend the rule of law, with targeted sanctions and travel bans against 14 Russian individuals responsible for the serious corruption that he exposed and a further 25 Russian perpetrators and accomplices of his abuse and death.""

Zelenskyy: Situation tense despite some victories

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the situation remains tense despite some Ukrainian victories following Russia's invasion of his country on February 24.

Russian forces have been repelled from the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation published via his Telegram channel.

Zelenskyy said Russian forces are attempting to regroup amid heavy losses

However, fighting continues in Kyiv as well as in other parts of the country.

Russian troops remain in control of Kyiv's northern suburbs. The situation remains ""very difficult"" in the Chernihiv, Sumy, Donbass and southern regions.

Zelenskyy added that further tightening of sanctions on Russia to include oil supplies to Europe were only likely to take place if Russia makes use of chemical weapons in its war effort.

""There are no words for that,"" Zelenskyy said.

Summary of Monday's events in Ukraine-Russia crisis

Ukrainian and Russian delegations are due to meet in Istanbul on Tuesday.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he made separate calls to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin that were progressing in a ""positive direction.''

He did not give more detail but added that he would meet Ukrainian and Russian delegations ahead of their talks.

Ukraine's foreign minister Dmtryo Kuleba said a cease-fire was the most his country could hope for from the latest peace talks with Russia.

""The minimum program will be humanitarian questions, and the maximum program is reaching an agreement on a cease-fire,"" Kuleba said. ""We are not trading people, land or sovereignty.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia expected no breakthrough at the talks.

The Financial Times reports in exchange for giving up on its plan to join NATO, Ukraine will be free to join the EU.

Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and Ukrainian peace negotiators suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning earlier this month after a meeting in Kyiv, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported.

The WSJ report said Abramovich, who accepted a Ukrainian request to help negotiate an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and at least two senior members of the Ukrainian team, were affected.

Ukrainian authorities said Russian missiles struck another fuel depot in the northwest of the country. More than 1,000 Russian mercenaries connected to the Wagner Group are deployed in eastern Ukraine, UK military intelligence said.

Russia's Novaya Gazeta newspaper said it would stop publishing until the war in Ukraine ends. The leading independent publication, edited by Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov, said it was taking the step after receiving a second warning from the media regulator Roskomnadzor.

If a media outlet receives two warnings from the communications regulator, a court can shut it down.

Meanwhile, the G7 rejected Russia's demand for gas payment in rubles.

Summary Towns and villages around Kyiv bear brunt of fighting

Ukrainian forces have largely held Russians at bay

Many residents have stayed on despite fierce clashes

Material damage extensive, but Ukrainians voice defiance

Russian setbacks around capital thwart wider objectives

LUKYANIVKA, Ukraine, March 29 (Reuters) - The burnt wreckage of two Russian tanks with blown off turrets and several armoured personnel carriers attest the ferocity of last week's clashes in Lukyanivka village just outside Kyiv. The charred corpse of a Russian soldier lies in a field nearby.

""There were mortars so strong that it was scary even in the cellar,"" local resident Valeriy Hudym told Reuters on Sunday, two days after Ukrainian soldiers seized back control of Lukyanivka in a five-hour battle with the Russians.

""Tanks were firing, artillery, and machine guns. Everything possible was there,"" Hudym said. Two Ukrainian soldiers, involved in the battle to retake the village, said the fighting was intense.

More than a month since Russia's invasion, the defence of Ukraine's capital Kyiv has played out in heavy clashes in places like Lukyanivka and the nearby town of Brovary to the east, Irpin and Bucha to the northwest and Makariv to the west.

When the histories are written such towns and villages may be minor details, but they are where the Russian advance has been halted, sometimes by small, mobile Ukrainian units wielding anti-tank weapons shipped in from abroad.

Moscow promised at peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that it would drastically scale back operations around Kyiv to help the dialogue.

In Lukyanivka, two hours' drive from the centre of Kyiv, residents recall warning Russian troops who had occupied their settlement to leave while they could.

""I have a neighbour called Svitlana. She told them openly to their face: 'Guys, go home. You will be killed here',"" Hudym said. Reuters was unable to independently confirm this.

The reversal in Lukyanivka has been repeated in areas around the northern half of the capital, as Ukrainian troops claw back territory lost in the first month of fighting in small battles, without scoring a decisive victory.

The Russian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the military situation around Kyiv.

But the small victories have dealt a psychological blow to a more powerful enemy and shown how nimble units with knowledge of the area can defend lines and even push them back, according to military experts.

They also serve strategic goals - to keep Russian artillery further from the city centre and prevent the invading army from fully encircling Kyiv, the experts said.

Cities including Kharkiv and Mariupol have suffered heavy bombardment as Russian ground advances stalled - part of what the Pentagon and other Western military officials describe as a sign of Russian frustration at the lack of progress.

Kyiv has also been struck by shells and missiles, and at least 264 civilians have been killed according to city authorities. But the scale of devastation, particularly to the city centre, is far smaller, according to witnesses.

Russia describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" with the aim of demilitarising its neighbour. It has denied targeting civilians.

In Lukyanivka, Reuters saw Ukrainian soldiers driving away two apparently serviceable Russian heavy tanks captured during the fighting.

""We knocked out the Russians. The Russians are now being moved a few kilometres away,"" said Marat Saifulin, from the Ukrainian ""Brotherhood battalion"" that took part in recapturing the village in an attack that lasted from noon until dusk.

SETBACKS AND RESISTANCE

CIA Director William Burns said in early March that the intention of Russian President Vladimir Putin was to seize Kyiv within two days of the start of the invasion on Feb. 24.

Putin and Russian officials have consistently said that Russia's military operation in Ukraine has gone according to plan.

However, two early setbacks suggested it would not be plain sailing for an available Russian force estimated by some diplomats before the war at around 190,000 troops. Russia has not given a figure for its deployment in Ukraine.

Russian paratroopers attacked Hostomel airport, a potential bridgehead northwest of Kyiv, on the first day of the invasion. But heavy fighting there slowed the Russian advance toward the capital, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Satellite imagery also captured a huge column of military hardware stretching 40 miles (64 km) and coming from a similar direction.

Seen by some Western defence officials as a major threat to Kyiv in the first days of the war, by March 10 it had largely dispersed, with some vehicles spreading into surrounding towns.

A senior U.S. defence official said in early March that Russia's advance on Kyiv, including the convoy, appeared to be stalling because of logistical problems including shortage of food and fuel, as well as low morale among some units.

Attacks by small units of Ukrainian troops on advancing tank columns, in some cases using shoulder-held anti-tank weapons such as the U.S.-made Javelin system, were also a factor in bogging down Russia's military machine.

To the east, in Brovary, a convoy of Russian tanks was repelled after several were destroyed in an ambush captured in dramatic drone footage released by pro-Ukrainian forces.

To the north in Bucha, near Irpin, the town's mayor filmed scenes of burnt out tanks and armoured vehicles still smouldering after coming under fierce attack.

In Irpin, Ukrainian forces destroyed a large bridge linking northwestern towns to Kyiv as a way of stalling the enemy's progress. On Monday, Irpin's mayor said Ukraine was back in full control. Reuters could not immediately verify his claim.

The result of the flexible defensive strategy and Russian shortcomings has been no major advances on Kyiv for several days.

In the city, where only half the peacetime population of 3.4 million remains, there have been signs of normal life returning to the streets, with some shops, restaurants and cinemas opening and people enjoying the spring sunshine in parks.

Hopes that the immediate threat to the capital may be receding were fuelled last week by the head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate.

He said that the first phase of the operation in Ukraine had largely been completed and that Russian forces would henceforth concentrate on the Donbass region in the east.

That appeared to chime with Western intelligence assessments that Russian forces had abandoned, at least for the moment, their active attempt to take Kyiv following heavy losses and unexpectedly stubborn Ukrainian defences.

PAYING PENSIONS, POOR MORALE

On many roads leading out of Kyiv, wrecked houses and debris show the price paid by those who decided to stay. Gas and electricity is often cut and there is no certainty about when and where the next missile might fall.

In Krasylivka village, 92-year-old Hanna Yevdokimova said the invasion was her third conflict after the Soviet-Finnish Winter War of 1939-1940 and World War Two, when she saw German troops march through the village.

Last week, her home was hit by missile wreckage. A twisted fragment of a Russian Kalibr missile lay 100 metres (328 ft) away in a neighbour's garden.

""What can I do? All I want is to rebuild so that I can die in my own home,"" she said.

Some residents of Lukyanivka said they spent nearly a month under Russian occupation as virtual prisoners in their own homes, their mobile phones confiscated and movement only permitted under armed escort.

Now they can come and go as they please amid badly damaged houses.

Near Makariv west of Kyiv, which is still contested, heavy shelling could be heard last week. Even so, the town's mayor Vadym Tokar travelled through surrounding villages wearing military fatigues and handing out pensions to the elderly.

Farmer Vasyl Chaylo, from Peremoha, described what he said were fearful Russian conscripts, short on rations and disciplined by tougher professional fighters.

""They are afraid. According to my observation, some of them perhaps do not want to fight and want to surrender, but they are kept in line by special forces,"" he said.

Chaylo added that he had asked tank crews who set up outside his house how long their dry rations would last and been told a week. ""They came to us on the eighth day and said that they had nothing to eat.""

Russia's defence ministry has acknowledged some conscripts have taken part in the conflict, after earlier denials by the Kremlin and military authorities. The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about rations.

Halyna Shybka, a former nurse in a military hospital in Kyiv for 25 years, ignored the entreaties of her grandchildren and remains with her husband Mykola in the house in Kalynivka, near the frontlines of Brovary, where they have lived in since 1974.

""They tried to persuade us in every way they could to leave with them, but I wanted to stay,"" she said, pouring cups of tea in her small kitchen, the sound of outgoing Ukrainian artillery fire rumbling in the background.

""This is our land, we're not going to leave.""

Germany says gas supply threatened after Moscow demands roubles

MALA ROHAN/NEAR IRPIN, Ukraine, March 30 (Reuters) - Russian forces bombarded the outskirts of Kyiv and a besieged city in northern Ukraine on Wednesday after promising to reduce attacks there in what the West dismissed as a ploy by Moscow to stem its heavy losses and regroup for other offensives.

Nearly five weeks into an invasion in which Russia has failed to capture any major city, the top U.N. human rights official said Moscow had bombed 50 hospitals as well as homes and schools across Ukraine in what may amount to war crimes. read more

Ukrainian officials called Russia out for having said on Tuesday it would curtail operations near the capital Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv ""to increase mutual trust"" for peace talks.

""It's not true,"" Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a video address to European Union regional officials. ""The whole night we listened to sirens, to rocket attacks and we listened to huge explosions east of Kyiv and north of Kyiv. There are immense battles there, people died, still die.""

Intensified bombardment could be heard in Kyiv on Wednesday morning from suburbs where Ukrainian forces have regained territory in recent days. Windows rattled from the relentless artillery on its outskirts.

Southeast of Irpin, a Kyiv suburb which has seen intense fighting for weeks, frequent shelling and ordnance exploding on the ground and in the air could be heard. Ukrainians evacuating spoke of heavy shelling north of Irpin and shells landing in Irpin itself.

Ukraine and Western leaders had cautioned that Moscow's apparent peace gesture at Tuesday's talks in Istanbul was a cover for reorganizing forces that had failed to take Kyiv.

Russia said on Wednesday its forces had achieved their objectives near Kyiv and Chernihiv and were regrouping to focus on the ""liberation"" of the breakaway eastern Donbas region. read more

The Pentagon said that Russia had started to reposition under a fifth of its forces arrayed around Kyiv, but warned Moscow was expected to refit and resupply them for redeployment. read more

OIL AND GAS SUPPLY DOUBTS

Western sanctions imposed on Russia as punishment for its invasion have largely isolated its economy from world trade but Moscow is still the biggest supplier of oil and gas to Europe. Russia's new demand for payment in roubles, rejected by the West, has raised fears of energy shortages and heightened recessionary risks in Europe.

Germany, Russia's biggest gas customer, declared an ""early warning"" on Wednesday of a possible emergency if Russia were to cut off supplies. Economy Minister Robert Habeck urged people to reduce consumption, saying ""every kilowatt-hour counts"".

Russian sources told Reuters it might keep the energy contract currency as is, with final payment in roubles. read more

Floating a potential compromise, Russian President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that payments could be made in euros and sent to Gazprombank, which would convert the money to roubles, a German government spokesperson said. read more

""Scholz did not agree to this procedure in the conversation, but asked for written information to better understand the procedure,"" the spokesperson said.

TRAPPED

In northern Ukraine, Chernihiv's Mayor Vladyslav Astroshenko said Russian bombardment of his city had intensified over the past 24 hours, with more than 100,000 people trapped inside with just enough food and medical supplies to last about another week.

""This is yet another confirmation that Russia always lies,"" he told CNN. He said 25 civilians had been injured in a mortar attack in the city centre.

Reuters could not verify the situation in Chernihiv. Russia's defence ministry did not reply to a request for comment.

Reuters journalists who entered the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, recaptured by Ukrainian forces this week, on Tuesday saw Ukrainian troops patrolling an abandoned ghost town of ruined buildings, with the body of an old man and a woman lying on the streets.

Around a quarter of Ukrainians have been driven from their homes and the United Nations said on Wednesday that the number who have fled the country had risen above 4 million. More than half of those refugees are children and the rest mostly women.

Over the past week, Ukrainian forces have recaptured towns and villages on the outskirts of Kyiv, broken the siege of the eastern city of Sumy and pushed back Russian forces in the southwest.

In the village of Mala Rohan in the eastern Kharkiv region, two burned-out tanks with their turrets ripped off stood near damaged houses. Maksym, a Ukrainian soldier, said the Russians were being pushed back ""slowly but steadily"".

""Most of them already understood that they made a huge mistake when they came here. Therefore, I think they have no chance here, we will win.""

Russia's defence ministry said the humanitarian situation in Kharkiv was getting worse and accused Ukrainian forces there of shooting at civilians, Russian news agencies reported, without presenting evidence.

Russia says it is carrying out a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Western countries say Moscow's invasion was entirely unprovoked.

The Donbas region, where Russia says it will now focus its efforts, includes the port of Mariupol, where heavy fighting was again reported on Wednesday. read more

Mariupol, which had a pre-war population of more than 400,000 people, has been laid waste in a month. The United Nations says thousands of people may have died there.

Russian forces were shelling nearly all cities along the region's frontline on Wednesday, said the governor of Donetsk, which is part of the Donbas.

Irpin gained wide attention after photos circulated of a mother and her two children who were killed by shelling as they tried to flee, their bodies lying on the pavement with luggage and a pet carrier nearby.

Announcing the liberation of the vity in a video posted to Telegram, Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn said, “We understand that there will be more attacks on our town and we will defend it courageously,” according to Reuters.

Elsewhere, at least 5,000 people have died in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion last month, a senior Ukrainian official said.

“About 5,000 people were buried, but the burials stopped 10 days ago because of continued shelling,” Tetyana Lomakina, a presidential adviser now in charge of humanitarian corridors, told AFP by phone.

She added that the number of people killed could only be estimated, with bodies stuck under the rubble.

“We could be talking about 10,000 dead,” she said.

Ukraine’s humanitarian needs are most dire in Mariupol, where Ukraine said that about 160,000 civilians remain encircled by Russian forces, desperate for food, water and medicine.

Ukraine’s foreign ministry said the situation there was “catastrophic” and Russia’s assault from land, sea, and air had turned a city once home to 450,000 people “into dust.”

Peace talks in Turkey

The mixed news from Ukraine came as a plane carrying members of a Russian delegation landed in Istanbul ahead of talks with Ukrainian negotiators aimed at ending the month-long war.

Turkey’s private DHA news agency said the Russian government plane landed at Istanbul Airport. The face-to-face talks between the two sides are scheduled to be held on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that Ukraine could declare neutrality, potentially accept a compromise on contested areas in the country’s east, and offer security guarantees to Russia to secure peace “without delay.” He said only a face-to-face meeting with Russia’s leader could end the war.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Monday that the two presidents could meet, but only after the key elements of a potential deal are negotiated.

Earlier talks have failed to make progress on ending the war that has killed thousands and driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes — including almost 4 million from their country.

NATO member Turkey has close relations with both Ukraine and Russia. Earlier this month, it hosted a meeting between the two countries’ foreign ministers.

UN humanitarian ceasefire

With talks already set in Turkey, the United Nations chief said he is launching an immediate effort to explore possible arrangements for “a humanitarian ceasefire in Ukraine.”

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday that he used his “good offices” to ask Martin Griffiths, the head of the UN’s worldwide humanitarian operations, to explore the possibility of a ceasefire with Russia and Ukraine.

He told reporters that he is appealing for “an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to allow for progress in serious political negotiations, aimed at reaching a peace agreement.”

Guterres said that since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, there has been a “senseless loss of thousands of lives,” displacement of 10 million people, systematic destruction of homes, schools and hospitals and other essential infrastructure, “and skyrocketing food and energy prices worldwide.”

A cessation of hostilities will allow humanitarian aid to be delivered and people to move safely, the secretary-general said, and “it will save lives, prevent suffering, and protect civilians.”

“I strongly appeal to the parties to this conflict, and to the international community as a whole, to work with us for peace in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and across the world,” the UN chief said.

The number of refugees who have flooded out of Ukraine is nearing 4 million, but data shows fewer people have crossed the border in recent days.

Border guards, aid agencies, and refugees say Russia’s unpredictable war on Ukraine offers few signs as to whether it is just a pause or a permanent drop-off.

In the first two weeks after the invasion, about 2.5 million people in Ukraine’s pre-war population of 44 million left the country to avoid the bombs and bloodshed. In the second two weeks, the number of refugees was roughly half that.

The total exodus through Sunday now stands at 3.87 million, according to the latest tally announced Monday from UNHCR, the UN refugee agency. In the previous 24 hours, only 45,000 people crossed Ukraine’s borders to seek safety, the slowest one-day count yet.

“People who were determined to leave when war breaks out fled in the first days,” said Anna Michalska, a spokeswoman for the Polish border guards.

UNHCR says the war has triggered Europe’s worst refugee crisis since World War II, and the speed and breadth of refugees fleeing to countries including Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary, Slovakia — as well as Russia — is unprecedented in recent times. Poland alone has taken in 2.3 million refugees and Romania nearly 600,000. The United States has vowed to take in 100,000.

A fiercer than expected Ukrainian resistance — bolstered by weapons from the US and other Western allies — has bogged Russian forces down. Russia has resorted to pummeling Ukrainian towns and cities with artillery and airstrikes.

Ukraine has banned reporting on troop and equipment movements not announced or approved by the military. Journalists who violate the law could face three to eight years in prison. In one case, a Kyiv resident was accused by the security services of posting images on TikTok showing Ukrainian military vehicles near a shopping mall that was later destroyed by a Russian missile strike.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/irpin-mayor-says-city-bordering-kyiv-liberated-from-russian-control/

What they did not encounter was the Russian army in any organized state.

After a month of savage street fighting, one of the most pivotal battles in the war ended this week — at least for now — with an improbable victory in Irpin for Ukraine’s outgunned and outnumbered military.

By Tuesday, Ukrainian forces had quashed any significant Russian resistance in this strategic outlying town near Kyiv, the capital.

Pockets of Russian soldiers remained, posing risks. A firefight erupted in the afternoon when Ukrainian soldiers destroyed a lone Russian armoured personnel carrier in an otherwise empty neighbourhood, according to a commander.

But Ukraine’s military had essentially recaptured Irpin, a town both strategically and symbolically important as the closest the Russian army had gotten to Kyiv, just 3 miles away. Its success in driving the Russians away may have factored into the peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on Tuesday when the two sides achieved what appeared to be their most substantive progress to date.

Moscow promised to reduce “by multiples” the intensity of its military activity around Kyiv, an area that includes Irpin, in effect acknowledging that its advance toward the capital had stalled and was at least in some places being pushed back.

With superior numbers and weaponry, Russia could always decide to mount another assault on Irpin. And Ukrainian security experts expressed scepticism about Russia’s pledge to pull back. “They will not abandon plans to take the capital,” said Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of Ukraine’s Security and Defense Council.

Still, some people saw the recapture of Irpin as a moral victory, even if street fighting continues in the town and the military gains may be tentative.

Kyiv was always the biggest prize of all for the Russian military, as the seat of government and a city ingrained in both Russian and Ukrainian identity. But the Ukrainian military’s performance in the vicious street fighting in an arc of outlying towns and villages became emblematic of the challenges Russian forces would face as they attempted to encircle or capture the capital.

“Today we have good news,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a videotaped address Monday. “Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, regaining control over Ukrainian territory.”

Mr Zelensky said the town of Irpin was “liberated.” He added, “Well done. I am grateful to everyone who worked for this result.”

Here, as elsewhere in the fighting around Kyiv, the Ukrainian military achieved its battlefield success by deploying small, fast-moving units largely on foot that staged ambushes or defended sites with the benefit of local knowledge. Many such units are based in central Kyiv, commuting to the war zone by car.

The reconnaissance unit that patrolled Irpin on Tuesday, a part of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, uses as its base a shuttered bar in Kyiv, now cluttered with sleeping bags, boxes of ammunition and hand grenades.

At dawn on a clear, cold morning Tuesday, the soldiers strapped on body armour and pouches of ammunition, with a crackling noise of Velcro, then jumped in place to ensure their gear was well attached. The bar’s stereo played Ukrainian folk songs.

The front in Irpin was a quick drive away. The soldiers filtered into the town in small groups of three or four, to avoid drawing Russian artillery, then regrouped in a maze of back streets.

“We are defending our land,” said a commander of one of the two squads, consisting of eight men each. He asked to be identified only by his first name, Bohdan. While the Russian military has pulled back in force, he said, Ukrainian soldiers still must search house to house in the city to flush out pockets of remaining enemy soldiers.

“We move into a neighborhood and if there is contact, we fire or call in artillery,” he said of these operations. “If there is no contact, well, then it is clear this territory is again ours.”

The mayor of Irpin, a once quiet and leafy suburb with a prewar population of about 70,000, said that all but about 4,000 civilians had fled. The patrol encountered only one elderly man, who waved from behind a window of a house.

In a town park, the Ukrainian patrol found a destroyed Russian armoured personnel carrier, burned in places to a rich orange colour. Besides the vehicle was the traditional blue-and-white undershirts used by Russian soldiers called telnyashkas. Elsewhere, they found a cardboard box labelled Russian army food. “Individual Food Ration,” the label said. “Not for Sale.”

The soldiers took selfies beside the incinerated armoured personnel carrier. Some sank to the pine duff to rest, gazing at the spectacle of the destroyed vehicle where Russian soldiers had died. The bodies had been retrieved earlier, though by whom was unclear.

“I don’t see the Russians as enemies,” said a Ukrainian soldier who offered only his first name, Hennady, out of concern for his safety. “They are just inert people, doing things without knowing what they are doing.”

The day had been quiet but suddenly shifted with a cacophony of heavy machine-gun fire and explosions from rocket-propelled grenades as the squad led by Bohdan, which had remained behind, encountered a Russian armoured personnel carrier. Why it remained in this place, otherwise empty of Russian soldiers, was unclear. Later, a commander said the vehicle was destroyed.

Serhiy, one of the soldiers, offered a more skeptical assessment of Ukrainian gains in Irpin. While perhaps the largest occupied town was recaptured, he said, Ukraine’s control was uncertain.

“We have a tentative front line” now outside Irpin, he said, “but the key word is tentative.”

“Their goal is Kyiv,” he added. “They will come back. They will need to cover this ground again.”

The Russian defense ministry has decided to ""radically, at times, reduce military activity"" in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv, deputy defense minister Alexander Fomin said, state media RIA reported. The ministry's Telegram channel also said that Moscow would ""drastically reduce military activity"" in the cities.

The announcement comes after Ukrainian and Western intelligence assessments suggested in recent days that Russia's advance on Kyiv was stalling.

Talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul, Turkey on Tuesday covered an array of important issues, including the future of the eastern Donbas region, the fate of Crimea, a broad alliance of security guarantors and a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Fomin told reporters that the ongoing discussions regarding the ""neutrality and non-nuclear status of Ukraine"" had contributed to the decision. More details on the steps to reduce hostilities will follow after the Russian delegation returns from Istanbul, Fomin said in remarks carried by Russian state news agency TASS.

Despite the announcement, intense fighting continued around the suburbs of Kyiv on Tuesday afternoon, especially in the northwest and northeast of the city.

Ukraine echoed the announcement regarding the reduction in military action, saying some Russian troops were pulling back from Kyiv and Chernihiv.

""The Russian enemy did not meet the goal of its offensive operation,"" the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in an official Facebook update Tuesday, adding that ""certain units"" of Russia's military were withdrawing from battlefronts in the cities.

However it warned of a ""high risk"" of Russian troops attacking military and civilian infrastructure. The Russian military, it claimed, was struggling to reinforce and rotate in new soldiers, due to the ""refusal of personnel to participate in the so-called special operation,"" and are ""not able to staff even one battalion-tactical group.""

Brig. Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency, said Russia's operations around Kyiv had failed and it was now impossible for the Russian army to overthrow the Ukrainian government. Putin's war is now focused on the south and the east of the country, he said.

""There is reason to believe that he is considering a 'Korean' scenario for Ukraine,"" said Budanov. ""That is, [Russian forces] will try to impose a dividing line between the unoccupied and occupied regions of our country. In fact, it is an attempt to create North and South Korea in Ukraine.""

Still, enough progress was made during Tuesday's talks between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations to allow Putin and Zelensky to meet, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said.

Speaking in Istanbul after the talks between the two sides ended, Podolyak said there was now a ""likelihood"" that the two presidents may meet. ""We have documents prepared now which allow the presidents to meet on a bilateral basis,"" he said.

Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti, citing the Russian delegation, also reported the possibility of a meeting between Putin and Zelensky. The head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, called the negotiations ""constructive,"" RIA reported.

Podolyak also said that talks between the two parties will ""continue online 24/7,"" adding that Ukraine needs ""clear legal wording.""

He referred to talks about the status of Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014.

""It was agreed in bilateral format to take a pause for 15 years and conduct bilateral talks on the status of these territories (Crimea and Sevastopol),"" he said.

Ukraine and the West have refused to recognize the Russian annexation of the Crimean peninsula, and the pause could be a formula for taking the issue off the table for now.

Podolyak added that they had separately discussed that ""no military hostilities"" take place over those 15 years.

The issue of security guarantees was also discussed. Another member of the Ukrainian team, Davyd Arakhamia said, ""We insist that this be an international treaty, signing all the guarantors of security, which will be ratified."" This would be comparable to NATO's Article 5, which enshrines the principle of collective defense, he said.

Podolyak also said that both sides are still ""discussing a humanitarian ceasefire,"" stressing there are ""many places where humanitarian corridors are needed.""

Over 3.9 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the start of the war, according to UNHCR.

Chernihiv, which lies about halfway between Kyiv and the Russian border, has endured intense shelling in recent weeks. Videos geolocated by CNN show heavy damage in civilian areas.

On Saturday, Chernihiv Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko announced the city was surrounded by Russian forces, leaving no safe pathways in or out.

He told CNN on Tuesday that between 300 and 400 people, mostly civilians, had been killed in the last three weeks.

""We don't have the exact figure because we can only count those who died in a hospital, but if people die from an explosion, we cannot always identify them,"" Atroshenko said.

Shifting strategies

The United States also believes Russia is executing a major strategy shift and withdrawing some forces from the area around Kyiv, two senior US officials told CNN on Tuesday.

The Russian forces are now pulling back in some areas of the north to focus on gains in the south and east, the US believes. The US has already observed these movements underway, including Russian Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) leaving the surrounding areas around Kyiv, according to the US intelligence.

In the US view, this is not a short-term adjustment to regroup, but a longer-term move as Russia comes to grips with failure to advance in the north.

The US assesses Russia will cover their retreat with air and artillery bombardment of the capital, one of the officials said. US officials caution that Russia could always reverse again if the battle conditions allow.

Russia's suggestion of a reduction in its military action was met with cynicism in the West.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had not seen signs the talks between the two sides were ""moving forward in an effective way.""

""There is what Russia says, and there is what Russia does. We're focused on the latter,"" Blinken said.

The UK agreed with those sentiments, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman saying on Tuesday that Britain will judge Russia by its actions rather than words and that they do not want to see anything less than a ""complete withdrawal"" of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory.

Meanwhile, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu said ""consensus and common understanding"" was reached between the opposing delegations on some issues, hailing progress made in particular on the ""top priority of achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible to pave the way for a permanent political solution.""

The ""trickier"" issues are now to be discussed at higher levels, with a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian Foreign Ministers to ""make final adjustments to the common approach,"" he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/russia-reduce-assault-kyiv-plan-intl/index.html
