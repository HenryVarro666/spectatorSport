Ukrainian officials accused Russian soldiers of stealing Ukrainian uniforms and vehicles early Friday and using them to lead a convoy towards the capital, Kyiv.

In a Facebook post made around 9 a.m. local time, Deputy Defense Minister Anna Malyar claimed that Russian forces ""seized two Ukrainian army vehicles and changed into Ukrainian uniforms.""

At the time, they were ""moving at speed to the center of Kiev"" from the side of Oblon, a district to the north of the city.

""They are followed by a column of Russian military trucks,"" she added. ""They will surely be destroyed.""

It came on the second day of President Vladimir Putin's all-out invasion of the country.

Malyar's claim was repeated on Facebook by the Ukrainian State Service for the Special Communications and Information Protection. It accused Russia of ""cunningly trying to break into Kyiv.""

The vehicles stolen were two armored personnel carriers and three military trucks, the service said.

The service also added a video which purports to show the convoy, which Insider was unable to verify. The grainy footage appears to be video of a surveillance monitor, showing two APCs and an unidentifiable vehicle speeding along a wide street.

According to Kyiv Independent reporter Anastasiia Lapatina, the Russian soldiers were ""neutralized."" She did not provide a source.

Representatives for the Ministry of Defense and the Special Communications Office did not immediately respond to Insider's request for further details.

The accusation comes after CNN reported large explosions in the capital overnight.

International opinion is divided on whether disguising oneself as the enemy constitutes a war crime.

This morning, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and there was heavy fighting between the troops of both countries.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the invading troops were targeting civilians and explosions could be heard in Kyiv.

The pre-dawn blasts in Kyiv set off day 2 of the Russian invasion ordered by President Vladimir Putin in defiance of Western warnings.

""Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,"" Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba posted on Twitter after the initial explosions were heard.

""Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one.""

Zelensky then delivered a video message in which he railed against the Russian troops.

""They say that civilian objects are not a target for them. But this is another lie of theirs. In reality, they do not distinguish between areas in which they operate,"" Zelensky said.

""Ukrainian air defence systems are defending our skies,"" he said. ""Ukrainians are demonstrating heroism"".

Leading away from the site were bloody footprints.

The fighting, part of a seesaw battle over two nights in the northern parts of Kyiv, left Russian trucks and a tracked vehicle smoldering on a highway. And it signaled that, though vastly outgunned, Ukraine’s army and a growing corps of civilian volunteers are mounting a spirited defense of the capital.

While military experts say the odds are stacked against them, for now the combined Ukrainian defense forces have defied expectations by slowing and in some cases halting the Russian army’s advance, apparently upsetting Moscow’s war plans. After three days of battle, Russia has yet to take any major cities.

The change to a war footing has been swift, for some almost bewilderingly so. What just three days ago had been a bustling, modern European capital, with copious restaurants, bars and cafes, slipped into an eerie war footing faster than seemingly imaginable.

Kyiv residents took shelter to the sound of explosions as Ukraine’s army said it had held back an assault on the capital, but was fighting Russian “sabotage groups” which had infiltrated the city.

Moscow said it had fired cruise missiles at military targets and would “develop the offensive from all directions” after accusing Ukraine of having “rejected” talks.

But, on day three of Russia’s invasion, a defiant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed his country would never give in to the Kremlin.

Zelensky spoke in a video message, wearing olive green military-style clothing, and looking tired, but determined.

“I am here. We will not lay down any weapons. We will defend our state, because our weapons are our truth,” the 44-year-old said. “Our truth is that this is our land, our country, our children, and we will protect all of this.”

He later said Ukraine had “derailed” the Russian plan of overthrowing him and urged Russians to pressure Putin into stopping the conflict.

Ignoring warnings from the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin unleashed a full-scale invasion that the UN refugee agency said has forced almost 116,000 people to flee to neighboring countries.

In Kyiv, residents took shelter in the subway system and in cellars and basements.

“We thought something like this might happen, but we were hoping until the end that it wouldn’t,” Irina Butyak told AFP in one shelter.

“We were hoping that common sense and common decency would prevail. Well, it didn’t,” the 38-year-old teacher said.

Thousands of refugees made their way to the Polish border city of Przemysl by train.

“We don’t want to be running from country to country and asking for support, but support is really needed this time,” one refugee, who only gave her first name, Anna, told AFP.

In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron warned that the world must brace for a long war.

“This crisis will last, this war will last and all the crises that come with it will have lasting consequences,” Macron said. “We must be prepared.”

After speaking to Macron, Zelensky tweeted to thank “partners” for sending weapons and equipment.

In the latest contribution from Washington, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $350 million in additional military equipment.

NATO has said it is deploying its rapid response force of 40,000 troops to eastern Europe for the first time, but the Western military alliance has made clear it will not send any troops to Ukraine.

In the early hours of Saturday, AFP reporters in Kyiv heard occasional blasts of what soldiers said were artillery and Grad missiles being fired in an area northwest of the city center. There were also loud explosions in the center.

Emergency services said a high-rise apartment block was hit by shelling overnight, posting a picture that showed a hole covering at least five floors blasted into the side of the building.

Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said the building had been hit by a missile.

“The enemy is trying to break into the city, in particular from Gostomel, Zhytomyr, where the aggressors are neutralized,” Klitschko said, referring to two settlements to the northwest and west of the city.

“Now in Kyiv there are, unfortunately, sabotage groups, there were several clashes,” he said.

Hours later, AFP saw a destroyed Ukrainian military truck in the city center and a civilian volunteer digging a trench for soldiers.

Ukrainian army tanks were also seen maneuvering all over the center but the streets were mostly empty and the center silent except for the sound of air raid sirens and birdsong.

The city said it was toughening a curfew in place and anyone on the streets after 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) would be considered “members of the enemy’s sabotage and reconnaissance groups.” The curfew will last until 8 a.m. on Monday.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, AFP saw traces of an airstrike on a military base near the village of Rozsishki in central Ukraine, including two destroyed trucks.

At the entrance to several villages and towns on the way to Lviv, men in civilian clothes could be seen manning improvised concrete barriers.

When he announced the beginning of the assault Thursday, Putin said it was to defend Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.

The rebels have been fighting Ukrainian government forces for eight years in a conflict in which more than 14,000 people have been killed.

Putin called the current conflict a “special military operation” and Russia’s communications regulator on Saturday told independent media to remove reports describing it as an “assault, invasion, or declaration of war.”

Russia has brushed off international condemnation and increasingly stringent sanctions adopted by the US, Canada, Britain and the European Union, including against Putin himself and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Moscow said sanctioning the pair was “a demonstration of the complete impotence of the foreign policy” of the West.

Zelensky has called on Western allies to go further by expelling Moscow from the SWIFT banking transfer system — a move that would cripple Russia’s trade with most of the world.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki slammed countries such as Germany for resisting the move.

“There is no time today for the kind of unyielding egoism that we see in certain Western countries, including here in Germany unfortunately,” Morawiecki said in Berlin ahead of a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.

Within an hour, the minister updated the post to say that there had been no damage and the vehicles have stopped.

Ukrainian reporter Anastasiia Lapatina later said the group of disguised Russian soldiers had been “neutralised”.

The reports came as Russia’s invasion on Ukraine entered its second day, with attacks on the country resuming at 4am local time.

Explosions sounded before dawn on Friday in Kyiv and gunfire was later heard near the government quarter as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting and Ukraine's president pleaded for international help to fend off an attack that could topple his democratically elected government and cause massive casualties.

The Ukrainian military said a group of Russian spies and saboteurs had been seen in a district of Kyiv about three miles north of the centre, and police told people not to exit a subway station in the city centre because there was gunfire in the area.

Elsewhere in the capital, soldiers established defensive positions at bridges, and armoured vehicles rolled down the streets, while many residents stood uneasily in doorways of their apartment buildings.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday said his country has been “left alone” to defend itself, as Moscow launched a full-scale military offensive that left over 137 Ukrainians, including civilians, dead.

The clash saw at least two people gunned down in a stolen Ukrainian army truck in a car park in front of a large apartment block in Obolon, found north of Kyiv.

As the sound of gunshots echoed off the nearby buildings, a tank - said to have been stolen by Russians - also crashed and crushed a civilian car on the road running past the car park.

Miraculously the driver - an elderly person - survived the shocking smash, and rescuers were later able to free the from the wreckage.

The two incidents were initially reported separately, but a new video clip posted to social media has revealed they were in fact linked, and part of the same skirmish.

Aftermath: A Ukrainian military medic approaches the bodies of Russian servicemen wearing a Ukrainian army uniforms lying beside and inside a vehicle after they were shot during a skirmish in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv

Footage captured through one of the apartments overlooking the car park shows the military truck carrying an artillery gun rolling from the road, over a pathway and into the car park - all while being peppered with shots.

The windows of the truck have been shot out, and the large khaki-green truck comes to a slow stop in the middle of the car park.

There, one man wearing camouflage slumps from the rear of the truck and onto the ground below while being shot at, apparently injured.

After a few seconds of struggle, the man comes a stop and is shown lying motionless on the floor having being shot dead.

A Ukrainian soldier is shown advancing on the truck from the opposite side of the car park, while shots can still be heard ringing out.

As the soldier closes in, a large tank is then shown speeding down the road that runs past where the truck came to a stop.

The tank suddenly swerves to its left into the path of an on-coming civilian sedan that is being driven in the opposite direct, smashing into it at speed.

The incident, recorded from multiple angles, saw an armoured truck driving down a main road leading through a residential area. As the armoured vehicle came close to the civilian car, it suddenly swerved towards it - giving the driver little time to react

The huge armoured vehicle rolls over the top of the car, crushing it under its weight, and comes to a stop with some of the sedan still underneath.

Despite the huge crash behind him, the Ukrainian soldier is shown again inching closer to the truck. Meanwhile, the tank reverses back off the car - which had been shunted backwards onto tram tracks - and crushing it a second time.

It is unclear what caused the tank to swerve, but shots can still be heard in the lead up to the crash, suggesting it might have been targeted by gunfire.

Pictures of the scene after the skirmish and crash bring some order to the chaos.

In addition to the man who was shot dead on the ground next to the truck, the driver of the truck was also killed, presumably while driving the vehicle.

Photographs from the scene show him slumped over in the truck's cabin.

Miraculously, reports said that the driver of the car survived the shocking crash, with a further video (pictured) showing people working desperately to free them from the wreckage

It was later reported that the pair were Russian servicemen dressed in military fatigues in an apparent bid to sneak into Kyiv. This was not immediately verified.

Across the road, the pictures showed the destroyed sedan, which was almost completely flattened by the armoured truck.

The windscreen was flat and level with the bonnet, which was also crumpled. The engine was also exposed.

The pictures showed the person must have been able to lean down into their seat and across the passenger seat in order avoid being crushed.

Miraculously, reports said that the driver of the car survived the shocking crash, with a further video showing people working desperately to free them from the wreckage.

Using tools including, an axe and a crowbar, a group of men are shown in a video working to get the door loose so they can rescue the person, who was trapped in the car that is almost completely destroyed.

Viktor Berbash, 58, a local resident, told The Sun that he went to his balcony after he heard gunshots early on Friday.

'I saw an armoured vehicle and there was automatic fire. And here this car, with probably an anti-aircraft gun on it, was already here,' he told the newspaper.

'Two armoured vehicles were driving along the road, and the second of them deliberately drove into the oncoming lane,' he added.

'It was not by chance, it was for fun, there was no need for this. And it just ran into this car. Stopped, reversed over it again and drove on.'

Multiple video clips of the incident were shared on social media, with those posting it on Twitter reporting they were recorded in Obolon, found north of Kyiv.

One angle was taken from a window overlooking the street. While captured from a distance, the video shows the truck suddenly swerve into the car.

Another angle, taken from a window overlooking the multi-lane road, showed the aftermath of the crash, capturing the armoured vehicle reversing off the car.

Users on Twitter said that the armoured vehicle that crashed into the car appeared to be a 9K35 Strela-10 - a short-range surface-to-air missile system.

Missiles pounded Ukraine's capital on Friday as Russian forces pressed their advance and authorities in Kyiv said they were preparing for an assault aimed at overthrowing the government.

Air raid sirens wailed over Kyiv, a European city of three million people, and some residents sheltered in underground metro stations, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion that has shocked the world.

Ukrainian officials said a Russian aircraft had been shot down and crashed into a building in Kyiv overnight, setting it ablaze and injuring eight people.

A senior Ukrainian official said Russian forces would enter areas just outside the capital later on Friday and that Ukrainian troops were defending positions on four fronts despite being outnumbered.

Kyiv city council warned residents of the Obolon district, near an air base seized on Thursday by Russian paratroopers, to stay indoors because of 'the approach of active hostilities'.

Windows were blasted out of a 10-storey apartment block near Kyiv's main airport, where a two-metre crater filled with rubble showed where a shell had struck before dawn. A policeman said people were injured there but not killed.

'How we can live through it in our time? What should we think. Putin should be burnt in hell along with his whole family,' said Oxana Gulenko, sweeping broken glass from her room.

A neighbour, Soviet army veteran Anatoliy Marchenko, 57, could not find his cat that had run away during the shelling.

'I know people there, they are my friends,' he said of Russia. 'What do they need from me? A war has come to my house.'

Witnesses said loud explosions could be heard in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city, close to Russia's border, and air raid sirens sounded over Lviv in the west. Authorities reported heavy fighting in the eastern city of Sumy.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people have fled the major cities.

Dozens have been reported killed. Russian troops seized the Chernobyl former nuclear power plant north of Kyiv as they advanced on the city from Belarus. Ukraine said radiation levels were elevated there.

U.S. officials believe Russia's initial aim is to topple President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and 'decapitate' his government. Zelenskiy said the troops were coming for him, but he would stay in Kyiv.

'(The) enemy has marked me down as the number one target,' Zelenskiy said in a video message. 'My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.'

Russia launched its invasion by land, air and sea on Thursday following a declaration of war by Putin, in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

Putin says Ukraine is an illegitimate state carved out of Russia, a view Ukrainians see as aimed at erasing their more than thousand-year history.

Putin's full aims remain obscure. He says he does not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and remove its leaders.

But it is not clear how a pro-Russian leader could be installed without holding much of the country. Russia has floated no name of such a figure and none has come forward.

After Moscow denied for months it was planning an invasion, news that Putin had ordered one came as a shock to Russians accustomed to viewing their ruler of 22 years as a cautious strategist. Many Russians have friends and family in Ukraine.

Russia has cracked down on dissent and state media have relentlessly characterised Ukraine as a threat, but thousands of Russians took to the streets to protest against the war. Hundreds were swiftly arrested.

Russian forces closed in on Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday, but dawn brought limited clarity about how far the invading troops had penetrated into the Ukrainian capital, where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had vowed defiance through the night.

""We must survive this night,” Zelenskyy – who told Ukrainians earlier that Russia has marked him as “target No. 1” – said in a video message before morning arrived in Kyiv.

As Saturday began, Zelenskyy tweeted that he had started “a new day on the diplomatic frontline” with a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, with “weapons and equipment from our partners” on the way.

But the danger remained far from over to the former Soviet republic. Photos from Ukraine detailed destruction by Russian troops and bombs, with Ukrainian citizens huddled in underground bomb shelters or trying to flee their country to safety, carrying family members and what possessions they could. Authorities in Kyiv described fighting in the streets and urged residents to seek shelter.

U.S. President Joe Biden was slated to meet with his national security team on Saturday morning; the U.S. and other nations have imposed sanctions on Russia and on its president, Vladimir Putin, in the hopes that the economic price will force Russia from its current path.

Dawn breaks in Kyiv

As dawn broke in Kyiv, it was not immediately clear how far the soldiers had advanced. Skirmishes reported on the edge of the city suggested that small Russian units were probing Ukrainian defenses to clear a path for the main forces.

But the swift movement of the troops after less than three days of fighting further imperiled a country clinging to independence in the face of a broad Russian assault, which threatened to topple the democratic government and scramble the post-Cold War world order.

The street clashes followed fighting that pummeled bridges, schools and apartment buildings, and resulted in hundreds of casualties.

President refuses to flee, urges Ukraine to 'stand firm'

Russian troops stormed toward Ukraine’s capital early Saturday as explosions reverberated through the city and the president urged the country to “stand firm” against the siege that could determine its future. He refused American help to evacuate, saying: “The fight is here.”

Hundreds of casualties were reported in the fighting, which included shelling that sliced through a Kyiv apartment building and pummeled bridges and schools. There also were growing signs that Russia may be seeking to overthrow Ukraine’s government, which U.S. officials have described as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ultimate objective.

The assault represented Putin's boldest effort yet to redraw the world map and revive Moscow’s Cold War-era influence. It triggered new international efforts to end the invasion, including direct sanctions on Putin.

As his country confronted explosions and gunfire, and as the fate of Kyiv hung in the balance, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a bleak statement that multiple cities were under attack.

“This night we have to stand firm,” he said. ""The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”

Russian forces have reportedly moved in closer to Kyiv early Saturday morning, and explosions were seen and heard in parts of the capital suggesting an escalation of fighting with Ukrainian defenders, according to CNN.

The cable network reported that operations by Ukrainian forces to repel the Russian advance were intensifying in the early morning hours of Saturday, Kyiv time, not long after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy warned that the battle could be over by morning.

""This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,"" Zelenskyy said in a late-night video message Friday that was widely circulated on Twitter.

CNN teams in the capital reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city. And Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications said clashes were underway in an eastern suburb as Russian forces appeared to be closing in on Kyiv from at least three sides.

Earlier Saturday morning, the State Service of Special Communications reported: “Explosions in Kyiv. What is known? The enemy is trying to attack CHP-6 near Troieschyna. The Armed Forces give battle. Resistance continues in Vasylkiv, where enemy troops are trying to land.”

""They just started shooting. It's scary, you don't know where it's going to go.

10 min ago there was a lot (of shooting); many rockets . It's silent now, and we are waiting. We will go down with a neighbor to the entrance to the first floor and we will sit there. It seems safer.""

""I have my car downstairs full of gas. I put my documents, money and some stuff in a little bag. In any moment i can take my bags, my cats, and run away if it is too scary to stay. ... Maybe I will go to the center of Ukraine. Somewhere where it is more safe. Mostly people are going to western Ukraine like Lviv. But right now I can only go through Kyiv because it is blocked any other way. Either by Russian troops on one side, or (on another road) the bridge was blown up to keep Russian troops from going over the road to Kyiv. So, I have only one way out from my city.""

Unclear if Japan to join in Russia sanctions

Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi says he spoke with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on the phone Saturday and agreed they must respond to Russian invasion of Ukraine properly to prevent it from becoming “a wrong lesson” because of its potential influence in Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.

Hayashi declined to comment if Japan plans to join the United States, Britain and the European Union in imposing sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He said Japan will closely stay in touch with other Group of Seven members and the international society while watching the development.

Russian troops march on

The Russian military said Friday it had encircled the cities of Sumy and Konotop in northeastern Ukraine, but was “taking steps to ensure civilians’ safety.”

Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces have so far knocked out 211 Ukrainian military installations, including 17 command centers, 19 air defense missile systems, 39 radar units, 67 tanks and six warplanes. The Russian military also said it seized a strategic airport outside Kyiv, allowing it to quickly build up forces to take the capital.

Late Friday, the Russian military said it has taken over Melitopol, a city near the Azov Sea. The claim could not immediately be independently verified.

Meanwhile, a senior U.S. defense official said it’s estimated that Russia has now launched more than 200 missiles into Ukraine and some have hit residential areas, although it was unclear if they were deliberately targeted.

But U.S. defense officials believe the Russian offensive has encountered considerable resistance and is proceeding slower than Moscow had envisioned.

Mapping and tracking Russia's invasion of Ukraine

Ukraine’s military reported shooting down an II-76 Russian transport plane carrying paratroopers near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Kyiv, an account confirmed by a senior American intelligence official. It was unclear how many were on board. Transport planes can carry up to 125 paratroopers.

""We must survive this night”

The U.S. and its European allies moved to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin Friday as Russia's military pushed further into Ukraine in an invasion that threatened to topple its democratic government.

The White House announced the new sanctions after President Joe Biden met with fellow NATO heads of state to discuss the mounting crisis.

Ukrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on their side and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures. Bridges and schools have been damaged in the shelling, which also sliced through a Kyiv apartment building.

As Russian troops neared the capital, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to stay and fight - and beckoned his fellow countrymen to do the same.

“You can not give up the capital,"" he said in a video message. ""We must survive this night.”

The crisis has roiled the globe since Putin, in the pre-dawn hours of Moscow on Thursday, announced in a televised address that he was launching a military operation against Ukraine.

International backlash followed swiftly, with sanctions by the United States and a host of other countries. Biden said the new economic measures would ""limit Russia's ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen to be part of the global economy.""

But, so far, those sanctions appear to have had little effect on Russia's attempt to take over the one-time Soviet Republic that has expressed a desire to someday join NATO.

• MOUNTING DEATH TOLL: Zelenskyy announced that 137 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians have been killed with hundreds more wounded.

• WHERE IS THE FIGHTING? Explosions sounded before dawn in Kyiv and gunfire was reported in several areas, as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting and Ukraine's president pleaded for international help to fend off the attack.

• WHERE ARE UKRAINIANS GOING? Poland’s Border Guard says that some 29,000 people were cleared to enter through the country’s land border with neighboring Ukraine on Thursday, the day Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began.

Russia vetoes UN Security Council resolution that it stop attacking Ukraine; China abstains

As expected, Russia vetoed a UN resolution on Friday evening demanding that Moscow stop its attack on Ukraine immediately and withdraw all troops. U.S. officials said they knew Moscow would oppose the measure but that they wanted to highlight Russia’s isolation within the international community.

The vote was 11 in favor, with Russia voting no. China, along with India and the United Arab Emirates, abstained.

The vote was delayed for two hours as the United States and Albania, co-sponsor of the resolution, worked behind the scenes to shore up support for the resolution among wavering nations, including Brazil.

“A line has been crossed, and this council cannot remain silent,” said Brazil’s Ambassador Ronaldo Costa Filho. He said his government was “gravely concerned” about Russia’s military action.

China’s decision to abstain was seen as a diplomatic victory for pro-Ukrainian forces, given its history of using its veto power alongside ally Russia.

Ukrainian President vows to stay and fight advancing Russian troops in Kyiv

As Russian troops advanced on Ukraine’s capital of Kyiv Friday evening, President Volodomyr Zelenskyy appealed for a cease-fire and warned in a video statement that multiple cities were under attack and intent on seizing the capitol.

”The night will be harder than the day,” Zelenskyy said on the video, which was widely circulated on Twitter.

“At night they will storm,” he said in the message to Ukrainians. “You can not give up the capital. We must survive this night.”

Biden administration spokeswoman Jen Psaki confirmed Friday afternoon that U.S. officials believe Putin intends to try to take the capital and oust the government.

The explosions and gunfire in Kyiv fueled further fears of wider war in Europe and triggered new international efforts — including direct sanctions on President Vladimir Putin by the U.S., UK, European Union and Canada — to make Moscow stop.

U.S. to sanction Putin, other Russian officials

The United States is slapping sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and some of his deputies in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday the new sanctions will target Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and members of Russia’s national security team.

The announcement follows a decision by the European Union earlier Friday to freeze the assets of Putin and Lavrov, along with other sanctions.

The United States already has hit Russia with sanctions that will impact multiple sectors of the Russia economy. But Ukraine has argued that a tougher economic response is needed and has asked for additional defense assistance.

The enigma of Vladimir Putin:What do we really know about Russia's leader?

Ukraine's ambassador to US: Very concerned about Chernobyl

Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., voiced concern Friday that Russia took control of the Chernobyl power plant – site of the worst nuclear disaster in history – and took 92 staff members as hostages.

“We are very concerned that the Chernobyl shelter is under threat of any type of random attack by the Russian federation,” Markarova told reporters in Washington.

More broadly, she said Ukraine armed forces destroyed 80 Russian tanks, 10 planes, seven helicopters and 516 armored vehicles. She blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for casualties.

“As a result of Mr. Putin’s decision to send Russians to kill Ukrainians, 2,800 of Russian soldiers will not be going back to Russia,” she said.

Markarova said she wasn’t able to say what it would take for Putin to abandon the attack, but that Ukraine sought territorial integrity not just of its eastern provinces, but also Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.

“We are ready for peace talks, but we are not ready for capitulation or surrender,” Markarova said.

Warner warns tech companies about Russian disinformation efforts

Sen. Mark Warner is urging U.S. tech companies on Friday not to let their platforms be misused by Russian influence operations in the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine.

The Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, sent letters Friday to Alphabet, Meta – formerly known as Google and Facebook – as well as Reddit, Telegram, TikTok, and Twitter alerting them to malicious “information warfare” activities by Russia and Russia-linked entities.

“As this conflict continues, we can expect to see an escalation in Russia’s use of both overt and covert means to sow confusion about the conflict and promote disinformation narratives that weaken the global response to these illegal acts,” Warner wrote.

In his letter to YouTube parent company Alphabet, Warner said his staff observed YouTube ads on Thursday monetizing content regarding the conflict in Ukraine from RT, Sputnik and TASS, which he described as malign actors affiliated with the Russian government.

“Unfortunately, your platforms continue to be key vectors for malign actors – including, notably, those affiliated with the Russian government – to not only spread disinformation, but to profit from it,” Warner said.

Hundreds of casualties reported amid bombing damage, destruction

As the fighting intensified in Ukraine Friday, government officials offered competing assessments of the death toll.

Ukrainian officials reported at least 137 deaths on their side and claimed hundreds on the Russian one. Russian authorities released no casualty figures.

U.N. officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes, estimating up to 4 million could flee if the fighting escalates.

Bridges and schools have been damaged in the shelling, which also sliced through a Kyiv apartment building. After 8 p.m. in Ukraine, a large boom was heard near Maidan Nezalezhnosti, the square in central Kyiv that was the heart of the protests which led to the 2014 ouster of a Kremlin-friendly president. The cause was not immediately known and smaller repeated blasts could be heard in the distance.

Trevor Reed's parents fear Russian attack on Ukraine will thwart son's release from Moscow prison

The parents of a former Marine imprisoned in Moscow worry the global outrage over Russia’s attack on Ukraine could hurt their chances of getting their son released at a moment when he is suffering from serious health problems.

Trevor Reed’s parents, Joey and Paula Reed, told the Dallas Morning News their son called his Moscow lawyers to tell them he was running a fever. He had prolonged exposure in December to another prisoner with tuberculosis and was coughing up blood, according to U.S. embassy spokesman Jason Rebholz. Trevor Reed had been diagnosed with COVID-19 last May.

As a Marine, Reed served as a presidential guard and provided security at Camp David during the Obama administration.

But Reed was arrested in Moscow in August 2019 after allegedly being involved in a drunken fight at a party. He’s serving a nine-year sentence on charges the U.S. ambassador called “absurd.” U.S. officials have said Reed and another former Marine, Paul Whelan, were imprisoned potentially to be used as bargaining chips for the release of Russian spies.

President Joe Biden said Thursday diplomatic talks with Russia have been ruptured by Moscow's massive military attack on Ukraine.

Paula Reed told the Dallas Morning News the remarks were “like the exclamation point” to know “it’s going to be that much more difficult to get Trevor home.”

EU to freeze assets on Vladimir Putin, Sergey Lavrov - Latvian official

The European Union agreed to freeze the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov along with other sanctions, according to Latvia's foreign minister.

The move is intended to ratchet up financial pressure on Putin to back off Ukraine and would add to other sanctions levied against Moscow from governments including the United States.

US official: Russian forces advance but not as quickly as anticipated

Russian forces continue to invade Ukraine along three routes, including from the north toward Kyiv, although a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Russian momentum toward Kyiv has slowed in the last 24 hours.

The U.S. official declined to say how many Russian troops were on the ground in Ukraine now, but estimated it was about one third of the combat force that Russia had massed before the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin had deployed more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s border prior to the invasion.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence findings, told reporters Friday the U.S. had information suggesting that Moscow had expected a faster advance on Ukraine's capital. The official declined to say how the Pentagon had made that assessment, but Russia has not yet captured any major population centers.

Russia has failed to dominate Ukrainian air space, the official said. Ukraine continues to fly warplanes that are attacking Russian forces. Ukraine also retains missiles for air defense.

In southern Ukraine, the Russians have made an amphibious attack, landing thousands of troops, the official said.

Elsewhere in the south, a battle is being fought for the Kakhovka hyrdo-electric plant that provides energy to Crimea and southern Ukraine. Russia has launched cyberattacks there, the official said.

Ukraine pressures Europe to ban Russia from SWIFT

Ukraine’s foreign minister ramped up the pressure on European leaders on Friday to kick Russia out of the SWIFT financial system in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine.

The United States and Europe already have hit Russia with sanctions that will impact multiple sectors of the Russia economy. But some European leaders have been reluctant to boot Russia from SWIFT, a global messaging system connecting thousands of financial institutions around the world.

Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba took to Twitter to urge those holdouts to reconsider, citing their past statements that a conflict like World War II should never be allowed to happen again.

“To some European leaders who are still hesitant: each year at commemorative events you say ‘Never again,’” he wrote. “The time to prove it is now. Russia is waging a horrific war of aggression in Europe. Here is your ‘never again’ test: BAN RUSSIA FROM SWIFT and kick it out of everywhere.”

Kuleba said he spoke Friday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken about the need for the U.S. to use its influence to persuade hesitant European leaders to ban Russia from SWIFT.

Zelenskyy says Ukraine is fighting Russia ‘alone’

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday Ukraine is fighting Russia “alone,” in an apparent criticism of the U.S. and other western allies, as he pushes for a stronger international response to Russia's invasion of his country.

“This morning, we are defending our state alone, as we did yesterday,” he said in an address to Ukrainians. “The world’s most powerful forces are watching from afar. Did yesterday’s sanctions convince Russia?”

Biden has vowed that he won’t send U.S. troops to Ukraine to fight Russia, though he has sent American forces to shore up NATO's eastern flank.

Biden announced a second round of U.S. sanctions announced Thursday, but it did not include the harsh step of cutting Russia from the SWIFT financial system, which connects banks worldwide.

Kremlin open to talks if Ukraine stops fighting

The Kremlin said Friday it is ready to hold talks with Ukrainian officials, but only after Ukrainian forces stand down. The conditional offer came as Russian forces bore down on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to send a delegation to Belarus to meet with Ukrainian officials. This came after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he is willing to discuss a non-aligned status for the country, which would essentially mean dropping the country's bid to join NATO.

However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Ukraine must put down its arms before any talks happen, according to Russia's state controlled TASS News Agency.

Charting Russia's invasion in maps

Russian military forces invaded Ukraine at roughly 9:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday (4:30 a.m. on Thursday in Ukraine), using missiles, troops, tanks and aircraft.

The invasion has targeted major cities and military sites, with the attacks coming from all different directions, according to Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Russia has fired more than 100 missiles.

Emergency spending for Ukraine likely to reach billions, US senator says

Congress may need to approve at least $10 billion in emergency spending to support Ukraine and for other needs, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said Friday.

Coons, a close ally of President Joe Biden who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters his estimate may be on the low side because it doesn’t include what may be a “robust” request from the Pentagon.

“There is strong enthusiasm to provide ongoing resupply and training and whatever other covert and overt support is necessary and appropriate for the Ukrainian resistance,” he said.

Coons, who also heads a subcommittee in charge of humanitarian aid, said he’s confident billions of dollars will be needed to support the likely millions of refugees expected to flee Ukraine for nearby countries.

“It would be a wild guess on my part,” he said, “but I would be supportive of an emergency supplemental of at least $10 billion, perhaps more, to meet these vital national security and humanitarian needs.”

Ukrainian official: Kyiv residents should make Molotov cocktails

Ukraine's Defense Ministry urged Kyiv's residents Friday to stay inside and prepare Molotov cocktails to defend their capital as Russian troops and tanks were on the verge of entering the central part of the city for the first since President Vladimir Putin launched his assault on Ukraine.

""Neutralize the enemy,"" Ukraine's Defense Ministry tweeted as Kyiv continued to be hit by apparent Russian airstrikes that have damaged apartment buildings and forced thousands into bomb shelters. Air raid sirens rang out through the night and into the early morning.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is continuing to plead with western leaders to unveil harsher sanctions on the Kremlin, saying “If you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.”

Ukraine claims that more than 1,000 Russian troops have already been killed, though British officials have put the Russian death toll at half that.

What is SWIFT? How could banning Russia from it impact the country?

President Biden on Thursday announced a raft of new sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

But one move the president didn’t announce: kicking Russia out of the SWIFT financial system.

Biden said removing Russia from the international SWIFT financial system is still on the table but that European allies had resisted that step. The SWIFT system shifts money between banks around the world. Removing Russia would block Moscow from most international financial transactions, including profits from oil and gas production that are the lifeblood of Russia’s economy.

Pope Francis makes unprecedented visit to Russian embassy

Pope Francis went to the Russian embassy in Rome on Friday to personally express his concern about the war in Ukraine, in an extraordinary papal gesture that has no recent precedent.

Popes usually receive ambassadors and heads of state in the Vatican. For Francis to travel a short distance to the Russian embassy outside the Vatican walls was a sign of his strength of concern about Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Vatican officials said they knew of no such previous papal initiative.

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed the pontiff wanted “clearly to express his concern about the war.” Pope Francis was there for just over a half-hour, Bruni said.

Francis has called for dialogue to end the conflict and has urged the faithful to set next Wednesday as a day of fasting and prayer for peace in Ukraine.

But he has refrained from publicly calling out Russia, presumably for fear of antagonizing the Russian Orthodox Church, with which he is trying to build stronger ties.

Rockets strike Kyiv in `horrific’ attack

Russian invasion advances on Kyiv; civilians spent night in bomb shelters

Russian troops appeared to be advancing on Kyiv at the start of the second day of the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Amid a fast-moving and difficult-to-verify situation, Ukraine's Defense Ministry tweeted early Friday that some Russian troops had broken through to several northern districts on the outskirts of the capital. However, Ukraine's military also said it was resisting the advance on multiple fronts.

The apparent development comes as thousands of civilians spent the night in bomb shelters, typically underground subway stations, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged his citizens to do all they can to resist Russia's assault. Zelenskyy has vowed to remain in Kyiv with his family and he appealed to Russia for a ceasefire.

Some 137 Ukrainians, a mixture of soldiers and civilians, died in the fighting on Thursday, Zelenskyy said. Britain's Defense Secretary told his country's media Friday that Russia has lost about 450 military personnel.

The U.S., Europe and Japan have all unveiled sanctions on key Russian banks, airlines and associates of President Vladimir Putin. Later Friday, NATO leaders will convene an emergency meeting by video link to discuss the deteriorating security situation.

The sound of explosions before dawn was reported in Kyiv, as well as the wail of air-raid sirens and the staccato bursts of gunfire in several parts of the city. Ukraine’s military said that Russian spies and saboteurs were spotted about three miles north of the city center.

The Ukrainian Border Guard said on its Facebook page that Russian troops were in the northern suburb of Obolon and asked residents to report on their movements. It also urged them to “make Molotov cocktails, neutralize the occupier!”

Thousands of residents spent the night in subway stations for protection from potential bombs and airstrikes. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a defiant video address calling on his compatriots not to flee, ordering men of fighting age, in particular, to stay.

At least 137 Ukrainian civilians and military personnel have been killed and more than 300 wounded, Zelensky said. There were reports that 400 Russian forces had died, but Moscow has not issued a casualty count.

World & Nation Full coverage of the war in Ukraine Russia’s war in Ukraine is causing a European refugee crisis on a scale not seen since World War II and raising fears of a return to Cold War-era dynamics.

In the northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-most populous, residents cautiously made their way around mostly empty streets amid a snowstorm Friday morning. Buses were still running. But just before noon, the sounds of explosions reverberated through the city center, sending pedestrians scurrying for shelter and motorists slamming on the gas in an attempt to escape from a threat they could hear but not see.

A channel on the messaging application Telegram posted a photo of what it said were the fins and fuselage of an unexploded missile lodged in a street in Kharkiv. The Times could not independently verify the image.

The violence came a day after Moscow accelerated its assault on neighboring Ukraine. On Thursday, explosions resounded in cities across the country, airstrikes crippled its defenses and Russian troops reportedly crossed into Ukraine by land and sea.

It was uncertain how long the Ukrainian army could hold back a blistering onslaught that included missiles, airborne units, heavy artillery and cyberattacks. But with brisk Russian offensives from the south, north and east, it appeared Russian President Vladimir Putin had his sights set on not just taking disputed regions of eastern Ukraine but also conquering a former Soviet republic turned U.S. ally and perceived threat to Moscow.

“We now have war in Europe on a scale and of a type we thought belonged to history,” said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.

Here in Kharkiv, scores of terrified residents sought refuge at an underground metro stop.

“I just can’t believe this is happening,” said Sergei, 38, a marketing manager, whose wife, mother and 4-year-old daughter sat on pink and blue yoga mats spread out on the platform. “This is the 21st century.”

All around him, bewildered Ukrainians threaded their way through crowds like extras in a film. “Not a World War II movie,” said Sergei, who, like others interviewed, declined to give his surname for safety reasons. “A horror movie.”

“They’re killing people and turning peaceful cities into military targets,” Zelensky said in a video address.

The turmoil has already displaced more than 100,000 people, the United Nations reported, as refugees began to trickle into neighboring nations, including Poland, Hungary and Romania.

The Russian invasion — with an estimated 190,000 troops massed around Ukraine — targeted strategic military sites and swept much of the nation. Russian missiles struck Ukrainian military command centers, air bases and depots in Kyiv and Kharkiv, as well as Dnipro, another major city, an advisor to Ukraine’s interior minister said on Facebook.

Russian forces took control of Chernobyl, the city north of Kyiv that was the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident, raising fears of a possible leak of radioactive material. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry also confirmed that Russian troops had seized a strategic international airport barely 10 miles outside Kyiv.

In Washington, President Biden described the onslaught as a “premeditated attack” that came “without provocation, without justification, without necessity.” He laid responsibility for it firmly on the Russian leader, calling the conflict “Putin’s war.”

Biden conferred with other world leaders Thursday to craft a response to an act of aggression that has drawn outcry across the globe and raised the specter of catastrophic bloodshed in Europe. Russia’s three lines of attack included an advance from the Crimean peninsula, a Russian bastion; and a thrust from northeastern Ukraine, a stronghold of pro-Russia separatists. A third advance of Russian military vehicles reportedly came from Belarus, a Russian ally, toward Kyiv, which lies barely 50 miles to the south.

Both the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization moved to bolster the alliance’s military presence, though Biden said there was no plan for troops to become involved in Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. The Pentagon ordered the deployment to Germany of 7,000 additional service members in a move intended “to reassure NATO allies, deter Russian aggression and be prepared to support a range of requirements in the region.”

NATO also said it was sending additional land, air and maritime assets to its eastern flanks in a bid to enhance its ability to “respond to all contingencies.”

Civilians took shelter and lines formed at banks as people hastened to withdraw cash. Traffic jams snarled roads as residents tried to flee the capital. Ukrainian air traffic controllers sealed off the country’s airspace.

President Zelensky declared martial law and encouraged his compatriots to take up arms. Meanwhile, the U.S. and the West announced additional sanctions on Russia to isolate Russian banks, oligarchs and companies from world markets in response to an invasion that Moscow had long denied was planned, even as Washington insisted that an attack was imminent.

Putin portrayed the incursion — which followed months of Russian military buildup along Ukraine’s borders to the north, east and south — as a move to liberate and protect eastern Ukraine, where Moscow-backed secessionists hold sway over a large swath of the region. He warned other countries to not intervene, saying that it would lead to “consequences you have never seen in history.”

The invasion rattled Europe and stirred memories not only of the Cold War but also of World War II. It reflected Putin’s long mistrust of NATO and the West and his ambition to stitch back together remnants of the former Soviet Union. And it raised the specter of how the West — let alone Ukraine — would handle a likely humanitarian crisis while trying to counter a Russian military that possesses both conventional and nuclear weapons.

“This is a grave moment for the security of Europe,” said Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary-general, who will convene an emergency virtual summit of alliance leaders Friday. “Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked attack on Ukraine is putting countless innocent lives at risk.”

An advisor to Zelensky said Russian forces had seized Chernobyl, where a reactor exploded in April 1986, spewing radioactive materials across Europe. The stricken nuclear plant has since been decommissioned and the damaged reactor encased in a giant concrete-and-steel shelter, but Ukrainian authorities warned that fighting could damage the covering.

Putin announced his “special military operation” in eastern Ukraine in a nationally televised address early Thursday in Moscow. Even as he spoke, bombing runs began across Ukraine, with about two dozen strikes reported on major cities and other areas.

The Russian news agency Tass reported that Russian strikes “crippled” 74 Ukrainian military facilities, including 11 airfields, a navy base and 18 radar stations housing missile systems. All objectives “have been successfully fulfilled,” Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov told reporters in Moscow.

The day before the incursion, Western powers said Russian soldiers had already entered Ukraine from the east, in the industrial heartland known as the Donbas, where Moscow’s proxy militias have engaged in battles with Ukrainian forces for eight years, costing thousands of lives. Putin on Monday recognized two Donbas enclaves under the control of pro-Russia separatists, Donetsk and Luhansk, as independent republics, setting the stage for him to send in troops to the region as “peacekeeping” forces.

Here in Kharkiv, Ukrainian soldiers stood in a field with two Howitzers aimed north, where the Russian border lay. A convoy of large Ukrainian military trucks lumbered down the road.

Almost all shops were closed. In the lobby of the high-end Kharkiv Palace Hotel, guests sipped coffee, wondering whether they should join the westward exodus.

“The Russians will be here in two hours,” said a man who gave his name as Anton, who had come to Kharkiv on a work trip and was trying to find a way to return to Kyiv. The road heading southwest to the city of Dnipro was not an option, he said, as he expected it to be bombed by the Russian military.

Some residents flocked to subway stations looking for escape or for shelter, lugging backpacks, small suitcases and pet carriers. Inside one station, people wedged themselves against the wall, using their bags to claim what little space they could as the crowds kept piling in. Those who could cram themselves into subway carriages did so, sitting on the seats, the floor or anywhere else they could find, waiting in darkness for the train service to start up.

Standing in the middle of a platform was Sergei, 30, a real estate agent turned programmer who was carrying his baby daughter, Naomi.

He wasn’t scared for himself, he said, but for Naomi. His wife, Katya, agreed, saying that they were trying to leave “not because we’re not patriots, but because we have a child. ... If it wasn’t for her I would go fight.”

As the day had worn on, the couple discussed whether they should try to get out of the city. There were no planes, no trains. Should they take a car and risk the traffic — not to mention the possibility of encountering Russian soldiers — on intercity roads?

“We just don’t know. There are too many rumors,” Katya said.

Earlier in the Donbas town of Slovyansk, about 75 miles north of Donetsk, the sound of explosions filled the morning air, but residents appeared to remain calm. As the sun rose, some emerged to start their workdays, albeit under tense circumstances.

“We’re going to stay open,” said Bogdan, an 18-year-old barista, as he slipped an almond croissant into a paper bag and handed it to a waiting customer at a cafe. “For now we’re waiting.”

Anton Chechenko, 30, an electric engineer who works in Slovyansk but whose family lives in Dnipro, about four hours’ drive to the west, stood in the central square and watched a flock of pigeons strut on cold tiles.

“Everyone here has lived through war. And we’re not seeing shelling yet,” he said. Besides, he added, “fear isn’t something that can save your life or your health. You need calm for that.”

The most visible sign at that hour of any distress was at banks and gas stations, where queues formed in the early morning and persisted as the day wore on. Alexander, 30, who gave only his first name, stood near a bank talking to an army officer on the street. He had just come back from the store and had loaded his backpack with canned food and other supplies.

He planned to go to a village near Kharkiv, to the northwest. “It will be calm there,” he said.

Shortly after he spoke, Zelensky announced that Ukraine was formally severing ties with Russia, which had earlier pulled out its diplomatic personnel from Kyiv, before the invasion began. Zelensky exhorted “those who have not yet lost their conscience” in Russia to go out and protest against the incursion.

“As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history,” Zelensky tweeted. “Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won’t give up its freedom.”

The assault negated weeks of frantic diplomacy to try to prevent war — and came even as the United Nations Security Council was in the midst of discussing the crisis in an extraordinary session.

It shatters a two-decade stretch of relative peace in Europe, which survived two world wars and a cold one in the 20th century. Even some seasoned analysts of contemporary Russia were stunned by Putin’s decision to move in, despite all the signs pointing to just such an intention.

The West is now under heavy pressure to present a united front not only in its rhetoric but also in the severity of penalties it is willing to inflict on Russia — and, as a consequence, on some of its own economies, particularly in Europe. Germany took a significant step toward that goal Tuesday when Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that his government was halting authorization of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project to bring Russian gas westward.

Much of Europe relies on Russian gas to heat homes and generate electricity. Russia supplies more than one-third of the gas consumed by the 27-nation European Union, making some member nations nervous about a major confrontation with Moscow.

The Biden administration says it has been working with European partners to secure other sources of energy for the Continent, although a rise in prices would be an inevitable result.

What you should know What are the roots of the Russia-Ukraine hostilities? Ukraine won its independence in 1991 with the fall of the Soviet Union. Russian President Vladimir Putin contends it was never a state. Why won't the U.S. and NATO approve a no-fly zone over Ukraine? A no-fly zone, many officials say, would draw the U.S. and its NATO allies into direct combat with Russia — an escalation many liken to a world war. Air combat missions would have to be supported by ground-based operations and the U.S. and its NATO allies would have to be prepared to go in over land, making it “a slippery slope from there to a shooting war.” Who gets to decide if Putin is a war criminal? There are set definitions and processes for determining who’s a war criminal and how they should be punished. The investigations into Putin’s actions already have begun. The U.S. and 44 other countries are working together to investigate possible violations and abuses, and there’s another inquiry by the International Criminal Court. Want to help Ukraine?
