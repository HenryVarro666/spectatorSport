Foi relatado que o avi√£o caiu em um campo perto de Nikolaev e a tripula√ß√£o russa n√£o teve tempo de usar suas armas. Conforme relatado, os m√≠sseis da aeronave n√£o foram lan√ßados.

A tripula√ß√£o do Kamov Ka-52 √© composta por dois pilotos. O v√≠deo mostra uma parte de um paraquedas rasgado perto dos destro√ßos.

Durante as √∫ltimas 24 horas, o ex√©rcito ucraniano conseguiu derrubar tr√™s avi√µes russos, um helic√≥ptero e v√°rios m√≠sseis de cruzeiro, disse Arestovych.
