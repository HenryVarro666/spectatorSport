“All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations,” he said, quoting the Charter.

Wrong but not irreversible

He underscored that the use of force by one country against another is “the repudiation of the principles that every country has committed to uphold”, which he stated, applies to the present military offensive.

“It is wrong. It is against the Charter. It is unacceptable. But it is not irreversible”, the UN chief said.

He went on to repeat the appeal he made to Russian President Vladimir Putin last night.

“Stop the military operation. Bring the troops back to Russia”, he reiterated.

Toll of war

As deaths rise, and images of fear, anguish and terror in every corner of Ukraine are pervasive, the top UN official reminded that “people – everyday innocent people – always pay the highest price”.

This is why the UN is scaling up its humanitarian operations in and around Ukraine.

“Today I am announcing that we will immediately allocate $20 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund to meet urgent needs,” he flagged, reiterating that the UN and its humanitarian partners are “committed to staying and delivering, to support people in Ukraine in their time of need”.

Assisting both sides

He informed the reporters that UN staff are working on “both sides of the contact line,” providing lifesaving humanitarian relief to people in need, “regardless of who or where they are”.

“The protection of civilians must be priority number one”, he stressed.

The UN chief restated that international humanitarian and human rights law must be upheld, noting that the decisions of the coming days “will shape our world and directly affect the lives of millions upon millions of people”.

“In line with the Charter, it’s not too late to save this generation from the scourge of war,” concluded the Secretary-General, “we need peace”.

General Assembly: Firm return to diplomacy

In his statement, General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid recalled that the Charter is based on the principle of sovereign equality and calls for Member States to settle their international disputes by peaceful means.

“The ongoing military offensive by Russia in Ukraine is inconsistent with the principles of the Charter,” he said, renewing his call to all Member States to uphold their obligations.

#Ukraine: ""The protection of the civilian population must be a priority. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas should – at all costs – be avoided."" – UN Human Rights Chief @mbachelet: https://t.co/tOmP1tugQk#Russia pic.twitter.com/7kpTgZUF3p — UN Human Rights (@UNHumanRights) February 24, 2022

“I call for an immediate ceasefire, de-escalation of tensions and a firm return to diplomacy and dialogue. The safe and unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and its people is a priority and the need of the hour.""

OHCHR: Violating international law

Prior to the media briefing, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet issued a statement on the military attack.

“Civilians in various parts of Ukraine were awoken by sounds of heavy bombardment and are terrified of further escalation, with many fleeing their homes,” she said. “This military action clearly violates international law and puts at risk countless civilian lives. It must be immediately halted.”

Ms. Bachelet reminded that States failing to take all reasonable measures to settle their international disputes by peaceful means “fall short of complying with their obligation to protect the right to life.”

Civilian protection a priority

Reports have emerged of military strikes near major cities with significant populations, including Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, Odesa, Mariupol and the capital, Kyiv.

“The protection of the civilian population must be a priority. The use of explosive weapons in populated areas should – at all costs – be avoided,” underscored the High Commissioner.

She called for the full respect of international humanitarian law, in particular the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their first additional protocol of 1977, as well as international human rights law.

The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission remains in the country and will continue to closely monitor and report on the situation.

‘Information war’

The UN human rights chief also warned of “an information war” under way.

“It is particularly crucial at this time that we continue to closely monitor and attempt to verify reports of human rights violations, including civilian casualties, damage to civilian objects, including critical infrastructure, and other impact on human rights on the ground,” she upheld.

UN coordinator: Guiding humanitarian principles

Meanwhile, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, Osnat Lubrani, expressed the Organization’s solidarity with the Ukrainian people.

“As we try to understand the evolving situation in different parts of the country… we are here to support the people exhausted by years of conflict and we are prepared to respond in case of any increase in humanitarian needs,” she said in a statement.

Ms. Lubrani reminded that humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence are the four principles guiding humanitarian assistance.

“Our aim is always to provide the most vulnerable civilians with critical humanitarian relief supplies and services, regardless of who or where they are,” she assured.

UNESCO: Respect international law

Also expressing its deep concern, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) called for respect of international humanitarian law –notably the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and its two Protocols, “to ensure the prevention of damage to cultural heritage in all its forms”.

This includes the obligations under the Security Council Resolution 2222 on the protection of journalists, media professionals and associated personnel in situations of conflict, to promote free, independent and impartial media as one of the essential foundations of a democratic society, and which can contribute to the protection of civilians.

Finally, UNESCO also called for “restraint from attacks on, or harm to, children, teachers, education personnel or schools, and for the right to education to be upheld”.

UNICEF: Refrain from harming children

At the same time, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) echoed the Secretary-General’s appeal for an immediate cease-fire and called on all parties to respect their international obligations to protect children from harm, and to ensure that humanitarian actors can safely and quickly reach children in need.

“UNICEF also calls on all parties to refrain from attacking essential infrastructure on which children depend - including water and sanitation systems, health facilities and schools,” added UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.

WFP: ‘An absolute catastrophe’

The World Food Programme (WFP) expressed deep concern “for the impact of hostilities on the lives and livelihoods of civilians.”

“As the situation evolves, there is a need to ensure that affected communities have continued access to any humanitarian support they may require and that the safety of humanitarian staff on the ground is guaranteed,” said WFP Director of Emergencies Margot van der Velden.

Taking to social media, WFP chief David Beasly tweeted that “And just when you think it can’t get any worse, the world wakes up to a conflict in Ukraine.”

He pointed out that the military action is likely to cause economic deterioration around the world especially for countries like Yemen, dependent on wheat imports from Ukraine and Russia.

“Prices will go up compounding an already terrible situation,” he lamented.

IAEA: Situation in Chornobyl

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) drew attention to the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, saying that “Ukraine has informed the IAEA that ‘unidentified armed forces’ have taken control of all facilities of the State Specialized Enterprise Chornobyl NPP, located within the Exclusion Zone,” adding that no casualties nor destruction had occurred at the industrial site.

“It is of vital importance that the safe and secure operations of the nuclear facilities in that zone should not be affected or disrupted in any way,” Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement.

UNHCR: ‘Fast-deteriorating situation’

UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi expressed grave concern over the “fast-deteriorating situation and ongoing military action in Ukraine,” and called on neighbouring countries to “to keep borders open to those seeking safety and protection.”",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/02/1112662

Civilian lives and infrastructure “must be protected and safeguarded at all times, in line with international humanitarian law”, Mr. Grandi continued, adding that the UN is working with Ukrainian authorities and partners to provide humanitarian assistance “wherever necessary and possible”.

“To that effect, security and access for humanitarian efforts must be guaranteed,” he added.

UN on the ground

Since 2015, UNHCR has delivered 141 humanitarian convoys to non-Government-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine.

Last year, 24 humanitarian convoys consisting of 202 trucks delivered various humanitarian items to help meet the high level of humanitarian needs among the civilian population there.

Underscoring the UN’s solidarity with the people of Ukraine, the top UN humanitarian official in the country, Osnat Lubrani, insisted that the Organization and aid partners “are committed to staying and delivering. We are here to support the people exhausted by years of conflict and we are prepared to respond in case of any increase in humanitarian needs.”

7.5 million children at risk: UNICEF

Echoing that message, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said that it was also deeply concerned for the “lives and wellbeing” of Ukraine’s 7.5 million children.

UNICEF chief Catherine Russell noted that “heavy weapons fire” along the contact line in the east of the country had already damaged critical water infrastructure and education facilities in recent days.

“Unless the fighting subsides, tens of thousands of families could be forcibly displaced, dramatically escalating humanitarian needs,” Ms. Russell warned, adding that “the past eight years of conflict have inflicted profound and lasting damage to children on both sides of the line of contact”.

“The children of Ukraine need peace, desperately, now.”

Meanwhile, UNICEF continues to provide psychosocial care to those children who have been traumatized by chronic insecurity.

It is also increasing large-scale, life-saving programmes, including by trucking safe water to conflict-affected areas; prepositioning health, hygiene and emergency education supplies as close as possible to communities near the line of contact; and working with municipalities to ensure immediate help for children and families in need.

Diplomatic efforts

The development followed a sustained UN-led and international diplomatic push to avert the crisis late on Wednesday night that saw Secretary-General António Guterres appeal directly to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.

“President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine, give peace a chance,” Mr. Guterres said, at the start of an emergency meeting of the Council – its second late-night session in a week.

That appeal came after speakers took the floor at the 193-member General Assembly to denounce Russia’s actions towards Ukraine and appeal for diplomacy.

“Let’s give peace all the chance it deserves,” said UN General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid, hours after Secretary-General António Guterres had warned that “the entire international system” was being tested by the Ukraine crisis.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/02/1112602

23 FEBRUARY 2022

SECURITY COUNCIL

8974TH MEETING (NIGHT)

Russian Federation Announces ‘Special Military Operation’ in Ukraine as Security Council Meets in Eleventh-Hour Effort to Avoid Full-Scale Conflict

‘Give Peace a Chance’, Secretary-General Stresses as Political Affairs Chief Calls for Dialogue ‘Even at this Late Hour’

The Russian Federation must call off its “special military operation” and perceived declaration of war against Ukraine, members of the Security Council demanded tonight in a heated emergency meeting, condemning contraventions of international law and the United Nations Charter, and raising alarm about the dangers of an explosive regional conflict fomenting a global humanitarian crisis not seen since the Second World War.

Delegates gathering at the eleventh hour to exhort Moscow to pull back its troops from Ukraine’s Donbas region found their calls moot after Russian President Vladimir Putin, nearly an hour into the meeting, announced in a televised speech the start of an operation to “demilitarize” its neighbour.

In opening remarks, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, citing rumours of an imminent offensive, said he initially had not believed anything serious would happen. He admitted he had been wrong. “If indeed an operation is being prepared, I have only one thing to say from the bottom of my heart: President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine,” he urged. “Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.”

Offering context, Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said Ukraine’s authorities had declared a nationwide state of emergency amid disturbing reports of heavy shelling across the contact line and repeated targeting of civilian infrastructure. With Moscow also reportedly shutting airspace to civilian aircraft near the border, Ukraine’s authorities were also citing a new large-scale cyberattack against State and financial institutions.

As President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine called for continued diplomacy, and President Putin saying he was ready for dialogue, she encouraged pursuit of those efforts, even at this late hour. “The people of Ukraine want peace,” she emphasized. “I am certain the people of Russia want peace. We must do everything in our power to ensure that peace prevails.”

In the ensuing debate, representatives from the two countries offered conflicting views of the events unfolding.

Ukraine’s delegate, who had called for the emergency meeting, addressed the representative of the Russian Federation to say that most of his prepared remarks had been rendered useless by 10 p.m. New York time, as “forty-eight minutes ago, your President declared war on Ukraine”. Requesting that the Secretary-General distribute legal United Nations memorandums from December 1991 — including a decision by the Council recommending that the Russian Federation be a Member State of the Organization — he asked his counterpart if he would state on record that Russian troops are not shelling Ukrainian cities.

“You have a smartphone, you can call [Sergey] Lavrov,” he said, referring to the Russian Foreign Minister. Absent that information, the Russian Federation must relinquish its presidency of the Security Council to a Member State respectful of the Charter. He had requested an emergency meeting to consider all necessary draft decisions to stop the conflict. “You declared the war,” he said. “It is the responsibility of this body to stop the war.”

In turn, the Russian Federation’s delegate expressed regret that calls to stop provocations against the Luhansk and Donetsk people’s republics had gone unheeded, with Ukraine harbouring a delusion that it could achieve a military solution in Donbas with help from Western sponsors. He said the Special Monitoring Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) recorded almost 2,000 violations of the ceasefire regime, including nearly 1,500 explosions, with refugees flowing into the Russian Federation.

“The tragedy of Ukraine” started after the “illegitimate coup” in 2014, he explained, when the new Government brought guns and planes upon the Russian-speaking citizens in the country’s eastern region, rather than engaging in dialogue with them. Women, children and the elderly have hidden from Ukrainian shelling for eight years. The root of the crisis lies in Kyiv’s provocations against Donbas, which prompted the leaders of the two republics to turn to Moscow for military support, in accordance with bilateral cooperation agreements. He described this as a logical step, as well as a consequence, of Kyiv’s actions.

A number of delegates condemned reports of an active invasion unfolding even as the Council met to dissuade the Russian Federation from military action, with the United States representative stressing that it had “literally violated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on live television before the world”. Moscow is closing airspace and moving forces into combat positions — a perilous moment. The United States is here tonight for one reason, she said: to ask the Russian Federation to return to its borders and send its troops and planes back to their barracks and hangars.

Citing “denial of service” attacks on Ukrainian banks attributed to Moscow, and soldiers already deployed to Ukraine’s occupied region, she pointed to the Russian Federation as the aggressor, bringing its people, the Ukrainian people and the world into a conflict that will produce untold human suffering. She said the United States will table a resolution on 24 February, pledging that “the world will hold Russia accountable”.

Indeed, “every development unfolding in the last 48 hours confirms to us — and to the whole world — that Russian worries have nothing to do with its security”, Albania’s delegate said. The issue is not a confrontation between the Russian Federation and the West, rather one between the Russian Federation “and international law and the United Nations Charter”. Calling the crisis “a dark hour” for the entire international community, he urged Moscow to reverse its illegal decisions and withdraw its military. Equating diplomacy with hope, he said: “it dies last”.

Other delegates agreed that there is still opportunity for a diplomatic solution to emerge.

The United Kingdom’s representative said that the Council is “here tonight to call on Russia to avert war”, as a full-scale conflict in a country of 44 million will drive casualties on both sides and devastating humanitarian consequences. While the world is calling for peace, “Russia is not listening”, she said. She raised the potential for the United Kingdom to ratchet up the already significant sanctions package targeting Russian oligarchs, banks and politicians supporting President Putin. “There is still time for restraint, de-escalation and reason — but that time is now.”

In similar stride, Kenya’s delegate called for calm and protection of civilians, joining calls for a diplomatic solution that envisions a viable security architecture for Europe, while remaining sensitive to the needs of other parties. He urged delegates to recall the ruins of war experienced by all those sitting around the Council table.

Also speaking were representatives of France, Ireland, India, United Arab Emirates, Norway, China, Brazil, Ghana, Gabon, Mexico and Germany.

The meeting began at 9:32 p.m. and ended at 11 p.m.

Briefings

ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, reaffirmed what he had said earlier today in the General Assembly, citing a number of events and rumours of an offensive against Ukraine being imminent. Stating he had not believed anything serious would happen, he admitted he had been wrong — and would like to not again be wrong. “If indeed an operation is being prepared, I have only one thing to say from the bottom of my heart: President Putin, stop your troops from attacking Ukraine,” he urged. “Give peace a chance. Too many people have already died.”

ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said that earlier in the day, the so-called authorities of the Donetsk and Luhansk “peoples republics” requested military assistance from the Russian Federation. As well, Ukrainian authorities declared a nationwide state of emergency and announced other related defence and security measures, including the mobilization of reservists. She cited disturbing reports of heavy shelling across the contact line and civilian and military casualties, as well as repeated targeting of civilian infrastructure. With media reporting an ongoing large-scale military build-up and military columns moving towards Ukraine, she noted the Russian Federation has also reportedly shut airspace to civilian aircraft near the border with Ukraine. While the United Nations could not verify that information, if confirmed, it would greatly aggravate an already extremely dangerous situation. Ukraine’s authorities were also reporting a new large-scale cyberattack targeting several State and financial institutions.

Noting that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine earlier this evening called for continued diplomacy, and Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin also spoke about his continued readiness to engage in dialogue, she encouraged those efforts, even at this late hour. Affirming that United Nations staff are on the ground to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine, she called on all parties to ensure the safety and security of those colleagues, and to respect international humanitarian law. While events in the coming hours and days cannot be predicted, she cited the unacceptably high cost — in human suffering and destruction — of an escalation. “The people of Ukraine want peace,” she emphasized. “I am certain the people of Russia want peace. We must do everything in our power to ensure that peace prevails.”

Statements

FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said the Russian Federation “has been saying one thing and doing its contrary”, noting that “every development unfolding in the last 48 hours confirms to us — and to the whole world — that Russian worries have nothing to do with its security”. Its anxieties are not linked to the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and this issue is not a confrontation between the Russian Federation and the West. “This is a confrontation between Russia and international law and the United Nations Charter,” he said, tenets it has chosen to ignore. “This is a dark hour, not only for Ukraine but for the entire international community,” he stressed. Calling on the Russian Federation to stop and reverse its illegal decisions, and to withdraw its military engagement, he equated diplomacy with hope. “It dies last,” he said. “But for it to work, it must be seized, not ignored.” If Moscow advances its plans, it will bear not only the consequences of the war but also the historical blame and shame of invading a neighbouring country. However, its responsibility — as a large country and permanent member of the Security Council — calls for it to help preserve peace and security, “not to torpedo it”.

LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said her country, along with its allies and partners, will continue to respond to the actions of the Russian Federation with clarity and conviction. Warning that a full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation into Ukraine is imminent, she said Moscow is currently closing airspace, moving troops into Donbas and forces into combat positions. This is a perilous moment, she affirmed, and the United States is here for one reason: to ask the Russian Federation to stop, return to its borders, send its troops and planes back to their barracks and hangars, and instead send its diplomats to the negotiating table. Last week, the United States informed the Council what it expected to see unfold. It said that Moscow would fabricate a pretext for an attack — and in fact, there have been numerous false flag events staged along the lines of contact in Donbas. The United States said that Moscow would theatrically convene emergency meetings at the highest level of Government. This was seen on 21 February, with a State televised meeting held by President Putin, an orchestrated moment when Moscow decided to recognize as “independent states” sovereign territory of Ukraine that has been controlled by Russian proxies since 2014.

“They literally violated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on live television before the world,” she warned. Nobody could have predicted just how dangerous and inciting President Putin’s speech would be, as he argued that that the world should be taken back to a time of “empires and colonies”. The United States also had said that communications would be shut down. Last week, it attributed “denial of service attacks” on Ukrainian banks to Moscow, while just this morning, there was similar activity on government websites. There have been reports of destructive malware placed on computers and executed on some. After that, the United States warned that soldiers and bombs would arrive in Ukraine. And already, soldiers have been deployed to Ukraine’s occupied region. Not all parties are culpable. As such, calling on both sides to de-escalate is merely giving Moscow “a pass”, as it is the aggressor. The Russian Federation has brought its people, the Ukrainian people and the world to the brink of a conflict that will produce untold human suffering. Ukrainians are counting on the United Nations. She urged the Council not to let them down.

BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom), noting that those gathered are “here tonight to call on Russia to avert war”, said that a full-scale conflict in a country of 44 million will bring immense suffering, casualties on both sides and devastating humanitarian consequences. She emphasized that, while the world is calling for peace, “Russia is not listening”. For its part, the United Kingdom will not compromise its commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, nor its support for peace, prosperity and democratic freedom for the people of Ukraine. The Russian Federation’s actions are an assault on the Charter of the United Nations, and the United Kingdom has announced a significant sanctions package targeting some of the Russian oligarchs, banks and politicians supporting President Putin. London will ratchet up these economic consequences should the Russian Federation continue its aggression. She went on to stress that “there is still time for restraint, de-escalation and reason — but that time is now”.

NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) warned that the Russian Federation is about to “provoke chaos in Ukraine and strike an unjustifiable blow to peace and security in the heart of Europe”. For several months, President Putin has patiently prepared the means for a major offensive against Ukraine. He has amassed soldiers and weapons at a level not seen since the Second World War. He incited violence through lies and disinformation. He even denied the legitimacy of the Ukrainian State, and attacked that country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, by recognizing the independence of portions of Ukraine’s territory. On the contrary, Ukraine has demonstrated admirable restraint and did not give in to violence despite Russian provocation. The leaders of Europe and the United States showed their unity and redoubled their efforts to propose a diplomatic outcome. President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and many partners played their part, expressing their readiness to work with the Russian Federation to build a renewed security architecture for Europe. Moscow should follow the path of diplomacy, draw back its decision to recognize the separatist entities in eastern Ukraine and withdraw its soldiers. If Moscow chooses war, it will have to assume all responsibilities and pay the price, he warned.

GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) said that as Council members gathered around the table, “we are staring into the abyss of a major conflict in Europe, a conflict that would have global implications”. She affirmed that the Council must stand up for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every Member State of the United Nations. Stressing that the decision by the Russian Federation to recognize as independent entities the non-Government-controlled areas of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions “does not change those borders one iota”, she urged Moscow to reverse that decision immediately, as well as any further escalatory, unilateral actions which can only serve to deepen the crisis. Noting that the path for diplomacy is “perilously narrow”, she said a resort to military conquest — for one State to impose its will unilaterally against another — has absolutely no place in the twenty-first century. “There is still a choice to turn from the path of war to the path of diplomacy and peace,” she affirmed.

T.S. TIRUMURTI (India) expressed regret that international efforts to defuse tensions between Ukraine and the Russian Federation were not heeded. The situation is in danger of spiralling into a major crisis, he warned, voicing deep concern about the developments, which may well undermine peace and security in the region if not handled carefully. Calling for immediate de-escalation, he called on all parties to exert greater efforts to bridge divergent interests, underlining that the legitimate security interests of all parties should be fully considered. He reiterated that more than 20,000 Indian nationals, including students, are located in different parts of Ukraine, including around its border areas, noting that his country is facilitating the return of all Indian nationals, including students, as required.

MOHAMED ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) affirmed the importance of engaging in dialogue at all levels to support opportunities for peace that are based in international law. Clarifying that the Minsk agreements constitute a basis for peace, he stressed the importance of adhering to international law and the Charter of the United Nations, particularly through settling disputes by peaceful means. Noting that there were obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian assistance even before the recent tensions, he said that any further escalation could worsen the humanitarian situation for a larger number of civilians. He called for a ceasefire and urged all parties not to obstruct access to aid or to civilians in conflict areas.

MONA JUUL (Norway) warned that the world is facing the dire prospects of a major war in Europe. Strongly condemning Moscow’s decision to send troops into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, she called on the Russian Federation to reverse these decisions and to “immediately, completely and unconditionally” withdraw all military forces from the territory of Ukraine and the vicinity of its internationally recognized borders. Calling upon all parties to strictly respect the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, and to facilitate safe, rapid and unhindered humanitarian access to those in need in Ukraine, she urged the Russian Federation — as a party to the Minsk agreements and to the conflict — to fulfil its commitments, to abide by international law and to return to the path of diplomacy. “The Charter applies to all nations — including Russia,” she stressed.

ZHANG JUN (China), noting that the situation in Ukraine is at a “critical juncture”, called on all parties concerned to exercise restraint and avoid further escalation of tensions. The door to a peaceful solution “is not fully shut, nor should it be”, he said, noting that China has pointed out the complex historical context of this issue on many occasions, and its position on safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States has been consistent. He expressed hope that all parties will remain cool-headed and rational, resolve issues properly through negotiations and address each other’s legitimate security concerns, in line with the Charter principles. For its part, China will continue to promote peace talks “in its own ways”, he said, welcoming any efforts towards a diplomatic solution.

RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) expressed concern about reports of troop movements into certain areas of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions. “The time is not for belligerent rhetoric nor military threats, but to engage truly in a diplomatic process,” he said. He called for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of all military forces, as an effective measure to prevent and remove threats to peace. Parties must abide by the Minsk agreements, above all its call for a comprehensive ceasefire, and grant access to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Monitoring Mission. Calling for rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access, he noted that negotiations must be mindful of United Nations Charter principles, while taking into account the security concerns of all parts to the conflict, to create adequate conditions for an inclusive political dialogue. Brazil does not underestimate the complexity of the current situation, he said, but it insists on dialogue vital to achieving a lasting settlement to this conflict.

HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), describing the unfolding developments as “troubling”, said the situation is a matter of concern not just for Ukraine and its neighbours but for all. Insecurity for one country is insecurity for all. Expressing regret over the Russian Federation’s decision to recognize non-Government-controlled regions in eastern Ukraine and send its troops there, he cited statements attributed to President Putin that Moscow is always open to diplomacy. Such claims must be backed by action of de-escalation on the ground. He also expressed concern over the hybrid warfare launched by the Russian Federation, with cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. He urged Moscow to reconsider its intention to move troops to eastern Ukraine, stressing that its troops do not meet the criteria for peacekeepers and underscoring Ghana’s recognition of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya), expressed concern over the serious risks of the conflict enveloping the entire Donbas region, leading to significant loss of life and a refugee crisis. Calling for calm and protection of civilians and civilian objects from violations, he said there was still reason to believe in prospects for a diplomatic solution to the crisis — which will require a vision for a viable security architecture for Europe, protecting Ukraine and other States while remaining sensitive to the needs of other parties. The Council can prevent a catastrophe, he stated, as when considering recent wars pursued by choice in violation of the Charter, the security of all parties was undermined. The leaders who designed today’s multilateral system were humbled by the wars of a previous century, he said, urging all Member States to recall the ruins of war experienced by all those sitting around the Council table.

XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said the Council is meeting this evening 48 hours after its latest meeting on the subject because the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine has been attacked. Men, women and children are caught in “murderous violence” in eastern Ukraine, leading to a mass exodus that imperils their safety. The spectre of a war hangs over an entire region and as such, Gabon fears an imminent invasion of Ukraine. All Charter provisions must be respected, he said, stressing that Moscow’s decision to recognize the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk sidelines the importance of the Minsk agreements. Gabon remains attached to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every State, he added.

ALICIA GUADALUPE BUENROSTRO MASSIEU (Mexico) expressed regret that, despite widespread calls from the international community, tensions around Ukraine have increased and Council members are obliged to meet once again. She expressed support for the Secretary-General’s statements and called on parties to avail themselves of his good offices. Recalling that the Russian Federation made an emphatic declaration several days earlier that it would not invade Ukraine, she pointed out that commencing a special mission runs counter to this statement. Invasion would be an act of aggression, she stressed, stating that Mexico will not waver in its call for détente, diplomacy and dialogue as a diplomatic solution is the only means for backing away from the precipice of a war in Europe.

VASSILY NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said he will not repeat what he said in the General Assembly earlier today but expressed regret that calls to stop provocations against the Luhansk and Donetsk people’s republics were not heeded. Ukraine, actively armed by a host of States, is still harbouring a delusion that it can achieve a military solution in Donbas with help from Western sponsors. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain the significant intensification of shelling and acts of diversion on the territory of the two republics. The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission recorded almost 2,000 violations of the ceasefire regime, including nearly 1,500 explosions. Donetsk and Luhansk residents remain sheltering in basements and refugees continue to flow into the Russian Federation. The nature of provocations by Ukraine’s armed forces has not changed. Western colleagues are repeating “a Ukrainian fairy tale” that people in Donbas are shelling themselves. In today’s General Assembly debate, Western colleagues did not find one word of compassion or condolences for the suffering of the people in Donbas, as if these 4 million people do not simply exist.

He explained that “the tragedy of Ukraine” started after the illegitimate coup in 2014, when the new Government, instead of engaging in dialogue with the Russian-speaking citizens of Ukraine, brought guns and planes upon them. The Russian leadership decided to recognize the republics to ensure peace and security. For Western countries, the people in Donbas are only pawns in a geopolitical game aimed at weakening the Russian Federation. “For us, these are women, children, the elderly who have been hiding from Ukrainian shelling and provocations for eight years,” he said. The root of the current crisis lies in the actions of Ukraine itself, which sabotaged its obligations under the Minsk Package of Measures. Last week, there was hope that Kyiv would rethink and carry out what it agreed to in 2015. But Ukraine was not ready for dialogue with the two republics or for steps to grant Donbas the special status provided for by the Minsk agreements. Instead, Ukrainian provocations against Donbas intensified, and the leaders of the two republics turned to Moscow with a request for military support, in accordance with bilateral cooperation agreements concluded simultaneously with their recognition. He described this as a logical step — as well as a consequence of actions taken by Ukraine’s regime. During the current meeting, President Putin announced a special military operation in Donbas. Details are yet to come, but the aim is to free people in that area from genocide conducted by Ukraine.

SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said most of his prepared statement had been rendered useless by 10 p.m. New York time. Citing obligations under Article IV of the Charter of the United Nations and noting that the Russian Federation is no longer able to carry them out, he said the Russian ambassador had declared war on his country three minutes earlier. He requested that the Secretary-General distribute legal United Nations memorandums from December 1991, particularly 19 December, including a decision by the Council recommending that the Russian Federation be a Member State of the Organization. “It would be a miracle if the Secretariat is able to produce such decisions,” he said. “Forty-eight minutes ago, your President declared war on Ukraine,” he charged, asking if the representative could state on record that Russian troops do not shell Ukrainian cities. “You have a smartphone, you can call [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey] Lavrov,” he said. “We can pause.” Absent that information, he stated the Russian Federation must relinquish the responsibility of the presidency of the Security Council to a Member State respectful of the Charter. He requested an emergency meeting to consider all necessary draft decisions to stop the war. “You declared the war, it is the responsibility of this body to stop the war,” he asserted.

ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany) said the Security Council is meeting at the very moment the President of the Russian Federation is announcing a military operation on Ukraine. Two days ago, the Russian Federation’s decision to recognize the so-called “people’s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk was harshly rejected in this Council. Moscow has not listened and, it turns out, it was not prepared to listen. It has continued its massive military build-up and now its military is moving into Ukraine’s territory. By its actions, Moscow is violating the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations, she said, condemning the violation of Donetsk and Luhansk in the strongest possible terms. Calling on Moscow to terminate its military action and withdraw its troops, she said its aggression will come at an unprecedented price politically, economy and morally. Germany was ready for another meeting in the Normandy format with its partners and allies. Now is the time to speak up and defend the Charter of the United Nations against unilateral aggression, she stressed.

Ms. THOMAS GREENFIELD (United States), taking the floor for a second time, pointed out that her country predicted the Russian Federation’s false-flag attacks, misinformation and emergency meetings relating to Ukraine. “But one piece had not come to pass”, she said, spotlighting that — while the Council was meeting tonight — “it appears that President Putin ordered that last step […] at the exact time we were gathered in the Council seeking peace, Putin delivered a message of war”. Underscoring the gravity of this emergency and calling for Council action, she said that the United States will table a resolution on 24 February. She went on to stress that the United States and its allies will respond in a united, decisive manner and that “the world will hold Russia accountable”.

Ms. WOODWARD (United Kingdom), taking the floor a second time, said that “as we sat in this chamber urging Russia to step back, President Putin announced special military operations” on Ukraine’s territory, an unprovoked and unjustified action. It is a grave day for Ukraine and for the principles of the United Nations. The United Kingdom and its partners have been clear that there will be consequences for Moscow’s actions. She expressed full support for the United States’ call for a Security Council resolution, noting that the Council must do all it can to stop the war and uphold the United Nations Charter.

Mr. HOXHA (Albania), taking the floor a second time, said his country had feared the current crisis, citing explosions now reported in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, as “the masks are down and the tanks are in”. Stating that the Russian Federation has decided to deny the existence of a country, he affirmed that Albania stands for peace, international law and anything else that mandates the aggressor will be responsible for its actions.

Mr. DE RIVIÈRE (France) expressed regret that when the Council is trying to prevent the worst of what could happen, members learned that President Putin announced the launch of special military operation in Donbas. The Russian Federation has chosen war, which France condemns in the strongest possible terms. The fact that such action was taken when the Council was meeting to prevent it shows Moscow’s disdain for the international order. France will join the initiative to table a resolution condemning the war launched by the Russian Federation, he said, calling on all to support the text. The Russian Federation should respect international humanitarian law and protect civilians, especially women and children and humanitarian personnel, he stressed.

Ms. BYRNE NASON (Ireland), taking the floor a second time, said that the members of the Council now see that the path forward has been closed by the announcement of military aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. This is something that Ireland roundly condemns. She said Ireland “stands with the people of Ukraine tonight and with every man, woman and child, who has seen this news, as we did, as we sat here in this chamber, and whose lives are at risk”. It is now time for the Council to stand up, assume its responsibility and speak up in the strongest possible terms against this act of aggression.

Mr. KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), taking the floor a second time, urged the Russian Federation’s representative to relinquish his duties as Chair and call the Russian President and Minister for Foreign Affairs to stop the aggression. He also welcomed the decision by some Council members to meet as soon as possible to address this situation, adding that: “there is no purgatory for war criminals — they go straight to hell”.

Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), taking the floor again, clarified that his country is not being aggressive against the people of Ukraine, but rather, “the junta in power in Kyiv”.

Earlier today, the so-called authorities of the “Donetsk and Luhansk Peoples Republics” requested military assistance from the Russian Federation.

Also today, the Ukrainian authorities declared a nationwide state of emergency and announced other related defense and security measures, including the mobilization of reservists.

Throughout the day we have seen disturbing reports of continued heavy shelling across the contact line and civilian and military casualties. There are also reports of the repeated targeting of civilian infrastructure.

This evening, different media are carrying reports of an ongoing large-scale military buildup and of military columns moving towards Ukraine. The Russian Federation has also reportedly shut airspace to civilian aircraft near the border with Ukraine.

The UN cannot verify any of these reports. But if these developments were confirmed, they would greatly aggravate an already dangerous situation.

The Ukrainian authorities are also reporting a new large-scale cyber-attack targeting several state and financial institutions.

Mr. President,

President Zelenskyy earlier this evening called for continued diplomacy. Separately, President Putin also spoke about his continued readiness to engage in dialogue.

We encourage such efforts, even at this late hour.

Mr. President,

UN staff remain on the ground to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine. We are committed to staying and delivering. All parties must ensure their safety and security. Respect for international humanitarian law and international human rights law is also paramount.

We cannot predict exactly what will happen in the coming hours and days in Ukraine. What is clear is the unacceptably high cost – in human suffering and destruction – of an escalation.

The people of Ukraine want peace. And I’m certain the people of Russia want peace. We must do everything in our power to ensure that peace prevails.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/dicarlo-we-must-do-everything-our-power-ensure-peace-prevails-ukraine

The U.N. assessment comes at a time of mounting concern among world powers that Russia’s invasion could completely decapitate the Ukrainian government. The U.N.’s top relief official cited reports of shelling on urban centers and other communities across Ukraine, population movement, and unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties and damage to residential infrastructure.

The United Nations plans on Monday to appeal for up to $2 billion in assistance over the next three months to address a looming humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, as hundreds of thousands of civilians flee their homes for safety and Russian forces continue their attacks on the nation’s major cities, according to a diplomatic source briefed on the plan.

“I’m extremely concerned about the impact of the ongoing escalation on civilians, everyday people like us, like you and me,” Martin Griffiths, the U.N. emergency relief coordinator, told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York on Friday. “I think it’s fair to say hundreds of thousands of people are on the move in Ukraine and out of Ukraine.”

Griffiths said the situation on the ground was too chaotic and fluid to say precisely how many people have been displaced or fled the country. But he said early figures compiled “some hours ago” suggested as many as 50,000 had already crossed the border into Poland and another 20,000 into Moldova. He added that the U.N. anticipates a “significant increase in numbers.”

The U.N. is relocating nonessential staff and family members, Griffiths said, but it remains committed to maintaining—and even expanding—its operations inside and outside Ukraine. (The U.N. has had a limited involvement in humanitarian needs in eastern Ukraine since fighting first broke out there in 2014.) “We have not left, we are not leaving,” he said. “Obviously people there are bunkered down at the moment, but we’re expanding our presence in Ukraine and scaling up efforts to help meet the needs of people affected across that country.”

Griffiths said the U.N. is continuing to finalize its funding pledge, but he confirmed that “it will be well north of a billion dollars.” He said the U.N. hoped that a significant portion of that money would be provided in cash, which can then be delivered to needy beneficiaries via the internet.

There could be spillover effects for relief operations well beyond Ukraine, he warned. World Food Program Executive Director David Beasley told Griffiths Friday that Ukraine produces about 50 percent of the wheat the organization distributes to needy communities around the world.

The move comes as Ukraine’s neighbors, including Poland, Hungary, and Romania, are preparing for a major influx of Ukrainian civilians fleeing conflict that could amount to the largest internal refugee flow Europe has seen since the end of World War II. On Friday, there were reports of lengthy lines at the Polish border with Ukraine.

In a press briefing, Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Oksana Markarova said that three government ministers had been assigned to coordinate the country’s humanitarian response and were putting together a needs assessment, gathering supplies, and working to make a plan to quickly distribute aid through the country. Markarova, who spoke on Thursday with U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power, could not confirm how many people are estimated to have been displaced by the fighting so far.

In the months before the invasion, as Russian President Vladimir Putin slowly began amassing forces near Ukraine’s borders, top officials in Kyiv warned that a full-scale war could force millions of Ukrainians to flee west. “The human cost for Ukraine would be catastrophic, but Ukrainians would not mourn alone,” Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s defense minister, wrote in December 2021. “The sudden appearance of between three and five million Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion would be just one of many major concerns facing European society.”

By Friday, Russian forces had advanced to parts of the outskirts of Kyiv, the country’s most populated city and seat of government, as Russian missiles and shells pounded the city. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country would continue fighting despite the mounting odds.

“We are not afraid of anything,” Zelensky said in an address to the nation after Russia launched its invasion. “We are not afraid to defend our state. We are not afraid of Russia. We are not afraid to talk to Russia.”

On Thursday, Filippo Grandi, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, urged Ukraine’s neighbors to keep their borders open to those fleeing the war and pledged to support efforts to help those forced to leave the country. European Union countries near Ukraine, such as Poland, have already set up reception centers for refugees and pledged to support Ukrainians fleeing the conflict with food, shelter, and medical care.

“We have already seen reports of casualties and people starting to flee their home to seek safety,” Grandi said. “The humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating.”

Prior to the invasion, U.S. intelligence analysts reportedly warned policymakers that war in Ukraine could lead to between 25,000 and 50,000 civilian deaths, 5,000 to 25,000 Ukrainian military deaths, and 3,000 and 10,000 on the Russian side.

“The intensification and spread of the conflict risk a scale of death and destruction that are frightening to contemplate, given the immense military capacities involved,” Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said in a statement.

The U.S. Agency for International Development, the top U.S. foreign aid agency, announced on Thursday it was deploying a specialized disaster assistance response team to Poland to coordinate the humanitarian response.

Some humanitarian workers have also expressed concern that sweeping Western sanctions against Russia could have knock-on effects on vulnerable Ukrainian populations, including restricting the flow of food and commodities into the regions controlled by Russia and driving up the prices of key staple goods.

Private relief groups have been urging the United States and its partners to ensure that tough sanctions against Russia don’t impede the flow of aid into Ukraine, according to one humanitarian source. In the past, the United States and other key powers have introduced humanitarian exemptions to sanctions, but those measures have often been characterized by relief agencies as inadequate. Griffiths said he would work with key countries sanctioning Russia to ensure that humanitarian supplies reach those in need.

Even before the crisis, some 3 million people were in need of assistance in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, and the U.N. anticipated that 1.8 million were at risk of displacement, according to Griffiths.

Griffiths said that the effort to plan for the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine has been complicated by the difficulty of predicting who will have authority on the ground there. He said that he has been in contact with Russian authorities and would have to establish some kind of notification system with the Russians to ensure the safe delivery of assistance. But he suggested it was unclear what role the Ukrainian government would play. “It’s too early to say exactly how we’re going to deal with who at this point,” he said.

“I’ve been 45 years dealing with conflicts all over the world,” he said, “and I have never seen a situation like this before in terms of the parameters of contingency planning. Contingency planning for what might or might not happen in Ukraine was of the highest degree of uncertainty.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/25/ukraine-crisis-russia-invasion-humanitarian-aid-un/

That money would also be used to fend off Russian cyberattacks, counter disinformation and assist with economic stabilization, as well as provide humanitarian aid, including emergency food and energy assistance.

The administration identified $3.5 billion in funding requirements stemming from the deployment of thousands of troops to Central and Eastern Europe and related measures to reassure NATO allies.

The Pentagon has deployed thousands of troops to Europe this month, including 5,000 troops rushed to Poland. President Joe Biden signed off on a deployment of 7,000 additional troops to Germany on Thursday.

The Biden administration’s request comes as lawmakers from both parties call for a substantial increase in emergency aid to Ukraine, which came under siege this week from Russian forces. Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), who chairs the spending panel that funds the State Department and foreign operations, predicted earlier Friday that at least $10 billion would be needed amid an impending refugee crisis in eastern Europe.

Lawmakers are also eager to provide additional aid to Ukraine’s military, but new funding is unlikely to significantly impact Ukraine’s fight against the Russian incursion.

The $2.9 billion in humanitarian aid was an emergency request, meaning the funding would be parceled out on top of the regular budget for diplomatic and foreign assistance. But the person familiar with the proposal noted that the larger list of Pentagon needs did not carry that designation.

A final defense funding bill will likely significantly boost Biden’s $715 billion Pentagon budget request, and appropriators could potentially incorporate the $3.5 billion in military needs into the full-year spending bill.

After Russia began bombing Ukraine, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the U.S. and NATO must “redouble our material support” for Ukraine and that the upcoming funding package would “provide an opportunity to lead by example.”

Some lawmakers have pushed for quick action on a supplemental spending package that provides money to cope with what many predict will become a humanitarian crisis in Europe, funnels more military aid to Ukraine as it attempts to beat back the Russian invasion and bolsters U.S. military posture in NATO countries on the alliance’s eastern front.

But top Democrats are angling to tack on a sizable supplemental spending package as a part of a the sweeping funding bill that would bundle together all dozen annual government spending measures. In addition to Ukraine aid, the White House is seeking tens of billions of dollars for pandemic work at home and abroad in the effort to beat back Covid-19.

Senate Appropriations Chair Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said in a statement Friday that the U.S. must provide enough resources to aid allies and “assist the innocent people caught in the middle of this needless calamity,” vowing to work closely with the Biden administration and lawmakers in both parties to enact that funding.",https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/25/white-house-congress-ukraine-aid-00012071

Both residents and humanitarian workers are exposed to grave immediate risks. We urgently call upon all parties in the conflict to adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law.

The conflict causes severe human suffering in the region and particularly to the people in Ukraine. In the eastern part of the country, they have already endured 8 years of armed conflict. Over 1.5 million people have been displaced and an estimated 2.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. The deterioration of political dialogue and the escalation in hostilities threaten to increase the humanitarian needs exponentially.

“The option of war is always a failure.”

We reiterate the message by Caritas Europe that, irrespective of the current tensions, the needs of those caught in this ongoing crisis must be prioritised, and humanitarian access must continuously be granted where needed.

War is always a failure

“The option of war is always a failure”, says Cordaid CEO Kees Zevenbergen. “It results in nothing less than horror for all the people of Ukraine.”

Cordaid’s sister organisation Caritas Ukraine has been responding to the crisis right from the start in 2014. It has provided life-saving support to almost 950.000 people in the affected areas. Cordaid financially supports their emergency response to the conflict. “We are definitely seeking ways to augment our support, given the unfolding events”, says Cordaid’s humanitarian aid coordinator Paul Borsboom.

Call for diplomacy and dialogue

Like all members of Caritas, Cordaid stands in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, especially with the most underprivileged. They deserve to live in peace and with dignity. This is why we call for increased efforts of diplomacy and political dialogue by all parties to deescalate and prevent further military action. Failing to do so will result in millions of Ukrainians fleeing their homes and seeking assistance.
