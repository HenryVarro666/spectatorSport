Zelenskyy says Moscow tank attack targeted human corridor

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russian forces of targeting a humanitarian corridor in the city of Mariupol in an operation of ""outright terror.""

Zelenskyy said that, while some 100,000 people have been evacuated the country's cities in just two days, some city residents have no way out.

The president said he had decided to send a convoy of trucks into the besieged port city with food, water, and medicine. However, he said, ""the occupiers launched a tank attack exactly where this corridor was supposed to be.""

""They knew what they were disrupting. They have a clear order to hold Mariupol hostage, to torture it, to carry out constant bombardment.""

""The world needs to know that. It has to admit it. We are all dealing with a terrorist state,"" Zelenskyy said.

Zelenskyy also said the city of Volnovakha was ""under attack"" in a similar way to Mariupol.

Mariupol's mayor says more than 1,200 civilians had died in 9 days of continuous shelling that have left residents with no water, heat, or communications.

International leaders and Ukraine have accused Russia of a ""barbaric"" attack on a children's hospital in the besieged city.

Ukraine says Russia shelled nuclear institute

Ukrainian officials say Russian forces have shelled a nuclear research institute in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, setting buildings on fire.

A shell hit a building where some equipment — including an experimental nuclear reactor — could release radiation if it were damaged, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Interior Ministry, said.

The shelling caused a fire in a neighboring hostel that firefighters brought under control.

Authorities said they had observed no initial change in background radiation.

The Ukrainian parliament's official website had earlier said fighting close to the institute was continuing.

Russian forces have already taken over two nuclear power plants in Ukraine, raising concerns about the security of the nuclear facilities.

Ukraine says it lost contact with Chernobyl nuclear plant

Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it lost contact with the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

""Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it had lost today all communications with the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), the day after the Russian-controlled site lost all external power supplies,"" the IAEA said.

Schröder's mission to Moscow reportedly on Ukraine's request

Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has traveled to Moscow to help mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Politico reported on Tuesday.

In an interview with DW, Politico's Executive Editor, Florian Eder said Schröder met President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine's request.

""The Ukrainian side asked Gerhard Schröder to try and build a bridge to Vladimir Putin and to try to negotiate about possible conditions for a ceasefire or something similar,"" Eder said.

The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, had suggested a week ago that Schröder should mediate between Ukraine and Russia. The former chancellor is a longtime business associate of Kremlin circles and Putin.

Watch video 04:11 Politico's Florian Eder on Gerhard Schröder's reported Moscow visit

Eder added it was ""really very much unprecedented"" for a former German leader to pursue diplomacy without telling the current government.

""I think very much that he is there on behalf of his own reputation that has been bruised and damaged in the past weeks, and he might hope to be able to repair that a little bit,"" he said.

German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit told DW that should the report be accurate, the visit was made without consulting the government. Chancellor Olaf Scholz declined to comment when asked about the report in Versailles.

Schröder's wife, So-yeon Schröder-Kim, has since posted an image of herself in central Moscow.

Estonian prime minister calls for bolstering NATO defense posture

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told DW Thursday that the Russian invasion of Ukraine had fundamentally changed how NATO countries in Europe need to think about their defense strategy.

""We need to increase our spending on defense and we need to go from a deterrence posture to defense plans, as in how do we defend our territory?"" she said.

As a small country formerly part of the Soviet Union, with a significant Russian population, Estonia's inclusion into the European Union and NATO membership allow the country security guarantees.

Former Soviet countries like Georgia and Ukraine, both of which have seen Russian troops on their soil this century, enjoy no such guarantees.

""We are members of NATO, so attacking us would literally mean also attacking France, Germany or the United States,"" Kallas said. ""We have collective defense and we are not afraid. We don't see any miitary threats right now to us, and our focus is on helping Ukraine.""

Putin downplays effects of Russia sanctions

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said that Russia would find a way to ""adapt"" to the massive international sanctions and pullouts of Western corporations in response to the invasion of Ukraine.

""We have to get through this period,"" he said, claiming that the unprecedented sanctions would make Russia stronger. ""The economy will undoubtedly adapt to the new situation. This will lead to an increase in our independence, self-reliance and sovereignty,"" Putin said.

As Western goods and services are cut off from Russia, and shortages loom, Putin tried to reassure Russians that the Kremlin had everything under control.

""It is clear that in such moments people's demands for certain categories of goods always increase, but we have no doubt that we will solve these problems in due course in a calm way and gradually people will find their way,"" Putin said.

Speaking to a televised government conference, Putin said the sanctions, in fact, hurt the West more than Russia.

""Their prices are rising, but that's not our fault. It's the result of their own miscalculations. There's no need to blame us,"" Putin said. ""They are telling their citizens to tighten their belts, to dress warmer,"" Putin said, adding that Russia was continuing to export oil and gas to Europe.

Many European countries continue to be dependent on Russian oil and gas. The US and UK this week said they would ban imports of Russian petroleum products. The EU is exploring ways to wean itself from Russian energy, but has so far held back from including oil and gas in sanctions packages.

Belarus says it will power Chernobyl

Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear power plant would be powered with energy from neighboring Belarus.

The energy ministry in Minsk made the announcement, according to the BelTA state news agency.

Ukraine's state-run nuclear company said Russian Forces had cut a power line supplying electricity to the site on Wednesday.

Chernobyl no longer generates electricity, but it needs the power to help cool spent nuclear fuel. The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, reported no critical impact on safety.

Ukraine's state-owned energy firm Ukrenergo criticized Minsk's intervention saying a ceasefire was the best remedy.

""All reports by Russian and Belarusian media on the supply of the Chernobyl power plant from Belarus are a provocation aimed at aggravating the situation,"" it said in a statement.

Berlin government was unaware of Gerhard Schröder's reported Moscow visit

Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Politico reported on Thursday.

He was visiting as part of a mediation effort to end the war in Ukraine, Politico said, referring to ""sources familiar with the matter.""

German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit told DW that should the report be accurate, the visit was made without consulting the government.

Last week Chancellor Olaf Scholz called on Schröder to step down from the boards of Russian state-owned energy companies.

Schröder is a longtime business associate of Kremlin circles and Putin. Like Scholz, Schröder is a member of the center-left Social Democrats. His close ties to Russia after leaving politics have embarrassed the party on more than one occasion in recent years.

When asked about the report by journalists on Thursday, Scholz simply replied: ""I do not wish to comment on that.""

Klitschko: Kyiv turned into a 'fortress'

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said nearly half of the capital's residents had fled and the capital had been turned into a fortress.

Every street, every building, every checkpoint has been fortified,"" he said in a televised address. ""Even people who in their lives never intended to change their clothes, now they are in uniform with machine guns in their hands.""

The former boxing champion said the city was determined not to fall to advancing Russian forces. Russian troops have taken over the outskirts in the north and northwest of the city. More attacks are expected from the northeast.

Chelsea wants sanctions relief

Chelsea Football Club said activities would continue despite the sanctions against its owner Roman Abramovich.

Chelsea said they would ask the government to lift the restrictions, including a ban on new ticket sales.

""This will include seeking permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the Club to operate as normal as possible,"" the club said in a statement.

Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, whose portfolio includes sports, earlier said that the sanctions on Abramovich would ""obviously have a direct impact"" on Chelsea but would deprive ""Abramovich of benefiting from his ownership of the club.""

He previously said he would sell the club, but the sanctions make that impossible.

'Putin's idea of blitzkrieg has failed' — former Ukraine president

Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko has told DW that Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has been a failure.

""Today because of the Ukrainian army, because of our soldiers, because of the unity of Ukrainian people, Putin understands that his idea of blitzkrieg has failed,"" Poroshenko said.

The former president told Russia to remove its forces from Ukraine and to stop killing Ukrainians.

""Please get out from Ukrainian soil. Please get out your troops. Please stop killing Ukrainians. And this is absolutely firm basis for negotiation,"" he added.

The former president emphasized that solidarity with allies was now vital and called for ""support of Ukraine, not only by finance, not only by political means, but also in their defensive capabilities.""

""Putin declared war not only to Ukraine, but the whole West. He declared war against Germany, against us, against Ukraine, against Europe,"" Poroshenko added.

ECB speeds up exit from bond purchase and warns of higher inflation

The European Central Bank raised its inflation projections and cut its growth outlook owing in large part to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.

""The Russian invasion of Ukraine will negatively affect the euro area economy and has significantly increased uncertainty,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said.

The bank now sees inflation at more than twice its 2% target this year, climbing to 5.1%, up from 3.2% previously. In 2023 and 2024, the ECB now projects inflation of 2.1% and 1.9%, respectively.

""Energy costs have risen further in recent weeks and there will be further pressure on some food and commodity prices owing to the war in Ukraine,"" Lagarde said.

The bank said it would accelerate its exit from bond purchases. The purchases aim to keep borrowing costs low for companies and promote business investment and hiring.

The ECB also said its first interest rate hike wouldn't immediately follow the end of asset purchases, as previously indicated.

Russia ban certain exports following Western sanctions

Speaking in the Polish capital of Warsaw, Harris expressed outrage over the bombing of the hospital and scenes of bloodied pregnant women being evacuated.

Standing alongside Harris, Polish President Andrzej Duda said, ""It is obvious to us that in Ukraine Russians are committing war crimes.""

Scholz and Macron called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine during the 75-minute phone call with Russian president Vladimir Putin, a German government spokesman added.

Their demand echoed a statement made by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, earlier on Saturday, who said negotiations must begin with a suspension of hostilities.

The Kremlin readout of the call said Putin briefed Macron and Scholz about the state of play in negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv and responded to their concerns about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. It did not mention a ceasefire and accused Ukraine of using civilians as human shields.



The participants agreed to say nothing further about the substance of the phone call, according to the German spokesperson, who added: “The conversation is part of ongoing international efforts to end the war in Ukraine.”

Crisis talks between Moscow and Kyiv, which had been conducted in person in Belarus, have continued via a video link, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday, according to the RIA news agency.

Speaking at a news briefing, Zelenskiy said Ukrainian and Russian negotiating teams had started discussing concrete topics rather than exchanging ultimatums.

Stating that about 1,300 Ukrainian troops had been killed since the invasion began, he claimed the conflict meant some small Ukrainian towns now no longer existed.

Zelenskiy said Ukraine could not stop fighting but was upholding a ceasefire around an agreed “humanitarian corridor” out of the besieged southern port of Mariupol and called on Russia to do the same.

He further suggested negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to end the war could be held in Jerusalem.

He said he hoped the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, would have a “positive influence” on peace talks.

Bennett visited Moscow on 5 March, spending three hours with Putin before travelling on to Berlin to brief Scholz. He has spoken to Zelenskiy on multiple occasions since.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/putin-did-not-show-willingness-to-end-ukraine-war-during-call-french-official-says

Third round of dialogue yields small positive subductions

Russia’s call with its European counterparts comes as Moscow initiated the third round of negotiations in Belarus to agree on a humanitarian corridor for safe passage of the civilians, and subsequently prospects of a ceasefire. Russian President Putin expressed hope that Kyiv will take a fair and constructive approach as the long-awaited negotiations kick-started with “small positive” developments such as agreement on humanitarian corridors.

The arrangement, though, was marred with controversies after Ukraine slammed that direct such corridors only allowed the refugees to escape to either Russia or its ally Belarus. ""The third round of negotiations has ended. There are small positive subductions in improving the logistics of humanitarian corridors,” Mikhail Podolyak, adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile wrote on Twitter. “Intensive consultations have continued on the basic political bloc of the regulations, along with a cease-fire and security guarantees,” he added.

The talks had resumed between the delegation from Russia and Ukraine in the Belarusian city of Brest with Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky at the helm of Moscow's delegation and Kyiv's Podolyak leading his aides. The two sides discussed a range of political, military, international humanitarian aid issues as Ukraine witnessed heavy shelling and destruction to the civilian infrastructure.

Among several conditions put forth by Moscow for a ceasefire, the main suggestion to the Ukraine delegation was to change its Constitution to reject its goal of joining any Western or European alliances such as NATO. In the year 2019, Ukraine's parliament has made amendments to its Constitution that enshrine the nation’s will and roadmap to join NATO. Both Russia and Ukraine initiated the first round of negotiations on Feb. 28 in Gomel, Belarus near the border with Ukraine due to the latter’s reluctance of entering into Russian allied nations. The negotiations lasted for nearly 5 hours. Russia also declared a ""temporary"" cease-fire in Kyiv, Mariupol, Kharkiv, and Sumy from 10 a.m. local time (0700GMT) to ensure the evacuation of civilians briefly.",https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-crisis/russia-ukraine-war-putin-discusses-kyiv-ceasefire-with-counterparts-olaf-scholz-and-macron-articleshow.html
