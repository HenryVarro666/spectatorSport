The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

Boris Johnson said the UK was “certainly looking at going up a gear in our support for the Ukrainians as they defend themselves”.

Asked what would need to happen for sanctions to be lifted against Russia, the British Prime Minister told the Commons Liaison Committee that a ceasefire would not be enough and that “goes straight into (Vladimir) Putin’s playbook”.

“In my view, we should continue to intensify sanctions with a rolling programme until every single one of his troops is out of Ukraine,” he said.

Asked if that included Crimea, he added: “As I said, every single one of these troops is out of Ukraine.”

Johnson was asked if this would include Georgia, which has been occupied since 2008.

He said: “I think that we need to to have a total rethink about all the support that we offer countries such as Georgia and Ukraine.” He said rather than offering them full Nato membership, the West should instead change the “security architecture” by arming those countries so heavily that Russia would not invade.

Johnson said western countries should be engaging in negotiations with Putin, but only if that is what Ukraine wants.

Asked whether French President Emmanuel Macron had been speaking to the Russia leader for “too long”, he said that “Putin is plainly not to be trusted”.

I think the most important thing and here I think Emmanuel and I would be in total agreement, the most important thing is that whatever happens should be what the Ukrainians want, and it’s for them to decide what their future should be. That is what is at stake here. It’s not for any of us, you know, whatever we may think to try to create a future for them, it’s for them to decide their future.

Johnson also said he understood why US President Joe Biden had said Putin should be removed from the Kremlin but that was “not the objective of the UK Government”.

He told MPs that “to desire a change of government in itself is not an ignoble thing” as he joked that some MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee would “like a change in this government”.

But he said: “It’s not the objective of the UK Government and it’s very, very important everybody gets this, we are simply setting out to help to protect the people of Ukraine and to protect them against absolutely barbaric and unreasonable violence.”",https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-latest-events-5724921-Mar2022/

Ušli smo u 37. dan ruske invazije na Ukrajinu. Borbe i dalje traju, poginuli se broje u tisućama, stradavaju civili, gradovi nestaju s lica zemlje... Iako je iza nas i nekoliko rundi pregovora, nikakav veći pomak nije ostvaren...",https://www.24sata.hr/news/ruskainvazijanaukrajinu37dan-826171
