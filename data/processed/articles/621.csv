US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will visit Slovakia and Bulgaria after NATO’s Defense Ministers Meeting in Brussels on Wednesday. Both countries possess S-300 surface-to-air missile systems, designed in the 1970s in the Soviet Union. The systems are precious for Ukraine, because its servicemen know how to operate them.

According to two of the CNN sources, Slovakia wants assurances that the systems will be replaced immediately with Western armament.

Austin III (@SecDef) March 9, 2022

Any country providing S-300s is likely to receive the US-made Patriot air defense missile system to backfill the capability it would be giving up, according to two other sources familiar with the negotiations. Germany and the Netherlands have already publicly announced that they are sending Patriots to Slovakia. But integrating a new, complex air defense system into a country’s existing military architecture, as well as training its forces to use it, can take time, one source familiar with the matter cautioned.

A diplomat in the region quoted by CNN said it’s “not a done deal” that Slovakia will provide Ukraine with S-300sbut noted that Germany is bringing in Patriots now, which would cover Slovakia’s ability to defend itself. Slovak troops would also not need training as they’ve operated Patriots in joint missions with other countries previously, the diplomat said.

The push to get more S-300s into the hands of the Ukrainians comes as Congress has been pressing the Biden administration to help Ukraine obtain the air defense system. Lawmakers in both parties, who heard from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a speech Wednesday morning, have urged the US to do more to help Ukraine obtain the weapons it is seeking, particularly after the administration opposed a plan last week to provide Ukraine with Polish MiG-29 jets.

From Slovakia, Austin will head to Bulgaria, where he will meet with senior civilian and military leaders.

The visits come amid reports that the US is exploring sending Ukraine more weapons amid its war with Russia.

According to reports, Bulgaria is reluctant to supply Ukraine with armament. The country, where the pro-Russian sentiments have deep historic roots, is providing assistance to Ukrainian refugees, some of which of Bulgarian origin. But Bulgaria is so far resisting calls to beef up its deficient army with troops and armament from other NATO countries.",https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/slovakia-preliminarily-agrees-to-send-key-air-defense-system-to-ukraine/
1,7af9d179-adca-4f58-adbe-18a80c8191e6,['Anita Powell'],,"U.S. President Joe Biden answered Ukraine’s plea for help on Wednesday with an $800 million assistance package that includes a range of weapons and defensive gear — a response that falls short of the no-fly zone Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeks as his country faces continued attacks from Russia.

But Biden also raised the temperature in the war of words between himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I think he is a war criminal,” Biden said, speaking to journalists at an event later in the day. He did not elaborate and walked away.

In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the TASS news agency Biden's statement was ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric.""

“The president's remarks speak for themselves,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, when pressed for details. “He was speaking from his heart and speaking from what you've seen on television, which is barbaric actions by a brutal dictator through his invasion of a foreign country.”

Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago. His forces have struck hospitals, schools and homes. Zelenskyy said that about 100 children have been killed in the full-scale attack.

The new U.S. aid package “brings the total of new U.S. security assistance to Ukraine to $1 billion just this week,” Biden said.

“This new package on its own is going to provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine,” the president added. “It includes 800 anti-aircraft systems to make sure the Ukrainian military can continue to stop the planes and helicopters that have been attacking their people and to defend their Ukrainian airspace.”

In addition to the 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems that Biden mentioned, the package includes 2,000 Javelin and 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems; hundreds of grenade launchers, shotguns and machine guns; thousands of rifles and pistols; more than 20 million rounds of ammunition and tens of thousands of sets of body armor and helmets.

The Pentagon Wednesday said efforts to deliver the equipment are already underway.

“We understand the tyranny of time here,” a senior U.S. defense official told reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence and other sensitive matters.

“We've already started working on how to source all these all these items and get them there as quickly as possible,” the official said, noting that despite Russian threats, “things are still getting into the hands of the Ukrainians … Those routes are still open.”

The official declined to go into detail about reports that some allies, including Slovakia, are willing to provide Kyiv with the Russian-made S-300 air defense system, capable of shooting down enemy aircraft as well as some ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.

“There are air defense systems, mobile systems that that we know the Ukrainians know how to use and we also know that there are allies and partners who also possess them and might be willing to provide,” the official said. “We’re actively having those discussions.”

The new U.S. assistance package follows an impassioned plea Zelenskyy made Wednesday to U.S. lawmakers, begging them to do more to protect his nation amid a 3-week-old onslaught by Russian forces.

Watch video by VOA's Katherine Gypson:

In his speech before a joint session of Congress, Zelenskyy evoked some of the worst traumas of American history to ask the U.S. to give more military assistance and impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine’s besieged cities.

“Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided,” Zelenskyy said, speaking virtually to a packed session of U.S. lawmakers in a speech that evoked the painful memories of Japan’s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, which spurred the U.S. to enter World War II; and the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, which launched the U.S.’s multifront, two-decades-long Global War on Terror.

The 44-year-old actor-turned-president, who spoke in English for part of his address, also raised the more inspiring parts of American history, including the words of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

“I need to protect our sky,” Zelenskyy said. “I need your decision, your help, which means exactly the same, the same you feel when you hear the words, ‘I have a dream.’”

He reiterated his request for a no-fly zone, a request the White House has said would put the U.S. into direct confrontation with Russia.

‘Not-too-hot, not-too-cold’

Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University, described Biden’s response as “about the right not-too-hot, not-too-cold solution” that will help Ukraine defend itself while avoiding a confrontation between two nuclear powers.

Zelenskyy’s requests for air support “will have only a marginal effect on the military outcome in Ukraine. The primary Russian threat to Ukraine right now is not the Russian air force, which so far has been surprisingly ineffective,” Biddle said.

“Biden has the responsibility of statesmanship to resist even a powerful dramatic appeal from an immensely sympathetic hero in the form of Zelenskyy and do what we can to help, but not necessarily do everything Zelenskyy is asking him to do,” Biddle told VOA, via Skype. “Sometimes, statesmanship involves making very hard unpleasant choices, like not doing everything a brave, noble underdog ally would like you to do.”

Psaki said Biden watched Zelenskyy’s speech from the White House. She said the administration is in close contact with the Ukrainian government and that none of Zelenskyy’s requests came as a surprise.

“If we were President Zelenskyy, we would be asking for everything possible as well, and continuing to ask for it,” she said. “Because he is watching his country and his people be attacked and brutalized by President Putin and the Russian military. But how President Biden makes decisions is through the prism of our own national security, and as we've said before, a no-fly zone would require implementation, it would require us potentially shooting down Russian planes, NATO shooting down Russian planes, and we are not interested in getting into World War III.”

Instead, Washington is pursuing what officials say are harsh and effective sanctions against Russia, with a special focus on the wealthy elites who surround Russian President Vladimir Putin. To that end, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Attorney General Merrick Garland met virtually on Wednesday with officials from Australia, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Commission to launch the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) multilateral task force.

‘This is a lie’

Putin seems to be unfazed by the opposition, and told Russian media on Wednesday that he will continue what he describes as a “special operation” in Ukraine.

“The West is trying to convince its citizens that their difficulties are the result of Russia’s actions, but this is a lie,” Russian media reported Putin as saying.

Following a meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels on Wednesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reiterated that the alliance is “united” in holding firm in their opposition to imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, despite Zelenskyy’s repeated calls for one.

He also said the alliance must continue to provide significant support to Ukraine, including military supplies, financial help and humanitarian aid. He also called on Russia to stop its attacks on Ukraine.

“Allies are united both in providing support to Ukraine, to support Ukraine to uphold the right for self-defense,” Stoltenberg told a press conference. “But allies are also united when it comes to that NATO should not deploy forces on the ground or in the airspace of Ukraine. Because we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict, this war, doesn't escalate beyond Ukraine.”

Russia has objected to NATO’s presence near its borders and sought a guarantee that Ukraine will never join the alliance. NATO insists countries are free to make their own decisions about security ties.

While Ukraine is not part of NATO, seven NATO countries share borders with Russia, Ukraine or Russian ally Belarus, and that proximity has raised concerns of a wider conflict.

Stoltenberg said Wednesday there are 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe and another 40,000 troops under direct NATO command, as well as hundreds of thousands more on heightened alert across NATO nations.

Biden is to join other NATO leaders in Brussels for a summit taking place March 24, marking one month since Russia launched its invasion after denying for months it planned to do so.

On the ground in Ukraine, the country’s emergencies agency reported a 12-story residential building was among the targets hit by Russian forces. Ukrainian officials also said Russia bombed a theater in Mariupol where hundreds of people were taking shelter.

2,7af9d179-adca-4f58-adbe-18a80c8191e6,['Voa News'],,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for Germany’s help Thursday, telling the German Parliament that a new wall is being erected in Europe “between freedom and bondage.”

""And this wall is getting bigger with every bomb that falls on Ukraine, with every decision that is not taken,"" Zelenskyy said in his video address.

He criticized Germany for its support of the now-suspended Nord Stream 2 pipeline project meant to carry natural gas from Russia, saying that Germany had put its economic concerns ahead of Ukraine’s security.

""We turned to you,"" he said. ""We told you that Nord Stream was a kind of preparation for the war,” Zelenskyy said.

In the besieged southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, rescue efforts were continuing Thursday at a theater where Ukraine said Russia carried out an airstrike Wednesday on the site, where hundreds of civilians had been sheltering.

Satellite images of the site released by the Maxar space technology company showed the word “children” written in Russian on the pavement outside the theater as recently as Monday to alert pilots of Russian warplanes of people inside.

Also Wednesday, Russian airstrikes hit a municipal pool complex where

pregnant women and women with children where sheltering, according to Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the regional Donetsk administration.

There were no reports of casualties from the attack on the pool complex, but the governor of northern city of Chernihiv said Thursday that at least 53 who were killed in heavy Russian aerial and ground attacks arrived at morgues in the past 24 hours.

Russia has denied any involvement.

In the meantime, the Ukrainian government said Russia conducted more airstrikes on Mariupol and attacks on other areas of Ukraine early Thursday, including on the towns of Kalynivka and Brovary outside the capital of Kyiv.

The mayor of the eastern town of Merefa said Russian artillery leveled a school and community center overnight but did not immediately report any casualties.

On Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden answered Ukraine’s plea for help with an $800 million assistance package that includes a range of weapons and defensive gear — a response that falls short of the no-fly zone Zelenskyy has sought.

Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago. His forces have struck hospitals, schools and homes. Zelenskyy said Wednesday that about 100 children have been killed in the full-scale attack.

“We've already started working on how to source all these all these items and get them there as quickly as possible,” the official said, noting that despite Russian threats, “things are still getting into the hands of the Ukrainians … Those routes are still open.”

At a news conference Thursday in Bratislava with Slovakian Defense Minister Jaroslav Naj’, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, “Enforcing a no-fly zone actually means that you’re in combat, you’re in a fight with Russia.”



Defense minister Naj’ said that Slovakia, a NATO member, would be willing to provide S-300 long-range air defense missile systems to Ukraine if his country received a “proper replacement” for its S-300s or if it received a “capability guaranteed for a certain period of time.”



Austin was non-committal on Slovakia’s proposal, telling reporters, “These are things that we will continue to work with all of our allies on, and certainly this is not just a U.S. issue, it’s a NATO issue.”



Western officials said Thursday that significant differences remain between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators who held talks Wednesday by video. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said “there is a very, very big gap between the positions in question.”

4,7af9d179-adca-4f58-adbe-18a80c8191e6,['阿妮塔 鲍威尔'],,"美国总统乔·拜登星期三(3月16日)回应乌克兰发出的求救呼吁，宣布了8亿美元的援助方案，包括一系列的武器和防御装备。但是，这项援助没有满足乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基提出的设立禁飞区以保护国家免受俄罗斯持续攻击的要求。



但是拜登还将他与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京之间的舌战升温。



在同天随后的一次活动中，他对记者们说：“我认为他是个战争罪犯。”拜登没有详细说明便离开了。



作为回应，克里姆林宫发言人德米特里·佩斯科夫对塔斯社说，拜登的这番话是“不可接受和不可宽恕的言辞”。



“总统的评论不言而喻，”白宫新闻秘书詹·莎琪被记者追问细节时说。“他发自本心说话，并说到了你们在电视看到的情景，那是一个残暴独裁者通过入侵外国而做出的野蛮行为。”



普京三个星期前发动了对乌克兰的入侵。他的军队击中了医院、学校和民宅。泽连斯基说，在这场全面进攻中，已有大约100名儿童丧生。

新的美国对乌援助

拜登说，新的美国援助方案“将使美国对乌克兰的新安全援助总额仅在本星期就达到10亿美元”。他还说：“这项新的方案本身就将向乌克兰提供前所未有的援助。它包括800套防空系统，以确保乌克兰军队能够继续阻止一直在攻击他们的人民的飞机与直升机，并保卫他们的乌克兰领空。”



除了拜登提到的800套毒刺式防空系统之外，这项援助方案还包括2千枚标枪反坦克导弹和1千枚轻型反装甲武器和6千个AT-4反装甲系统、数以百计的榴弹发射器、霰弹枪和机关枪，数以千计的步枪和手枪以及超过2千万发弹药和数以万计的防弹服和头盔。



五角大楼星期三说，运送设备的努力已经在进行之中。



一名要求匿名以讨论情报和其它敏感事宜的美国高级国防官员说：“我们理解在这个问题上时间压倒一切。”



“我们已经就如何获取所有这些物件并尽快把它们送到那里而开始努力，”这位官员说。这位官员还说，虽然有俄罗斯方面的威胁，“物资仍在送入乌克兰人的手中......这些路线仍然是开通的。”



有报道说，某些盟国，比如斯洛伐克，愿意向基辅方面提供可以击落敌机的俄制S-300防空系统以及一些弹道导弹和巡航导弹。但是，那位美国国防官员拒绝谈论有关细节。



“我们知道乌克兰方面知道如何使用这些防空系统、移动式系统，我们也知道有盟友和伙伴拥有这些系统，而且有可能愿意提供，”这位官员说。“我们正在积极进行这些讨论。”

泽连斯基对美国会讲话

在美国宣布新的援助方案之前，乌克兰总统泽连斯基星期三对美国国会发表了讲话，动情地请求议员们付出更多努力来保护乌克兰。俄军在乌克兰的杀戮已经持续了三个星期。



泽连斯基在讲话中提到了美国历史上一些给人们留下最大心理创伤的事件。他请求美国国会和拜登增加军事援助，并在遭到围攻的乌克兰城市上空设立禁飞区。



泽连斯基通过视频连线对座无虚席的美国国会参众两院联席会议发表演说。他提到了日本1941年袭击珍珠港和2001年9月11日美国遭到恐怖袭击的这些痛苦回忆。珍珠港事件促使美国投入第二次世界大战，9/11恐怖袭击让美国发动了历时20年的多方位全球反恐战争。泽连斯基说：“此刻，正在决定的是我们国家的命运。”

今年44岁、演员出身的泽连斯基总统在部分演说中使用了英语。他还提到了美国历史上更为鼓舞人心的部分，包括民权运动领袖小马丁·路德·金的话语。



“我需要保护我们的天空，”泽连斯基说。“我需要你们的决定、你们的帮助，这跟你们听到这样一句话时的意思和感觉是完全一样的，这句话就是：‘我有一个梦’。”



他再次提出了设立禁飞区的请求。白宫已表示，这将使美国陷入与俄罗斯的直接冲突。

白宫没有同意设立禁飞区，但是白宫官员表示，华盛顿正寻求对俄罗斯实施更为严厉和有效的制裁，特别专注于普京身边腰缠万贯的上层人士。为此，美国财政部长珍妮特·耶伦和美国司法部长梅里克·加兰德星期三通过视频连线与澳大利亚、加拿大、德国、法国、意大利、日本、英国与欧盟委员会的官员会晤，成了对付“俄罗斯精英分子、代理人、寡头”的多边工作组。



俄罗斯总统普京似乎对他遇到的阻力无动于衷。他星期三对俄罗斯媒体说，他将在乌克兰继续他号称的“特别军事行动”

俄罗斯媒体援引普京的话说：“西方正试图让他们的公民相信，他们的困难是俄罗斯的行动造成的，但这是一个谎言。”

北约反对设立禁飞区

星期三，北约在布鲁塞尔召开了一次防长会议。北约秘书长延斯·斯托尔滕贝格会后重申，虽然泽连斯基一再提出请求，但北约联盟立场“团结”，反对在乌克兰上空设立禁飞区。



他还说，北约联盟必须继续向乌克兰提供重大支持，包括军事物资、财政帮助和人道救援。他还呼吁俄罗斯停止攻击乌克兰。



“盟国在向乌克兰提供支持、支持乌克兰维持自卫权利方面都是团结的，”斯托尔滕贝格在记者会上说。“但是，盟国在北约不应在乌克兰地面或领空部署军队的问题上也是团结的。因为我们有责任确保这场冲突、这场战争不会升级到乌克兰之外。”



早些时候，美国国防部长劳埃德·奥斯汀强调了对乌克兰自卫能力的支持以及美国对任何遭到攻击的北约盟国的承诺。

奥斯汀说：“我认为，我们在这里的存在向世界发出一个信号，那就是我们仍然团结一致地支持乌克兰，我们谴责俄罗斯对乌克兰无端和无理的入侵。”



俄罗斯拒绝接受北约在其边界附近的存在并曾试图让北约保证乌克兰永远也不会入盟。北约坚持认为，各国有权就本国的安全关系作出自己的决定。



虽然乌克兰不是北约成员国，但是北约有七个成员国与俄罗斯、乌克兰或俄罗斯的盟友白俄罗斯接壤，这种近距离增加了人们对冲突扩大的担心。



斯托尔滕贝格星期三说，在欧洲有10万美军，还有4万军队在北约直接指挥下，而且北约各国还有几十万部队加强了戒备。



拜登计划与其他北约领导人一道参加定于3月24日在布鲁塞尔举行的峰会，这一天将是俄罗斯发动侵乌战争一个月。在入侵之前，俄罗斯一直矢口否认计划入侵。



在乌克兰境内，乌克兰紧急事务局报告说，被俄军击中的目标包括一座12层的居民楼。乌克兰官员还说，俄罗斯轰炸了马里乌波尔有数百人栖身的一座剧院。
