On Thursday afternoon, they were equally resolute when they came to the opposite conclusion.

In a stunning reversal, the International Paralympic Committee bowed to heavy internal pressure and barred athletes from Russia and Belarus on the eve of the opening ceremony, extending the global sporting isolation of both countries in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.

Citing threats by several federations to boycott the Paralympic Games, mounting discontent in the athletes’ village and fears that a “deteriorating” situation there could lead to violence, the International Paralympic Committee said the situation had changed so dramatically overnight that the viability of the Games would be in jeopardy if organizers did not expel the Russian and Belarusian delegations.

“The environment in the village is deteriorating,” said Andrew Parsons, the president of the I.P.C. He said rising anger and threats by multiple national committees, some under pressure from their governments, to withdraw from the Games had made the situation “untenable.”

Russia’s sports minister, Oleg Matytsin, told journalists in Moscow that the country was preparing an immediate appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland that would seek to overturn the exclusion of Russian athletes before the Games open.

“Today’s decision of the International Paralympic Committee to bar our team is a blatant violation of athletes’ rights and a manipulation of the Olympic Charter and human lives’ values in pursue of political goals,” Matytsin said, according to the state-run news agency TASS.

The announcement came less than a day after the committee had said it would allow athletes from both countries to compete as neutrals in Beijing, a response to the invasion that was widely criticized as inadequate. By Thursday morning, Paralympic officials met again and decided they had little choice but to throw out the two teams.

Parsons said that there had been no reports of confrontations or violence between athletes, but that tensions were rising. He said there was a “huge” concern for the safety of participants, including 71 Russians athletes.

“The village is not the place for fights,” Parsons said.

The move made the Paralympics the latest international sporting organization to bar Russian and Belarusian athletes and teams in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which was staged with Belarusian support. Sports like soccer, tennis, auto racing and figure skating already have barred Russian and Belarusian athletes since the International Olympic Committee took the extraordinary step this week of suggesting global federations and event organizers put in place a global ban on athletes from the two countries as a result of their actions in Ukraine.

The Russian and Belarusian Paralympic delegations — whose athletes initially had been cleared to compete if they agreed to do so without their national names, flags or anthems — could appeal the decision in court. But the Games are set to hold their opening ceremony on Friday, and their first events on Saturday.

Russia’s Paralympic committee criticized the reversal as “completely unfounded,” and said it unfairly portrayed the Russian committee and its Paralympic athletes “as the perpetrators of the current political conflicts.”

“In this regard, the R.P.C. considers the I.P.C.’s decision illegal and reserves the right to defend the rights and interests of Russian para athletes” in court, it said in a statement.

Athletes from both Ukraine and Russia practiced on Thursday, sometimes side by side, but Parsons said the I.P.C. now would work with the Russian and Belarusian delegations to get their teams home from China.

On Wednesday, Parsons had said the I.P.C. could not remove the athletes from Russia and Belarus because there was no specific mechanism to do so in the organization’s constitution; at the time, he said it was the I.P.C.’s “duty” to allow the Russians to participate.

On Thursday, he acknowledged that the legal situation had not changed, but that the situation on the ground had. The executive board, he argued, was equally bound to protect the viability of the Paralympic Games in the face of growing discontent. By Thursday, for example, teams in wheelchair curling and sled hockey had informed Paralympic officials that they would refuse to play against Russian opponents.

“The I.P.C. is a membership-based organization,” he said, “and we are receptive to the views of our member organizations.”

By then, Parsons said, a large number of members had reached out and urged the I.P.C. to reconsider its decision. Ukraine’s athletes released a statement voicing their disapproval, saying the claims of “political neutrality” from sports administrators were “a convenient lie used to deflect calls to stand up for human rights and peace.”

On Thursday, their team’s leader left no doubt about the country’s position. “Russia and Belarus must leave the Paralympic Games as soon as possible,” said Valerii Sushkevich, a member of Ukraine’s parliament and the president of the nation’s Paralympic committee.

Parsons, who had declared on Wednesday that the Russian and Belarussian athletes had a right to compete because they were not responsible for the invasion, expressed regret on Thursday that their dreams of competing at the Games would not be fulfilled.

“To the para athletes from the impacted countries, we are very sorry that you are affected by the decisions that your government took last week in breaching the Olympic truce,” he said. “You are victims of your government’s actions.”

The Games, though, will go ahead. The opening ceremony will take place in Beijing on Friday night, and competition begins Saturday in Alpine skiing, sled hockey, cross-country skiing and wheelchair curling.

Said Parsons: “We can at least preserve the experience for the around 600 athletes that are still competing here.”",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/02/world/ukraine-russia-war

This post starts over the weekend when the Hungarian government offered it's train system to Ukrainian refugees crossing into Hungary with no limits on where they could trave from the border station. The following Monday my hands were absolutely freezing while I was working on the interior of my new house (it doesn't have any heating). As I stopped to warm them up again by taking off my gloves and blowing on them, I thought to myself ""damn man. There's people walking in this E36 M3"". Rumor has it, the border crossing is measured in DAYS (10 of them, was the most I'd heard) and of course Ukraine was all they talked about on the radio that morning. It snowed a while later, and again that night.



Tuesday I was dropping off my youngest at the pre-school and I ran into a English speaking teacher friend of mine doing the same. Someone from a building neighboring her school had asked her if she had an extra ball on Monday. When she asked why he would ever need a ball, the reason he gave was ""There's about 20 kids in here, and not a damn one of them has a toy""



She investigated and found 48 refugees now housed in the building. That was the start of a whirlwind of events.



She went shopping immediately, and shortly after I was able to snoop around and find the building she was talking about. It's an old Russian barracks left over from when that area was a tank base (last used in the 80's). It's home to a group of migrant men from Ukraine who were brought over on a contract to build a new highway nearby. The asked the building owner if they could bring their families before the fighting got to where they were from, and he graciously agreed. The train service I mentioned got them into town.



I went in to see what they needed. The short version of that was ""yes, and we need it now"". I left after a quick walk through where I tried and failed to take notes, my head a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions. It was like I didn't know which way to go, but was trying to go every way at once. Somehow I ended up at the post office. Mrs. Hungary had a package delivered.



Things cleared up a little later on the drive to the store. I was headed there to fill the truck with whatever I could. But decided in the parking lot that instead of going wild with the credit card all at once, I'd take to the keyboard and I sent out a public SOS on the book of faces. After that, I went off to secure some baby formula (One of the mothers was down to the bottom of her last box). Short story long, my phone absolutely blew up while I was trying to check out, and it's been blowing up ever since.



We got 4 kids to the doctors, none of the cases too serious (well, one of the babies tested positive for COVID). Mostly just fever reduction medicine, nasal spray, and cough suppressants. The appropriate medical authorities have been notified of the COVID case and will be involved from now on.



The outpouring of local community support meant we were able to meet their immediate needs (electric heaters, baby stuff, medicine, etc). These are people who DO have one local working member in the family present, so they're not in danger of starving. But that being said, they didn't bring anything with them either. Plus the barracks were home to nothing but bachelors, so the kitchen was devoid of anything other than bottle openers and a coffee maker (well, there were stoves present, but no pots or pans), nothing that kids could play with, and the food in the place was mostly sausage and chips



We're on Wednesday now (holy crap, has it really been only 36 hours) and Mrs. Hungary and I have found ourselves centered in this new organization we seem to have created. People are volunteering faster than we can collect goods! The 4-Runner is over half-loaded on it's second run, and there's more stuff at the house. Another friend of ours (a Hungarian speaking Swedish lady) is coordinating amongst others in the international community and has an equal amount of stuff to deliver. I think we all got the worlds fastest crash course in what it means to organize relief aid (and we've learned a lot!).



Right now, we're working on calming things down. People were understandably a bit panicked when they arrived but now that they've spent some nights in the building they're realizing that this is a place they can stay. Our first order of business will be on three fronts:



1) Organize the donations with a focal in the building (an employee of the building) who can be tasked with handing them out as needed. This will help us ensure everyone gets something (Our first goods delivered were often absorbed by whoever was there and first and going forward with that would be very counter productive), and it would help us know what is needed for the next visit.

2) Get that kitchen operational! The kitchen adequately sized and laid out like a cafeteria so it should be no problem for everyone to share the facility once it's sufficiently stocked with kitchenware. Plus doing so would go a long way with helping the residents towards self sufficiency.

3) Find a room and convert it to a play room. Those dang kids will go nuts if they're locked in doors all day (I know mine do). We need a place where they can scream and throw toys.



Once those three are settled, we can work on ""relief aid"" I think. Just something where we pop in time to time and break the monotony with something nice for the kids and parents. This place wasn't really made to house ""family dynamics"" and the employees that work there (three each) are janitors, and maintenance folk. Not counselors. Having some strangers in to bring in fresh activities and treats would probably go a long way with easing the tension in the place.



On the weird side, I got to talk to the Mayor! He was a little shocked to know that these guys were in town, and was more shocked that we found him before he did. He said he was actually expecting a group of refugees here shortly, but apparently it wasn't this one. He plans to house this next group near a bus station we have in town.



Anyhoo, I went to sleep last night at midnight knowing I had to be back up at 6am. Next visit is scheduled for Friday at 8am.

Indeed, a kindergartener in the early 1800s would have learned that Ceres was a planet.

So while the argument over planethood might seem like a modern astronomical debate, 19th century astronomers were bedeviled by this of question of how to define what actually counts as a planet.

And, as alluded to, Ceres predates Pluto in his controversy. The asteroid belt, which sits roughly between Mars and Jupiter, is filled with minor planets and asteroids. One of those celestial bodies, Ceres, has a surface covered in minerals like clay and carbonates, as well as water ice. It is an odd world, to be sure: because it is not completely frozen and is covered in salt water, scientists believe Ceres could harbor microbial life. This place Ceres in stark contrast with Pluto, which is on the far side of the solar system and has an entirely frozen surface. In addition, whereas Ceres is a dull monochromatic gray, Pluto's colors range from white and black to vivid orange.

Yet Ceres and Pluto have one very important thing in common: Astronomers at one point thought they should be classified as planets, but then changed their mind. It all comes down to size, which in the case of planetary science really does matter.

Flashback to the beginning of the 19th century. An Italian priest and astronomer named Giuseppe Piazzi at the Palermo Observatory had answered a nearly three-decade old question: Why did the orbits of Mars and Jupiter indicate that a planet existed between them even though none could be found? On Jan. 1, 1801, Piazzi seemed to answer this question by announcing that he had found a ""star"" which had moved from its position in the Taurus constellation. Scientists soon concluded that this must be the missing planet and assumed the matter was resolved.

Then another ""planet"" was discovered. On March 28, 1802, German physician and astronomer Heinrich Olbers discovered Pallas; this was rapidly followed by Juno in 1804 and Vesta in 1807. Each was duly designated as a planet, although astronomers began to have their doubts that this increasingly-cumbersome system was working out. Although scientists were given a breather for a few decades, a plethora of new discoveries between 1845 and 1852 left the astronomical community with 15 asteroids to account for. None of the new ones were labeled as planets, but it was becoming increasingly clear that reforms would be necessary. By 1867, it was clear that Ceres was too small to be grouped in with a body like Earth, and so it was given a new designation: Minor planet. And instead of being given fancy names and symbols, they would be labeled with numbers based on when they were discovered or their determination of orbit.

This bring us to Pluto. While Ceres has a diameter of 588 miles (compared to the Earth's 7918 mile diameter), Pluto has a comparatively heftier diameter of 1477 miles. Yet this did not save Pluto from getting the axe as a planet when the International Astronomical Union met in 2006. The reason was, quite simply, that astronomers had decided that there were three criteria for being considered a planet:

So, the three criteria of the IAU for a full-sized planet are:

It is in orbit around the Sun.

It has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape).

It has ""cleared the neighborhood"" around its orbit.



Because Pluto did not meet the third requirement — it has not ""cleared the neighborhood"" around its orbit — it lost its status as a planet. Clearing the neighborhood means that the region of space near which it orbits the sun is bereft of larger bodies, having been absorbed into the planet. Ceres, like Pluto, clearly doesn't pass this criteria: the asteroid belt in which Ceres resides is evidence of a ""failed"" planet that didn't clear its neighborhood. Indeed, there are multiple other relatively massive bodies — Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea — also in Ceres' vicinity.

Pluto had held this distinction of planet for 76 years, starting with its discovery in 1930 by American astronomer Clyde W. Tombaugh. The demotion of Pluto to dwarf planet remains controversial, and not just among lay astronomers. A team of American scientists published a paper in December in the scientific journal Icarus arguing that a ""planet"" should be defined as any geologically active celestial body. One co-author argued that we should say there are ""probably over 150 planets in our solar system""; the paper claimed that the need to distinguish planets from moons is cultural, not scientific, and hinders proper understanding of astronomy.

""We found that during the 1800s the non-scientific public in the Latin west developed its own folk taxonomy about planets reflecting the concerns of astrology and theology, and that this folk taxonomy eventually affected the scientists,"" the scientists explained. They later concluded that ""using the geophysical planet concept with subcategories for the individual features (including gravitational dominance) makes the planet concept both useful and deeply insightful for communicating with the public."" This did not happen in 2006, they assert, because ""because adequate time was not taken to sort these issues,"" with the resulting vote leading to ""a deeper split in the community.""

Ironically, even as Pluto was being demoted, Ceres nearly received a promotion. An earlier 21st century proposal for defining a planet would have done so by describing a planet as having enough mass to be nearly round and to orbit around a star without being a satellite of a planet or a star itself. Had this definition been accepted, Ceres would have become the fifth planet from the Sun.",https://www.rawstory.com/russians-fire-on-ukraine-civilians-blocking-road-to-nuclear-plant/

Russians turned on the ""lying machine."" Fakes

As previously warned, Russia has begun to spread a bunch of fakes. They hacked the websites of several local communities, launched fakes in their media, spread fakes through Ukrainian channels about the humanitarian catastrophe in Berdiansk, ""dispersed"" fake lists with personal data and photos of alleged members of the secret subversive groups, tried to order topographic maps from topographers, saying in pure Russian it's for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and distributed fakes about tags on Google Maps. All this happened yesterday.

Be attentive! The Russians launched an ad on Facebook under the guise of SBU messages. Under no circumstances should you follow the links in the publication.

Russians' attack on ZNPP

At night, the Russians fired on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, resulting in a fire in the building of the training center. For a long time, rescuers couldn't enter the ZNPP territory to put out the fire. There have been several conflicting allegations of enemy shelling of the unit.

At around 6 am, rescuers managed to enter the ZNPP territory and put out the fire. However, ZNPP, unfortunately, was captured by Russian troops.

After the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate announced this, a video appeared where the mayor of Enerhodar, lowering his eyes, said that the fire was extinguished at the station, there were no civilian casualties, and urged city residents not to provoke the Russian military. Energoatom has already stated that the appeal was ""recorded under the barrel of a machine gun."" It can be seen that the official reads the text from the paper and looks unnatural.

The attack on the Zaporizhzhia NPP was another reason for Zelenskyy to appeal to the world community to close the skies over Ukraine. Zelenskyy also spoke with US President Biden at night, during the shelling of ZNPP.

Currently, the radiation background is normal, according to the Zaporizhzhia Regional State Administration. Only the fourth power unit is working.

11:31 – Energoatom reported a powerful explosion in Enerhodar.

12:30 – Russian vehicles arrived in Enerhodar

The IAEA will urgently inspect nuclear power plants in Ukraine. This will be done due to the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the occupiers. An inspection in the Chernobyl zone is also planned, Energoatom reported.

Ukraine's accession to the EU

Ukraine's application for EU membership has been registered and the review procedure has begun. On average, the application procedure lasts from 3 to 10 years. The European Parliament recommended granting Ukraine the status of a candidate for EU membership, it was known yesterday.

Today, German Chancellor Scholz said that Ukraine's and Georgia's accession to the EU was not relevant at the moment. Both countries have recently applied to join the European Union.

Kyiv

Since the beginning of the war, a total of 578 military and civilian wounded have been taken to hospitals in the Kyiv region, the Kyiv Regional State Administration.

According to the Armed Forces, the main efforts of the occupiers are focused on the encirclement of Kyiv and the weakening of resistance in the blocked settlements. In the course of this task, the groups of the Russian Armed Forces exhausted most of the operational reserves and began preparations for the transfer of additional forces and resources from the Southern and Eastern military districts. The second echelons and most of the operational reserves of the occupying groups were put into operation.

The main enemy forces were blocked and stopped in the Makariv area. The occupiers withdrew from Bucha and Hostomel airfield.

In the direction of Brovary, the Russian invader has minus 4 infantry fighting vehicles, 2 tanks, and one infantry armored vehicle plus a Ukrainian unit. The enemy hides his equipment among the houses of civilians. Robbing shops. It's raging. Because they see their cars that have become scrap metal and know that the same fate awaits them! Glory to Ukraine.

13:00 – Fighting is taking place in the western direction from Kyiv, Arestovych confirms.

Enemy soldiers have already confiscated a local tractor, a Kamaz truck, and looted two grocery stores. At night, the aggressor's vehicles drove through the streets and flooded the windows with floodlights. Locals are threatened.

In the evening, the Armed Forces of Ukraine reports: Chernihiv is carrying out a heroic defense. Units of the operational group of troops hold positions on the occupied frontiers.

In the area of ​​the settlement of Mykhailo-Kotsiubynske, Chernihiv region, a column of up to 200 units of equipment and manpower is standing in front of the water barrier. The bridge across the river was destroyed.
