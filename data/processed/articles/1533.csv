Russian Black Sea Navy fleet overpainted hull numbers of their vessels in recent weeks, so no one knows what is the particular vessel on the photos. Like this project 1164 Slava-class cruise. A single representative of class in the Black Sea

What happened with Slava-class cruiser in Black Sea?

Question about Oscar II class Kursk submarine, Putin answered ""She has sunk""

Precise - no, waiting for more input data. Bridge is too small

Has it been geo located yet? #geolocation

Putin's foreign language is German, likely he has only basic knowledge of English

You know what's funny.. I heard Saddam spoke very good English and even his American guards liked him. I have heard Putin can speak English very well.. Just interesting. Don't most people respect a knowledge of languages?

But if obsolete radars of the vessel, are not able to track more than 1 target, there are multiple S-400 radars in Crimea, that according to rumours, spread by their manufacturers, could track ""more than 1 aerial target"". Than no exchange of data even between major assets

Russian Telegram channels discussing why powerful air defense of cruiser Moskva has not responded to subsonic cruise missiles, suggesting that it was busy with tracking TB2 drone elsewhere.

And of course, Russian Telegram channels, even of prominent propagandists/top influencers want retaliation ""erase Odesa from the face of Earth"" ""Odesa should be destroyed to the ground"". Cruiser Moskva was a legitimate military target, Odesa is not

But if obsolete radars of the vessel, are not able to track more than 1 target, there are multiple S-400 radars in Crimea, that according to rumours, spread by their manufacturers, could track ""more than 1 aerial target"".

Probably, without airborne radars(e.g. A50) that seems impossible for trajectories Odesa region - Zmeinii island

Neptune rockets fly 10 meters above sea level, maybe S-400 in Crimea would have some issues tracking that?

Russian Ministry of Defense claims another TB2 destroyed on the ground at Dnipro airfield (no more ""Dnipropetrovsk"" as in previous reports) #41 , 113% of Bayraktar TB2 destroyed

According to Russian numbers it would be Bayraktar #40 (of total 36). 111%
