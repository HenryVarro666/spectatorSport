The Center to Counter Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine reports that Russia is demanding that Wikipedia to take down the information on war crimes in Ukraine. According to the report, Wikipedia informed about the claims from Roskomnadzor over the content of five texts, referring to the law of the Russian Federation ""on fake news"":

""Battle for Kyiv (2022)"". ""War crimes during the Russian invasion of Ukraine."" ""Shelling of the hospital in Mariupol"". ""Destruction of the Mariupol Theater (2022)"". ""Massacre in Bucha"".

The Center states that ""information is required to be taken down, but what exactly information, this is not reported.""",https://imi.org.ua/en/news/russia-demanded-from-wikipedia-to-take-down-info-on-war-crimes-in-ukraine-i44858

On Tuesday, the country’s internet regulator Roskomnadzor denounced the site, saying “Wikipedia has become a new line of constant information attacks on Russians.”

For now, the Russian government is only threatening to fine the encyclopedia website up to 4 million rubles ($47,000) unless it scrubs the information. It’s unclear if the proposed fine is a one-time fee or if it could grow each day.

Roskomnadzor is likely demanding the site remove content from the Wikipedia page devoted to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which now mentions civilian casualties and war crimes the Russian military has allegedly committed.

Roskomnadzor claims Wikipedia is spreading inaccurate information about the war by hosting the content. “In the articles published on the resource, an exclusively anti-Russian interpretation of events is promoted,” the regulator said.

The Wikimedia Foundation, which helps runs the encyclopedia site, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the nonprofit has previously vowed to fight any Kremlin attempts to censor the site.

“As ever, Wikipedia is an important source of reliable, factual information in this crisis. In recognition of this important role, we will not back down in the face of efforts to censor and intimidate members of our movement,” the Wikimedia Foundation wrote last month.

The nonprofit wrote the statement days after the Russian government sent a request on March 1, demanding it remove content about its invasion of Ukraine. In response, the Wikimedia Foundation said the information was “sourced and shared by volunteers who invest time and effort to ensure that the content is fact-based and reliable.

“As the invasion continues, Ukrainian volunteers have continued to add content and make edits to Wikipedia, even in face of deep hardship,” the foundation added.

The decision to keep hosting the content may result in Russia issuing a site-wide block of Wikipedia. Last month, the Kremlin did just that to Facebook and Instagram for failing to comply with its demands. Russia has also recently passed a law that empowers authorities to jail anyone in the country for spreading alleged falsehoods about the war in Ukraine.",https://www.pcmag.com/news/russia-pressures-wikipedia-to-remove-ukraine-war-content-threatens-fines

Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor demanded that Wikipedia remove ""unreliable socially significant information"" regarding the war in Ukraine, threatening a fine of up to 4 million rubles ($48,000). In its message published on Tuesday, April 5, Roskomnadzor accused the online encyclopedia of ""becoming a new line of constant information attacks on Russians"", since it ""massively hosts"" materials with ""unreliable information"" about the military actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine.

The supervisory authority claims that Wikipedia articles ""purposefully misinform users providing blatantly false information"" and ""promote an exclusively anti-Russian interpretation of events.""

Roskomnadzor insists on limiting the dissemination of such information in accordance with the requirement of the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation, the report says.

Earlier, the Russian Wikipedia reported on its social media pages that the notification of the Prosecutor General's Office concerns five articles: ""The Battle for Kiev (2022)"", ""War crimes during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine"", ""Shelling of a hospital in Mariupol"", ""Destruction of the Mariupol theater (2022)"" and ""Massacre in Bucha"". The Wikipedia’s administration said that they had not been informed what information should be removed from these articles.

At the end of March, Roskomnadzor already promised to bring Wikipedia to administrative responsibility for not deleting ""illegal information"", threatening it with a fine of up to 4 million rubles.

DUBAI: Dubai-based independent production house Seven has partnered with Gravity Media, a global provider of live broadcast facilities and production services, in the runup to the World Cup Qatar 2022.

The two companies will be responsible for providing local broadcast facilities suitable for international rights and non-rights holders. The facilities will be available for use starting in November.

Both firms offer the use of 4K and HD truck-based facilities including Gravity Media’s special equipment and capabilities, as well as local and international crew members.

During the World Cup, Seven Production will offer its team of technical personnel and four medium- and large-sized HD/4K outside broadcast trucks, or OB vans, which are essentially mobile studios.

Seven Production has significant experience covering events in the Middle East and North Africa region. In 2007, it began customizing its OB van to cater for local sports productions and claims to be the first company to introduce 4K to the region.

The company has worked on events such as the AFC Asian Cup, MBC Formula 1, the Dakar Rally, and Top Chef Arabia.

Pierre Tabet, managing director of Seven Production, said: “Seven Production’s collaboration with Gravity Media is the best broadcasting partnership the World Cup could possibly have.

“Our extensive knowledge in sports broadcasting combined with years of experience in the Middle East results in the perfect solution for such a world-class event.”

The Gravity Media team will work closely with Seven Production through its office in Doha. Since its launch in 2007, the company has worked with several clients including beIN Sports, Al Jazeera Media Network, Qatar Television, Aspire Zone, Qatar Olympic Committee, and the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy.

Gravity Media has also previously provided broadcast solutions for the World Cup including live broadcast services, fast-turnaround highlights, temporary studio hire, and full-time edits, as well as scripted, voiced, and ready-to-air highlights programs at the end of each match.

Eamonn Dowdall, executive director of Gravity Media, said: “Gravity Media looks forward to the collaboration with Seven Production. Working together makes us the most powerful and creative media broadcasting partnership, allowing us to offer cutting-edge production services across the region.”",https://www.arabnews.pk/node/2057116/media

(NEW YORK) — Russian forces are continuing to have a tough time pushing through Ukraine due to Ukrainians, led by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and backed by weapons and military equipment from the United States and many European countries, putting up “stiff resistance,” according to U.S. officials.

The attack began Feb. 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “special military operation.” Heavy shelling and missile attacks, many on civilian buildings, have continued throughout the country, including some in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, as well as other major cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol.

In recent days, Russian forces appear to be pulling away from Kyiv after Russian officials said they were reducing military action near Kyiv and in Chernihiv in northern Ukraine in an attempt to increase “mutual trust and create conditions required” for further peace talks with Ukrainian negotiators.

Russia is now being accused of committing war crimes by the United States and countries throughout Europe after graphic images emerged of civilians lying dead in the streets of the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, some with their hands bound and shot at close range.

Here’s how the news is developing. All times Eastern:

Russian brigade accused of Bucha atrocities will be sent back to war, Ukrainian intelligence says

A brigade of the Russian Ground Forces accused of committing war crimes in the Ukrainian city of Bucha will be sent back to war, according to the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense.

“The Russian command will not rotate the personnel in this unit and will throw it back to the front,” the directorate said in a statement Tuesday.

As of Monday, Russia’s 64th Motor Rifle Brigade was withdrawn from Ukraine to Belarus, according to Ukrainian intelligence. By Wednesday, the personnel will be transported to the western Russian city of Belgorod, just north of the border with Ukraine, with plans to return to the front line in the direction of the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, according to Ukrainian intelligence.

“Usually, Russian units leaving the combat zone receive much more time for recovery and rest,” the directorate said. “This indicates that ‘special tasks’ are expected for the 64th Brigade. The first of them: intimidation of inhabitants of settlements of Ukraine. Those who committed the crimes of genocide in Bucha may repeat this again in other cities.”

“Another goal of the rapid return of the 64th Brigade to the territory of Ukraine is the rapid ‘disposal’ of unnecessary witnesses. That is, relocation to a part of the front where they will not have a chance to stay alive to make it impossible to testify in future courts,” the directorate added. “The personnel of the unit, aware of the resonance of the events in Bucha and the responsibility for the crimes committed, massively opposes the return to Ukraine. However, the Russian command ignores these sentiments and threatens the tribunal if they refuse to continue fighting. The militaries do not accept reports of dismissal from Russian soldiers.”

On Monday, the directorate published online what it said was a list with the names of hundreds of personnel of Russia’s 64th Motor Rifle Brigade whom they believe were directly responsible for the atrocities in Bucha. Ukrainian officials have said there is evidence of other Russian units being involved. Russia has denied the claims.

Ukraine has retaken ‘key terrain’ from Russia, UK says

Ukrainian troops have retaken “key terrain” in the north of the country, “after denying Russia the ability to secure its objectives and forcing Russian forces to retreat” from areas around Chernihiv and north of Kyiv, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update Tuesday.

“Low-level fighting is likely to continue in some parts of the newly recaptured regions, but diminish significantly over this week as the remainder of Russian forces withdraw,” the ministry added. “Many Russian units withdrawing from northern Ukraine are likely to require significant re-equipping and refurbishment before being available to redeploy for operations in eastern Ukraine.”

Peace talks may now be off the table, Zelenskyy says

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicated Tuesday that peace talks with Russia may now be off the table, following the gruesome discovery of scores of dead civilians in Bucha and other towns outside Ukraine’s capital that were recently recaptured from Russian forces.

“The most difficult thing is to talk about what they did,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv. “We believe that this is genocide. We believe that they should be punished for it.”

“I believe that we need to set such a bar for these negotiations,” he added. “It may happen that there will be no meeting.”

Zelenskyy’s comments came a day after he traveled to Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, where bodies in civilian clothes were found strewn in the streets and in mass graves. Many of the victims appeared to have been shot at close range and some even showed signs of torture. ABC News journalists on the ground saw some of the dead, including a family that locals said were executed with their hands bound.

Russia threatens to fine Wikipedia if it doesn’t remove info about Ukraine war

Russia’s communications and media regulator, Roskomnadzor, is demanding that Wikipedia remove content that contradicts the Kremlin’s narrative about the war in Ukraine.

“Based on a motion from the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office, Roskomnadzor demanded on April 4 that the Wikipedia management put an end to the dissemination of false socially significant information,” the agency said in a statement Tuesday. “Materials containing false information about the special military operation in Ukraine and operations of the Russian Armed Forces have been massively published on Wikipedia in the recent period. Wikipedia has become a new line for continuous information attacks on Russians.”

Roskomnadzor accused the free online encyclopedia of “deliberately” misinforming Russian users. The agency noted that it has previously asked Wikipedia “to remove false information about events in Ukraine” and threatened to fine the San Francisco-based company up to 4 million rubles (about $47,000) for failing to delete such content, which is illegal under Russian law.

US cuts Russia off from dollars it holds at American financial institutions

The U.S. Treasury said Monday night that it would no longer allow the Russian government to make payments on debt using dollars it holds at U.S. financial institutions, another step that puts pressure on the Russian government’s funds.

This step “was in the works before the weekend and isn’t a response” to the atrocities in Bucha, according to a Treasury spokesperson.

“One of the most potent actions of the 700-plus sanctions we’ve imposed have been our sanctions on Russia’s Central Bank, which were levied with unprecedented multilateral coordination, speed, and impact,” the spokesperson said. “Today is the deadline for Russia to make another debt payment. Beginning today, the U.S. Treasury will not permit any dollar debt payments to be made from Russian government accounts at U.S. financial institutions.”

“Russia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default,” the spokesperson continued. “This will further deplete the resources Putin is using to continue his war against Ukraine and will cause more uncertainty and challenges for their financial system.”
