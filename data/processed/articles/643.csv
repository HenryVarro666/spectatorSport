Speaking to Al Jazeera, Frank Ledwidge, senior lecturer in military capabilities and strategy at the University of Portsmouth, said Russia’s attack “has, in military terms, culminated”.

“Essentially, that they’ve gone as far as they can with the logistics and weaponry they brought into the country – that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s stalled,” he added.

“What we’re seeing now is what’s called an operational pause as they start to get, in colloquial terms, their act together, which they have not had largely due to very poor planning assumptions in the early part of the campaign.

“So they’d be working frantically to try to get weapons and get their planning sorted out and to understand where does it go next. And of course, Ukrainians have a say in that, which is why we are starting to see counterattacks by Ukrainian armed forces that seem to be having some effect.”

Bombed Mariupol theatre sheltering at least 500 civilians: HRW

Human Rights Watch says the Mariupol theatre hit during an alleged Russian attack was sheltering at least 500 civilians.

“Until we know more, we cannot rule out the possibility of a Ukrainian military target in the area of the theatre, but we do know that the theatre had been housing at least 500 civilians,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch.

“This raises serious concerns about what the intended target was in a city where civilians have already been under siege for days and telecommunications, power, water and heating have been almost completely cut off.”

UK warns Russia ‘likely resorting to less precise weapons’

The British Ministry of Defence says Russia’s failure to control Ukrainian airspace means it has probably expended far more stand-off air-launched weapons than originally planned.

“As a result, it is likely Russia is resorting to the use of older, less precise weapons, which are less militarily effective and more likely to result in civilian casualties,” the ministry said in its latest intelligence update.

Russia continues to make little tangible progress across most of Ukraine, and Russian forces are still stalled outside Kyiv while continuing to bombard the capital city with missiles, a senior US defence official has said.

One key development has been increased Russian naval activity in the northern Black Sea, where ships were shelling suburbs of Odesa, the Associated Press cited the official as saying.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it is not clear what the Russians intend to do, but the shelling could be the start of preparations to launch a ground assault on Odesa.

The draft resolution also does not address accountability or acknowledge Russia’s invasion of its neighbour, the Reuters news agency reported.

17 Mar 2022 02.30 'Weapons, and sanctions, and the rest will be done by Ukraine', FM says Warren Murray Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba has said that what his country needs from the west is “weapons and sanctions, and the rest will be done by Ukraine”. Speaking to Anderson Cooper about negotiations with Russia in an interview with CNN, Kuleba said: There are a number of factors that make a difference in the Russian position in the talks, the first one is the fierce resistance of the Ukrainian army and Ukrainian people on the ground; the second is sanctions imposed on Russia, sanctions which cause the Russian economy to go down and to suffer. Continued resistance and sanctions has forced Russia to slightly change its position, Kuleba added. Its position becomes different but I could not call it a dramatic change or serious change in the position. But under the circumstances every change in the Russian position is a constructive one. Because they start with unilateral ultimatums which if put together constitute a unilateral surrender of Ukraine and that is not acceptable … But I have to be clear, both delegations the Russian and Ukrainian one are far away from reaching an agreement on the current situation …” Asked about his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, reviving rhetoric about “denazification” of Ukraine, Kuleba said: “Listen, Russia will never, never admit that they made a concession or that they realised the goals they had set for themselves were not achievable. They will always publicly say everything is fine, everything is going according to plan and it’s exactly what we wanted. Whatever Minister Lavrov said in the press conference, I know two things: if Ukraine gets sufficient amount of weapons to defend itself, if sanctions pressure will be continued, then Russia will make serious concessions. Kuleba called for caution in reading Russian messages. [We should] understand two things and I will say it again because it’s crucially important: weapons and sanctions, and the rest will be done by Ukraine”.



17 Mar 2022 02.11 Finally, Zelenskiy said plans are already underway to restore Ukraine after the war. We are already working on the program for the restoration of our country after the war. I promise to every Ukrainian who lost their house or apartment as a result of shelling, that the state will rebuild everything. I am confident that we will be able to rebuild our country quickly. No matter how big the losses are.... It will be a historic reconstruction, a project that will inspire the world just as our fight for freedom, our fight for Ukraine.” (Translation provided by Bermet Talant.)

Sanger']",2022-03-16,"ODESSA, Ukraine — Ukrainian forces carried out counter-offensives against Russian positions on Wednesday, seeking to inflict what one official called “maximum losses,” even as the invading Russian military stepped up its lethal attacks on cities.

In Mariupol, an airstrike destroyed a theater where about 1,000 people had taken shelter, according to city and regional administrators, and photos and videos posted online showed the burning wreckage of the building.

Officials in Mariupol, the besieged southern city that has suffered the most intense bombardment, said they could not yet estimate the number of casualties among civilians, who might have been in a bomb shelter beneath the theater. The strike came as 11,000 residents evacuated the city on Wednesday, according to its City Council.

In a video address to Ukrainians early Thursday morning, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called for more sanctions against Russia and said it was a “terrorist state.”

“Our hearts are broken by what Russia is doing to our people,” he said, “to our Mariupol.”

After falling back under a relentless pounding over the war’s first weeks, Ukrainian troops tried to gain some momentum with counterattacks on Russian positions outside of Kyiv and in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, in Ukraine’s south, a senior Ukrainian military official said.

Rather than seek to regain lost territory, Ukrainian forces tried to cause as much destruction and death as possible, attacking Russian troops and equipment with tanks, fighter jets and artillery, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military information.

“In the task of inflicting maximum losses, we’ve done excellently,” the official said.

American intelligence officials said their conservative estimate of Russian troop deaths was at least 7,000, a staggering number that carries implications for both combat effectiveness and morale. Western defense and intelligence agencies estimate that Ukraine also has suffered thousands of combatants killed.

Mr. Zelensky addressed Congress via video link on Wednesday, asking for more aid, and President Biden promised more weaponry. The administration plans to provide Ukraine with high-tech defensive weapons that are easily portable and require little training or logistical support to use, according to U.S. and European officials.

Meanwhile, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia falsely accused Ukraine of seeking weapons of mass destruction and asserted that what he called an “economic blitzkrieg” by the West, aimed at destroying Russia, had failed.

Mr. Putin also sneered at Russians who oppose the war, saying the Russian people could distinguish “true patriots from the scum and the traitors, and just to spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths.”

In a televised videoconference with top officials, he once again falsely described the government in Kyiv, led by a Jewish president and prime minister, as being “pro-Nazi” and on its way to acquiring nuclear weapons. “Their aim, of course, would have been Russia,” he said.

And then he went deeper into unreality, accusing the government in Kyiv of disregard for the suffering of the Ukrainian people that his own forces were bombing every day.

“The fact that people are dying, that hundreds of thousands, millions have become refugees, that there is a real humanitarian catastrophe in cities held by neo-Nazis and armed criminals,” he said. “They’re indifferent.”

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators held a third consecutive day of talks on a possible settlement to the conflict, and in typical fashion, the Kremlin left a muddy picture of its intentions. Mr. Putin’s bellicose, often false statements, larded with World War II references, clashed with more conciliatory comments from his underlings.

But little appeared to have changed on the battlefield. The war in Ukraine, about to enter its fourth week, has become a grinding daily slog with little evidence of significant gains for either side.

Details of the Ukrainian offensive could not be fully established independently, though several top Ukrainian officials, including key aides to Mr. Zelensky, confirmed that the counterattacks were underway.

In Kyiv, missile strikes and heavy artillery sounded overnight and in the early morning on Wednesday in exchanges in the outlying suburbs that were notably heavier and louder than in previous days. Two people were wounded and a residential building was damaged in a strike that landed near the city zoo, the second time in two days that shells have landed close to the city center.

Satellite pictures from Tuesday showed heavy black smoke above the Kherson airport, where the senior military official said Ukrainian forces had targeted parked Russian military aircraft.

Kherson was the first (and so far, only) major city to be fully taken over by Russian forces, which have turned it into a forward military base from which they have launched attacks on surrounding cities and villages, according to Ukrainian officials. On Tuesday, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that it had taken control of the entire Kherson region, giving Russian forces a significant foothold in southern Ukraine that Ukraine’s military will have difficulty dislodging.

Even so, neither side can be said to have made much progress militarily. The Institute for the Study of War, which has been tracking developments closely, noted in a Tuesday evening assessment that, for nearly two weeks, Russian forces have not been conducting extensive simultaneous attacks that would allow them to seize control of multiple areas at once in Ukraine. And they are unlikely to do so in the next week, it said.

In the absence of significant military gains, Russian forces on Wednesday continued a campaign of terror against Ukrainian civilians.

At least 10 people were killed when a Russian strike hit a bread line in Chernihiv, a city north of Kyiv that has been subject to intense shelling by Russian troops seeking to move on the capital. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said in a statement that the attack occurred at about 10 a.m. as people were lined up at a grocery store. Photos released by the prosecutor’s office showed several bodies scattered around a dirt yard.

Using heavy artillery, cruise missiles and fighter jets, Russian forces have systematically targeted civilian areas with no military presence, striking apartment buildings, schools and hospitals in cities and villages all over a broad front in the north, east and south of Ukraine. The attacks may have killed thousands of civilians, though reaching a precise count of the dead has been impossible.

Saying it was “profoundly concerned” by Russia’s use of force, the International Court of Justice ordered Russia on Wednesday to suspend its military operations immediately, pending its full review of a case submitted by Ukraine last month. However, the order was not expected to lead to any immediate cessation in the onslaught.

According to the United Nations, at least 726 civilians have been killed, including 64 children, since the invasion began on Feb. 24, though its figures do not include areas where fighting has been heaviest, like Kharkiv and Mariupol. In Mariupol alone, which has been turned into a hellscape of burning and decimated buildings, local authorities say at least 2,400 have been killed, and probably far more.

In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, the municipal emergency services agency first reported on Wednesday that 500 civilians had been killed since the war began, but then revised that number to 100 later in the day. In any case, the agency said in a statement on Facebook, the true number of deaths could be much higher, noting that emergency workers were continuing to scour the rubble of residential neighborhoods for more bodies, often under fire.

Mr. Zelensky’s appeal to Congress on Wednesday was in part a desperate effort to obtain the weaponry and defenses capable of fending off such attacks. Central to this appeal was a call for a no-fly zone to be imposed over Ukraine, aimed at preventing Russian fighter jets, which cause severe destruction, from operating over Ukrainian territory. “Close the sky” has become a rallying cry for Ukrainian officials and regular citizens.

“Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people,” Mr. Zelensky said.

Knowing that the request had little chance of being approved, given that it would thrust American pilots into direct confrontation with the Russians, Mr. Zelensky quickly pivoted to something to which Republicans and Democrats have been far more receptive: asking for more weapons to enable his people to keep up the fight themselves.

Mr. Biden announced $800 million in new military aid to Ukraine, including antiaircraft and antitank missiles, body armor, vehicles, drones and small arms, bringing to $2 billion the amount delivered or pledged since early last year. But as expected, he did not offer to deliver warplanes or enforce a no-fly zone.

The United States and its allies have relied primarily on financial sanctions that are already devastating the Russian economy.

Russian officials close to the talks said Wednesday there had been signs of progress, though even there, the picture was unclear. They said the idea of a neutral Ukraine, with a status like that of Sweden or Austria, was on the table, which their Ukrainian counterparts disputed.

Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, told a Russian television network that the status of the Russian language and Russian news outlets in Ukraine were under discussion, and that “there are concrete formulas that are close to being agreed on.”

Ukraine: peace plan is a draft just with Russian stances

A new round of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are under way on Wednesday, with the latest information being released on a potential peace plan drafted. Financial Times reports that Ukraine and Russia have drafted the first version of a 15-point peace plan, including a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops if Kiev declares its neutrality and accepts a limit on its armed forces, writes Financial Times, citing 3 sources close to the talks.

The proposed deal, which Ukrainian and Russian negotiators discussed at length on Monday, would stipulate that Ukraine give up its ambitions to join NATO and promise not to host military bases or weapons in exchange for protection from allies such as United States, United Kingdom or Turkey.

In retort, Mihailo Podoliak, one of the Ukrainian negotiators said that “what the Financial Times presented is a draft that represents the positions demanded by the Russian side. That’s all”.

Briefly. FT published a draft, which represents the requesting position of the Russian side. Nothing more. The ?? side has its own positions. The only thing we confirm at this stage is a ceasefire, withdrawal of Russian troops and security guarantees from a number of countries — ??????? ??????? (@Podolyak_M) March 16, 2022

Kremlin had announced earlier on Wednesday that a Swedish-Austrian-style neutrality of Ukraine is the compromise currently being discussed by Russian and Ukrainian negotiators. “This is actually an option that is currently being discussed and can be seen as a compromise,” Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. Russia’s chief negotiator Vladimir Medinski also said Wednesday that negotiations were “slow and difficult” and assured that the Kremlin “wants peace as soon as possible.”

In his turn, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that peace talks with Ukraine are not easy, but there are hopes for a compromise, according to Reuters. He noted that the negotiators were close to agreeing on the formulation of agreements, and that a status of neutrality for Kyiv was being taken “seriously”. However, the head of Russian diplomacy told RBC that there are other important issues, including the use of the Russian language in Ukraine and freedom of expression.

Lavrov said of a potential Zelensky-Putin meeting: “There is no obstacle to organizing such a meeting, stating that it will not only be for the sake of being held, but to seal the concrete agreements that are being drawn up. currently by the two delegations .”

A presidential aide, Mihailo Podoliak had previously said that “deep contradictions” still persist in the Russian-Ukrainian talks, but “a compromise” is still possible. “It is a complicated and extremely laborious process, but of course a compromise is possible”, Podoliak said on Twitter.

Zelensky: Peace talks more realistic, yet more time needed

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, asking it “to do more in the darkest period for Ukraine, for the whole of Europe”.

Volodymyr Zelensky has again called on Western allies for help and thanked Joe Biden for US $ 13 billion in support, also calling for a no fly zone or, in its absence, military aid – fighter jets or defense systems.

Zelensky had said on Tuesday night that peace talks appear to have become more realistic, but that more time is needed.

“It is difficult, but important, as any war ends with an agreement. The agreements continue, and from my information, the positions during the negotiations already sound more realistic. But it still takes time for decisions to be in Ukraine’s interest. The invaders committed new obvious war crimes. They targeted peaceful cities, civilian infrastructure. The number of missiles used by Russia against Ukraine is more than 900. I invite all friends of Ukraine to visit Kiev. It’s dangerous here because our skies aren’t closed to Russian missiles and planes,” he stated.

The capital, Kyiv, is “subject to missiles and airstrikes by Russian troops every day.” But he did not give up, “Zelensky told Congress via a translator. He said his country was” in the worst war since World War II. ”

Zelensky asked the US MPs to recall the dark moments in the USA history, such as Pearl Harbour or September 11.

“In your great history you have pages that will allow you to understand the Ukrainians, to understand us now when we need you. Remember Pearl Harbor, that awful morning, December 7, 1941, when your sky was filled with planes attacking you, remember, remember September 11, that terrible day when evil tried to turn your cities. in battlefields, when innocent people were attacked, attacked from the air,” he stated.

“Our country is going through the same thing every day now. Every night for three weeks, a lot of Ukrainian cities – Odessa and Kharkov, Chernihiv and Sumi, Zhitomir and Mariupol. Russia has turned Ukraine’s sky into a source of death for thousands of people. Russian troops have already fired more than 1,000 rockets at Ukraine, countless bombs killing us with precision. It is a terror that Europe has not known for 80 years and we demand a response to this terror from all over the world. Is it too much to ask? Create an air exclusion space over Ukraine to save people. It’s too much? A humanitarian zone of air exclusion through which Russia can no longer terrorize our cities,” Zelensky continued.

In the end, the Ukrainian president called for the creation of a new international organization for war prevention and humanitarian aid.

More bombings, more victims among civilians

It is the 21st day of war in Ukraine, and sirens have sounded again in Kyiv and other several cities, with new bombings killing more civilians and the number of refugees leaving the country exceeding 3 million. Russian troops have made no significant progress and have not captured any of the top 10 cities in Ukraine.

At least 10 people have died in Chernihiv after a shell fell on a group of people standing in line for bread. Chernihiv is surrounded by Russian forces and repeatedly bombed, with most of the bombs hitting residential areas.

Several explosions took place in Kyiv this morning, BBC reports. Emergency services in the Ukrainian capital reported that a 12-storey building in the Sevcenko district had been hit during the bombing at around 6 p.m. A nearby nine-story building was also damaged, authorities say. According to them, two people were injured and 35 were evacuated from the building. The fire was extinguished at 7.45 am and rescuers are now looking for survivors. Several video images shared on social media showed large columns of smoke around the buildings.

Residents of the city remain hidden in bunkers and basements, in Kyiv there is a ban on going out until Thursday. Authorities warned that it was a “difficult and dangerous” time for the capital.

In the city of Mariupol the situation is dramatic, as Russian troops are holding hostage 400 doctors and patients, says the mayor. Conditions in Mariupol are “unbearable” and “just hell,” residents fleeing the besieged city in southeastern Ukraine told CNN, while social media footage shows how the city was devastated by Russian military bombing.

At the largest hospital in Mariupol the staff and patients – about 400 people – were taken hostage by Russian troops on Tuesday. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of the Donetsk regional administration, says a hospital employee told him that staff and patients are being kept in the basement, where the sick and injured continue to be treated, with Russian troops occupying the medical unit.

Sergei Orlov, Mariupol’s deputy mayor, says Russian forces are “destroying” Mariupol with regular attacks. “Yesterday, we counted 22 planes bombing our city and at least 100 bombs they used to bomb the city. The damage is terrible,” he said on Tuesday.

Emergency services in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine said on Wednesday that at least 500 Kharkiv residents had been killed by Russian troops in the past three weeks.

The confirmed balance of civilian casualties in Ukraine is 691 people killed and 1,143 injured, the UN announced, adding that the real figures are probably “considerably higher”.

Also Wednesday, the Ukrainian Attorney General’s Office reported that Putin’s invading troops had killed at least 103 children so far. Russian forces hit more than 400 schools, and 59 of them were destroyed, Attorney General Iryna Venediktova said on Facebook.

German television channel ZDF has released a video showing Russian soldiers shooting a civilian who raised his hands in non-aggression. The man tried to leave Kyiv by car, but was shot.

According to Ukrainian military forces, Russian Black Sea warships bombed the Ukrainian coast in areas near the city of Odessa. According to a statement posted on the Armed Forces’ Facebook page, the villages of Lebedivka, Sanzheika, Zatoka and Bilenke, all located about 30 kilometers south of the port city, have been bombed in the past 24 hours. Odessa is the third largest city in the country and is considered a key target of Russia’s campaign in Ukraine.

Ukrainian authorities accuse two-thirds of Russian missiles fired during the invasion of Ukraine of hitting civilian buildings, suggesting that this is not necessarily due to miscalculations by the Russian army, according to EFE.

On Tuesday night, Russian forces launched “strategic bomber missiles and Iskander ballistic missiles over Ukraine. As a result, many civilian targets were damaged, which unfortunately became the hallmark of the Russian army, considered “the second most powerful army in the world,” Presidential Adviser Oleksii Arestovich told a news conference. according to Ukrinform. According to him, Ukrainian forces shot down “at least three planes, a helicopter and intercepted several Russian cruise missiles”, against which Ukrainian forces responded by launching missiles. “Propaganda in Moscow claims that the Russian army is acting with surgical precision, but two-thirds of the missiles hit civilian targets, and this is apparently being done deliberately,” Arestovich said. According to the Pentagon, the Russian military has launched “more than 900 missiles of various types and sizes” since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, and until Monday, a US Defense Ministry official said on Tuesday.

Ukrainian army: 13,800 Russian soldiers killed

About 13,800 Russian soldiers have been killed since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the Ukrainian military said. Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said on Wednesday morning that “the Ukrainian army has managed to deal devastating blows to the occupation troops.”

According to a report by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, 430 tanks, 1375 armored fighting vehicles, 190 artillery systems and 108 helicopters were also destroyed.

According to the quoted source, the air force destroyed three Russian warplanes, a helicopter, three drones and shot down two missiles, BBC reports, arguing that it has not yet independently verified this information.

Moreover, another Russian commander-in-chief woulld have been killed on the Ukrainian front. General Oleg Mitiaev was the commander of the 150th Division, Nexta TV reports. If the information is confirmed, Mitiaev would be the fourth top general killed since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. Russia reportedly moved about 20 generals to the front line, an unusually large number, which shows that the invasion does not go according to the Kremlin’s plans.

Three EU PMs in Kyiv. Poland asks for international peacekeeping mission in Ukraine

Three European leaders – the prime ministers of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia – have traveled by train to Kyiv to meet with Zelensky and show support. The three prime ministers of the three EU countries went ahead with the hours-long train trip despite worries within the European Union about the security risks of traveling within a war zone.

Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on social media in the evening that he, deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski and the Czech and Slovenian leaders were in Kyiv.

“It is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made. It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance,” Morawiecki said on Twitter.

An international peacekeeping mission should be sent to operate in Ukraine, the leader of the Polish ruling PiS party said during a press conference in Kyiv, along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski, Reuters reports.

“I think it is necessary to have a peacekeeping mission – NATO, possibly a larger international structure, but a mission that will be able to defend itself, to operate on Ukrainian territory, which will be on Ukrainian territory with the consent of the President and the government of Ukraine,” Jaroslaw Kaczynski said during a press conference broadcast by Polish television.

This mission will aim to “establish peace, provide humanitarian aid, but at the same time be protected by adequate forces, by the armed forces,” Kaczynski said.

Biden to announce additional assistance to Ukraine

President Joe Biden will announce $ 800 million in additional security assistance to Ukraine on Wednesday to help Kiev cope with the Russian invasion, a White House official said Tuesday night.

The US president is due to make the announcement following a video speech by his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky before the US Congress.

This amounts to “the total announced in the last week alone at one billion dollars,” the US official said on condition of anonymity. “In total, the president has authorized $ 2 billion in security since the beginning of the administration (Biden). The United States remains by far Ukraine’s largest security aid donor,” he said.

U.S. Senate condemns Vladimir Putin as war criminal

The United States Senate unanimously passed a resolution on Tuesday condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin as a war criminal, a rare demonstration of unity in the deeply divided US Congress, Reuters reports.

The resolution, introduced by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and backed by senators on both sides, encourages the International Criminal Court in The Hague and other states to target the Russian military in any investigation into war crimes committed during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“We have all come together in this House, Democrats and Republicans, to say that Vladimir Putin cannot escape responsibility for the atrocities committed against the Ukrainian people,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a speech. before voting.

A second Fox News journalist confirmed dead

A second Fox News journalist, an Ukrainian woman who was correspondent, Oleksandra Kuvshinova was also confirmed dead. The American television station Fox News announced the murder of another member of his team from Ukraine, the journalist Oleksandra Kuvshinova, aged 24 years. She was killed in Horenka, near Kyiv, along with her fellow cameraman Pierre Zakrzewsk, while his correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has sent a message of condolences to Fox News journalists killed in Ukraine. He posted a message on Twitter about the deaths of Fox News journalists Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, an Irish citizen, and Oleksandra Kuvshinova, 24, a Ukrainian.

“I am grateful to all those who risk their lives to show the world what is happening in Ukraine. The United States condemns Russia’s continued violence, which threatens the safety of journalists and other media workers in Ukraine,” said Anthony Blinken.

Blinken to Putin: End this war, an independent Ukraine will exist longer than Vladimir Putin

Speaking on CNN, Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent a message to Russian president Putin: “Message to Putin is: end this war; stop this war that you’re committing; end the aggression that is unjustified, unprovoked.”

“There’s going to be a Ukraine, an independent Ukraine, a lot longer than there’s going to be Vladimir Putin. One way or the other, Ukraine will be there, and at some point Putin won’t. The real question is how much death and destruction is wrought by Russia’s aggression in the meantime, and that’s what we’re working as hard as we can to limit, to stop, to put an end to this war of choice that Russia is committing.

And we’re doing that through the support we’re providing to Ukraine every single day. We’re doing that by the pressure we’re exerting against Russia every single day. And my hope is that we can end this sooner rather than later so that that death and destruction doesn’t continue. But I can tell you how this is going to end ultimately: It’s going to end with an independent Ukraine, and at some point, it’s going to end without Vladimir Putin,” Blinken pointed out.

Biden in Brussels next week

U.S. Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced that President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. will travel to Brussels, Belgium later this month. “President Biden will join an extraordinary NATO summit on March 24 to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine as well as to reaffirm our ironclad commitment to our NATO Allies. President Biden will also join a scheduled European Council Summit to discuss our shared concerns about Ukraine, including transatlantic efforts to impose economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those affected by the violence, and address other challenges related to the conflict,” she announced.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki pointed out though that Russia may have accidentally punished President Biden’s father.

“I would first note that President Biden is a junior, so they may have sanctioned his dad, may he rest in peace,” Ms Psaki told reporters on Tuesday. The president’s name is Joe Biden jr, not senior, as Russia’s foreign ministry mistakenly labeled him.

Ukraine’s IT Army: 300,000 hackers respond to Ukraine’s call

Ukraine has called on a global army of IT experts to help the country fight Vladimir Putin. About 300,000 volunteers answered the call

About 300,000 volunteers have joined a group on the Telegram app called “Ukraine’s IT Army”, which assigns participants tasks to lead the digital fight against Putin.

The extended army of hackers has managed to disrupt Russian web services, according to NetBlocks, a company that monitors the internet connection globally. The availability of the Kremlin and Duma sites, the lower house of the Russian parliament, has been “intermittent” since the invasion began. The websites of the state media services, several banks and the energy giant Gazprom were also targeted.

It tweeted: “Russian forces are struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain.

“Russian forces have remained largely tied to Ukraine’s road network and have demonstrated a reluctance to conduct off-road manoeuvre. The destruction of bridges by Ukrainian forces has also played a key role in stalling Russia’s advance.

“Russia’s continued failure to gain control of the air has drastically limited their ability to effectively use air manoeuvre, further limiting their options.
