Gen. Igor Konashenkov claimed Friday that Russian forces staged a ""successful landing operation"" to capture Hostomel airfield on the outskirts of Kyiv.

""More than 200 Russian helicopters were involved in the operation,"" according to the statement. ""The success of the landing was ensured by the suppression of the entire air defense system in the landing area, the complete isolation of the combat area from the air and the active conduct of electronic warfare.""

Konashenkov claimed that Russian forces killed more than 200 of the opposing forces and that there were no casualties among in the Russian Armed Forces.

CNN could not immediately corroborate those claims, but a CNN team on the ground witnessed Russian airborne troops taking positions at the airfield Thursday.

The Russian statement claimed — without evidence — that US military and intelligence advisers have instructed Ukrainian military leaders to place rocket artillery systems in residential areas to provoke return fire on local residents, echoing propaganda claims that the Russian military has made in Syria to counter allegations of civilian casualties caused by Russian strikes.

""I appeal to Ukrainian citizens,"" Konashenkov said. ""Your nationalist leadership uses the same methods as the terrorists. They want to use you as a human shield. The Russian Armed Forces will not inflict any strikes on residential areas of the Ukrainian capital.""

More context: Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what appears to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.

Barnes']",2022-03-07 00:00:00,"During a trip through the Eastern European countries that fear they could next face Mr. Putin’s military, General Milley has consistently been asked the same questions. Why have the Russians performed so poorly in the early days of the war? Why did they so badly misjudge the Ukrainian resistance?

His careful response, before reporters in Estonia: “We’ve seen a large, combined-arms, multi-axis invasion of the second-largest country in Europe, Ukraine, by Russian air, ground, special forces, intelligence forces,” he said, before describing some of the bombardment brought by Russia and his concern over its “indiscriminate firing” on civilians.

“It’s a little bit early to draw any definitive lessons learned,” he added. “But one of the lessons that’s clearly evident is that the will of the people, the will of the Ukrainian people, and the importance of national leadership and the fighting skills of the Ukrainian army has come through loud and clear.”

While the Russian army’s troubles are real, the public’s view of the fight is skewed by the realities of the information battlefield. Russia remains keen to play down the war and provides little information about its victories or defeats, contributing to an incomplete picture.

But a dissection of the Russian military’s performance so far, compiled from interviews with two dozen American, NATO and Ukrainian officials, paints a portrait of young, inexperienced conscripted soldiers who have not been empowered to make on-the-spot decisions, and a noncommissioned officer corps that isn’t allowed to make decisions either. Russia’s military leadership, with Gen. Valery Gerasimov at the top, is far too centralized; lieutenants must ask him for permission even on small matters, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters.

In addition, the Russian senior officers have proved so far to be risk-averse, the officials said.

Their caution partly explains why they still don’t have air superiority over all of Ukraine, for example, American officials said. Faced with bad weather in northern Ukraine, the Russian officers grounded some Russian attack planes and helicopters, and forced others to fly at lower altitudes, making them more vulnerable to Ukrainian ground fire, a senior Pentagon official said.

“Most Russian capabilities have been sitting on the sidelines,” said Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at CNA, a defense research institute, in an email. “The force employment is completely irrational, preparations for a real war near nonexistent and morale incredibly low because troops were clearly not told they would be sent into this fight.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/us/politics/russia-ukraine-military.html

Riding point for the formation was lethal-looking two-seater Ka-52 Alligator attack helicopters with distinctive double-rotors, side-mounted 30-millimeter cannons, and a dozen Ataka anti-tank guided missiles on stub wings.

But the Alligators were but the escort for the real strike force: Mi-8 ‘Hip’ assault transports carrying a more lethal cargo: up to 300 elite Russian airborne soldiers. Reportedly the paratroopers may have come from the 11th Guards Air Assault Brigade.

The paratroopers, or desantniki, weren’t heading for Kyiv itself, but rather Antonov Airport ten miles northwest on the outskirts of the metropolis. Also known as Hostomel or Gostomel after the nearby town, Antonov Airport was operated by the former chief manufacturer of Soviet transport aircraft, and its 2.17 mile-long runway was used principally for cargo flights and aircraft testing.

The airport’s most famous resident was the world’s heaviest and widest cargo aircraft (in terms of wingspan) ever made: the only ever built Antonov An-225 Mriya (“Dream”), which has remained in demand to deliver oversized cargoes across the world on short notice, most recently shipment of Covid-treating medicines.

If the Russian assault went as planned, Antonov could be used to land thousands of additional airborne soldiers and their light armored vehicles by cargo plane, allowing Russian troops to begin tightening the noose around the Ukrainian capital even before Russian mechanized armies fought their way in.

Cell phone cameras recorded the helicopters’ approach which evoked the famous aerial assault scene in the Vietnam war film Apocalypse Now.

Kyiv soon admitted the desantniki had seized control of an airport right on its doorstep.

But Russia’s ambitious airborne assault was a high-risk affair. It meant flying a bunch of helicopters in proximity to numerous short-range air defense systems—often using heat-seeking missiles instead of radar guidance, and thus not disabled by Russian air defense suppression strikes targeting Ukrainian radars.

The other problem was that openly inserting a small infantry unit deep behind enemy lines—say right next to the capital—is very risky, a move predicated on hopes that Ukrainian forces would be in such disarray they would be unable to mount a counter-attack.

So despite the overwhelming scale of Russia’s assault on Ukraine, the gambit for Antonov Airport did not go as planned.

Alligators in the Dnieper River

As Russian helicopters skimmed south along the Dnieper River dividing Kiev toward and Hostomel, they came under fire from small arms and man-portable surface-to-air missiles—likely Soviet Strela or Iglas-S missiles and/or possibly Piorun and U.S.-built Stinger missiles recently transferred from Poland and Lithuania respectively. Short-range air defense vehicles with autocannons and their own short-range missiles may also have engaged.

Aware of their peril, helicopters pumped out scores of brilliant flares in the hopes of decoying heat-seeking missiles. But it did not prove enough. One of the Alligators was struck and fell into the Dnieper, smoke pouring upwards into the sky even after its immersion.

Both the helicopter’s crew members ejected—an unique capability of the Ka-52 found in a few other helicopters—lofted down into the water as well.

Another Alligator appears to have sustained so much damage it was forced to crash land. Footage of the empty cockpit implies both crew members escaped.

Ukrainian sources claim a third helicopter downed, though confirmation is unavailable, with some alleging a Ukrainian MiG-29 fighter made the kill.

Counterattack

Contrary to Russian hopes, Kyiv’s defenders were not so disorganized as to fail to assess both the small size of the paratrooper force and the danger an enemy airheadt next to the capital posed if let uncontested. Indeed, after 10 AM a Ukrainian told a journalist their intelligence reported eighteen Il-76MD troop transports bound towards Kyiv had taken off from Pskov, base of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division.

First, the 4th Rapid Response Brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard surrounded the airport. This was a new model unit organized according to NATO standards combining light infantry, a battalion of T-64BV main battle tanks, an artillery battery and supporting surveillance drones.

Lacking armored vehicles, the Russian airborne at Hostomel depended on air support to stave off Ukrainian attack. Russian Su-25 Frogfoot ground attack jets were recorded flying in for strikes.

But Ukrainian warplanes—having remarkably escaped Russia’s first strike—pounded the airfield in return, with an image showing two of Ukraine’s swing-wing Su-24M ‘Fencer’ bombers swooping over the airfield and releasing a brace of bombs, as well as flares for self-defense.

Another video recorded from a civilian home near Hostomel shows a Ukrainian MiG-29 skimming over rooftops and launching what appear to be unguided S-8 rockets terrifyingly close to the recorder—reportedly targeting either withdrawing Russian airborne infantry, or a Russian helicopter per various sources.

Eventually, Ukrainian minister Oleksiy Arestovych claimed the airport had been secured by Ukrainian forces. But twenty minutes later he issued a partial retraction—a mopping up operation was still ongoing. When CNN’s Matthew Chance arrived at the airport gate he encountered Russian, not Ukrainian soldiers he was expecting.

Later that evening, the Russian airborne were allegedly driven from the airport, though the remaining elements continued skirmishing in the woods outside of it.

Some accounts claim Ukraine’s ‘45th Spetsnaz Brigade’ was responsible for the final assault, but this appears to refer only to a Russian, not Ukrainian, unit. Instead, at 10 PM local time, the 4th Brigade’s Facebook page posted an image of soldiers holding a seemingly bullet-riddled battle flag celebrating the victory.

On the same site, Antonov Airline’s chief pilot assured that the legendary An-225 remained undamaged, contrary to earlier reports claiming its hangar had caught fire.

Russia strikes back

Kyiv’s forces may have sought to render Hostomel inoperable by demolishing or obstructing its runway after the battle. That’s because Russian forces crossing the Ukraine-Belarus border had reportedly penetrated through the Exclusion Zone around Chernobyl and were rolling towards northwestern Kyiv.

Furthermore, a contingent of Spetsnaz special forces infiltrated into Kyiv wearing Ukrainian military uniforms—incidentally, a violation of Article 39 of the Geneva Convention—sprang into action, causing small arms fire to echo throughout the capital.

Videos recorded from high-rise apartments in the northern Obolon suburb show a Spetsnaz- gun truck riddled by fire from Ukrainian troops, while a hijacked Strela-10 (SA-8) tracked air defense vehicles races away—only to run over a civilian car driving from the opposite direction. Remarkably the elderly man inside survived and was hospitalized for treatment.

Fighting meanwhile continued around Hostomel with remnants of the Russian airborne, who may have been reinforced by Spetsnaz or by Russian mechanized elements. Finally around 2 PM local time on February 25, Russia’s ministry of defense claimed it had recaptured Antonov Airport supposedly in an operation involving 200 helicopters, a number unlikely to be accurate.

Nonetheless, video footage does appear to show Russian paratroopers manning a checkpoint at Hostomel.

Another recording allegedly depicts the burning remains of a Russian tank column there. Furthermore, a Ukrainian Ground Forces Mi-24P helicopter gunships was recorded unleashing barrages of S-8 80-millimeter rockets from 20-shot launcher pods on targets around Hostomel.

While Ukraine’s victory at Hostomel may have proved ephemeral, it indicated that Ukraine’s military is neither paralyzed nor evaporating in the face of Russia’s assault like Georgia’s did in the 2008 Russo-Georgia war.

However, Ukraine’s capacity to defeat an arguably ill-advised Russian operational gambit does not assure future success. Russia is attacking Ukraine on so many fronts it can afford to be stalled in some areas, such as around Kharkiv and Mariupol, as long as breakthrough are achieved elsewhere, as has occurred in southern Ukraine at Kherson and Melitopol.

As Russia has yet to commit all its forces, it will likely use Soviet ‘echelon’ style tactic wherein troops withheld from the first wave are channeled down the most promising avenues of attack, or into as yet untested sectors deemed vulnerable.

Still, the battle at Hostomel suggests Putin’s unprovoked invasion will meet stiffer resistance than he apparently expected.

The Ukrainian military destroyed a Kadyrov forces unit near Hostomel, Kyiv region.

""A unit of Kadyrov forces near Hostomel was destroyed. Commander of the 141st Regiment of the Chechen unit of the Russian Guard, Magomed Tushayev, was killed together with the group,"" the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine posted on Telegram.

The destruction delayed as the enemy were insidiously hiding behind civilian infrastructure.

Kadyrov forces units were also spotted in Kharkiv direction, with the Z mark on their vehicles. Currently, such vehicles are on their way from Sumy to Kyiv.

Ramzan Kadyrov is the leader of Russia's Chechnya region and an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin.

As reported, Russian president Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine on February 24 and launched a large-scale invasion.

Russian troops have been shelling and destroying key infrastructure for four days already, while missiles have been hitting residential buildings.

Martial law was imposed in Ukraine and general mobilization was announced.
