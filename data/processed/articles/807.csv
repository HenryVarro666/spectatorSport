Her face is pale, one hand cradles her belly in a protective gesture. Every window on that side of the building appears to be blown out; wreckage litters the ground around it.

The searing image was taken following a Russian airstrike on the hospital Wednesday that injured 17 people, including children, women and doctors, according to Mariupol city officials. Three people died, the city council said Thursday, among them, a child.

The city in southeastern Ukraine has been besieged by Russian forces for days, its trapped residents forced to shelter underground, melt snow for water and scavenge for food. Now, even a hospital caring for pregnant women, newborns and children is not safe.

Mariupol's Mayor Vadym Boychenko condemned Russia's ""cynical and destructive war against humanity,"" in a video message on Thursday.

""Every 30 minutes Mariupol was invaded by Russian aviation that was shooting at civilian buildings killing civilians: elderly, women and children,"" he said, adding, ""it's genocide that was created by the Russian army with Putin.""

Mariupol's hospital wasn't the only children's medical facility that was damaged by Russian forces on Wednesday. Two hospitals in Zhytomyr, west of the capital, Kyiv, had their windows blown out in a Russian airstrike on a thermal power plant and civilian building in the city, the mayor said. One of them was a children's hospital. There were no casualties and everyone was in a bomb shelter, according to the city's mayor, Serhii Sukhomlyn.

The rules of war specify that civilians should not be targeted and that medical workers, medical vehicles and hospitals dedicated to humanitarian work cannot be attacked.

But in the past two weeks Russian forces have repeatedly struck medical facilities in Ukraine, prompting claims they are being systematically targeted, despite Russian denials.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been 24 verified attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine so far.

""These attacks have led to at least 12 deaths and 17 injuries. At least 8 of the injured and 2 of the killed were verified to be health workers. The attacks took place between 24 February and 8 March,"" WHO said Thursday.

""WHO strongly condemns these attacks. Attacks on health care violate international law and endanger lives. Even in times of conflict, we must protect the sanctity and safety of health care, a fundamental human right,"" it said in an email to CNN.

A CNN crew in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, saw patients -- including sick children -- take cover in a hospital's underground bomb shelter as air raid sirens wailed.

Stass, 12 years old and heavily bandaged, was unaware that his father was not with him in the hospital at that moment because he was burying the boy's mother and sister. ""I was in the neighbor's basement when the bomb hit the roof on my side,"" he said. ""We ran to my granny's house. Another hit there. My arm is broken. My dad and neighbor brought me here. I was in a coma for two days.""

In a late-night video address Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the Mariupol hospital bombing as an ""atrocity"" and ""proof of a genocide of Ukrainians,"" as he renewed his calls on Western leaders to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

He also called on Russia to explain why it was carrying out strikes on hospitals. ""Why were they a threat to the Russian Federation? What kind of country is the Russian Federation that is afraid of hospitals, afraid of maternity wards and destroys them?"" he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday alleged without evidence the bombed hospital in Mariupol was the radical Azov battalion's base and that all patients and nurses had left. Later on Thursday, a Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson denied in a briefing that Russia had shelled the maternity hospital at all, calling it a ""provocation.""

Lavrov said Russia informed the UN Security Council meeting about this a few days before the attack. The Azov battalion is integrated into the Ukrainian armed forces but was formerly an independent ultra-nationalist militia.

""On March 7 or 6, I don't remember exactly now, but at the meeting of the UN Security Council, our delegation presented facts that this maternity hospital had long been captured by the Azov battalion and other radicals,"" Lavrov said.

""All the women in labor, all the nurses, in general, all the staff was driven out of there,"" Lavrov added.

Video from the hospital after the bombing clearly showed there were both patients and staff there, including pregnant women.

Ukrainian emergency employees work at the hospital damaged by shelling in Mariupol.

A 'dire and desperate' situation

The Mariupol hospital attack has sparked a flurry of international condemnation, with French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal calling it ""inhumane"" and ""unjustifiable"" in comments Thursday.

""I want to say in the name of the French government that the strike by Russia against Mariupol's pediatric hospital was inhumane and cowardly. It's women, children, healthcare workers who were targeted, it's unjustifiable,"" he said in an interview with French radio station RTL.

Calling again for a ceasefire in Ukraine, Attal predicted the worst was yet to come in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also condemned the strike in Mariupol, saying: ""There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenseless.""

The United Nations said it was following up ""urgently"" on ""shocking reports"" of the bombing of the hospital.

""It bears reminding that we have called, WHO has called for an immediate halt to attacks on health care, hospitals, health care workers, ambulances -- none of these should ever, ever be a target,"" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Wednesday.

The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine ""continues to deteriorate rapidly,"" Dujarric added. More than 2.2 million people have crossed international borders escaping Ukraine since the invasion began, Dujarric said.

In Mariupol itself, the situation is becoming ""increasingly dire and desperate,"" the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Thursday.

It warned that ""hundreds of thousands of people have no food, water, heat, electricity, or medical care,"" and said that ""people urgently need respite from violence and humanitarian aid.""

""All the shops and pharmacies were looted four to five days ago. Some people still have food but I'm not sure for how long it will last,"" the deputy head of sub-delegation of ICRC Sasha Volkov said in a interview recorded Wednesday and published on the ICRC website.

Many people in Mariupol have reported having no food for children, Volkov said. ""People started to attack each other for food. People started to ruin someone's car to take the gasoline out.""

Disturbing pictures from an Associated Press photographer showed bodies being lowered into a mass grave in the city on Wednesday, some encased in body bags but others apparently wrapped only in blankets.

At least 1,300 civilians have been killed in Mariupol since the Russian invasion began, an adviser to the city's mayor said Wednesday. CNN cannot independently verify these casualty figures.

Zelensky warned Russian propagandists they ""will be held responsible for complicity with war crimes"" in a video message Thursday.

""Russian citizens will hate you for consistently lying to them for many years. When they will feel the consequences of your lies, feel with their wallets, their dwindling opportunities, with the stolen futures of the Russian children,"" he said, adding that the aggressor also pays a price in war.

His warning came after Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova on Wednesday called for a ""new model"" of investigative efforts to tackle alleged war crimes in Ukraine.

And for those trying desperately to flee Russian attacks, evacuation efforts continue to be fragile and fleeting.

Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of violating agreed pauses in hostilities.

On Thursday morning, the Ukrainian government said that it was opening evacuation corridors -- designed to allow civilians to escape to safer regions -- in several parts of the country.

Later that day, Zelensky said about 100,000 people have been evacuated through the corridors over the past two days.

Mariupol and the city of Volnovakha however, remain completely blocked, he said, adding that despite Ukrainian officials' best efforts to make the corridor work, ""Russian troops did not cease fire.""

Meanwhile, a meeting between Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Lavrov in Turkey ended Thursday without an agreement reached on evacuation corridors or a ceasefire, Kuleba said.

At a news conference following the meeting, Kuleba said he had raised the prospect of establishing a corridor to allow civilians to flee from the besieged city of Mariupol but ""unfortunately Minister Lavrov was not in a position to commit himself to it.""",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-10-intl/index.html

Switzerland has condemned the bombing of a children's hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, calling it an ""inconceivable act of inhumanity"". Ukraine accused Russia of carrying out genocide, while the Kremlin said the bombing claim was fake “information terrorism”.

In a tweetExternal link published on Wednesday evening, the Swiss foreign ministry said it was appalled by the bombing of the children’s hospital, which had been supported by the Swiss authorities in the past.

“Switzerland harshly condemns this inconceivable act of inhumanity,” it wrote.

The foreign ministry called on Russia to ""emphatically"" comply with its obligations under international law and to stop shelling civilians and civilian facilities ""immediately"".

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of genocide after Ukrainian officials said Russian aircraft bombed the children's hospital on Wednesday, burying patients in rubble despite a ceasefire deal for people to flee the city.

Local Ukrainian authorities said the hospital was hit several times, causing ""colossal"" destruction, and that 17 people were wounded. On Thursday, the city council of Mariupol said three people had died, including one child, in the attack.

""Fake news""

Russia meanwhile said on Thursday that the Ukrainian bombing claim was fake news because the building was a former maternity hospital that had long been taken over by troops.

""That’s how fake news is born,"" Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, said on TwitterExternal link. Polyanskiy said Russia had warned on March 7 that the hospital had been turned into a military object from which Ukrainians were firing.

A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, described the Ukrainian claim on Thursday as “information terrorism”. But another Kremlin spokesperson said on Thursday it would seek information from the Russian military about the matter.

Ukraine says it hopes to start evacuating civilians through a ""humanitarian corridor"" from Mariupol on Thursday.

Several previous attempts to establish a humanitarian corridor from Mariupol have failed, and people in the city of more than 400,000 people have been sheltering there without water or power for over a week.

Each side has blamed the other for the collapse of local ceasefires, including around Mariupol.

Russia's war in Ukraine entered its third week on Thursday with none of its key stated objectives reached despite thousands of people killed, more than two million refugees, and thousands forced to cower in besieged cities under relentless bombardment.

Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said without evidence on Thursday that Russia had bombed a maternity hospital in Ukraine because it contained Ukrainian militants.

Three people, including one child, were killed, and 17 people were injured in Wednesday's attack in Mariupol, the city council said, according to The Associated Press.

Images taken at the wrecked hospital showed several civilian injuries, including a bloodied pregnant woman being carried away on a stretcher.

But during a press conference after talks with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Lavrov said the hospital was empty of patients and that Russia had told the United Nations it was being used as a Ukrainian militia base.

""On March 7 or 6, I don't remember exactly now, but at a meeting of the UN Security Council, facts were presented by our delegation about that this maternity hospital was seized long ago by the Azov Battalion and other radicals,"" Lavrov said, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency.

""All the women in labor, all the nurses, and all the attendants were expelled.""

The Azov Battalion is a volunteer infantry unit of right-wing Ukrainian ultranationalists that became part of the country's national guard in 2014.

The UN did not immediately return a request for comment from Insider.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday morning that the attack was an ""atrocity"" and showed Russia was committing ""genocide.""

""What kind of country is this, the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals, afraid of maternity hospitals, and destroys them?"" he said.

""The air bomb on the maternity hospital is the final proof,"" he later said. ""Proof that the genocide of Ukrainians is taking place.""

But Lavrov rejected the classification at the press conference, saying: ""It is not the first time we see pathetic outcries concerning so-called atrocities.""

Lavrov also called the Russian invasion of Ukraine a ""special military operation"" and denied, falsely, that Russia had attacked Ukraine.

""We're not planning to attack other countries. We didn't even attack Ukraine,"" he said, repeating the claim that Russia was defending the pro-Kremlin Ukrainian territories of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Speaking at his own press conference, Kuleba said he and Lavrov had made no progress on arranging a cease-fire.",https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-says-mariupol-maternity-hospital-militia-base-no-evidence-2022-3

“Three people were killed, including a female child, in yesterday’s attack on a children’s and maternity hospital in Ukraine’s besieged Mariupol, according to updated figures this morning,” the city council said on its Telegram channel.

Officials had previously given a toll of 17 injured, including doctors, in the attack.

“The Russian forces are destroying Mariupol’s civilian population deliberately and without mercy,” the city council said.

It says 1,200 inhabitants have been killed in nine days of Russian siege.

The attack on the children’s hospital, described by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a “war crime”, has triggered international indignation.

Save the Children’s Eastern Europe Director, Irina Saghoyan, said in a statement on Thursday: “It’s horrifying that a place people seek for help has become one of absolute and utter destruction.

“Where can families and children turn to if even hospitals are not safe? They must not become the battlefields where conflicts rage and innocent children are the casualties.”

The attack a day earlier in the besieged southern city wounded 17 people, including women waiting to give birth, doctors and children buried in the rubble. Bombs also fell on two hospitals in another city west of the capital Kyiv.

The World Health Organization said it has confirmed 18 attacks on medical facilities since the Russian invasion began two weeks ago.

The Kremlin said it will approach the Russian military for details of the strike, which Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky called a “war crime.”

“We will certainly ask our military about this, since we don’t have clear information about what happened there. Without fail, the military will provide some kind of information,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, as Moscow’s advance into Ukraine enters its third week.

However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that the hospital had been serving as a military base for nationalists.

“This maternity hospital has long been occupied by the Azov Battalion and other radicals. They drove out the women in labor, nurses and general staff. It was the base of the ultra-radical Azov Battalion,” Lavrov said, following talks in Turkey with his Ukrainian counterpart.

Photos following the attack showed injured pregnant women.

Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s deputy envoy to the United Nations, backed up Lavrov and dismissed the reports that a maternity hospital was hit as “fake news.”

Responding to a tweet from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who called the strike “horrific,” Polyanskiy wrote that Russia had earlier this week warned the hospital was “turned into a military object by radicals.”

Britain’s Armed Forces minister, James Heappey, said that whether hitting the hospital was “indiscriminate” fire into a built-up area or a deliberate targeting, “it is a war crime.”

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also labeled the attack a war crime, saying, “We’re seeing how hospitals are being bombed. They are attacking civil society in an indiscriminate manner, therefore clearly violating human rights and more than likely committing war crimes.

“Such war crimes cannot go unpunished,” Sanchez said during a visit to a Ukrainian refugee center near Madrid.

Little progress

As the war entered its third week, Western officials said Russian forces have made little progress on the ground in recent days, but they have intensified the bombardment of Mariupol and other cities, trapping hundreds of thousands of people, with food and water running short. Temporary ceasefires to allow evacuations have often faltered, with Ukraine accusing Russia of continuing their bombardments. But Zelensky said 35,000 people managed to get out on Wednesday from several besieged towns.

The Mariupol city council posted a video Thursday showing buses driving down a highway, with a note saying that a convoy bringing food and medicine was on the way despite several days of thwarted efforts to reach the city.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk pleaded Thursday with the Russian military to allow access for repair to a damaged gas pipeline in the south that has left Mariupol and other towns without heat for days.

Two other hospitals were also hit in Zhytomyr, a city west of Kyiv, Mayor Serhii Sukhomlyn said on Facebook. He said there were no injuries.

“Everyone is working to get help to the people of Mariupol. And it will come,” said Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko.

On the western edge of Kyiv, artillery fire could be heard Thursday, Deputy Interior Minister Vadym Denysenko said. He told Ukrainian TV channel Rada that residents had a “rather difficult” night on the outskirts of the capital in which Russian forces started by targeting military sites but then hit residential areas.

Meanwhile, the sides held their highest-level talks so far Thursday. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he hoped the meeting between Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in a Turkish Mediterranean resort “will open the door to a permanent ceasefire.”

Kuleba said the two sides discussed a 24-hour ceasefire but did not make progress. He said Russia was still seeking “a surrender from Ukraine.”

“This is not what they are going to get,” he said, adding that he was willing to continue the dialogue.

Authorities announced new ceasefires to allow thousands of civilians to escape bombarded towns, with evacuations planned Thursday from towns and cities under bombardment in eastern and southern Ukraine — including Mariupol — as well as the Kyiv suburbs.

Previous attempts to establish safe evacuation corridors over the past few days largely failed because of what the Ukrainians said were Russian attacks. But Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a telephone call with Germany’s chancellor, accused militant Ukrainian nationalists of hampering the evacuations.

International Red Cross spokesman Jason Straziuso said safe passage corridors were welcome but have to be well planned, with details agreed on by all sides including the right to bring in food, clean water, medical supplies and other necessities.

Such guarantees are vital for places like Mariupol, a city of 430,000 on the Sea of Azov, where Zelensky’s office said about 1,200 people have died during the nine-day siege.

Local authorities hurried to bury the dead from the past two weeks of fighting in a mass grave in the city. Workers dug a trench some 25 meters (yards) long at one of the city’s old cemeteries and made the sign of the cross as they pushed in bodies wrapped in carpets or bags.

Nationwide, thousands are thought to have been killed, both civilians and soldiers, since Putin’s forces invaded. The UN estimates more than 2 million people have fled the country, the biggest exodus of refugees in Europe since the end of World War II.

Russia’s military is struggling more than expected, but Putin’s invading force of more than 150,000 troops retains possibly insurmountable advantages in firepower as it bears down on key cities.

Despite often heavy shelling on populated areas, American military officials reported little change on the ground over the previous 24 hours, other than Russian progress against the cities of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv, in heavy fighting. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to assess the military situation.

Russia, meanwhile, said on Thursday that it would look into the incident, Reuters reported.

“We will definitely ask our military, because you and I don’t have clear information about what happened there,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “And the military are very likely to provide some information.”

Originally, Russia initially denied reports of the attack, saying its military was not targeting civilians.

Ukrainian officials were quick to condemn the strike, with the mayor of the city calling for a no-fly zone in Ukraine.

“Our will has not been broken, we will fight to the end. We have motivated soldiers and officers who defend our homeland,” mayor Vadym Boichenko Boichenko said. “But today we need support.”

“Close the sky over Ukraine,” the mayor added.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made similar calls for help after the hospital bombing.

“Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?” Zelensky asked.

“Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity,” he added.
