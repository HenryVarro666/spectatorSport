Guterres praises ‘generosity and solidarity’

In a phone call with Polish President, Andrzej Duda, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he appreciated the welcome extended there, to more than one million refugees from Ukraine.

Today's attack on a hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, where maternity & children's wards are located, is horrific.



Civilians are paying the highest price for a war that has nothing to do with them.



This senseless violence must stop.



End the bloodshed now. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 9, 2022

The UN chief “told the President that he will do everything possible to mobilize the whole of the UN system, in coordination with UNHCR, to support Poland’s generosity”, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York.

He said Mr. Guterres was thankful for the “immense generosity and solidarity shown by all countries” bordering Ukraine.

As part of his overall mediation efforts to try and end the fighting in Ukraine, the UN chief also spoke on Wednesday afternoon with German Chancellor Olaf Schultz, and Josep Borrell, the European Union's foreign and security policy High Representative.

Latest estimates from UN aid agencies suggest that four million refugees are likely by the end of the war, which represents about 10 per cent of Ukraine’s population.

Horror over maternity hospital attack

The development follows news alerts on Wednesday that a Russian strike on a children’s hospital and maternity ward in the stricken city of Mariupol, had left children buried under the rubble, according to Ukrainian officials.

The bombing has not been independently verified, but Mr. Dujarric said the UN was urgently investigating the “shocking” reports.

He reiterated the UN’s call for an immediate halt to attacks on healthcare, hospitals, health-workers and ambulances, reminding that “none of these, should ever be a target.”

Any attacks on healthcare, are a clear violation of International Humanitarian Law.

In a tweet, Mr. Guterres described reports of the attack as ""horrific"", noting that civilians were paying ""the highest price, for a war that has nothing to do with them. This senseless violence must stop.""

In a statement, UNICEF chief, Catherine Russell, said she was “horrified by the reported attack…an attack which reportedly left young children and women in labour, buried beneath the rubble of destroyed buildings. We do not yet know the number of casualties but fear the worst.”

Horrific toll on children

“This attack, if confirmed, underscores the horrific toll this war is exacting on Ukraine’s children and families” she added. “In less than two weeks, at least 37 children have been killed and 50 injured, while more than one million children have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries.

“UNICEF renews its call for an immediate ceasefire and urges all parties to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect children from harm, and to ensure that humanitarian actors can safely and quickly reach children in need.”

Multiple attacks

Briefing journalists in Geneva, World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that so far, WHO has verified 18 attacks on health facilities, health workers and ambulances amidst Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including 10 deaths and 16 injuries.

“These attacks deprive whole communities of health care”, he said.

So far, WHO has delivered 81 metric tons of supplies, and WHO is establishing a pipeline of supplies for health facilities throughout Ukraine, especially in the most affected areas, Tedros added.

“Yesterday, we delivered five metric tons of medical supplies to Kyiv to support surgical care for 150 trauma patients, and other supplies to manage a range of health conditions for 45,000 people for a month. More supplies will be distributed today, and we have 400 cubic metres of supplies waiting to be transported to Ukraine, from our logistics hub in Dubai.”

The UN health agency chief said some of the main health challenges beyond surviving airstrikes and bombings, were hypothermia and frostbite, respiratory diseases, lack of treatment for cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, and mental health issues.

WHO personnel have been deployed to neighbouring countries to provide mental health and psychosocial support.

“WHO continues to call on the Russian Federation to commit to a peaceful resolution to this crisis, and to allow safe, unimpeded access to humanitarian assistance for those in need”, said Tedros.

IOM helps nationals return home

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Wednesday it has helped almost 100 so-called Third Country Nationals (TCNs), stranded in Ukraine during the Russian attack, to return home.

They include 77 Tunisians, forced to flee to Romania and Poland; three Lebanese nationals, and 17 Ghanaian students. Seven other students leave for Ghana on Thursday.

IOM said that around 109,000 TCNs have fled Ukraine since the war began, as the agency collaborates with States, embassies, border authorities, and other partners, to help them return.

In addition to supporting returns, IOM provided pre-departure medical assistance, food, COVID-19 testing, Personal Protective Equipment and much-needed ground transportation to the points of departure.

IOM is providing TCNs – some of whom have faced discrimination and xenophobic attacks during their journeys – help to liaise with their home authorities, and has created a network of Hotlines in Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Lithuania providing information to all those forced to leave Ukraine.",https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113652

A children's hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine, was destroyed Wednesday in what Ukrainian officials said was a targeted attack by Russian airstrikes, as the deputy mayor warned the hard-hit city is on the ""brink of a humanitarian catastrophe.""

At least three people, including a child, were killed in the airstrike, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Another 17 people, including women, children and medical workers, were wounded, he said.

The Ukrainian leader accused Russian state media of lying about the lack of patients inside the hospital at the time of the attack.

""War crimes are impossible without propaganda that covers them,"" Zelenskyy said in a televised address Thursday. ""You will bear responsibility as well as those who give orders to throw bombs on peaceful people.""

Zelenskyy had posted a video on social media Wednesday that he said showed the heavily damaged children's hospital and maternity ward in the southeastern Ukrainian port city.

""Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,"" he said, calling on the international community again to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. ""People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror?""

Pavlo Kirilenko, the head of the Donetsk regional military administration, claimed in a post on Facebook that a Russian aircraft deliberately targeted the 600-bed hospital.

""City center maternity hospital, hospital, children's ward and therapy -- all destroyed during a Russian aviation flight to Mariupol,"" he said. ""The Russians! You have not only crossed the border of unacceptable relations between states and peoples. You have crossed the line of humanity.""

Russia's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed during a daily briefing Wednesday that Ukraine had put firing positions inside the children's hospital in Mariupol, though there is currently no evidence to support that allegation. The comment, however, appears to be an implicit acknowledgment that Russia deliberately targeted the hospital, as Kirilenko had claimed.

UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said she was ""horrified"" by the reported attack on the hospital.

""We do not yet know the number of casualties but fear the worst,"" she said in a statement. ""This attack, if confirmed, underscores the horrific toll this war is exacting on Ukraine's children and families. In less than two weeks, at least 37 children have been killed and 50 injured, while more than 1 million children have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries.""

The besieged city, which sits on the Sea of Azov, has been without power or water amid steady Russian bombardments.

In a video conference Wednesday, Mariupol deputy mayor Serhiy Orlov said the city is on the ""brink of a humanitarian catastrophe"" and that ""'Russia is trying to wipe Mariupol from the face of the earth.""

Orlov reported that 1,207 people have died in the city because of shelling and aerial attacks -- and that half of those killed were ethnic Russians. Among the casualties was a child who died from dehydration, according to Zelenskyy.

The city has been burying its dead in a mass grave on the outskirts of Mariupol as it endures heavy shelling.

New satellite imagery collected by commercial satellite company Maxar Technologies on Wednesday morning, before the reported shelling of the hospital, showed extensive damage to civilian infrastructure in and around the city, including residential homes, high-rise apartment buildings, grocery stores and shopping centers.

Orlov accused Russia of indiscriminately bombarding the city because its forces were unable to break through its defenses, but he said that Mariupol would not surrender. He also called on the international community to impose a no-fly zone, an escalation that the White House and NATO allies have opposed.

""The Russian army cannot break our defenses and win on the ground, and this is why they are just bombing us relentlessly to break our spirit,"" he said. ""Our spirit is strong but we need help. To the outside world we say: Help us save our city! Close the skies! Impose a no-fly zone!""'

THE MAYOR OF Mariupol has said that 1,207 civilians have been killed in the Russian siege of the city, while 17 people were injured during a missile strike on a children’s hospital in the city.

In a message on Telegram, city authorities said that the Russian siege saw “1,207 peaceful Mariupol residents dying” while the city’s mayor Vadym Boichenko posted a video message updating civilians.

The ground shook more than a mile away when a series of blasts slammed into the Mariupol complex, blowing out windows and ripping away much of the front of one building.

Police and soldiers rushed to scene to evacuate victims, carrying out a heavily pregnant and bleeding woman on a stretcher.

A statement on the city council’s social media account said the hospital suffered “colossal” damage.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted that there were “people, children under the wreckage”. He called the strike an “atrocity”.

The deputy head of Zelenskyy’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said authorities are trying to establish the number of people who may have been killed or wounded.

Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the southeastern Donetsk region, said in a Facebook post that 17 staff were wounded in the air strike but that “so far no kids were wounded” and that there have been “no deaths”.

Russia’s spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is quoted as saying “national battalions” had expelled staff and patients from the Mariupol’s maternity hospital and set up firing positions there.

It comes as citizens trying to escape shelling on the outskirts of Kyiv streamed toward the capital amid warnings from the West that Moscow’s invasion is about to take a more brutal and indiscriminate turn.

A children's hospital has been left in ruins by an attack carried out during a supposed ceasefire, in the city of Mariupol.

Widespread condemnation

The bombing of the children’s hospital has been condemned internationally by the UN, the WHO, UNICEF, and heads of Government.

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in response to the news that no health facility “should ever be a target”. The UN and the WHIO have called for an “immediate halt to attacks on health care, hospitals, healthcare workers, ambulances,” Dujarric told a press conference.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the air strike made the “indiscriminate cruelty” of the invasion “crystal clear”.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also condemned the attack, saying: “There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless.”

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of the WHO said the organisation “is aware of disturbing news reports about an attack on a maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukraine. The WHO unequivocally condemns all acts of violence against health facilities, healthworkers and patients. We reiterate our urgent call for a peaceful resolution.”

Ukrainian MEP Inna Sovsun told RTÉ’s Drivetime programme that the attack was “another level of cruelty”.

We are still waiting for data on the casualties. I pray that people did manage to hide in the basement and that we will not have casualties, but the very fact that the Russians are doing this is just unacceptable and unthinkable.

“This extreme cruelty towards civilians is basically what they’ve resorted to right now, because they cannot fight the Ukrainian army, so they turn to cruelty against civilians.”

Sovsun said residents in Mariupol remain without water, heating and electricity since the city was surrounded by Russian forces, calling it a “humanitarian catastrophe”.

People try to flee cities

The incident comes as authorities announced the new cease-fire this morning to allow thousands of civilians to escape from towns around Kyiv as well as the southern cities of Mariupol, Enerhodar and Volnovakha, Izyum in the east and Sumy in the northeast.

Previous attempts to establish safe evacuation corridors largely failed because of Russian attacks.

It was not immediately clear whether anyone was able to leave other cities, but people streamed out of Kyiv’s suburbs, many headed for the city centre, even as explosions were heard in the capital and air raid sirens sounded repeatedly.

From there, they planned to board trains bound for western Ukrainian regions not under attack.

In Mariupol, local authorities hurried to bury the dead in a mass grave. City workers dug a trench some 25 metres long at one of the city’s old cemeteries and made a sign of the cross as they pushed bodies wrapped in carpets or bags over the edge.

Thousands of people are thought to have been killed, both civilians and soldiers, in two weeks of fighting since President Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded.

The UN estimates more than two million people have fled the country, the biggest exodus of refugees in Europe since the end of the Second World War.

Negotiations

As the war continues, the first set of high-level talks between Russia and Ukraine are set to get underway in Turkey.

Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba will meet for the talks in southern Turkey.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who had pushed for Turkey to play a mediation role, has expressed hope the talks can avert tragedy and even help agree a ceasefire.

Lavrov and Kuleba will be joined at the meeting by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, with NATO member Turkey keen to maintain strong relations with both sides despite the conflict.

Kuleba confirmed in a video on Facebook he was preparing to meet Lavrov on Thursday, warning that his expectations were “limited”.

He said the success of the talks would depend on “what instructions and directives Lavrov is under” from the Kremlin at the discussions.

Fighting continues

While Kharkiv remains within Ukrainian control, with AFP sources saying that the city is now likely surrounded by Russian troops.

Russian forces have also begun to press through Donetsk and Lugansk on the eastern border of the country.

In Kyiv, while bombardment is continuing in the Ukrainian capital, there is no evidence of Russia making any breakthrough in the north.

The British defence ministry has said that the Russians have “ailing to make any significant breakthrough” in the northwest.

Most of the Russian forces outside the city are stationed around 60km outside Kyiv and are seeking to attack from the east, according to the US Defence Department.

Some defence analysts have been concentrating for an assault within the next four days.

6,5d9f8663-3881-4afe-8d22-4d161354288c,"['Alan Mozes', 'Robert Preidt', 'Physician S Briefing Staff']",2022-03-10 13:38:44+00:00,"THURSDAY, March 10, 2022 (HealthDay News) -- As the war in Ukraine enters its third week, the scale of the devastation is placing the health of all Ukrainians — and the country's health care system itself — in peril.

""It's mind-boggling,"" said James Elder, a spokesperson for UNICEF, who arrived in the western city of Lviv just two days after the Russian invasion began.

Since then, ""a million children who are refugees have had to flee the country — in 13 days. Imagine the stress and the trauma. The world has not seen anything like this since World War II,"" he noted.

""But it's also really important to remember those who are at risk trapped in-country, as much as we see this huge outflux of people,"" Elder added. ""People who can't move. People in hospitals who are on drips. Babies in incubators. People who are trapped in bunkers. I visited a hospital here in Lviv just yesterday that took in 60 children, some injured in Kyiv, others just unwell after hiding out for days in a cold basement.""

Compounding the problem is the direct threat to hospitals themselves.

Doctors Without Borders noted that intentional wartime attacks on medical personnel, hospitals and health care facilities are a direct violation of the Geneva convention.

On Tuesday, the Ukrainian Health Minister Viktor Liashko announced that since Russia launched its invasion, 61 hospitals throughout the country have essentially been ""put out of action,"" intentionally or not. According to the Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov, 34 of them were destroyed by Russian bombardments.

That number grew on Wednesday, when a Russian airstrike hit a maternity hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol. Three people were killed in the blast, including a child, while 17 were injured.

These attacks put Ukrainian public health officials — such as Shorena Basilaia in the capital city of Kyiv and Svyatoslav Linnikov in the southern port city of Odessa — on the front lines of the struggle.

Hospitals under fire

Though Lviv has so far been something of an oasis from the sort of heavy bombardment that has engulfed cities in the eastern and southern parts of the country, the capital city of Kyiv (population 3 million) and its surroundings haven't been so lucky.

Deputy director of Kyiv's City Hospital for Adults No. 27, Basilaia tries to strike a can-do tone, despite the obvious risks that come with ensuring continued access to health care in the heart of a war zone.

The 270-bed hospital she helms — which has largely been attending to COVID-19 patients of late — ""has not been hit [by missiles] so far, and I hope it remains like this,"" Basilaia said, adding that medical supplies are still on hand.



""We do have medicines, no shortage so far,"" she said, though she points out that medical facilities in other parts of the country are in far more dire straits. For now, her staff remains ""functional and ready for all kinds of scenarios,"" she said.

Even so, the situation is ""very stressful and difficult right now,"" Basilaia acknowledged.

""War has a negative effect on everything, including the health system,"" she noted. For example, safety concerns have made it impossible for some of her staff to even make the journey into work. And those who do get to work find themselves on constant alert, ready to scramble at the sound of an air raid siren — not to mention the start of actual shelling — as they race patients into the protection of a bunker below.

""It's insane,"" agreed Linnikov. He directs the department of health promotion at Odessa's Regional Center for Public Health (RCPH), a local equivalent of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""I am not a warrior,"" he stressed. ""I've never held a gun. But I feel like I'm in a movie. Actually, 'The War of the Worlds,' with Tom Cruise. Because, if you remember, in that movie the first alien attack was in Ukraine.""

But Slava, as he's known, is not a Hollywood film star. A native son of Odessa, he's a surgeon by training. Pre-war —and pre-pandemic — his main role at the RCPH was to promote and teach public health interventions aimed at lowering the risk for both infectious diseases, such as HIV and viral hepatitis, and non-communicable illnesses such as heart and vascular disease, strokes and cancer.

Still coping with COVID

""But with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic I started fighting a new threat,"" he explained, quickly shifting his attention towards prepping materials on infection prevention, facilitating vaccinations and debunking pandemic misinformation.

According to the World Health Organization, the nation of roughly 44 million has registered 5 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and about 112,000 deaths, a population-wide death rate comparable to that of Italy.



Linnikov noted that he and his colleagues have spent much of the past two years on a countrywide effort ""aimed at saving people's lives from the coronavirus"" with considerable success: Until now, Ukraine had managed to administer roughly 31.5 million vaccinations.

Then, the unthinkable happened.

""On Feb. 24, at 5 a.m., I was awakened with the most terrible words: 'Get up. The war has begun. They are bombing our cities.'"" Linnikov admits that he and his friends initially reacted to the ""surreal"" Russian invasion with shock and disbelief. ""In the first hours after the start of the war, it became quite difficult to understand what to do next,"" he said.

""It is impossible to prepare yourself for war,"" he said. ""Your brain doesn't want to believe it.""

But Russia's assault on Ukrainian sovereignty dates back to the annexation of Crimea in 2014, so the shock quickly faded.

""After five hours from the beginning of the war, the first groups of volunteers appeared. We begin to collect aid for the first victims, and look for ammunition for volunteers, and form warehouses for humanitarian aid,"" Linnikov said.

Top of mind was also the conviction that the work of public health can't just stop when bombs start falling. Nor can ensuring that the chronically ill have continued access to critical treatment. ""War is a threat to physical health here and now. Our main task now is to provide uninterrupted medical care to those who need it,"" Linnikov said.

""We are talking about patients with diabetes who need daily insulin,"" he explained. ""Or people who live with HIV. It is impossible for them to be left without medicine for a single day. So, now doctors across all Ukraine are doing everything to provide them with medicines.""



Medical supplies, training paramount

""It's all about supplies,"" agreed Elder, one of roughly 130 UNICEF staff working in Ukraine right now. ""It's absolutely critical. Over this past weekend alone, we got 60 tons of medical supplies into the country: surgical kits, resuscitation kits and midwife kits, because women are now having babies in bunkers and basements,"" he noted.

""Of course, getting these supplies to people who are being shelled and attacked — getting food and water and medical attention to whole families, who in some cases have been trapped without water for days on end — is a big issue,"" Elder said. ""What we need — the surest and quickest way out of this — is for the bombing to stop. But if not, then we need humanitarian corridors, to bring in lifesaving assistance and to bring out the vulnerable. It has to happen.""

Beyond that, Linnikov said that the Ukrainian health care system must also now take on the added responsibility for ""teaching the civilian population the skills of first aid, survival in critical conditions, maintaining mental health and adapting to stress,"" in addition to continuing the COVID vaccination program ""where it is still possible and safe.""

For now, Odessa (which is 300 miles south of Kyiv) has not yet experienced a large-scale attack. But with Russian land forces only 80 miles to the east and Russian naval ships poised just outside the strategic city's territorial waters, Linnikov suggests that the ever-present sense of threat and dread is itself posing a health risk, undermining the psychological welfare of an entire nation.

""The uncertainty is frightening,"" he said, adding that he fears this is just the calm before the storm.

""Odessa is my home. It's very beautiful and it's a very important symbol in our country, like L.A. for America. But it's in a very dangerous position now and of course we want to fight,"" said Linnikov. ""We want to protect the city. We want to help people, provide the care they need. But we also want to run, because we know it will be very dangerous for my friends and me to stay there.""

Ukrainians are now caught on an emotional seesaw, teetering between anger and rage and fatigue and fear.

But ""there is no despondency, no powerlessness,"" Linnikov hastened to add. ""There is no time for depression right now. Post-traumatic stress syndrome, depression and other mental problems will come later.""

Still, the war has profoundly shifted the ground beneath his feet.

""I no longer feel the days of the week,"" Linnikov said. ""Or the dates of the months. Now there are only hours. The hours of war: 24, 48, 168…""

And counting.
