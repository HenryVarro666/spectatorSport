On Capitol Hill, the Senate Judiciary Committee is debating the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson, who looks set to become the first Black woman to sit on the US Supreme Court.

The panel is evenly split down partisan lines and is expected to return a tied vote, but this will not stop the nomination from proceeding to the Senate floor, where Ms Brown Jackson appears to already have the support of 51 senators.

Meanwhile, the cost of a Secret Service command post to protect Hunter Biden as required by law has been revealed, though it is far less than the reported costs of protecting the Trump family, the spike in rental rates is having an impact.

Lindsey Graham: If GOP controlled Senate, Jackson would not have gotten hearing

South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Monday that if Republicans controlled the Senate, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson would not have received a hearing.

Mr Graham made the remarks during the Senate Judiciary Committee’s confirmation vote for Judge Jackson weeks after her confirmation hearing. The South Carolina Republican noted how this would be the first time that he would vote against a Supreme Court nominee, having voted to confirm Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, both of whom Barack Obama appointed.

“If we get back the Senate and we’re in charge of this body and there’s judicial openings, we will talk to our colleagues on the other side, but if we were in charge she would not be before the committee,” Mr Graham said during the confirmation vote hearing. “You would have had someone more moderate than this.”

New study shows how Covid has hit poor Americans harder

16:50 , Andrew Naughtie

As the Biden administration tries to get Congress to allocate billions of dollars of new funds for Covid-19 relief, a new study from the Poor People’s Campaign has detailed what it calls the “immoral, shocking and unjust” neglect of poor communities during the pandemic, reporting that Americans living in poorer counties died of Covid-19 at almost twice the rate of those in rich counties.

The study, based on income and death data from over 3,200 US counties, shows an even bigger gap during the Delta variant that made up the US’s fourth coronavirus wave, when people living in the lowest income counties died at five times the rate of those in the highest income counties. The 300 counties with the highest death rates have an average poverty rate of 45 per cent, and household median incomes on average $23,000 lower than counties with lower rates. Many of the top twenty counties were sparsely populated areas in Georgia, Texas and Virginia, the report and an accompanying map of death rates and income online show.

After the sometimes acrimonious and bizarre hearings held a couple of weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee is soon to vote on whether to send the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the full Senate for a confirmation vote.

With no Republicans coming out to support the nominee – even those who went out of her way to praise her have backed away – the committee is expected to return a tied vote, after which Chuck Schumer will use procedural measures to bring the vote to the floor.

The Independent’s Eric Garcia is monitoring the proceedings as the committee’s Senators say their piece. Follow him below:

US seizes its first Russian oligarch mega-yacht

The Biden administration is reportedly considering ramping up sanctions on Russia given the flood of reports of war crimes being committed by Russian forces in Ukraine – but the sanctions already in place are still being enforced, with a joint Spanish-American operation seizing a super-yacht belonging to billionaire oligarch Viktor Vekselberg.

At the Marina Real in the port of Palma de Mallorca, a large group of Spanish Civil Guards and US federal agents boarded the boat, according to Associated Press reporters who were at the scene and saw the authorities early Monday morning.

Mr Vekselberg's US assets remain frozen and American companies have been forbidden from doing business with him and his entities.

“The Democratic president assessed Fox as one of the most destructive forces in the United States,” the authors write in This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America’s Future, “and told an associate midway through 2021 that its corporate overlord, the Australian-born News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch, was even more toxic than that.”

Another Republican confirms “no” vote on Ketanji Brown Jackson

As the Senate Judiciary Committee prepares to vote on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s historic nomination to the US Supreme Court, more Republican senators are lining up with their party against her. The latest is Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey, who is retiring at the end of this year. In his statement, he cites Ms Brown Jackson’s supposed “inability to define her own judicial philosophy” as a core reason for withholding his support.

Biden on Sacramento shooting

11:08 , Andrew Naughtie

Joe Biden yesterday released a statement on the mass shooting in Sacramento, which saw six people killed and 12 wounded. In the written remarks, he repeated what has become his standard call for concrete action to curb the US’s devastating gun violence problem.

We must do more than mourn; we must act. That is why my Administration has taken historic executive action to implement my comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy — from standing up gun trafficking strike forces to helping cities across the country expand community violence interventions and hire more police officers for community policing. We also continue to call on Congress to act. Ban ghost guns. Require background checks for all gun sales. Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Repeal gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability. Pass my budget proposal, which would give cities more of the funding they need to fund the police and fund the crime prevention and intervention strategies that can make our cities safer. These are just a few of the steps Congress urgently needs to take to save lives.

Mr Biden campaigned heavily on gun safety reform, but like many of his other top priorities, the arithmetic of the US Senate has stymied his efforts to get the most ambitious of his plans passed into law.

Report: Hunter Biden’s Secret Service detail shelling out thousands for Malibu mansion

10:29 , Andrew Naughtie

As the Justice Department’s investigation into Hunter Biden’s business dealings and tax affairs heats up, ABC News reports that the Secret Service detail protecting the president’s son has spent more than $30,000 a month to rent a mansion in Malibu, California.

According to the story – which recalls various reports of Trump-owned businesses charging high rates to the agents assigned to protect the former president – the business of protecting presidents and their families is necessarily an expensive one, with agents obliged to rent housing near their protectees wherever they may be living or staying.

“Typically, wherever a protectee sets up their residence, the Secret Service is forced to find someplace to rent nearby at market value,” said [retired senior Secret Service agent Don Mihalek], noting that the agency is also renting out properties to protect President Joe Biden’s residences in Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. “This isn’t new,” Mihalek said. “The Service has had to do this in past administrations, and unfortunately, the housing market right now has driven the prices up substantially.” A White House official referred ABC News to the Secret Service for comment. Asked about the cost of the protection, a representative for the Secret Service said only: “Due to the need to maintain operational security, the U.S. Secret Service does not comment on the means, methods, or resources used to conduct our protective operations.”

Joe Biden’s performance on the economy has become one of his opponents’ main targets, but while the problems facing millions of everyday Americans are undeniable, the reality of what has changed in the past year hasn’t always cut through the news cycle.

And some of the coverage of the recent jobs numbers – which showed a continued uptick in employment – has been particularly downbeat. It’s now starting to get some pushback.

Watch: Lindsey Graham threatens Democrats over future Supreme Court nominations

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham spent Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination hearings in a foul mood, and he showed the same irascibility at the committee vote on her nomination yesterday.

Among his various recriminations, most of which had little if anything to do with the judge herself, was an implicit threat to block almost by default any nominee put forward by Democratic president if and when Republicans control the Senate.

This is what Lisa Murkowski worried about in her endorsement of the judge before her full Senate vote. “We are to that point where it’s almost automatic: If it is a president who is not of my party puts forth a nominee, I am somehow obligated to just barely even give consideration, not just before the name is named,” she said.

“This is an awful process, it’s just awful.”

ICYMI | White House condemns ‘hateful’ anti-LGBT+ bills

06:44 , Alisha Rahaman Sarkar

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday said the “Don’t Say Gay” law reflects “misinformed, hateful policies that do absolutely nothing to address the real issues”.

Ms Psaki responded to a series of questions from Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy, who asked whether Joe Biden’s administration believes it is “fair” that “biological males are competing against women” in university sports, and “at what age does the White House think that students should be taught about sexual orientation or gender identity”.

“Parents across the country are looking to national, state and district leaders to support our nation’s students, to ensure that kids are treated equally in schools, and this is not a reflection of that,” she said.

White House says Russian atrocities part of Putin’s ‘plan’ for Ukraine

05:30 , Oliver O'Connell

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday said the atrocities committed by Russian forces in Bucha, Ukraine and other parts of the country part of a deliberate plan to inflict terror on civilians.

Earlier on Monday, President Joe Biden said revelations of Russian attacks on civilians, including execution-style killings of bound captives, justifies his earlier decision to refer to Russian president Vladimir Putin as a “war criminal”.

“The truth of the matter – we saw it happen in Bucha – this warrants him – he is a war criminal,” said Mr Biden, who added that the Russian dictator “should be held accountable”.

The confirmation vote came weeks after memnbers of the committee aggressively questioned Ms Jackson.

White House statement on bipartisan Covid-19 funding proposal

Monday 4 April 2022 23:30 , Oliver O'Connell

We are grateful for the Senate’s work on a bipartisan plan to help meet some of the country’s COVID-19 response needs. The Administration requested $22.5 billion to continue to provide critical protections like vaccines, boosters, treatments, and tests to people here at home and for help putting shots in arms around the world. Every dollar we requested is essential and we will continue to work with Congress to get all of the funding we need. But time is of the essence. We urge Congress to move promptly on this $10 billion package because it can begin to fund the most immediate needs, as we currently run the risk of not having some critical tools like treatments and tests starting in May and June. We will continue to work with Congress to fund our remaining domestic needs and will work with Senators Schumer and Romney – and others -- to build bipartisan support for a package to fund our global COVID-19 response. We must continue our work to vaccinate the world both because it is the right thing to do, and also, because as it is critical to reducing the risk of new variants, which in turn is critical to the safety of the American people.

US describes ‘litany of atrocities’ in Ukraine as Biden says Putin should face war crimes charges

The Biden administration made a clear effort to dial up the rhetoric against Vladimir Putin and Russia on Monday with stern condemnations of reported massacres of civilians in Ukraine and promises for more action against Russia.

After horrifying images of what appeared to be civilians who had been executed with their hands tied were shared in western media outlets over the weekend, the US State Department called the reports of massacres committed by Russian troops “credible” and suggested directly that they were the result of deliberate, ordered actions that Russian military forces were carrying out.

New study shows how Covid has hit poor Americans harder

Monday 4 April 2022 16:50 , Andrew Naughtie

As the Biden administration tries to get Congress to allocate billions of dollars of new funds for Covid-19 relief, a new study from the Poor People’s Campaign has detailed what it calls the “immoral, shocking and unjust” neglect of poor communities during the pandemic, reporting that Americans living in poorer counties died of Covid-19 at almost twice the rate of those in rich counties.

The study, based on income and death data from over 3,200 US counties, shows an even bigger gap during the Delta variant that made up the US’s fourth coronavirus wave, when people living in the lowest income counties died at five times the rate of those in the highest income counties. The 300 counties with the highest death rates have an average poverty rate of 45 per cent, and household median incomes on average $23,000 lower than counties with lower rates. Many of the top twenty counties were sparsely populated areas in Georgia, Texas and Virginia, the report and an accompanying map of death rates and income online show.
