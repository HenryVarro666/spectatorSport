Editor’s Note: This story was updated at 12:10 p.m. on Feb. 27 to include new information about the unfolding war in Ukraine and the announcement that the U.S. will send additional aid.

Russia’s advance in Ukraine had slowed to a stop outside Kyiv in the face of logistics and fuel shortages while Ukraine had used “creative” solutions to defend their country, a senior defense official told journalists early Feb. 27, including reportedly using a drone to destroy a Russian mechanized column. Still, heavy fighting continued in the second city of Kharkiv; Russian naval assets positioned near Odessa; and a “siege” approach had begun on the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, raising the prospect of more civilian deaths, the Defense Department reported.

“The Ukrainians are putting up a very stiff, and brave, and heroic resistance,” the defense official said. “The Russians have been frustrated; they have been slowed; they have been stymied; and they have been resisted by the Ukrainians. And to some degree, they have done it to themselves in terms of their fuel and logistics and sustainment problems.”

Nonetheless, the official said DOD expects that Russia will adapt and overcome the setbacks.

“They have a significant amount of combined arms capability still at their beck and call,” the official added.

The developments come as Ukraine agreed to talks with Russia without conditions at the Belarus border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly spoke to Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, who guaranteed the security of a Ukrainian delegation.

The reports come as western partners continue to flow defense assistance to Ukraine.

President Joe Biden authorized another $350 million in defense assistance Feb. 25 with convoys of military assistance from the U.S. and other partners flowing uninhibited into Ukraine, DOD reported. The additional defense assistance authorization will include anti-armor, small arms, munitions, body armor, and related equipment. U.S. defense assistance to Ukraine in the last year now totals $1 billion.

DOD assessed that Russian forces remain 30 kilometers north of Kyiv.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces claimed as of Feb. 27 to have destroyed 146 Russian tanks, 27 airplanes, 26 helicopters, 706 armored combat vehicles, 49 artillery pieces, and an anti-missile aircraft system; and counted 4,300 Russian soldiers dead and nearly 200 taken as prisoner. The downed aircraft reportedly included in the prior day three Su-30 aircraft, two Su-25 aircraft, and two IL-76MD aircraft.

Ukraine reported 210 Ukrainian deaths and 1,100 wounded with no distinction between military and civilian, according to information provided by a Ukrainian defense official to Air Force Magazine.

DOD now reports the Russian siege on Chernihiv has included rocket fire into the city, increasing the likelihood of destroying civilian infrastructure and deaths of civilians.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry reports that it is documenting Russian war crimes to include attacks on two civilian vessels in the Black Sea approaching Ukraine, shelling that hit kindergarten classrooms and orphanages, firing on ambulance crews in Zaporizhia and Kyiv, hospitals under fire, and heightened radiation levels from the Chernobyl exclusion zone after the Russian military took control of the nuclear power plant, holding 92 hostages.

“We are collecting these and other materials, which we will immediately transfer to The Hague,” read a statement from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry.

The Russian Ministry of Defense’s website has been down since at least the second day of the invasion.

Despite a stalled advance on the capital of Kyiv, the Defense Department said Feb. 27 Russia had committed inside Ukraine about two-thirds of the forces it had amassed. Initial estimates said Russia had prepared up to 190,000 troops for the invasion.

Russia also has made new amphibious landings potentially involving thousands of naval infantry from the Sea of Azov; and is now moving forces from Crimea northeast toward the city of Mariupol, near the disputed Donbas region, where Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded with a force that he called “peacekeepers” Feb. 21.

Air Space Still Contested

Initial strikes targeted airfields where Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29s, Su-27s, and L-39s operated, and where S-300 long-range surface-to-air missile systems are based, reported Aviation Week, citing the Ukraine Ministry of Defense. DOD now counts more than 320 ballistic and cruise missile strikes on Ukrainian territory, but said that Ukrainian air defense systems remain operational.

“Air space is still contested,” the official said, noting Russia has not achieved air superiority. Ukrainian air missile defense systems are still working, and Ukraine has aircraft in the air, though they have been degraded by strikes.

Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, defense minister Oleksii Reznikov, on Feb. 24, promising continued U.S. support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and defense assistance.

Zelensky in an early Feb. 25 statement praised sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European allies against Russia, but he said the sanctions were not stopping the Russian onslaught in his country, calling for more defense assistance and stiffer sanctions, to include removing Russia from the international banking system SWIFT. As of Feb. 26, reports indicated that President Biden was seriously weighing the measure.

Following a Feb. 25 call with Biden, Zelensky applauded U.S. support in a tweet. White House press secretary Jen Psaki then announced new sanctions on Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.",https://www.airforcemag.com/pentagon-ukraine-resists-russian-momentum-slows-but-kyiv-siege-continues/

Overnight, Russian forces launched rockets at the city, foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted: “Horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv. Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany.”

Speaking to CNN early Friday, former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said he and the forces with him in central Kyiv had just been warned of another missile attack, one of many air-raid warnings that were ringing out across the country.

“He’s just simply mad, he’s just simply crazy….to come here and kill Ukrainians,” Poroshenko said.

The latest reports from Ukraine come just before NATO is to hold an emergency virtual summit of its member heads of state and government, including President Joe Biden.

“Every inch of NATO territory will be defended,” U.S. permanent ambassador to NATO Julie Smith said on CNN ahead of the meeting.

On Friday, Kremlin officials also officially responded to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s offer to negotiate a “neutral” Ukraine, saying they would be open to talks, CNN’s Matthew Chance reported, reading the statement from the Kremlin live on TV.

""Following Zelenskyy’s proposal to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin can send representatives of the [Russian] Ministry of Defense, the Foreign Ministry, and his administration to negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation,"" CNN reported, citing the a readout posted to Russian state media RIA Novosti.

China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that President Xi Jinping talked with Putin Friday and supported the idea that the Russian leader should negotiate with Ukrainian officials.

“We’re ready for negotiations at any moment as soon as the armed forces of Ukraine respond to our proposal, stop resisting, lay down their weapons,” Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Friday, according to Turkey news agency Anadolu.

The Ukrainian defense ministry said that more than 1,000 Russian troops had been killed in the fighting.

“Today the number of losses from the occupying forces of the Russian Federation is more than one thousand,” the ministry tweeted. “Russia has not suffered such a large number of casualties during this period of hostilities in the entire period of its existence in any of the armed conflicts it has started.”

Poroshenko told CNN that 133 Ukrainian troops had been killed.

Russian casualty reports remain unverified, but information coming out of Ukraine initially suggested Ukrainian forces were delivering a more aggressive defense of Ukraine than Russia may have anticipated.

A senior defense official at the Pentagon said Thursday that the multi-front advance on Kyiv is intent on “decapitating” Ukraine’s government.

Ukraine “needs the support of partners more than ever. We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation. Sanctions must be further strengthened,” Zelenskyy tweeted, adding that there was heavy fighting “at the entrances to Chernihiv, Hostomel and Melitopol.” Cherniviv is just north of Kyiv, Hostomel is west of the capital city.

""It's our assessment that [Russian forces] have every intention of basically, decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance, which would explain these early moves towards Kyiv,"" the official said.

Ukraine was already promoting a remarkable audio recording allegedly capturing the heroism of 13 Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island off the country’s southern tip, in the Black Sea. As a Russian warship ordered the soldiers to surrender or face bombardment, a Ukrainian soldier radioed back: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.”

Kuleba also said Russia had attacked a kindergarten.

“Today’s Russian attacks on a kindergarten and an orphanage are war crimes and violations of the Rome Statute,” the foreign minister said. “Together with the General Prosecutor’s Office we are collecting this and other facts, which we will immediately send to the Hague. Responsibility is inevitable.”

Zelenskyy and Poroshenko on Friday urged NATO to send in its response force and impose further sanctions on Russian interests, including blocking Russia from the SWIFT banking messaging system that allows quick financial transactions across borders and is used to facilitate transactions of goods and services in Russia.

President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday that adding SWIFT to the sanctions would not be effective. The United States does not control the network, which is owned by U.S. and European banks and carries 40 million messages daily, according to the BBC. European governments have hesitated to expel Russian banks, a step many believe could hurt the wider international banking system.

Beyond Ukraine, Russia and Western governments continue to spar via non-military punitive measures. On Friday, Moscow banned British aircraft from flying through Russian airspace, as retaliation for the UK’s ban on Aeroflot, Sky News reported.",https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2022/02/kyiv-under-siege-russian-forces-move-ukrainian-capital/362434/

Thousands of Russian naval infantry have joined with other Russian ground forces and are about 30 miles to the southwest of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, U.S. defense officials said on Sunday.

The amphibious forces came from a Friday landing into Ukraine, through the Sea of Azov, and have advanced 12 miles east toward Mariupol, the senior defense official told reporters on Sunday.

“Our assessment is that Mariupol is defended and the Ukrainians will put up a resistance there,” a defense official said.

On Saturday, USNI News contributor H I Sutton published satellite photos showing a patrol boat, Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship RTS Moskva (121) and a Russian surveillance ship were operating near Zmiinyi Island.

Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters the Department of Defense did not have “perfect visibility” on the assault and could not provide exact numbers for how many troops Russian put ashore through landing ships.

The amphibious assault is a piece of the Russian plan to cut off the Donbas region and continue to target population centers, Kirby said.

The Russian navy largely played a supporting role in the Ukrainian invasion, which Russia began early Thursday morning, USNI News previously reported.

The amphibious assault comes from one of two amphibious task forces Moscow assembled for its attack on the neighboring country. Another task force was believed to be in Crimea and could land troops in the Black Sea port of Odesa.

On Sunday, Pentagon officials said Russian naval forces were beginning to assemble to the south of Odesa in the Black Sea but did not have indications of the intent of the forces.

“We do see some [naval] posturing in the Black Sea, south of Odesa. That is a little concerning, but it’s difficult right now to understand what that means,” the official said.

Moscow has a force of more than 10 amphibious ships, USNI News reported. The Kremlin has moved six amphibious landing ships into the Black Sea over the last month to join landing ships that were already part of the Black Sea fleet.

These include three Ropucha-class tank landing ships, which are capable of landing 10 main battle tanks and 350 troops ashore. The larger Ivan Gren-class, also in the Black Sea, can move 13 main battle tanks and 300 troops while also fielding two attack helicopters.

On Saturday, a senior defense official said the landing near Mariupol used a little less than half of the Russian tank landing ships in the Black Sea.

“Our assessment was that they used four of their landing ships to conduct this assault. We don’t know how much naval infantry was on each one, we just don’t have a perfect count,” the official said.

“But this would involve several thousand naval infantry troops.”

Meanwhile, two commercial vessels, off of the port in Odesa, were hit by Russian fire, according to Naval News. The Namura Queen, flying under the flag of Panama, took a missile to her stern.

Bunker Millenium Spirit, flying under the flag of Moldova, was also hit causing a fire, according to Naval News. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence attributes the missile to Russia, while the Moldovan government said the source is unknown.

U.S. agribusiness giant Cargill confirmed that one of its chartered grain-carrying ships had been attacked in the Black Sea.

On Sunday, Pentagon officials confirmed the Russian Navy was targeting cargo ships in the Black Sea.

Russia also amassed 16 ships near Syria, USNI News reported.

Russian troops have been largely advancing along three lines, the senior defense official said, which remains true as of Sunday morning.

Forces are moving south to north to south, going from Crimea to the Ukrainian city of Kherson. Forces are now going both northwest and northeast from the south, the defense official said, which includes splitting some forces toward Mariupol.

Russia also moved troops from Belarus toward the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and toward Kharkiv, Ukraine. It is likely that Russia expected its troops to move into Kyiv quicker but has met unexpected resistance, the senior defense official said.

In the city of Chernihiv, about 90 miles outside of Kyiv, Pentagon officials say that Russian troops have taken up a siege posture as of Sunday morning and fired rockets into the city.

“They’re making a move on Kyiv from northwest of Kyiv, as well as from northeast of Kyiv,” a defense official said.

“On that northeast vector down towards Kyiv, they’ve had trouble around Chernihiv. And it appears that they are adopting a siege mentality, which any student of military tactics or strategy in history will tell you when you adopt siege tactics, it increases the likelihood of, of collateral damage to civilian infrastructure as well as to civilian life.”

The continued slowed movement might explain the Russian amphibious assault, as former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Adm. James Stavridis told USNI News on Thursday that amphibious landings become an option when the ground offensive is slowed.

“The Russian Black Sea fleet is essentially a holding force directed against the Ukrainian military south of Ukraine. Assuming Putin’s ground offensives don’t bog down – which will depend on the quality of Ukrainian resistance – they will probably limit their participation to surface-to-surface missile strikes,” Stavridis previously told USNI News.

Ukraine previously said that its troops would fight for the country. That was demonstrated in an incident on Snake Island, the senior official said.

A Russian warship opened fire on 13 border guards on Snake Island after telling them to surrender, according to The Washington Post. The border guards refused, telling the Russian warship to, “go fuck yourself.”

All 13 border guards were killed, according to Post reporting.

During the press conference, the senior official said the Snake Island incident demonstrated Ukrainian resistance.

“From our perspective, it’s both gut-wrenching and inspiring,” he said. “And certainly reflective of what we have seen in the last 24 hours, which is Ukrainians being willing to fight for their country, and do so bravely.”",https://news.usni.org/2022/02/25/russian-navy-launches-amphibious-assault-on-ukraine

Kyiv

Russian forces entered the outskirts of Kyiv on Friday and were threatening the Ukrainian capital from the north-west and east in a lightning attack apparently aimed at seizing the city.

Late on Friday witnesses reported hearing artillery rounds and intense gunfire from the western part of Kyiv, as president Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned his citizens: “This night will be the hardest... We must withstand. The night will be very hard, but sunset will come.”

He added: “We can’t lose the capital.”

The defence ministry in Moscow claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west after a day of fighting, although Western sources said they did not believe the airport was usable.

A jittery mood also contributed to confusion: what were thought to be a Russian tank were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning – although one expert said it was probably a Ukranian Strela-10 air defence system.

Nevertheless such was the nervousness, Kyiv authorities earlier warned locals in Obolonskyi to stay off the streets because “active hostilities” were approaching . Residents were urged to “make molotov cocktails”. The defence ministry also said it had distributed 18,000 assault rifles in the capital.

Gunfire could be also heard close to St Sophia Cathedral, reporters said, creating an increasingly tense atmosphere in the capital, which many expected would have been better defended given its obvious strategic significance.

Intense gunfire broke out on a bridge across the Dnieper River dividing eastern and western Kyiv, with about 200 Ukrainian forces taking defensive positions and sheltering behind their armoured vehicles and under the bridge. Another key bridge leading to the capital was blown away, with smoke rising from it.

Konrad Muzyka, the president of Rochan Consulting, said the “situation does look dire at the moment” particularly regarding Kyiv. “It appears that the main goal is to take Kyiv, break the C2 [command and control], and ‘decapitate’ the political leadership.”

Russian forces have been trying to advance through the north-western suburbs around Vorzel, Buch and Irpen. In the early afternoon, Russia claimed it had control of the capital from the west.

During the fighting, Ukrainian officials claimed that a kindergarten in Vorzel where 50 children were sheltering was hit by Russian fire, although without inflicting any casualties.

Ukraine’s military also warned that a group of Russian spies and saboteurs was seen in a district about 3 miles (5km) north of the city centre. Video posted online by an interior ministry adviser apparently showed dead Russian saboteurs who had captured Ukrainian military vehicles and switched uniforms.

Windows were blasted out of a 10-storey apartment block near Kyiv’s main airport, where a 2-metre crater filled with rubble showed where a shell had struck before dawn. A police officer said people were injured there but not killed.

Approach to Kyiv

Pressure was also intensifying around Chernihiv, about 90 miles north-east of Kyiv, Ukraine’s military said. Russian forces are trying to bypass the city, where there had been fighting, and head down the E95 road to Kozelec and ultimately Kyiv’s eastern suburbs.

Farther east, about 125 miles from the capital, Ukraine’s military admitted on Friday morning that the city of Konotop had been lost to Russian forces. Boryspil, the capital’s main civilian airport, lies to the east of the capital.

The speed of the Russian advance, despite the best efforts of Ukraine’s military, caught many by surprise as Russian military forces converged on Kyiv from the north, east and west. But British defence intelligence said it believed the majority of Russian forces aiming for Kyiv were over 50km away.

Mariupol and the Donbas

The US department of defence said that Russia had launched an amphibious landing with thousands of naval infantry to the west of the key southern coastal city of Mariupol.

“It certainly appears to us to be a piece of their designs in the south to further cut off the Donbas region and to – from a southern perspective – continue to try to take population centres,” said John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary.

Kirby said that the US did not have “perfect visibility” on the attack, but video posted on social media earlier appeared to show a column of Russian armoured vehicles, including T-72B3 tanks and BMP-3 armoured vehicles, moving through the coastal town of Prymorsk which is located between Melitopol and Mariupol.

Describing the “amphibious assault” under way from the Sea of Azov a senior US defence official told reporters that Russians are “putting potentially thousands of naval infantry ashore there … The general assumption is they are going to move towards the north-east, towards Mariupol and the Donbas region.”

Several social media accounts in the region showed images and accounts of volleys of Russian Grad missiles hitting targets near Mariupol late on Friday afternoon.

The aim of the landing would appear to be to allow Russian marines to link up with forces farther east in the Donbas region, where Ukraine’s forces were believed to be holding firm.

Video circulated showing large numbers of what appeared to be Russian Spetsnaz special forces massing outside a Ukrainian SBU intelligence building in Melitopol.

Fighting was reported to be continuing around Kherson on the Dnieper River.

Rest of the country

In Sumy, the main city in the eastern Sumy region, 125 miles from the Russian border, Russian forces were in control of the city, with residents saying that armour was visible patrolling in the streets.

South-east of Sumy the city of Kharkiv, which has a population of more than 1 million, is gradually being surrounded. There were reports of artillery fire and shelling in and around the city.

A resident in the southern Black Sea port of Odesa said that while there had been Russian strikes in the south of the city the north remained calm. It appears not to be an early target.

Casualties

Ukraine said that it had killed 1,000 Russian soldiers on Friday alone – and eliminated up to 80 tanks, 7 helicopters and 10 planes. Moscow has given no casualty count. UN officials reported 25 civilian deaths, mostly from shelling and airstrikes, and said that 100,000 people were believed to have left their homes.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia pressed its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in an attack that could rewrite the global post-Cold War security order.

Explosions sounded before dawn in Kyiv as Western leaders scheduled an emergency meeting and Ukraine’s president pleaded for international help. The nature of the explosions was not immediately clear, but the blasts came amid signs that the capital and largest Ukrainian city was increasingly threatened following a day of fighting that left more than 100 Ukrainians dead.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the government had information that “subversive groups” were encroaching on the city, and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Kyiv “could well be under siege” in what U.S. officials believe is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told lawmakers on a phone call Thursday evening that Russian mechanized forces that entered from Belarus were about 20 miles from Kyiv, according to a person familiar with the call.

The assault, anticipated for weeks by the U.S. and Western allies and undertaken by Putin in the face of international condemnation and cascading sanctions, amounts to the largest ground war in Europe since World War II.

Russian missiles bombarded cities and military bases in the first day of the attack, and Ukraine officials said they had lost control of the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant, scene of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. Civilians piled into trains and cars to flee and patrons of a hotel were directed into a shelter as explosions sounded in Kyiv.

“Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself and won’t give up its freedom,” Zelenskyy tweeted. His grasp on power increasingly tenuous, he called Thursday for even more severe sanctions than the ones imposed by Western allies and ordered a full military mobilization that would last 90 days.

Zelenskyy said in a video address that 137 “heroes,” including 10 military officers, had been killed and 316 people wounded. The dead included border guards on the Zmiinyi Island in the Odesa region, which was taken over by Russians.

He concluded an emotional speech by saying that “the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.” He also said the country had heard from Moscow that ”they want to talk about Ukraine’s neutral status.”

Biden was to meet Friday morning with fellow leaders of NATO governments in what the White House described as an “extraordinary virtual summit” to disuss Ukraine.

U.S. President Joe Biden announced new sanctions against Russia, saying Putin “chose this war” and had exhibited a “sinister” view of the world in which nations take what they want by force. Other nations also announced sanctions, or said they would shortly.

“It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary — by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause,” Biden said.

Blinken said in television interviews that he was convinced that Russia was intent on overthrowing the Ukrainian government, telling CBS that Putin wants to “reconstitute the Soviet empire” and that Kyiv was already “under threat, and it could well be under siege.”

Fearing a Russian attack on the capital city, thousands of people went deep underground as night fell, jamming Kyiv’s subway stations.

At times it felt almost cheerful. Families ate dinner. Children played. Adults chatted. People brought sleeping bags or dogs or crossword puzzles — anything to alleviate the waiting and the long night ahead.

But the exhaustion was clear on many faces. And the worries.

“Nobody believed that this war would start and that they would take Kyiv directly,” said Anton Mironov, waiting out the night in one of the old Soviet metro stations. “I feel mostly fatigue. None of it feels real.”

The invasion began early Thursday with a series of missile strikes, many on key government and military installations, quickly followed by a three-pronged ground assault. Ukrainian and U.S. officials said Russian forces were attacking from the east toward Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city; from the southern region of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014; and from Belarus to the north.

Zelenskyy, who had earlier cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law, appealed to global leaders, saying that “if you don’t help us now, if you fail to offer a powerful assistance to Ukraine, tomorrow the war will knock on your door.”

Though Biden said he had no plans to speak with Putin, the Russian leader did have what the Kremlin described as a “serious and frank exchange” with French President Emmanuel Macron.

Both sides claimed to have destroyed some of the other’s aircraft and military hardware, though little of that could be confirmed.

Hours after the invasion began, Russian forces seized control of the now-unused Chernobyl plant and its surrounding exclusion zone after a fierce battle, presidential adviser Myhailo Podolyak told The Associated Press.

The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said it was told by Ukraine of the takeover, adding that there had been “no casualties or destruction at the industrial site.”

The 1986 disaster occurred when a nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kyiv exploded, sending a radioactive cloud across Europe. The damaged reactor was later covered by a protective shell to prevent leaks.

Alyona Shevtsova, adviser to the commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, wrote on Facebook that staff members at the Chernobyl plant had been “taken hostage.” The White House said it was “outraged” by reports of the detentions.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense issued an update saying that though the plant was “likely captured,” the country’s forces had halted Russia’s advance toward Chernihiv and that it was unlikely that Russia had achieved its planned Day One military objectives.

The chief of the NATO alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said the “brutal act of war” shattered peace in Europe, joining a chorus of world leaders decrying an attack that could cause massive casualties and topple Ukraine’s democratically elected government. The conflict shook global financial markets: Stocks plunged and oil prices soared amid concerns that heating bills and food prices would skyrocket.

Condemnation came not only from the U.S. and Europe, but from South Korea, Australia and beyond — and many governments readied new sanctions. Even friendly leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orban sought to distance themselves from Putin.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he aimed to cut off Russia from the U.K.’s financial markets as he announced sanctions, freezing the assets of all large Russian banks and planning to bar Russian companies and the Kremlin from raising money on British markets.

“Now we see him for what he is — a bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest,” Johnson said of Putin.

The U.S. sanctions will target Russian banks, oligarchs, state-controlled companies and high-tech sectors, Biden said, but they were designed not to disrupt global energy markets. Russian oil and natural gas exports are vital energy sources for Europe.

Zelenskyy urged the U.S. and West to go further and cut the Russians from the SWIFT system, a key financial network that connects thousands of banks around the world. The White House has been reluctant to immediately cut Russia from SWIFT, worried it could cause enormous economic problems in Europe and elsewhere in the West.

While some nervous Europeans speculated about a possible new world war, the U.S. and its NATO partners have shown no indication they would send troops into Ukraine, fearing a larger conflict. NATO reinforced its members in Eastern Europe as a precaution, and Biden said the U.S. was deploying additional forces to Germany to bolster NATO.

European authorities declared the country’s airspace an active conflict zone.

After weeks of denying plans to invade, Putin launched the operation on a country the size of Texas that has increasingly tilted toward the democratic West and away from Moscow’s sway. The autocratic leader made clear earlier this week that he sees no reason for Ukraine to exist, raising fears of possible broader conflict in the vast space that the Soviet Union once ruled. Putin denied plans to occupy Ukraine, but his ultimate goals remain hazy.

Ukrainians were urged to shelter in place and not to panic.

“Until the very last moment, I didn’t believe it would happen. I just pushed away these thoughts,” said a terrified Anna Dovnya in Kyiv, watching soldiers and police remove shrapnel from an exploded shell. “We have lost all faith.”

With social media amplifying a torrent of military claims and counter-claims, it was difficult to determine exactly what was happening on the ground.

Russia and Ukraine made competing claims about damage they had inflicted. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had destroyed scores of Ukrainian air bases, military facilities and drones. It confirmed the loss of one of its Su-25 attack jets, blaming “pilot error,” and said an An-26 transport plane had crashed because of technical failure, killing the entire crew. It did not say how many were aboard.

Russia said it was not targeting cities, but journalists saw destruction in many civilian areas.

But he said Russia was ""behind its hoped-for timetable"" in the military action against its neighbour.

""In fact it's behind its hoped-for timetable. They've lost over 450 personnel.

""One of the significant airports they were trying to capture with their elite spetsnaz [special forces] has failed to be taken and, in fact, the Ukrainians have taken it back.

""So I think, contrary to great Russian claims and indeed President Putin's vision that somehow the Ukrainians would be liberated and would be flocking to his cause, he's got that completely wrong.

""And the Russian army has failed to deliver on day one its main objective.""

Later, in a intelligence update posted to its Twitter account on Friday afternoon, the Ministry of Defence said that fighting ""continues in key locations"".

""Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities,"" the MoD said.

In a further update, the MoD said that Russian forces had opened up a new route of advance towards Ukrainian capital Kyiv, having failed to capture Chernihiv, a city 150km to the north west.

""The bulk of Russian forces advancing on Kyiv remain more than 50km from the centre of the city,"" the MoD added.

""There are reports of sporadic clashes in the northern suburbs of Kyiv, which we continue to monitor.""

PM to speak with NATO leaders

Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday hit Russia with what he described as the ""largest set of sanctions ever imposed anywhere by the UK government"", after the attack on Ukraine.

He spoke with leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force today - made up of the UK, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway - and will also join a virtual meeting of NATO leaders at 2pm.

On Friday morning, Mr Johnson spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

""President Zelenskyy updated the PM on the most recent Russian military advances, including missile and artillery strikes on Ukrainian cities and the terrible developments in Kyiv in the early hours of this morning,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said.

""The PM assured President Zelenskyy that the world is united in its horror at what Putin his doing.

""He paid tribute to the bravery and heroism of the Ukrainian people in standing up to Russia's campaign of violence, and expressed his deep condolences for those who have been killed.""

Posting on Twitter after his call with Mr Johnson, Mr Zelenskyy said his country needed ""the support of partners more than ever"".

""We demand effective counteraction to the Russian Federation,"" he added. ""Sanctions must be further strengthened.""

Downing Street said the PM was expected to raise the prospect of banning Russia from the Swift international payment system in the meeting with NATO allies, amid reports of a reluctance among some European nations to take such action.

Number 10 said ""nothing is off the table"" in support of Ukraine.

Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would be ready to hold talks with Kyiv but only once Ukraine's military had laid down its arms.

He also said the Kremlin did not want ""neo-Nazis"" to govern Ukraine.

The Belarusian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office on Friday afternoon, a day after the Russian ambassador was handed a dressing-down by Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.

Belarus is an ally of Russia and the two countries recently conducted joint military drills ahead of the invasion of Ukraine.

Russian troops entered north Ukraine on Thursday from across the Belarus border.

After the summons, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said: ""The UK condemns the role Belarus is playing in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""Belarus must stop supporting Russia's illegal and unprovoked actions. We must be united against Russian aggression.""

Mr Cleverly told the ambassador that UK sanctions on Russia would also apply to Belarusian individuals, entities and organisations who have aided and abetted the invasion of Ukraine.

Minister pushes back at calls for no-fly zone over Ukraine

Appearing in the House of Commons on Friday, armed forces minister James Heappey pushed back at calls from MPs for a no-fly zone to be enforced over Ukraine.

He warned that it could trigger a wider conflict between NATO countries and Russia under the alliance's Article 5 mutual defence clause.

""We need to have our eyes wide open to the reality that in such an event, NATO jets would not possibly but would most certainly probably come into a combat situation with Russian jets,"" Mr Heappey told MPs.

""And the risk of miscalculation and escalation and the triggering of Article 5 could not be understated in those circumstances.""

Mr Heappey said, for operational reasons, he could not specify exactly what extra military support the UK would supply to Ukraine.

But he reassured MPs the government wanted to see ""as much British kit in hands of Ukrainians as we can manage"".

The minister said military officers had been instructed to ""look across the full UK inventory for everything we have right now and look at what might be usable in the circumstances"".

Mr Heappey said anti-tank missiles had ""already proven to be invaluable"" in the conflict in Ukraine, with unsubstantiated reports they had ""been used to defeat Russian armour"".

He also told MPs that a total of 1,000 UK troops are on stand-by to support Ukraine's neighbours with a likely influx of refugees.

Putin compared to Hitler

Russia's aggression against Ukraine came despite a recent flurry of diplomatic activity to try and persuade Mr Putin to withdraw his forces from Ukraine's borders.

But, speaking to Sky News, Mr Wallace dismissed the suggestion that Western nations had failed in their efforts to avert a conflict.

The defence secretary used a newspaper interview earlier this month to suggest there was a ""whiff of Munich"" about the Ukraine crisis.

Explaining those comments, he said: ""It wasn't the bit about appeasement I was referring to, I was referring that in Munich in 1938, Adolf Hitler all along had a plan to invade parts of Europe.

""And all the diplomacy was about a straw man attempt by him to buy time. Putin has been set on this for many, many months and certainly over a year.

""It doesn't matter how much effort we made, and we all made unbelievable efforts... it didn't matter.""

Mr Wallace accused Moscow of acting on a ""greed to subsume Ukraine into the Russian Federation, or indeed for President Putin to land-grab"".

Mr Wallace said that Mr Putin had ""clearly broken international law"" with his actions over Ukraine.

""He's occupying or trying to occupy a sovereign country who made one mistake in his eyes,"" he said.

""Their mistake in his eyes was not to choose the Kremlin as a way for their future. And that's all they have done.""

Mr Wallace, who was this week overheard claiming Mr Putin had gone ""full tonto"" over Ukraine, added: ""Putin didn't need to do this, he didn't need to occupy - which he's doing right now - a sovereign country.

""None of it stacked up, none of the reasons why he would do it stacked up.

""A few of us felt that - and I made a few comments the other day about President Putin - he's not doing something that's logical.

""He's doing something that is about his ego and his legacy.""

In another broadcast interview, Mr Wallace suggested Mr Putin could turn his aim on the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia after Ukraine.

""He won't stop... He will use everything in the Baltic states. He doesn't believe the Baltic states are really countries,"" the defence secretary told BBC Radio 4.

Labour calls for government to 'go further' on sanctions

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted the government to ""go even further"" than the latest package of sanctions.

""In the past we have not been strong enough in response to Putin,"" Sir Keir told Sky News.

""That has given him the idea that the benefits of his aggression outweigh the costs.

""We cannot allow that to happen again. The package we put in now must be enough not just to isolate Russia but to cripple its ability to function.""",https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-crisis-russia-has-failed-to-take-any-of-its-major-objectives-and-has-lost-450-personnel-defence-secretary-ben-wallace-says-12550928
