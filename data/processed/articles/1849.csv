Ukraine: Russian shelling hits evacuation convoy, one dead

One person was killed and four wounded when Russian forces shelled an evacuation convoy out of the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, Ukrainian Human Rights Commissioner Lyudmyla Denisova said.

Denisova said that there were ""civilian volunteers"" on the buses.

Denisova said Russian forces were ""denying any chance of evacuating peaceful citizens from besieged Chernihiv, essentially holding tens of thousands of people hostage without food, water or heat.""

Russia had previously announced it would draw down military activities around Chernihiv.

Pentagon: Ukraine stopped Russian convoy near Kyiv 'pretty quickly'

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby it was not clear if Russia's convoy of military vehicles to Kyiv, ""even exists"" anymore after failing to accomplish its mission.

The stalled convoy, which had once stretched some 40 miles (64 kilometers), became a symbol of Russia's battlefield difficulties and had been reportedly attacked several times by Ukrainian forces during the first weeks of the more than monthlong war.

""I don't even know if it still exists at this point... They never really accomplished their mission,"" Kirby told reporters, responding to a question about whether the Pentagon had any updates about the convoy.

""They never really accomplished their mission. They never really provided any supply of any value to Russian forces assembling around Kyiv,"" he added.

""The Ukrainians put a stop to that convoy pretty quickly.""

UN nuclear watchdog says Russian forces have left Chernobyl

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it has been informed by Ukraine that Russian forces have ""in writing, transferred control"" of the Chernobyl nuclear plant to Ukrainian authorities.

Energoatom, Ukraine's nuclear operator company, earlier reported that most of the Russian forces that were occupying the Chernobyl nuclear power station had left.

Energoatom said only a ""small number"" of Russian troops remained, but the majority were heading toward Belarus.

""The information is confirmed that the occupiers, who seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and other facilities in the exclusion zone, have set off in two columns toward the Ukrainian border with the Republic of Belarus,"" it said in a statement.

Russian troops were exposed to ""significant doses"" of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site around the now-closed Chernobyl plant, Energoatom said.

The troops ""panicked at the first sign of illness,"" which ""showed up very quickly,"" and began preparing to leave, the operator added.

The IAEA said it could not confirm that Russian forces had received high doses of radiation.

Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the US continues ""to see indications"" that Russian troops were departing from Chernobyl.

""But we don't see any indication that they're going be sent home,"" he told reporters.

Kirby said the troops' departure was ""not necessarily because of a health hazard or emergency at Chernobyl,"" but rather for repositioning to be ""resupplied and used elsewhere in Ukraine.""

Germany says sent over €80 million worth of weapons to Ukraine

German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said Germany has delivered more than €80 million ($88.62 million) worth of weapons to Ukraine so far, ""and more are to follow.""

Berlin has come under fire over what critics say is not enough military aid to Kyiv, as compared to, for instance, Washington.

Earlier this month, the White House said US President Joe Biden was sending an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine.

According to the White House, the figure brings the total US security assistance to Kyiv to $1 billion in one week — and a total of $2 billion since Biden took office in early 2021.

Ukraine says Russian forces killed 148 children

Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Russian forces have killed 148 children during shelling and airstrikes.

According to the ministry, Russia has fired 1,370 missiles and destroyed 15 Ukrainian airports since the start of the invasion on February 24.

Over 10 million Ukrainians have been displaced by the war, the ministry said.

The figures could not be independently verified.

Biden says Putin 'seems to be self-isolated'

US President Joe Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be self-isolating and may have sacked some of his advisers.

""He seems to be self-isolated and there's some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,"" Biden said. ""But I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time.""

Earlier, US and UK intelligence reports said Putin was being ""misled"" by his advisers about the developments of the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin denied the claim.

UN delivers aid to northern Ukraine, says south inaccessible

Osnat Lubrani, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, says supplies have been delivered for thousands of people in the country's northeast — but some encircled cities in the south of Ukraine remain difficult to reach.

Lubrani said food rations from the UN's partners will benefit nearly 6,000 people in Sumy and areas including Trostianets and Okhtyrka.

According to Lubrani, basic household items, including blankets and kettles from the UN refugee agency, will support 1,500 people. Sanitation kits will also help 6,000 people with hygiene and drinking water, she said.

The UN-facilitated humanitarian notification system with Ukraine and Russia enabled safe passage for the convoy to Sumy on Thursday, ""but this is clearly not enough,"" Lubrani said.

However, efforts to reach Mariupol, Kherson and other southern Ukrainian cities have been unsuccessful over the past month due to safety concerns.

Britain, allies to send more 'lethal aid' to Ukraine

British Defense Minister Ben Wallace said Britain and its allies have agreed to send more military aid to Ukraine.

""There'll be more lethal aid going into Ukraine as a result of today. A number of countries have come forward either with new ideas or indeed more pledges of money,"" Wallace told reporters.

He said the aid for Ukraine would include the provision of air and coastal defense systems, longer-range artillery and counter-battery capabilities, armored vehicles and wider training and logistical support.

The minister's statement came after he hosted over 35 international partners at the second International Defense Donor Conference for Ukraine (IDDCU).

""Today's donor conference demonstrates the international community's determination to support Ukraine in the face of President Putin's illegal and unprovoked invasion by Russian forces,"" Wallace said in a later statement.

Oil prices fall as Biden releases oil reserves

US President Joe Biden has announced the largest-ever release of US emergency oil reserve in a bid to bring down gasoline prices.

Prices have soared in recent weeks over fears of a major supply shortfall in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Following the news about Biden's move, oil prices tumbled. London's Brent crude and New York's WTI managed to pull back slightly in mid-afternoon trading but were both still more than 4% lower at prices well above $100 (€90) a barrel.

Biden said the US will release 1 million barrels of oil a day for the next six months.

""The scale of this release is unprecedented: the world has never had a release of oil reserves at this one million per day rate for this length of time,"" the White House said in a statement. ""This record release will provide a historic amount of supply to serve as bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up.""

US sanctions Russian tech firms

The US Treasury Department announced sanctions against a series of Russian tech firms, including Russia's largest chip maker.

IAEA chief arrives in Russia for talks

The International Atomic Energy Agency said its director, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has arrived in Russia's Baltic Sea exclave of Kaliningrad for talks with senior Russian officials.

The UN nuclear watchdog did not specify whom Grossi would meet on Friday.

Grossi arrived in Russia after visiting a nuclear power plant in Ukraine and held talks with top officials on efforts to ensure the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power plants.

There are 15 active nuclear reactors at four plants in Ukraine. Russia's military controls one of them, Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest nuclear power plant.

Red Cross team prepares for Mariupol evacuation

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its team has assembled in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with medicines, food, water, hygiene items and other essentials.

The team is preparing to take civilians out of the besieged port city of Mariupol.

""We're here because really, we hope to be able to facilitate safe passage for civilians desperately wanting to flee Mariupol,"" said Lucile Marbeau, a staff member with the ICRC team hoping to enter the city.

Russia has said it committed to a cease-fire along the route from Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, and Ukrainian authorities said they were sending 45 buses to collect civilians from the city and provide aid to those who remain.

Julien Lerisson, deputy director of operations for the ICRC, said the organization has high-level agreement for the mission but is focused on making sure ""the order trickles down the chain of command,"" allowing the team to enter and leave Mariupol safely.

Zelenskyy calls on Belgium to send arms to Ukraine

Speaking to Belgian lawmakers, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Belgium to deliver arms to help his people fight Russian troops, especially in Mariupol.

The Ukrainian leader called on Belgium to consider peace more important than trade with Russia.

""I think that peace is much more valuable than diamonds, than agreements with Russia, than Russian ships in the ports, more also than Russian oil and gas, so help us!

Zelenskyy went on to say that the besieged city of Mariupol, in southern Ukraine, remained with thousands of civilians without access to ""anything necessary to survive.""

""Today [Mariupol] is hell on earth... but no one has the determination to stop the disaster,"" Zelenskyy said via video call.

Macron calls for extended cease-fire in Mariupol

French President Emmanuel Macron's office said Russia's hourslong cease-fire on Thursday was not enough time to allow trapped residents to get out of — or aid into — the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

The city has been surrounded by Russian troops since the beginning of March, and its residents have been in dire humanitarian conditions.

On Thursday, the Ukrainian government sent 45 buses to Mariupol to get people out. It's still unclear if the mission was successful.

Putin says gas payments to be made via Russian accounts

Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded that foreign countries open accounts with Gazprombank in order to continue receiving Russian gas.

Putin signed a decree stipulating that foreign buyers must transfer foreign currency to a special Gazprombank account. The bank would then act as intermediary, buying rubles on behalf of the gas buyer to transfer the payment in Russian currency to another special account.

If ""unfriendly"" countries fail to comply with Putin's order, Russian gas supplied would be cut off, he said.

It came day after Germany said Putin had assured Chancellor Olaf Sholz in a phone call that gas payments could still be made in euros.

""De facto, for those who receive Russian gas, who pay for the deliveries, there is in fact no change. They just acquire rubles for the amount in currency which is stipulated in the gas contract,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday.

""Russia remains committed to all its obligations under existing contracts, both in quantity and in price,"" he said, adding that Putin and Scholz had discussed the system in detail a day earlier.

At the time, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin had ordered military investigators to punish those responsible for ordering conscripts into Ukraine, something he insisted had not been ordered despite the defense ministry's contradictory statement.

Russian forces have started to withdraw from the Chernobyl nuclear power site, a senior US defense official said.

Russian forces took control of the facility on February 24, the day Russia started the war in Ukraine.

Russian troops left the nearby town of Slavutych, where much of the personnel of the Chernobyl plant lives, on Monday.

""Chernobyl is (an) area where [Russian forces] are beginning to reposition some of their troops -- leaving, walking away from the Chernobyl facility and moving into Belarus,"" the official said.

""We think that they are leaving, I can't tell you that they're all gone.""

Summary of events in the Russian war in Ukraine on Wednesday

South Ossetian leader Anatoly Bibilov said that the breakaway republic wants to hold a vote on integration into the Russian Federation.

The head of the United Kingdom's eavesdropping agency, GCHQ, said Russia's President Vladimir Putin ""has massively misjudged the situation"" in Ukraine.

Russia promised a temporary cease-fire to let residents of the besieged port of Mariupol flee on Thursday.

Russia's Defense Ministry reiterated its plan to focus forces on securing the separatist republics in the Donbas despite its forces continuing to bombard Kyiv and Chernihiv on Wednesday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that European companies could continue paying for gas in euros. Putin said the money would be paid into Gazprom Bank, which is not a subject of sanctions, and then transferred in rubles to Russia.

President Joe Biden told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy the US would provide $500 million (€448 million) in direct budgetary aid to Ukraine.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says Western nations should tighten sanctions against Moscow until Russian President Vladimir Putin withdraws all his soldiers from Ukraine. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that a peace deal would not ""automatically lead to easing of [sanctions against Russia].""

Russian forces in Ukraine are regrouping and preparing for renewed offensive operations, Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said.

Russian air strikes and heavy shelling have killed civilians in acts that may amount to war crimes, the top United Nations human rights official said on Wednesday.

The US president has ordered the release of one million barrels of oil per day from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve for six months, in a bid to control energy prices that have spiked following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“The bottom line is if we want lower gas prices we need to have more oil supply right now,” Biden said. “This is a moment of consequence and peril for the world, and pain at the pump for American families.”

He also invoked the Defense Production Act to encourage the mining of critical minerals for batteries in electric vehicles as part of a broader push to shift toward cleaner energy sources.

The US president warned the oil industry not “to sit on record profits” during the current price surge, adding that he wanted “to lay a new foundation for true and lasting American energy independence.”

The official added that in recent days members of the Russian parliament discussed the “de-Nazification” of six more countries, including Poland.

Russia’s Gazprombank is the intermediary for rouble gas payments, Putin order says

President Vladimir Putin’s decree says that foreign buyers of Russian gas will have to use special accounts at the country’s Gazprombank to pay for the import of the energy source, the Reuters news agency reports.

A foreign buyer is now obliged to transfer foreign currency to one special, so-called “K”, account, Reuters reported, citing the order. Gazprombank would then buy roubles on behalf of the gas buyer to transfer roubles to another special “K” account.

Gazprombank would then transfer the rouble funds of the foreign gas buyer to Gazprom’s rouble accounts. The bank can open such accounts without the presence of a foreign buyer’s representative, according to Reuters.

OPEC sticks to modest boost in oil despite war jitters

OPEC and allied oil producers, including Russia, have decided to stick to a modest increase in the amount of crude they pump to the world despite Western pressure to step up production as a result of the war in Ukraine.

The group, known as OPEC+, said it would add 432,000 barrels per day in May, as it works to gradually restore production cuts made during the depths of the coronavirus pandemic. That’s slightly up from 400,000 barrels in previous months.

The alliance has been unmoved by pleas from oil-consuming countries to pump more oil as energy prices soar, fueling inflation worldwide. High prices have helped Russia – the world’s largest exporter – offset some of the impacts of Western sanctions.

“Putin has been in withdrawal from the details of day-to-day government in Russia for the last two years, while he’s been worrying about COVID,” Brenton told Al Jazeera.

“So I think the likelihood is that he’s not been fully informed on the Russian military situation,” he added.

The former leader of South Ossetia, a breakaway province in ex-Soviet Georgia, said “hundreds of fighters” have joined Russian forces in Ukraine, complaining they were treated as “cannon fodder”.

“I don’t doubt that the boys who already returned home could go back to the special operation zone and help complete the liberation of Donbas IF THEY FIND IT NECESSARY,” Eduard Kokoity wrote on Telegram on Wednesday.

South Ossetia broke away from Georgia in the 1990s. Its leaders said Georgia’s post-Soviet nationalist government violated the rights of Ossetians to use their language that is distantly related to Farsi.

Russia fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008 and recognised the “independence” of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It now has large military bases there.

He also called for a fifth package of European Union sanctions on Russia, adding it should “deliver a maximum blow to the Kremlin regime”.

Turkey working to bring together Ukrainian, Russian foreign ministers

Turkey is working to bring together the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers for talks after hosting negotiations in Istanbul this week, the country’s foreign minister has said, adding the meeting could happen within two weeks.

Negotiators from Ukraine and Russia held the first face-to-face meeting in more than two weeks in Istanbul on Tuesday, during which Ukraine presented written proposals to stop the Russian invasion.

Speaking to broadcaster A Haber, Cavusoglu said Ankara had not seen the full implementation of decisions made during the discussions, including the withdrawal of Russian forces from some areas, but added significant progress was still made.

Addressing the surprise appearance of Roman Abramovich at the meeting, Cavusoglu said the sanctioned Russian billionaire was “sincerely” working to end the war.

Abramovich has been liaising between Kyiv and Moscow since the invasion began on February 24, he added.

Ukraine says convoy of buses on its way to Mariupol

A convoy of Ukrainian buses has set out for the besieged, southeastern port city of Mariupol to try to deliver humanitarian supplies and bring out trapped civilians, the country’s deputy prime minister has said.

Iryna Vereshchuk said 45 buses were on their way to Mariupol after the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed Russia had agreed to open a safe corridor. Seventeen buses had already left for Mariupol from Zaporizhzhia, about 220km (136 miles) to the northwest, she added.

Another 28 were waiting for authorisation to pass the Russian checkpoint in Vasylivka, near Zaporizhzhia.

Mariupol’s mayor said this week that up to 170,000 residents were trapped there with no power and dwindling supplies. Previous attempts to organise safe corridors for civilians to evacuate from the city have failed.

Russia sanctions threaten to chip away at dollar dominance: IMF

Financial sanctions imposed on Russia threaten to gradually dilute the dominance of the US dollar and could result in a more fragmented international monetary system, a top official at the International Monetary Fund has said.

“The dollar would remain the major global currency even in that landscape, but fragmentation at a smaller level is certainly quite possible,” Gita Gopinath, IMF’s first deputy managing director, told the Financial Times, adding that some countries are already renegotiating the currency in which they get paid for trade.

She said the war will also spur the adoption of digital finance, from cryptocurrencies to stablecoins and central bank digital currencies.

Indian authorities are considering dedicated rupee-rouble payment mechanisms for trade with Russia to enable existing trade obligations in the wake of sanctions imposed on the Kremlin.

Experts say a payment mechanism could pave the way for cheaper oil imports to India and open up opportunities for Indian manufacturers of agricultural machinery, medicine, furniture and bathroom fittings, among other goods, who are looking for new markets.

Ukraine recalls ambassadors to Georgia, Morocco

Zelenskyy has recalled Ukraine’s ambassadors to Georgia and Morocco, suggesting they had not done enough to persuade those countries to support Ukraine and punish Russia for the invasion.

“[I]f there won’t be weapons, won’t be sanctions, won’t be restrictions for Russian business, then please look for other work,” Zelenskyy said in his nighttime address. “I am waiting for concrete results in the coming days from … our representatives in Latin America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa.”

EU agrees with US assessment on Putin’s advisers: Report

A senior European diplomat has told Reuters that a US assessment of Putin’s advisers misleading him about the Ukraine war is in line with European thinking. “Putin thought things were going better than they were. That’s the problem with surrounding yourself with ‘yes men’,” the diplomat said.

Reuters also cited two European diplomats saying Russian conscripts were told they were taking part in military exercises but had to sign for extended duty before the invasion.

“They were misled, badly trained and then arrived to find old Ukrainian women who looked like their grandmothers yelling at them to go home,” one of the diplomats told the news agency.

UK intelligence chief says some Russian soldiers disobeying orders in Ukraine

The head of one of the UK’s intelligence agencies has said that some Russian soldiers in Ukraine have refused to carry out orders, adding Putin had “misjudged” the invasion.

Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) chief Jeremy Fleming said there was evidence that Moscow’s troops had low morale and were poorly equipped.

“We’ve seen Russian soldiers – short of weapons and morale – refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft,” he said during a speech in the Australian capital Canberra.

“It’s clear he [Putin] misjudged the resistance of the Ukrainian people. He underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanize. He underplayed the economic consequences of the sanctions regime, and he overestimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory,” Fleming added.

Although Putin’s advisers were believed to be too afraid to tell the truth, the “extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime,” he said.

Russian promises ‘cannot be believed’: Analyst

Global affairs analyst Michael Bociurkiw says evacuations and other humanitarian interventions in Ukraine are “very difficult” because Russian promises cannot be believed.

Bociurkiw, a former spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in Ukraine, spoke after Russia announced it would implement a ceasefire on Thursday to allow civilian evacuations from the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol.

“[A]nyone from the Red Cross or the Ukrainian government … has a very difficult time planning any type of intervention, evacuation, [or] humanitarian delivery because promises cannot be believed from the Russian side,” he said.

Sanctions should remain until all Russian troops withdraw: UK’s Johnson

UK PM Boris Johnson says Western nations should not lift sanctions on Russia until all Russian troops leave Ukraine.

“I certainly don’t think that you could expect the G7 to lift sanctions simply because there’s been a ceasefire in Ukraine, and that again goes straight into Putin’s playbook,” Johnson said.

“In my view, we should continue to intensify sanctions with a rolling programme until every single one of his troops is out of Ukraine.”

6,084ec018-68fb-47b1-b7ed-4669081ae405,[],2022-03-31 19:15:11+00:00,"Most of the Russian soldiers who occupied the Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine after the invasion of the country have already left those facilities, according to a statement from the Ukrainian nuclear agency, Energoatom, published on Thursday. This entity has also published the photograph of a document that collects, according to what it affirms, the transfer of the plant back to the local authorities.

The soldiers set out in two columns on the road to the north, where the border with Belarus is located, just a dozen kilometers from the plant. According to the testimony of the employees of the plant, who have remained inside for weeks, this Thursday there are hardly any occupying troops left. The facilities were occupied by Russia a few days after the start of the war, on February 24.

Chernobyl, scene in 1986 of the greatest nuclear catastrophe in history, continues to represent a nightmare for the Ukrainians. It is still today one of the most polluted areas in the world and, in the midst of the current war, it is a strategic and sensitive place for both parties. In fact, it was one of the first targets that the Kremlin’s troops dropped on after invading the former Soviet republic. The subsequent takeover by Russia of the largest nuclear plant in Europe, located in Zaporizhia, in southern Ukraine, raised alarms in the face of a possible catastrophe.

More information

Meanwhile, a new column of Kremlin soldiers is forming this Thursday in the surroundings of the town of Slavutich, where the Chernobyl workers reside, with the intention of also heading towards Belarus, always according to the text of the Ukrainian nuclear agency, made public through the social network Telegram. As proof of the recovery of control of the facilities, Energoatom has published a photo of a document entitled Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Transfer of Protection Act, dated March 31 and signed by a Russian general.

While Ukraine announced the withdrawal of soldiers from Chernobyl, bombings have continued in other parts of the country. Russian troops continue attacks in the disputed area of ​​Donbas, in the east, with heavy weapons, and the offensive continues around kyiv and in other important cities such as Chernihiv (north) and Kharkiv (east). The different regional administrations assure that practically the entire country is suffering from attacks, despite Moscow’s announcement that it would reduce its offensive on the capital and other cities, the Urkrinform agency reported.

In the case of Lugansk, where pro-Russian separatists control part of the border area with Russia, the authorities say that the entire territory has been shelled overnight with heavy weapons – seven people have lost their lives. In this area, the city of Lisichansk has been the center of the Russian offensive for the past two days, which has also caused dozens of injuries. In this city, an oil refinery was on fire on Thursday, the Ukrainian agency said.

In the Donetsk region, where the secessionists also control a self-proclaimed republic, the Russians bombarded Mariinka with phosphorus shells, Ukraine reported, and several rocket launchers were fired at other towns such as Avdiivka, Heorhiivka, Novokalinove and Ocheretine.

Several Russian missiles also hit an oil depot in the central Dnipropetrovsk region and an asphalt manufacturing plant in nearby Novomoskovsk. In this case, there were no fatalities.

The shelling of the residential areas of Kharkov, in the east, also continues, and on Wednesday night the attacks damaged a gas pipeline and caused a fire that was extinguished. In this city, the Russians bombed the Derhachi district, killing at least one person. The regional authorities indicated that it is impossible to evacuate the population due to the constant bombing, while dozens of volunteers try to deliver humanitarian aid.

Faced with these moves by Moscow, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has once again expressed distrust of the Kremlin’s announcements: “We have heard recent statements that Russia will scale back its military operations in kyiv and northern Ukraine. But Russia has continually lied about its intentions. So we can only judge Russia based on her actions, not her words. According to our intelligence, the Russian units are not withdrawing, but relocating”, he pointed out at a press conference in Brussels. “Russia is trying to regroup, resupply and strengthen its offensive in the Donbas region. At the same time, Russia is keeping up the pressure on kyiv and other cities. We can expect additional offensive actions that will bring even more suffering. Russia must end this senseless war, withdraw all its troops and join the talks in good faith,” Stoltenberg added.

The city most affected by the bombing of Moscow, the besieged Mariupol, is waiting for a convoy made up of fifty buses to access in the next few hours to remove trapped citizens, after the Kremlin announced a ceasefire in the locality. This Thursday afternoon, Moscow has reported that a humanitarian corridor between Mariupol and Zaporizhia will open on Friday, according to the Tass agency. Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk announced that 45 buses were already heading to the port city, after the International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that Russia had agreed to open a humanitarian corridor. A total of 5,000 people have died and some 170,000 remain trapped, according to data from the mayor’s office of this city, located on the shores of the Azov Sea and besieged for weeks by Russian troops.

Ukrainian soldiers continue to wage defensive fighting in Chernihiv, where the Russians shelled the city’s suburbs on Wednesday. And in the kyiv region, the detonations and explosions have been felt much less in recent hours around the northwest front of the capital, but towns such as Irpin or Bucha remain in dispute, despite the fact that the Government announced on Monday that it had achieved dislodge the Russian military from the first.
