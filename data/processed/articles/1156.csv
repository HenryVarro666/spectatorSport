0,20c43467-7a4b-4b43-81a9-92dfa8fb5163,[],2022-03-26,"This story recounts all that occurred Saturday in the war in Ukraine. For the latest news, see our latest live updates story.

In a sweeping and forceful speech concluding a four-day trip to Europe, President Joe Biden cast the war in Ukraine on Saturday as part of an ongoing battle for freedom and ended with a blunt call for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be stopped.

""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said during a visit to Warsaw, Poland, in his strongest comments to date about his desire to see Putin gone.

Shortly after the speech, a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity said Biden was not calling for Putin to be removed from office.

“The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,"" the official said. ""He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded that “it’s not up to the president of the U.S. and not up to the Americans to decide who will remain in power in Russia.”

“Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,” Peskov said.

Biden's speech was delivered hours after meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda during a historic visit Saturday where the allies presented a united front against Russian aggression and reaffirmed their commitment to the NATO alliance.

Biden later met with Ukrainian refugees, including children who asked him to “say a prayer for my dad or my grandfather or my brother. He’s back there fighting.”

Biden's visit comes as Moscow appears to be recalibrating its military strategies in Ukraine, even as several media outlets reported a Russian missile struck a fuel depot in the western Ukraine city of Lviv which has largely escaped the devastation other parts of the nation have suffered.

Russia's military goals in Ukraine have been hazy since it began its invasion more than a month ago, and new statements suggest Moscow may consider claiming victory without completely overthrowing the Ukrainian government or capturing Kyiv.

Western analysts and leaders were skeptical of the Friday statements, where the deputy chief of the Russian general staff said his forces had largely achieved the ""main objectives"" of a first phase of the conflict. The power of the Ukrainian military has been ""considerably reduced,"" freeing up troops to ""focus on the main efforts to achieve the main goal, liberation of Donbas,"" said Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi.

The implications of the statement are difficult to determine, according to Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who has studied U.S. wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.

""It's plausible that they’re basically trying to ratchet their perceived war aims down to something they’ve already accomplished,"" he said.

Before the invasion, portions of the Donbas in southeastern Ukraine were already controlled by Russian-backed forces. Similarly skeptical, French President Emmanuel Macron said “it’s too soon to say” whether the Russians have changed their approach.

But what does appear clear: In the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance, the progress of Russian forces has largely stalled. Kyiv — while battered — remains under the control of the Ukrainian government.

►In remarks from Warsaw, President Joe Biden slammed Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""butcher"" for the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and said the West ""has never been stronger."" Poland has been on the front lines of the refugee crisis, having accepted some 2 million Ukrainians fleeing the war.

►Several media outlets reported that the western city of Lviv, largely spared from the bombardments in other parts of the nation was struck by a Russian missile Saturday. The mayor of the city says one of the targets was a fuel depot.

►The U.N. human rights office said it has been challenging to confirm fatalities in Mariupol given the organization's strict methodology for counting the number of civilian deaths in conflict. The office says at least 1,035 civilians have been killed in Ukraine and 1,650 injured, but acknowledges that is an undercount.

► The governor of the Kyiv region says that Russian forces have entered the city of Slavutych in northern Ukraine and seized a hospital there.

Governor of Lviv region says man detained on suspicion of espionage

LVIV, Ukraine — The governor of the Lviv region says a man was detained on suspicion of espionage at the site of one of the two rocket attacks that rattled the city on Saturday.

Maksym Kozytskyy said police found the man had recorded a rocket flying toward the target and striking it. Police also found on his telephone photos of checkpoints in the region, which Kozytskyy said had been sent to two Russian telephone numbers.

Rockets hit an oil storage facility and an unspecified industrial facility, wounding at least five people. A thick plume of smoke and towering flames could be seen on Lviv’s outskirts hours after the attacks.

Biden stirs concern with remark that Putin 'cannot remain in power'

After four days of alliance building, emotional interactions with refugees and stirring words about the need to fight for democracy, one sentence that President Joe Biden appeared to tack on to the end of his final speech in Poland threatened to overshadow all he had achieved as he deals with the most significant foreign policy crisis of his presidency.

“For God’s sake,” Biden said of Russian President Vladimir Putin, “this man cannot remain in power.”

The White House tried to quickly walk it back.

Biden was not promoting regime change, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The point the president was trying to make in his remarks was that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.”

Biden may have been saying what he believes, but it was not smart policy to say it aloud, said Tom Schwartz, a historian of U.S. foreign relations at Vanderbilt University. Read more here.

Kremlin responds to Biden's condemnation of Putin

A spokesperson for the Kremlin on Saturday said President Joe Biden's statement that Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" was ""extremely negative"" for U.S. relations with Russia.

“Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,” Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press. “And of course it is unbecoming for the president of the U.S. to make such statements.”

The White House walked back Biden's initial statements in Poland, claiming the president was not endorsing regime change, but meant that ""Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.""

Peskov said that with Biden's statements, he was ""narrowing the window of opportunity for our bilateral relations under the current administration.""

US giving $100 million for civilian security assistance in Ukraine

The U.S. will give Ukraine an additional $100 million in civilian security assistance, the State Department announced Saturday.

The funding will help pay for field gear, medical supplies, armored vehicles and other equipment for Ukraine’s police and border guards.

Ukrainian law enforcement officers are playing a key role in rescuing civilians, protecting convoys of fleeing refugees and providing security to civilian areas torn apart by Russia’s invasion, according to the State Department.

The administration repeated past warnings that it is helping document war crimes so those responsible can be held accountable.

Biden: Autocracy ‘no match’ for liberty

President Joe Biden said he arrived in Europe with a message for NATO, the European Union and all freedom-loving nations: “We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul.”

“We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come,” he said.

“It will not be easy. There will be cost, but it’s a price we have to pay Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty.”

Biden to Russians: 'These are not the actions of a great nation'

Biden appealed to ordinary Russians, first telling them – “if you’re able to listen” – that “you ... are not our enemy.”

The president said what they experienced at the hands of invaders in World War II is exactly what is happening to Ukrainians by the Russian military.

“These are not the actions of a great nation,” Biden said of the bombings of hospitals, schools and maternity wards. “This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people.”

Biden said Putin’s aggressions have cut his people off from the rest of the world and taken Russia back to the 19th century.

But Biden promised that the United States “will stand with you and the brave people of Ukraine who want peace.”

“For God’s sake,” Biden said at the end of his speech, Putin ""cannot remain in power.""

Biden: War in Ukraine 'strategic failure' for Putin

President Joe Biden said Saturday the war in Ukraine has been “a strategic failure” for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Putin thought Ukrainians would “roll over and not fight,” Biden said.

“Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance,” he said.

Russia’s actions have also strengthened NATO’s resolve instead of pulling the alliance apart, Biden said.

“The west is now stronger, more united than it has ever been,” he said.

Biden warns against ‘forces of autocracy’

President Joe Biden warned Saturday that the battle for democracy did not end with the Cold War.

“Over the last 30 years, the forces of autocracy have lived all across the globe,” Biden said in remarks from the steps of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland.

Today, Russia has “strangled” democracy, and Vladimir Putin has sought to do so elsewhere – not only in his homeland but by invalidating neighboring nations, Biden said.

“Let us resolve to put the strength of democracies into action to thwart the designs of autocracy,” he said. “Let us remember that the test of this moment is the test of all time.”

“We stand with you. Period,” Biden said.

Biden spoke in the packed courtyard of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland where American and Polish flags waved in the background. When the president said he suspected Ukrainians were in the audience, a cheer went up.

Biden said Ukrainians’ resistance is part of a larger fight for essential democratic principles. Those principles, he said, have always been under siege and every generation has to had to fight democracy’s mortal foes.

Biden in Warsaw: 'Be not afraid'

In remarks concluding his four-day trip to Europe, President Joe Biden stood on the steps of the Royal Castle in Warsaw on Saturday and recalled the words of Pope John Paul II: “Be not afraid.”

The White House billed Biden’s speech as a major address in which he would address efforts of the free world to hold Russia accountable for the war in Ukraine.

“In this battle, we need to be clear-eyed,” Biden said. “This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.”

Russian missile strikes Lviv fuel depot

LVIV, Ukraine — Air raid sirens sounded Saturday afternoon in the western city of Lviv, and governor of the region Maxym Kozytsky reported “three powerful explosions near Lviv” without giving details of what was hit. Footage shot by The Associated Press showed thick plumes of smoke rising above the city.

The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadoviy, tweeted that one of missiles struck an industrial area that include a fuel storage depot, but that there was no indication residences were hit.

""All emergency services are working on the location,"" he tweeted. ""Please stay in the shelters until the air alarm goes off.""

Lviv, a city of over 700,000 roughly 70 kilometers (43 miles) east of Ukraine’s border with Poland, has been largely spared from major Russian attacks in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, the Russian forces fired missiles on a military training center near Lviv, which at the time was the most westward target, and killed 35 people.

Since the beginning of the invasion, Lviv has become a safe harbor for some 200,000 displaced Ukrainians.

The explosions Saturday came as U.S. President Joe Biden was wrapping up a visit to neighboring NATO ally Poland in which he told Poland’s president that “ your freedom is ours.”

Biden on Ukrainian refugees: ‘You just want to hug them’

President Joe Biden got a glimpse of the human toll of the war in Ukraine on Saturday when he visited with a group of Ukrainian refugees whose resilience he said demonstrated “the depth and strength of the human spirit.”

“They’re an amazing group of people,” he said.

Biden mingled for several minutes with refugees and humanitarian officials who are providing assistance to them at a national stadium in Warsaw. The stadium serves as a processing center where refugees are issued identification cards allowing them to work, live, go to school and get social benefits.

Biden stopped in a courtyard that is serving as a distribution site for the World Central Kitchen, the non-profit organization founded by Chef José Andrés. The group has set up a mobile kitchen and is providing hot meals to the refugees.

Biden chatted briefly with Andrés before walking over to a corner where families were gathered around tables with plates of hamburgers, fries, sausages and other food. Wearing a face mask and accompanied by an interpreter, the president picked up a small girl wearing a pink jacket and held her in his arms for several minutes.

“It’s so incredible to see all of those little children,” Biden told reporters. “You just want to hug them.”

Biden said each of the children he spoke with asked him to “say a prayer for my dad or my grandfather or my brother. He’s back there fighting.”

“I remember what it’s like when you have someone in a war zone,” said Biden, whose late son, Beau, was a veteran of the war in Iraq. “Every morning, you get up and you wonder. You just pray you don’t get that phone call.”

Asked what his visit with the refugees made him think of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden responded: “He’s a butcher.”

Biden stresses ‘sacred obligation’ to defend NATO allies

President Joe Biden sought Saturday to reassure Poland that the U.S. would come to its defense if it should come under attack by Russia in an escalation of the war in Ukraine.

The U.S. considers its commitment to defend other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization “a sacred obligation,” Biden told Polish President Andrzej Duda during a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw.

“You can count on that,” Biden said.

The U.S. has sent thousands of forces to Poland to shore up NATO’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden visited with members of the 82nd Airborne Division on Friday during a stop in Rzeszów, Poland, about 60 miles from the border of Ukraine.

In Warsaw, Biden and Duda sat across from each other at a long table beneath a crystal chandelier as the two leaders prepared to discuss the humanitarian crisis sparked by the month-old war. More than 2 million Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland to escape the war.

Speaking in Polish, Duda said Biden’s visit strengthened the bond between the two countries.

Russia’s invasion has created “a huge tragedy” for the Ukrainian people and “a great sense of threat” for the Polish people, Duda said.

“We know what Russian imperialism stands for, and we know what it means to be attacked by Russian armed forces,” Duda said.

Biden stressed that stability in Europe “is critically important to the United States” and said the most important criterion is that NATO stay “absolutely, completely, thoroughly united” and that there be “no separation in our points of view.”

Ukraine official: Russia destroyed 4,500 houses, 400 educational institutions

During a briefing at the Ukraine Media Center, Ukraine’s development minister said Russian forces have destroyed about 4,500 houses and almost 400 education institutions since the war began last month, according to the Ukrainian news outlet Pravda.

“These figures are growing every day, and perhaps every hour,” said Oleksiy Chernyshov, Ukraine’s minister of development of communities and territories, according to the report. “At this time, when we say the bombing is going on, people are dying, infrastructure is being destroyed.""

He added that about 100 factories and enterprises and 150 health care facilities were also destroyed and noted that not all damage can be assessed until the conflict has ceased.

The price tag on the damage could reach “tens of billions” of dollars, he said.

European nuclear group severing ties with Russia and Belarus

The European Council for Nuclear Research is suspending work in Belarus and Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On Saturday the 23 member states of CERN Council agreed to halt all events in Russia and Belarus and all scientists in all scientific committees of institutions in Russia and Belarus.

In the announcement Friday, the CERN Council said the restrictions were agreed upon and implemented in an act of solidarity with the Ukrainian people.

Earlier this month, the CERN Council condemned the military invasion and agreed not to engage in new collaborations with Russia. At the council's June session the group said they will consider more sanctions on Russia and Belarus.

Ukraine: Women perform significant role in military resistance to Russia

Women make up 15% of Ukraine's military, with nearly 7,000 women serving in its Air Force alone, a top Ukrainian official said Saturday. Ukraine’s military has 250,000 active-duty troops.

“Women are the heart of the resilience of local communities,” People’s Deputy Lesia Vasylenko said in a tweet. “Heroic mothers and their inspiring daughters. This is the (Ukrainian) resistance.”

The figure is on par with other nations worldwide, many of which have significantly larger militaries.

About 16.5% of the active-duty U.S. military are women, according to a 2020 Government Accountability Office report. Some branches of the military are more gender diverse than others – roughly 21% of the Air Force is comprised of women compared to 9% of Marines – a 2021 Department of Defense report shows.

About 11% of the United Kingdom Regular Armed Forces are women, according to a 2021 report. The Center for Strategic & International Studies calculated that roughly 4% of the Russian military was women in 2020. The percentage of women in the other reporting NATO nations’ militaries range from 0.3% (Turkey) to 20% (Hungary), a 2020 NATO report shows.

Russia conducted 60 cyberattacks against Ukraine, information protection agency says

Ukraine's information protection agency on Friday said that, between March 15-22, Russia conducted 60 cyberattacks against the nation’s ""critical infrastructure and government organizations,” but that most were limited in impact.

“The number of attacks is growing, but most of them are unsuccessful,” Viktor Zhora, deputy head of Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communication and Protection of Information, said in a March 23 briefing, according to the agency’s Telegram post. “Even those that are successful do not affect the operation of critical information infrastructure.”

Zhora added that the current activity is less serious than the activity tracked by the agency earlier this year.

Russian troops enter city of Slavutych, seize hospital

LVIV, Ukraine -- The governor of the Kyiv region says that Russian forces have entered the city of Slavutych and seized a hospital there.

Slavutych is located north of Kyiv and west of Chernihiv, outside the exclusion zone that was established around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the 1986 disaster. It is home to workers at the Chernobyl site.

Governor Oleksandr Pavlyuk said Saturday that the Russians also kidnapped the city’s mayor, but some media reported later in the day that the mayor was released swiftly. Neither claim could be verified independently .

The governor said that residents of Slavutych took to the streets with Ukrainian flags to protest the Russian invasion.

“The Russians opened fire into the air. They threw flash-bang grenades into the crowd. But the residents did not disperse, on the contrary, more of them showed up,” Pavlyuk said.

Top Ukrainian officials to attend Biden speech in Warsaw

A pair of top Ukrainian officials will be on hand in Warsaw Saturday when President Joe Biden delivers a speech on holding Russia accountable for its month-long war against Ukraine.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in a message on Twitter that he and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba will attend the president’s address.

Biden started the final day of his four-day trip to Europe by dropping by a meeting between Reznikov and Kuleba and their U.S. counterparts – Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Reznikov tweeted a photo of the meeting – sans Biden – and said they were discussing “current issues & cooperation in political & defense directions.”

“In the evening we’ll also be present at @POTUS speech on the Russian war against Ukraine,” Reznikov wrote.

Biden will deliver his remarks at the Royal Castle in Warsaw.

Ukraine president Zelenskyy makes surprise appearance at Doha Forum

DOHA, Qatar — Ukraine's president made a surprise video appearance Saturday at Qatar's Doha Forum, calling on the energy-rich nation and others to boost their production to counteract the loss of Russian energy supplies.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the United Nations and world powers to come to his aid, as he has in a series of other addresses given around the world since the start of the war Feb. 24. He compared Russia's destruction of the port city of Mariupol to the Syrian and Russian destruction wrought on the city of Aleppo in the Syrian war.

""They are destroying our ports,"" Zelenskyy said. ""The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide.""

The loss of Ukrainian wheat already has worried Mideast nations like Egypt, which relies on those exports.

Zelenskyy called on countries to increase their exports of energy — something particularly important as Qatar is a world leader in the export of natural gas.

Zelenskyy criticized Russia for what he described as threatening the world with its nuclear weapons, raising the possibility of tactical nuclear weapons being used on the battlefield.

""Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,"" Zelenskyy said.

He also noted that Muslims in Ukraine would have to fight during the upcoming holy fasting month of Ramadan.

""We have to ensure this sacred month of Ramadan is not overshadowed by the misery of people in Ukraine,"" he said.

President Biden to meet with refugees, deliver speech

President Joe Biden on Saturday will cap his European trip talking to Ukrainian refugees in Poland and delivering a speech on holding Russia accountable for its invasion and upholding democratic values.

Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, previewed Biden’s remarks as a major address that will “speak to the stakes of this moment, the urgency of the challenge that lies ahead, what the conflict in Ukraine means for the world, and why it is so important that the free world sustain unity and resolve in the face of Russian aggression.”

Biden will also put the war in historical context and describe where he sees it going from here, Sullivan said.

Before delivering those remarks at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda at the Presidential Palace

“The suffering that is taking place now is at your doorstep,” Biden told Duda on Friday at a meeting in Rzeszów, where the influx of refugees is the largest. “You're the ones who are risking, in some cases, your lives and risking all you know to try to help. And the American people are proud to support your efforts.”

On Thursday, Biden announced the U.S. will take in up to 100,000 Ukrainians and provide more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance.

Poland has taken in more than 2 million refugees, and the numbers continue to grow.

“We have never experienced anything like that throughout our history,” Duda told Biden.

On Saturday, Biden will meet with refugees at the National Stadium in Warsaw. The stadium is a processing center where refugees are issued identification cards allowing them to work, live, go to school and get social benefits.

“I'm here in Poland to see firsthand the humanitarian crisis,” Biden said Friday, expressing his disappointment that he can’t cross the border into Ukraine for security reasons.

Biden has been in Europe since Wednesday, meeting with NATO allies and other European and world leaders.

The U.S. and its allies announced new sanctions on Russia, additional help for Ukraine, and discussed beefing up force presence in Eastern Europe in the near and longer-term.

UK sees Russians reluctant to enter urban war

LONDON — Britain's Defense Ministry says Russia continues to besiege a number of major Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol.

A daily update says Russian forces are proving reluctant to engage in large scale urban infantry operations, rather preferring to rely on the indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments in an attempt to demoralize defending forces.

The assessment says it is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties.

Zelenskyy: Ukraine will not cede territory to end Russian invasion

Zelenskyy has again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but says Ukraine would not agree to give up any of its territory for the sake of peace.

In his nightly video address to the nation Friday, Zelenskyy appeared to be responding to Col. Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, who said Russian forces would now focus on “the main goal, the liberation of Donbas.”

Russian-backed separatists have controlled part of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine since 2014, and Russian forces have been battling to seize more of the region from Ukraine, including the besieged city of Mariupol.

Rudskoi’s statement also was a suggestion that Russia may be backing away from trying to take Kyiv and other major cities where its offensive has stalled. Zelenskyy noted that Russian forces have lost thousands of troops but still haven’t been able to take Kyiv or Kharkiv, the second-largest city.

Ukraine destroys Russian vessel; Moscow taps troops in Georgia

Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian transport ship in the port city of Berdyansk that appeared to be on a resupply mission, a senior Defense official said Friday.

The attack on Thursday blew up a tank-landing ship at its pier, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. The Russians have 22 warships in the Black Sea.

Russian combat power in Ukraine, which dipped below 90% for the first time this week, is now between 85% and 90%, the official said. For the first time, Russia appears to be drawing reinforcements from its troops based in Georgia. Combat power includes troops, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, warplanes, warships and ballistic missiles.

Russia has also drawn down its stockpile of precision-guided weapons and is relying more on so-called dumb bombs to bombard cities, the official said. Russia has used about 50% of its air-launched cruise missiles. Russia’s cruise missiles have at times failed to launch or hit their targets.

Poll shows Americans support Russian sanctions, think Biden should be tougher

A majority of Americans are supportive of the harsh sanctions on Russia but believe Biden needs to be tougher on the Kremlin after its invasion of Ukraine, according to a poll commissioned by the Associated Press and NORC released Thursday.

The poll, which surveyed 1,082 U.S. adults from Thursday to Monday, found 56% of Americans believe Biden's response to Russia hasn't been tough enough, including a majority of 53% of Democrats. A very small percent, about 6%, said they thought Biden had been ""too tough,"" the poll shows.

Across the board, Americans of both political parties were supportive of the harsh economic blows to Russia. The poll showed 68% were supportive of economic sanctions in general with 70% saying they supported the recent banning of oil imported from Russia, which in turn caused gas prices to rise.

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

The new economic restrictions on Russia and billions more in aid for Ukrainians were detailed as President Joe Biden huddled with North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Group of Seven leaders at a summit in Brussels.

The meeting is seen as pivotal for democracies seeking to curtail Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and prevent him from going to war in other nations not currently within NATO, or actually attacking one of the 30 member states.

“NATO leaders met today on the one-month anniversary of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine to reiterate our strong support for the Ukrainian people, our determination to hold Russia accountable for its brutal war and our commitment to strengthening the NATO Alliance,” Biden said in a statement.

The United States, which has sent thousands of soldiers into Europe so far this year, will coordinate with NATO countries ahead of another summit in June to “develop plans for additional forces and capabilities to strengthen NATO’s defenses,” according to Biden.

“We will adopt an updated Strategic Concept to ensure NATO is ready to meet any challenge in the new and more dangerous security environment,” he said in the statement.

In the meantime, four new NATO battle groups, which typically number between 1,000 and 1,500 soldiers, are being established in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.

And a senior administration official said Thursday morning the Biden administration has started consulting with allied nations to provide anti-ship missiles to Ukraine.

“There may be some technical challenges with making that happen, but that is something that we are consulting with Allies and starting to work on,” the official said.

Food, shelter, medical supplies

The $1 billion in humanitarian assistance announced Thursday will go toward providing food, shelter, water and medical supplies to people “affected by Russia’s war in Ukraine and its severe impacts around the world, including a marked rise in food insecurity.”

The United States will spend an additional $320 million during the coming months to bolster democracy and human rights initiatives in Ukraine and surrounding countries.

That funding will go toward launching the European Democratic Resilience Initiative, an organization that will support a variety of programs, including documenting potential war crimes in Ukraine, countering disinformation, strengthening anti-corruption programs and increasing the safety of vulnerable groups such as the LGBTQI+ community.

Biden pledged the United States would provide more than $11 billion in the next five years through the Feed the Future initiative to assist countries whose food stability has been affected by the war in Ukraine.

The funding would go to nations “vulnerable to increases in food and fertilizer prices.”

The Biden administration also announced it’s prepared to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians and “others fleeing Russia’s aggression through the full range of legal pathways, including the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.”

The U.S. government, the statement said, was preparing to expand existing immigration programs and create new ones to focus on bringing in Ukrainians who have family within the country.

In addition to financial support for Ukraine, the Biden administration continued to pile sanctions on Russia and some of its richest citizens.

The latest round of sanctions will hit Russia’s legislature, known as the Duma, and 328 members of that organization, as well as 48 state-owned defense enterprises that produce weapons for the government.

Russia signaled a possible recalibration of its war aims in Ukraine on Friday as the Kremlin faced spreading global ostracism for the brutal invasion, hardened Western economic punishments and a determined Ukrainian resistance that appeared to be making some gains on the ground.

A statement by Russia’s Defense Ministry said the goals of the “first stage of the operation” had been “mainly accomplished,” with Ukraine’s combat capabilities “significantly reduced,” and that it would now focus on securing Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years.

The Defense Ministry statement was ambiguous about further possible Russian territorial ambitions in Ukraine, where its ground forces have been mostly stymied by the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian military response.

But on a day when President Biden was visiting U.S. soldiers in Poland near the Ukrainian border, the statement suggested the possibility that the Russians were looking for a way to salvage some kind of achievement before the costs of the war they launched a month ago became impossibly onerous.

While Russia “does not exclude” that its forces will storm major Ukrainian cities such as Chernihiv, Mykolaiv and the capital, Kyiv, the Defense Ministry statement said that taking them over was not the primary objective.

“As individual units carry out their tasks — and they are being solved successfully — our forces and means will be concentrated on the main thing: the complete liberation of the Donbas,” Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, a senior Russian military commander, said in the statement, his first since Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24.

Whether General Rudskoi’s statement was sincere or simply strategic misdirection was difficult to assess. But the statement amounted to the most direct acknowledgment yet that Russia may be unable to take full control of Ukraine and would instead target the Donbas region, where Russia has recognized the independence of two Kremlin-backed separatist areas that it calls the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and the “Luhansk People’s Republic.”

Russia has also insisted that Ukraine recognize its control of Crimea, which President Vladimir V. Putin’s forces seized from Ukraine in 2014.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has ruled out ceding those regions to stop the war.

Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst, cautioned that the public pronouncements of Russian military commanders should be regarded skeptically. While Russia could indeed be narrowing its war aims, he said, General Rudskoi’s statement could also be a feint as Russia regroups for a new offensive.

“We could say that this is a signal that we’re no longer insisting on dismantling Ukrainian statehood,” Mr. Luzin said. “But I would rather see it as a distracting maneuver.”

General Rudskoi’s statement came as Ukraine acknowledged that Russian forces had been “partially successful” in achieving one of their key objectives — securing a land corridor from Russia to the Crimean Peninsula.

While Russia already controlled much of the area, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the route allowed Russian troops and supplies to flow between Crimea and Russia.

But some Ukrainian officials said the significance of such a route might be overstated. Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine under Mr. Zelensky, described the land bridge as a minor Russian victory and said the Kremlin was moving to secure Donetsk and Luhansk to “sell to the Russian public as a potential victory.”

In Moscow, Mr. Putin, who has made any criticism of the war a potential crime, used a televised videoconference with the winners of a presidential arts prize on Friday to deliver a diatribe about “cancel culture” that made no mention of the war in Ukraine.

In embracing a term that has become a favorite of the American political right to reprise his contention that the West is trying to erase Russian culture and history, Mr. Putin cited J.K. Rowling, author of the “Harry Potter” books, whose comments about transgender women have been criticized as transphobic.

“Not so long ago, the children’s writer J.K. Rowling was also ‘canceled’ for the fact that she — the author of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies around the world — did not please fans of so-called gender freedoms,” Mr. Putin said.

Ms. Rowling responded on Twitter that, “Critiques of Western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics.” She added the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine.

As Mr. Putin spoke, there were indications that Ukrainian forces were making some progress in the second week of their counteroffensive. A senior Pentagon official said that Russian forces no longer had full control of the southern port of Kherson and that the city, the first major urban center to be captured in the Russian invasion, was now “contested territory.”

The Pentagon assessment contradicted General Rudskoi’s claim on Friday that the Kherson region was “under full control.”

In another sign of the bloody stalemate in Ukraine, Russian soldiers have adopted “defensive positions” near Kyiv, the Pentagon official said, adding that Russia appeared to be “prioritizing” the fight in eastern Ukraine, as General Rudskoi had indicated.

“Clearly, they overestimated their ability to take Kyiv and overestimated their ability to take any population center,” the Pentagon official said.

Mr. Biden, on the second day of his three-day visit to Europe because of the Ukraine crisis, traveled to Rzeszow, Poland, about 50 miles from the Ukrainian border, where he met with members of the 82nd Airborne Division who are serving as part of NATO’s efforts to protect Poland and other member states from Russian aggression.

Greeting American service members who were eating pizza in a cafeteria, Mr. Biden called them “the finest fighting force in the history of the world,” and added, “I personally thank you for what you do.”

Later, Mr. Biden met with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and officials managing the humanitarian response to the more than two million Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland to escape the shelling and deprivation.

Mr. Biden also announced a deal to increase U.S. shipments of natural gas to help wean Europe off Russian energy. But it remained unclear exactly how the administration would achieve its goals.

The deal calls for the United States to send an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas — roughly 10 to 12 percent of current annual U.S. exports to all countries. But it does not address the lack of port capacity to ship and receive more gas on both sides of the Atlantic.

Still, American gas executives welcomed a renewed emphasis on exports as a sign that the Biden administration was now seeking to promote the U.S. oil and gas industry rather than punish it for contributions to climate change.

“I have no idea how they are going to do this, but I don’t want to criticize them because for the first time they are trying to do the right thing,” said Charif Souki, executive chairman of Tellurian, a U.S. gas producer that is planning to build an export terminal in Louisiana.

Robert Habeck, the vice chancellor and economic minister of Germany, said his country expected to halve imports of Russian oil by midsummer and nearly end them by year’s end — sooner than many thought possible. He estimated that Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, could be free of Russian gas by mid-2024.

Images and videos from Ukraine that emerged on Friday underscored the escalating death toll and destruction.

Newly surfaced security camera footage, verified by The New York Times, showed an attack on people in line for emergency aid outside a post office and shopping center in the battered northeastern city of Kharkiv on Thursday. Oleg Sinegubov, the head of the regional government there, said that at least six civilians had been killed and 15 wounded.

Photographs out of Kharkiv on Friday also showed a large fireball and nearby cars and buildings on fire, as residents fled on foot and bicycle, carrying whatever belongings they could grab in the aftermath of the attack.

In the central city of Dnipro, Russian missile strikes on a military facility destroyed buildings late Thursday night, according to Ukrainian officials, who said that casualties were still being assessed.

And in Mariupol, the southern port savaged by Russian attacks, Ukrainian officials said that an estimated 300 people had been killed in a March 16 strike on a theater used as a bomb shelter.

It was unclear how officials had arrived at that estimate. Ukrainian officials have said that about 130 people were rescued from the theater, which was attacked even though “children” had been written in giant letters on the pavement on both sides of the building.

The United Nations said on Friday that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed, including 93 children, since Russia’s invasion began, many in what appeared to have been indiscriminate bombardments that could constitute war crimes.

The United Nations cautioned that it had not been able to verify the death toll in areas of intense conflict, including Mariupol, and said the actual number of injured and dead was likely to be considerably higher.

In a sign that diplomatic efforts were struggling, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rejected comments by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who had suggested that Ukraine was open to concessions in four key areas.

In an interview released Friday, Mr. Erdogan, who is hosting talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations, said that Ukraine was willing to drop its bid for NATO membership, accept Russian as an official language, make “certain concessions” about disarmament and agree to “collective security.”

But Mr. Kuleba said the negotiations had proved “very difficult” and that Ukraine had “taken a strong position and does not relinquish its demands.”

“We insist, first of all, on a cease-fire, security guarantees and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” he said, adding that there was “no consensus with Russia on the four points mentioned by the president of Turkey.”

“In particular,” he said, “the Ukrainian language is and will be the only one state language in Ukraine.”

WARSAW — President Biden delivered a forceful denunciation of Vladimir V. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on Saturday, declaring “for God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” as he cast the war as the latest front in a decades-long battle between the forces of democracy and oppression.

Ending a three-day diplomatic trip to Europe with a fiery speech outside a centuries-old castle in Warsaw, Mr. Biden described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as the “test of all time” in a post-World War II struggle between democracy and autocracy, “between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force.”

“In this battle, we need to be cleareyed,” Mr. Biden said in front of a crowd waving Polish, Ukrainian and American flags. “This battle will not be won in days or months, either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.”

Mr. Biden used the speech to bolster a key NATO ally on Ukraine’s western border that has served as a conduit for Western arms and has absorbed more than 2 million refugees fleeing the violence, more than any other country in Europe. And he sought to prepare the public, at home and abroad, for a grinding conflict that could drag on for weeks, months or longer.

Just hours before the event, missiles struck the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, about 50 miles from the Polish border, extending Russia’s monthlong assault on major cities and civilian populations — and undercutting Russian statements a day earlier suggesting Moscow might be scaling back its goals in the war.

While declaring that “the Russian people are not our enemy,” Mr. Biden unleashed an angry tirade against Mr. Putin’s claim that the invasion of Ukraine was intended to “de-Nazify” the country. Mr. Biden called that justification “a lie,” noting that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is Jewish and that his father’s family was killed in the Holocaust.

“It’s just cynical,” Mr. Biden said. “He knows that. And it’s also obscene.”

It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Biden’s apparent call for the ouster of Mr. Putin was one of the off-the-cuff remarks for which he is known or a calculated jab, one of many in the speech. But it risks confirming Russia’s central propaganda claim that the West, and particularly the United States, is determined to destroy Russia.

The White House immediately sought to play down the remark. “The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,” a White House official told reporters. “He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.”

Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said Mr. Putin’s fate was not in the hands of the American president. “It’s not for Biden to decide,” Mr. Peskov told reporters. “The president of Russia is elected by the Russians.”

Experts were divided on whether Mr. Biden’s remark was intended to signal he believed Mr. Putin should be ousted, a political escalation that could have consequences on the battlefield.

Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Twitter that the White House’s attempt to walk back the president’s comment was “unlikely to wash.”

“Putin will see it as confirmation of what he’s believed all along,” he wrote. “Bad lapse in discipline that runs risk of extending the scope and duration of the war.”

Mr. Biden’s statement that Mr. Putin could no longer remain in power could be perceived “as a call for regime change,” said Michal Baranowski, a senior fellow and director of the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund, a nonpartisan policy organization. But he said he did not read it that way, and that Mr. Putin was unlikely to, either. “I think just what President Biden was saying is, how can such a terrible person be ruling Russia?” said Mr. Baranowski. “In that context, I don’t think it will lead to any escalation with Russia.”

Earlier in the day, Mr. Biden stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, and assured him that the United States considered its support for NATO to be a “sacred obligation.”

“America’s ability to meet its role in other parts of the world rests upon a united Europe,” Mr. Biden said.

While Poland’s right-wing, populist government has been embraced by Washington and Brussels as a linchpin of Western security, it has provoked quarrels with both in the past. Mr. Duda, however, thanked Mr. Biden for his support, saying that Poland stood ready as a “serious partner, a credible partner.”

At a stadium in Warsaw, Mr. Biden met with Ukrainian refugees in his first personal encounter with some of the civilians ensnared in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis caused by weeks of indiscriminate Russian shelling of Ukrainian cities and towns.

After speaking with the refugees, including several from the city of Mariupol, which has been flattened by Russian shelling, Mr. Biden called Mr. Putin “a butcher.”

That comment also prompted a retort from Mr. Peskov, who told TASS, the Russian state-owned news agency, that “such personal insults narrow the window of opportunity” for bilateral relations with the Biden administration.

Mr. Biden also met with Ukrainian ministers in his first in-person meeting with the country’s top leaders since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, part of what American officials hoped would be a powerful display of the United States’ commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty.

“We did receive additional promises from the United States on how our defense cooperation will evolve,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, told reporters, the Reuters news agency reported.

But Mr. Biden gave no indication that the United States was willing to budge from its previous rejection of Ukrainian requests to establish a no-fly zone over the country or to provide it with the MIG-29 warplanes that Poland offered some weeks ago.

As Mr. Biden visited Poland, two missiles struck Lviv, rattling residents who ran into underground shelters as smoke rose into the sky. Lviv’s mayor said a fuel storage facility was on fire, and a regional administrator said five people had been injured.

Although Russian missiles hit a warplane repair factory near Lviv on March 18, the city, which had 700,000 residents before many of them fled the war, has otherwise been spared the airstrikes and missile attacks that have hammered other Ukrainian population centers.

Mr. Biden ended his trip one day after a senior Russian general suggested that the Kremlin might be redefining its goals in the war by focusing less on seizing major cities and instead targeting the eastern Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces for eight years.

Mr. Biden’s administration was quietly exploring the implications of the statement by the Russian general, Sergei Rudskoi, which indicated that Mr. Putin might be looking for a way out of the brutal invasion he launched with confidence and bravado a month ago.

Western intelligence agencies have in recent weeks picked up chatter among senior Russian commanders about giving up the effort to take Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and other key areas in the north and west of the country, according to two people with access to the intelligence. Instead, the commanders have talked more narrowly of securing the Donbas region.

Military analysts have cautioned that General Rudskoi’s statement could be intended as misdirection while Russian forces regroup for a new offensive.

Only weeks ago, Mr. Putin threatened to fully absorb Ukraine, warning that, “The current leadership needs to understand that if they continue doing what they are doing, they risk the future of Ukrainian statehood.”

In the latest instance of nuclear saber-rattling, Dmitri A. Medvedev, the vice chairman of Russia’s Security Council, restated Moscow’s willingness to use nuclear weapons against the United States and Europe if its existence was threatened.

“No one wants war, especially given that nuclear war would be a threat to the existence of human civilization,” Mr. Medvedev told Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency in excerpts from an interview published on Saturday.

Hoping to rally his country and encourage negotiations with Moscow, Mr. Zelensky said that the success of a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began two weeks ago was “leading the Russian leadership to a simple and logical idea: Talk is necessary.”

For the moment, large portions of Ukraine remain a battleground in what has increasingly come to resemble a bloody stalemate between the smaller Ukrainian army and Russian troops that have struggled with logistical problems.

On Saturday, Russian forces entered the small northern city of Slavutych, near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, where they seized the hospital and briefly detained the mayor, a regional military official said.

In response, dozens of residents unfurled the Ukrainian flag in front of city hall and chanted, “glory to Ukraine,” prompting Russian troops to fire into the air and throw stun grenades, according to videos and the official, Oleksandr Pavliuk.

Biden is scheduled to travel to Poland on Friday, where questions about the refugee crisis and concerns over growing Russian aggression are expected to be at the center of talks with President Andrzej Duda.

Another significant moment could come shortly before Biden returns to Washington on Saturday.

At the bustling tea stands and roadside eateries of Delhi, European politics is not a regular topic of conversation.

But with wall-to-wall coverage of the war in Ukraine on television and in the newspapers, petrol prices rising and pressure growing on the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to denounce Russia, Indians are starting to grapple with the consequences of the conflict 2,800 miles away.

Ram Agarwal, a shopkeeper, does not condone the loss of civilian life but nor can he bring himself to criticise Russia. He grew up in the 1950s and 60s when India and the Soviet Union were such close allies that Nikita Khrushchev coined the slogan “Hindi Rusi bhai bhai” (Indians and Russians are brothers).

“I am 74 and my generation grew up with Hindi Rusi bhai bhai. It’s like attacking a dear old friend,” he said.



Arvind Maurya, an electrician, also expressed the even-handedness that has marked much of the public response. “I hear that Ukraine used to be a part of Russia, but instead of respecting that, Nato is pulling Ukraine into its own orbit. But war is never good for anyone and the Russian bombing of civilians is not the way to solve these differences. They must sit down and talk,” he said.

But away from the street, feelings are stronger. Indians from the right and left have converged on the war, the former because of their antipathy towards western culture and the latter because of their anti-Americanism, particularly in relation to foreign policy.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-calls-on-west-for-planes-and-tanks-biden-says-butcher-putin-cannot-remain-in-power-live?page=with:block-62408be78f08118734a736ae

Even as Biden’s words rocketed around the world, the White House attempted to clarify soon after Biden finished speaking in Poland that he was not calling for a new government in Russia.

A White House official asserted that Biden was ""not discussing Putin’s power in Russia or regime change."" The official, who was not authorized to comment by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Biden’s point was that ""Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.""

The White House declined to comment on whether Biden’s statement about Putin was part of his prepared remarks.

""For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,"" Biden said at the very end of a speech in Poland's capital that served as the capstone on a four-day trip to Europe.

Biden has frequently talked about ensuring that the Kremlin's now invasion, now in its second month, becomes a ""strategic failure"" for Putin and has described the Russian leader as a ""war criminal."" But until his remarks in Warsaw, the American leader had not veered toward suggesting Putin should not run Russia. Earlier on Saturday, shortly after meeting with Ukrainian refugees, Biden called Putin a ""butcher.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press that ""it’s not up to the president of the U.S. and not up to the Americans to decide who will remain in power in Russia.""

""Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,"" Peskov added. ""And of course it is unbecoming for the president of the U.S. to make such statements.""

Asked about the impact of such statements from Biden on Russia-U.S. relations, Peskov described it as ""extremely negative."" ""With each such statement, and Biden now prefers to make them daily, he is narrowing the window of opportunity for our bilateral relations under the current administration,"" Peskov said.

This past week, Russians warned John Sullivan, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow, that diplomatic relations were in jeopardy because Washington has imposed painful economic sanctions on Russia. On Thursday, the Russians declared almost a dozen diplomats at the U.S. Embassy as ""persona non grata,"" paving the way for their expulsion. Staffing at the embassy is already thin, and U.S. officials have said further reductions will make it difficult if not impossible to keep it operating.

Biden also used his speech to also make a vociferous defense of liberal democracy and the NATO military alliance, while saying Europe must steel itself for a long fight against Russian aggression.

Earlier in the day, as Biden met with Ukrainian refugees, Russia kept up its pounding of cities throughout Ukraine. Explosions rang out in Lviv, the closest major Ukrainian city to Poland and a destination for the internally replaced that has been largely spared from major attacks.

The images of Biden reassuring refugees and calling for Western unity contrasted with the dramatic scenes of flames and black smoke billowing so near the Polish border — another jarring split-screen moment in the war.

In what was billed by the White House as a major address, Biden spoke inside the Royal Castle, one of Warsaw's notable landmarks that was badly damaged during War II.

He borrowed the words of Polish-born Pope John Paul II and cited anti-communist Polish dissident and former president, Lech Walesa, as he warned that Putin's invasion of Ukraine threatens to bring ""decades of war.""

""In this battle we need to be clear-eyed. This battle will not be won in days, or months, either,"" Biden said.

RELATED: President Biden in Poland for meetings on Ukraine refugee crisis

The crowd of about 1,000 included some of the Ukrainian refugees who have fled for Poland and elsewhere in the midst of the brutal invasion.

""We must commit now, to be this fight for the long haul,"" Biden said.

Biden also rebuked Putin for his claim the invasion sought to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. The president of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelensky, is Jewish and his father’s family died in the Holocaust.

""Putin has the gall to say he’s de-Nazifying Ukraine. It’s a lie,"" Biden said. ""It’s just cynical. He knows that and it’s also obscene.""

Biden also tried to tie the invasion to the former Soviet Union’s history of brutal oppression, including the post-World War II military operations to stamp out pro-democracy movements in Hungary, Poland and what was then Czechoslovakia.

The president defended the 27-member NATO alliance that Moscow says is increasingly a threat to Russian security. He noted that NATO had worked for months through diplomatic channels to try to head off Russia's invasion.

The war has led the U.S. to increase its military presence in Poland and Eastern Europe, and Nordic nations such as Finland and Sweden are now considering applying to join NATO.

""The Kremlin wants to portray NATO enlargement as an imperial project aimed to destabilize in Russia,"" Biden said. ""NATO is a defensive alliance that has never sought the demise of Russia.""

After meeting with refugees at the National Stadium, Biden marveled at their spirit and resolve in the aftermath of Russia’s deadly invasion as he embraced mothers and children and promised enduring support from Western powers.

Biden listened intently as children described the perilous flight from neighboring Ukraine with their parents. Smiling broadly, he lifted up a young girl in a pink coat and told her she reminded him of his granddaughters.

The president held hands with parents and gave them hugs during the stop at the soccer stadium where refugees go to obtain a Polish identification number that gives them access to social services such as health care and schools.

Some of the women and children told Biden that they fled without their husbands and fathers, men of fighting age who were required to remain behind to aid the resistance against Putin's forces.

""What I am always surprised by is the depth and strength of the human spirit,"" Biden told reporters after his conversations with the refugees at the stadium, which more recently had served as a field hospital for COVID-19 patients. ""Each one of those children said something to the effect of, 'Say a prayer for my dad or grandfather or my brother who is out there fighting.""

The president spent time reassuring Poland that the U.S. would defend against any attacks by Russia as he acknowledged that the NATO ally bore the burden of the refugee crisis from the war.

""Your freedom is ours,"" Biden told Poland's president, Andrzej Duda earlier, echoing one of that country's unofficial mottos.

More than 3.7 million people have fled Ukraine since the war began, and more than 2.2 million Ukrainians have crossed into Poland, though it is unclear how many have remained there and how many have left for other countries. Earlier this week the U.S. announced it would take in as many as 100,000 refugees, and Biden told Duda that he understood Poland was ""taking on a big responsibility, but it should be all of NATO's responsibility.""

Biden called the ""collective defense"" agreement of NATO a ""sacred commitment,"" and said the unity of the Western military alliance was of the utmost importance.

""I’m confident that Vladimir Putin was counting on dividing NATO,"" Biden said. ""But he hasn’t been able to do it. We’ve all stayed together.""

European security is facing its most serious test since World War II. Western leaders have spent the past week consulting over contingency plans in case the conflict spreads. The invasion has shaken NATO out of any complacency it might have felt and cast a dark shadow over Europe.

No clear path to ending the conflict has emerged. Although Russian officials have suggested they will focus their invasion on the Donbas, a region in eastern Ukraine, Biden told reporters, when asked whether the Kremlin had changed its strategy, ""I am not sure they have.""",https://www.fox5dc.com/news/biden-meeting-with-polish-president-ukrainian-refugees-on-last-day-in-europe
