Russian journalist Oksana Baulina was killed by a rocket strike while on assignment in Kyiv, according to her employer, the independent news website The Insider.

The site said she ""died under fire"" while ""filming the destruction after Russian troops shelled the Podil district of the capital."" Another civilian was killed in the attack, it added, and two people who were with Baulina were hospitalized with injuries.

Baulina previously worked as a producer for the Anti-Corruption Foundation, the Russian non-profit established more than a decade ago by vocal Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. After the Russian government designated it an extremist organization in June 2021, Baulina had to leave the country in order to continue reporting on government corruption for The Insider, which is headquartered in Latvia.

""Oksana went to Ukraine as a correspondent, she managed to send several reports from Lviv and Kyiv,"" the publication added. ""The Insider expresses its deepest condolences to Oksana's family and friends.""

Baulina's coworkers and supporters are remembering her life on social media and demanding accountability for her death.

Investigative journalist Alexey Kovalyov, who said he had known Baulina for almost two decades and worked with her at several independent outlets, described her in a tweet as having a ""phenomenal sense of moral clarity."" Journalist Christo Grozev called her ""amazingly brave.""

Vladimir Milov, who worked with Baulina at the Anti-Corruption Foundation, vowed in a tweet to avenge her.

""I will never forget her and to all those who are responsible for her death I promise that they won't get away with (only) a trial and a verdict,"" Milov wrote, according to a translation from Al Jazeera.

The Insider said it will continue to cover the war in Ukraine, ""including such Russian war crimes as indiscriminate shelling of residential areas which result in the deaths of civilians and journalists.""

Sergiy Tomalenko, the head of the Ukrainian journalist's union, wrote on Facebook that Baulina was not the only journalist whose death by Russian forces was reported on Wednesday.

Viktor Dêdov, the operator of a local television channel in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol, was reportedly killed there on March 11, according to Facebook's English translation of the post.

Several other journalists have been killed while covering the war in Ukraine since it first broke out a month ago.

They include U.S. video journalist Brent Renaud, Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian freelancer Oleksandra Kuvshynova. Citing Ukrainian reports, the BBC says that Ukrainian journalist Shakirov Dilerbek Shukurovych was killed in late February, camera operator Yevhenii Sakun was killed during Russian shelling of Kyiv's television tower in March and investigative journalist Viktor Dudar died during a battle with Russian troops near the southern city of Mykolaiv.

Tributes to Baulina poured out on Twitter:

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

Oksana Baulina, who previously also worked for the Russian opposition leader Alexander Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, was killed alongside another civilian on Wednesday while reporting for the independent Russian news website the Insider.

Two other people in the group were wounded in the attack which took place in the Podolsky district of Kyiv, the outlet reported.

“The Insider expresses its deepest condolences to Oksana’s family and friends,” it said.

The publication added: “We will continue to cover the war in Ukraine, including such Russian war crimes as indiscriminate shelling of residential areas which result in the deaths of civilians and journalists.”

Baulina, 42, began her career working for lifestyle magazines including Time Out Moscow and In Style, but after a decade she shifted to more political work, becoming a producer for Alexander Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation.

She was briefly jailed when Russian police stormed the group’s headquarters where she was coordinating a live broadcast from a national rally.

Baulina left Russia after authorities declared the Anti-Corruption Foundation an “extremist organization” in 2021 but she continued to report for the Insider and Coda Story.

After Russia invaded Ukraine a month ago, Baulina filed several reports from Kyiv and Lviv in western Ukraine for the Insider.

Sergiy Tomilenko, head of the Ukranian journalists’ union, confirmed the death in a statement on Facebook, saying that Baulina was reporting on the aftermath of a shelling when she was hit by fresh fire.

Oksana was funny, dedicated and extremely brave. She was putting a new life together in Warsaw after having to flee Russia due to Navalny links and determined to do important journalism. Another victim of this awful senseless mess. https://t.co/fHUYm9PCQA — Shaun Walker (@shaunwalker7) March 23, 2022

Alexey Kovalev, the investigations editor at the Latvian-based Russian news website Meduza, paid tribute to Baulina’s “phenomenal sense of moral clarity”.

“Oksana ditched a successful career in glossy magazines (I first met her at Time Out Moscow in 2006 where she edited the fashion section) to become an opposition activist, human rights campaigner and then full time reporter. Arrested several times, her org declared ‘extremist’,” he tweeted.

Anastasia Karimova, a program director at Foundation for Democratic Development in Washington, tweeted: “The Russian army has killed one of Russia’s best people.”

Vladimir Milov, who worked with her at Navalny’s group, vowed to avenge her.

“I will never forget her and to all those who are responsible for her death I promise that they won’t get away with (only) a trial and a verdict,” Milov said on Twitter.

“What an unbelievable horror,” wrote Lyubov Sobol, another prominent member of Navalny’s team.

At least four other reporters have been killed during the conflict: Brent Renaud, an American film-maker, Evgeny Sakun, a cameraman with Kyiv Live TV, Irish cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian producer Oleksandra Kuvshynova. Television news crews have described being shot at even when they have identified themselves as journalists, prompting speculation that they were targeted on purpose.

Paris, March 23, 2022 — In response to the death of Russian journalist Oksana Baulina amid Russian forces’ attacks on Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, the Committee to Protect Journalists issued the following statement calling for the safety of journalists and all civilians to be respected during the conflict:

“We are profoundly saddened by the death of Oksana Baulina, who was tragically killed while on assignment for The Insider,” said Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, in New York. “This is another demonstration of the cruelty of Russia’s war on Ukraine, which has already claimed the lives of at least four other journalists. Ukrainian and Russian authorities must do everything in their power to ensure the safety of journalists and all other civilians, and to thoroughly investigate attacks on members of the press.”

Baulina, a reporter for the independent Latvia-based investigative news website The Insider, was killed on Wednesday, March 23, while reporting in Kyiv’s Podilskyi district, according to a statement published by her outlet, media reports, and The Insider deputy editor Timur Olevskiy, who spoke to CPJ via messaging app.

Baulina was covering Russian forces’ shelling of the city at the time she was killed, according to those sources. The Russian military increased its shelling of residential areas near the center of Kyiv early Wednesday, according to media reports.

The Insider reported that another civilian died in the attack that killed Baulina, and two people accompanying her were wounded and hospitalized.

Baulina covered topics including Russian politics and corruption. Before joining The Insider, she worked for Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, until the organization was put on the list of extremist organizations in June 2021 and she was forced to leave Russia, according to The Insider’s statement.

CPJ emailed the Russian and Ukrainian Ministries of Defense for comment, but did not receive any replies.

At least four other journalists have been killed since Russia started its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February.
