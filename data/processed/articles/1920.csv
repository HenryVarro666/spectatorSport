Jones @Evans707 Not worth the risk mate. Never gonna win the Nations League group so that home game against Poland in September could be the crucial one. Park 11 men behind the ball and play for a 0-0 - qualification for the WC has to be the priority.

Cheryle Johnson “It’s a story that I heard over and over from women refugees in Poland. They told me that their priorities were simple: a safe place to live with their children, far from the bombs and battles.”.

WJJH @vtchakarova Given the daily displeasures of President Zelensky with Western Europe, would Ukraine not be better served to re-esthablishish with Poland & likeminded CEE countries the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, so they can fight/pay for their own wars & have more common ground..

Adam Ciernicki @RadoslawLuczak @JulianRoepcke I suspect the real reasons are far more serious than mistake, otherwise Ukraine would not risk one of key EU relationships. In Poland we did have a National Defence minister who was BANNED by NATO to access any classified documents, never said out loud but he is a Russian asset.
