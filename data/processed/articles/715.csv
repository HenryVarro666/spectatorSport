One in support of Russia and the other in solidarity with Ukraine and in opposition to the war.

Following Saturday’s pro-Russian rally, Armenian peace activists organised an anti-war protest on Sunday, the largest since the war began.

A few hundred demonstrators — Armenians, Russians, and Ukrainians, took to the streets of Yerevan to ‘resist war’, as many of the placards read. The protesters also chanted ‘No to war’ (Нет войне) in Russian throughout the march.

‘Of all countries and capitals, for Yerevan, it was the hardest to “speak out”’, Tigran Amiryan, one of the participants, wrote on Facebook. ‘But despite all the risks, today in the centre of Yerevan, “Putin to The Hague”, “ No to war!” and “Glory to Ukraine!” were heard loud in the streets of the city’.

While the march was the largest such protest since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, it has been preceded by almost a dozen small pro-Ukraine gatherings organised by Armenia’s minor pro-Western political parties and the Ukrainian embassy in Armenia. Several pro-Russian protests have also taken place in the country, since the war began, mainly organised by Armenia’s Communist Party.



In addition to the Communists, the Saturday pro-Russia protest was supported by minor parties opposed to the Nikol Pashinyan administration and known for their fervent support of Armenia joining a ‘Union State’ with the Russian Federation.

The protesters gathered near the Russian embassy of Yerevan before marching into the city centre. Many of the protesters held up cutouts of the Latin letter ‘Z’, which has in recent weeks been adopted by the Russian authorities as a symbol of support for the ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine and sang Russian patriotic songs.

In contrast to the youthful anti-war crowd, the pro-Russia rally appeared to skew older.

The protest was widely covered by Russian state-controlled media, with the apparent aim of giving the impression of mass popular support among Armenians for the invasion. A similar pro-war event was organised on 15 March at a Russian-language secondary school in Gyumri. During the demonstration, the students, most of whom are children of Russian soldiers stationed at a nearby Russian military base, lined up to form a large ‘Z’ in the schoolyard. Some of the students have since told journalists that they were forced to participate.

So far, the Armenian authorities have avoided taking a strong stance on the war, once supporting Russia in a Council of Europe vote to suspend the country, and have since abstained on other international votes concerning the conflict.

Armenia is heavily dependent on Russia, both economically and militarily, especially after the country’s defeat in the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. Two thousand Russian peacekeepers are also stationed in the Armenian-inhabited territories of Nagorno-Karabakh.",https://oc-media.org/armenian-communists-and-peace-activists-hold-competing-ukraine-protests/

YEREVAN, Armenia — As Russia’s economy has plummeted and government restrictions on opposition to the war have increased, Russians have departed their country, suddenly and fearfully, with no time to plan a future or pack cherished belongings. They have left behind family, friends, homes and careers. They are journalists, activists, artists, foodies, mothers and fathers.

Many who made the choice to flee have decamped to this city of about 1 million, where flights are cheap and the cost of living is relatively low compared with capitals in nearby countries. A growing sense of limbo has set in. They spoke to The Washington Post about the whiplash of their exit, the pain of leaving loved ones behind and the difficulty of squaring their national identity with Russia’s invasion.

I am Ukrainian. My father was born there. During the 22 years of Putin’s regime, I stayed in Russia anyway and tried to do something to change the system. But bombing Kyiv was a point of no return for me. I don’t want this [Russian] passport anymore.

My parents in Russia were supportive of my decision to leave. “Go away,” they said.

“First they will strangle Ukrainians there, and then they will strangle Ukrainians here,” my mother said.

For me, there’s a difference between “Russian” as a concept of ethnic identity and “Russian” as a citizen of the country. The authorities in Russia are trying to impose biological nationalism. I am a Russian, I was born in Russia, and for me, it is more like civil nationalism. A Russian is an ethnic Ukrainian, it is an ethnic Georgian, an ethnic Russian, a Belarusian, a Latvian, and so on. But we are all under the umbrella of Russian citizenship.

I’ve been going to protests since I was 18. I had no illusions about the political regime in Russia, and there is a risk of going to jail for my convictions and leaving my children in an orphanage.

We chose Armenia because it had the cheapest tickets and our friends are here. Also for the comfort of our children, there are a lot of people here who knew Russian.

My parents have different positions on us coming here. My dad trusts the government. My mom is more hesitant. We sat up all night with her, and I tried to calmly explain to her my position and complete rejection of this war.

My grandfather was born in Ukraine, but there has always been a tacit rejection of this fact in the family. Before Feb. 24, I used my father’s last name. But now I’ve switched to a Ukrainian last name.

I’m not ready to accept that we left for good. I believed I could influence people with my actions: reviews of modern children’s books, exhibitions about memory and how the 20th century changed people’s consciousness in Russia. To suddenly realize that this was going nowhere was terribly hard for me.

My husband wanted to buy tickets and leave quickly. Our kids made “No to war” posters at school and went to shout in the streets of Moscow. I understood I had to shut them up immediately, because passersby were already looking around. And that was a good reason for me to leave.

I don’t want to make any plans now, but I would like to go back. We’ve done our best to make sure our children have a picture of the world where there are different people, different nationalities, different gender identities. Now that’s broken for them, because so many of those people have fled Russia.

We discussed it many times: If the war starts, we would leave immediately. I can’t be in a country that is now an aggressor. On Feb. 24 I told my husband to sell everything we have, because we don’t have much of a safety net. We’ve spent the last three years manufacturing lightweight and comfortable wheelchairs for children and adults. We had invested everything into this charitable foundation.

I had to a face a choice: stay in Russia and continue to be an activist or leave. I probably would have chosen the first option if I didn’t have children. I certainly ask myself, could I have have done anything else? But I did everything I could. I went to protests until the very last day. I delivered food to those who were arrested. So I don’t have feelings of guilt. I think the blame is always in the hands of those who do this evil.

I don’t see any future for myself in Russia — some very powerful changes have to happen and I’m not sure they can happen in the next 10 years. If there were democracy, that would be enough to go back and rebuild everything.

To be Russian means first of all not being afraid to speak the truth. It is to live by conscience and truth. During the first days of the war, I was not in a position to do anything. I worked for a pro-government media outlet and we had to call the war a “military operation.” I was sickened.

My fiancee was very afraid that I would be drafted. They were mailing out summonses to come to the enlistment office that had no legal basis whatsoever. It was so scary. It’s scary to be sent to a war, but even scarier to be sent to one you don’t want to be in.

I have a lot of relatives and friends in Ukraine. And you know the scariest thing? My grandfather is Ukrainian but worked all his life at a missile plant in Dubna, Russia. Those missiles could now bomb Ukraine.

I have plans to marry my fiancee and go to Spain, to start a new life there from scratch. I don’t want to go back to Russia. You can’t go to a restaurant with your girlfriend in Moscow and then go home while people are being killed in Ukraine. I don’t think it’s right to associate yourself with that country at this point.

On Feb. 24 my friends and I went to the main square in Voronezh. There were already a lot of police and a few people fearfully huddled together on the edges. Everyone was afraid of being arrested. I then realized there would be no big protests in Russia. I decided to pack a suitcase. The fear was very strong, but I was thinking mostly of my friends in Kyiv, sheltering in the subway.

For about 10 years, I’ve been making political art. Now I think it’s impossible to stay in Russia and continue to take risks. I could go to jail for a long period just for some antiwar pictures.

My mother, who is retired, is in Russia. It’s unclear how I can help her now, as all bank cards and Visa and Mastercard do not work. There’s no buckwheat and sugar in her store nearby, and the prices have gone up. But she supports me. I want to bring her to Armenia.

I don’t think in the next year or two Russia will be a good place to live, even if something happens to Putin now and the war in Ukraine stops today. The only way I would go back is if the media becomes independent of the government, which seems fantastical.

Across downtown Yerevan, a similar scene plays out almost daily as crowds of tall, Slavic-looking people — men, women, children, often entire families — conspicuously shuffle about, dragging carry-on luggage behind them as they look for their AirBnBs or hotels.

They are part of the more than 50,000 people estimated to have migrated to Armenia since hostilities began in Ukraine on February 24. The vast majority of new-commers are Russians escaping increasingly brutal political repressions back home as well as rumors of an impending martial law which could see many of them trapped inside Russia. However, smaller numbers of Ukrainians (believed to include those who had been stuck in Russia as well as ethnic-Armenian Ukrainian nationals repatriating) and Belarusians are also looking to make Armenia home.

IT professionals and other highly skilled people make up the bulk of this new wave of Russian émigrés, as entire Russian and international companies continue to relocate their operations to the Armenian capital to avoid the effects of Western sanctions. At least 140 companies relocated, or opened new offices in Armenia in the first two weeks of the war. 113 of these are from Russia, while smaller umbers of Ukrainian, Belarusian, Moldovan and Kazakhstani-registered firms made the move as well, motivated in part by Armenia’s ease of doing business which includes tax wavers for startups, and a particularly low turnover tax rate among many other benefits.

“Our company sent us a message on Saturday morning announcing that they chartered a bus to Demededevo [Moscow’s International airport] later that same day to relocate us to Yerevan,” said Sasha, an IT worker from a city in central Russia. Sasha, whose last name and place of work were withheld for security reasons, says he packed up what he could carry, took his family and flew to Yerevan where his company also maintains offices. “We knew the Caucasus had a tradition for hospitality, but I was surprised by how warmly we were welcomed,” he added.

For many escaping Russians, however, Yerevan was simply one of few remaining options as tit-for-tat overflight bans between Moscow and Brussels closed up most European destinations. “We chose Armenia because it’s close enough and remains one of few places in Europe that isn’t hostile to Russians,” Igor, another newly-arrived Russian, told the Mirror-Spectator. Armenia’s pro-business regulations also make it easy to work out of. Igor noted he was able to find an affordable apartment and open a bank account and is now waiting for his wife and children to join him in Yerevan.

In the wake of the chaotic breakup of the Soviet Union, a few newly independent states suddenly found themselves in possession of an abundance of Soviet nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles. Ukraine inherited a 1,900-warhead arsenal including intercontinental ballistic missiles and long-range bombers. In fact, for several years after it became independent, Ukraine was the de facto third largest nuclear weapons state in the world.

More than 90% of Ukrainians (a majority in every region of the country including now-Russian-occupied Crimea) voted to confirm Ukraine’s independence from Moscow. Despite this new national confidence, enough citizens felt threatened by their Russian former overlord that there was a real debate about whether Ukraine should keep its nuclear arsenal.

In the end, a concerted diplomatic push by the United States in the name of nonproliferation secured an important victory when Ukraine joined the U.S., U.K., and Russia in signing the “Budapest Memorandum” on December 5, 1994. In this agreement, Ukraine surrendered its entire nuclear arsenal in return for explicit security assurances by Russia and its co-signers. Notably, they all agreed to “refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.”

As Ukrainians are painfully aware, Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine is not the first time its reneged on this promise: Russia has effectively been at war with Ukraine for eight years.

In February, according to at least one source, President Putin’s approval rating was 71%—the highest since May 2018.

The invasion of Ukraine certainly looks different from within Russia, where one cannot publicly refer to Putin’s “special military operation” as a war without risking a penalty of up to 15 years in prison. Playing on Russians’ deep historical trauma of World War II, Putin has cynically cast the invasion as an effort to “de-nazify” Ukraine, in which hundreds of thousands of Russians lost their lives battling Nazi Germany. Since the invasion began, Putin has relentlessly tightened his chokehold on expression and thought in Russia, blocking broadcasts by the BBC, Voice of America, and Radio Free Europe, chasing out foreign journalists, shuttering domestic independent news, and cutting off access to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. According to the independent human rights project OVD-Info, as of mid- March, nearly 15,000 Russians have been detained for participating in anti-war protests.

In the run up to the war, Putin’s propaganda worked: according to a national poll conducted in February by an independent group, Putin’s personal approval rating was 71%, the highest in almost four years. In the same survey, only 23% of respondents opposed the military operation in Ukraine. One month into the war, the Russian public’s awareness of the bloodshed remains muffled.

Most analysts conclude that Putin believed he could capture or bend Ukraine to his will in a matter of days. As the fighting moves into its fifth week, free channels of communication like the Telegram messaging service may poke holes in the official line, as stories and images are shared of the thousands of funerals taking place for young Russian soldiers killed in Putin’s war. Russia’s economic isolation grows by the day, as does the number of citizens detained or fined for protesting the war. As much as Putin may yearn for the totalitarian days of the Soviet empire, Russian society has come a long way since then.

80,000 Ukrainian women are due to deliver a child within the next three months

Amid the larger human tragedy of Putin’s war on Ukraine, on March 14 we were reminded of the particular toll that war takes on women when news broke that an expectant mother injured in a Russian attack on her maternity hospital died, along with her baby. She was one of some 80,000 Ukrainian women due to give birth in the next three months, according to the United Nations, now facing the horrors of war while struggling to support new lives entering the world. In Kyiv, a team of nannies have stayed behind to care for 19 babies who were recently born to surrogate mothers and are now trapped by the war, their parents unable to reach them and their citizenship uncertain. Other women have refused to abandon the elderly, disabled, even pets stranded in shelters.

Around the world, war puts women and girls at heightened risk of gender-based violence, exploitation, and trafficking, and the lack of access to essential health care services, water, food, and hygiene puts them at a greater risk for sickness and death. As we grapple with the increased vulnerabilities of women and children in crisis, we also recognize the contributions women make during war, and in conflict prevention and resolution efforts.

March is Women’s History Month. The theme for 2022 is Providing Healing, Promoting Hope. Originally conceived to celebrate the outsized role of women as health care providers and caregivers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the theme serves equally well in recognizing women in wartime. In Ukraine, women are leading humanitarian aid efforts, documenting the crisis, baking bread for their soldiers, and mass producing Molotov cocktails. Many Ukrainian women, including Ukrainian Parliament Member Kira Rudik, have taken up arms against Russia. Fifteen percent of Ukrainian soldiers are women, and even more women are fighting in resistance groups. A growing number of Ukrainian women from abroad are returning to support Ukraine.

It is not just Ukrainian women fighting this unjust war. An interesting feature of the growing anti-war movement in Russia is the role that women are playing, risking their freedom in street protests and their careers—including one woman who interrupted a live television broadcast to raise awareness of the propaganda.",https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/one-time-nukes-polling-propaganda-ukrainian-women

A crucial portion of the world’s wheat, corn and barley is trapped in Russia and Ukraine because of the war.

The war in Ukraine has delivered a shock to global energy markets. Now the planet is facing a deeper crisis: a shortage of food.

A crucial portion of the world’s wheat, corn and barley is trapped in Russia and Ukraine because of the war, while an even larger portion of the world’s fertilizers is stuck in Russia and Belarus. The result is that global food and fertilizer prices are soaring. Since the invasion last month, wheat prices have increased by 21 percent, barley by 33 percent and some fertilizers by 40 percent.

The upheaval is compounded by major challenges that were already increasing prices and squeezing supplies, including the pandemic, shipping constraints, high energy costs and recent droughts, floods and fires.

Now economists, aid organizations and government officials are warning of the repercussions: an increase in world hunger.

The looming disaster is laying bare the consequences of a major war in the modern era of globalization. Prices for food, fertilizer, oil, gas and even metals like aluminum, nickel and palladium are all rising fast — and experts expect worse as the effects cascade.

“Ukraine has only compounded a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe,” said David M. Beasley, the executive director of the World Food Program, the United Nations agency that feeds 125 million people a day. “There is no precedent even close to this since World War II.”

Ukrainian farms are about to miss critical planting and harvesting seasons. European fertilizer plants are significantly cutting production because of high energy prices. Farmers from Brazil to Texas are cutting back on fertilizer, threatening the size of the next harvests.

China, facing its worst wheat crop in decades after severe flooding, is planning to buy much more of the world’s dwindling supply. And India, which ordinarily exports a small amount of wheat, has already seen foreign demand more than triple compared with last year.

Around the world, the result will be even higher grocery bills. In February, U.S. grocery prices were already up 8.6 percent over a year prior, the largest increase in 40 years, according to government data. Economists expect the war to further inflate those prices.

For those living on the brink of food insecurity, the latest surge in prices could push many over the edge. After remaining mostly flat for five years, hunger rose by about 18 percent during the pandemic to between 720 million and 811 million people. Earlier this month, the United Nations said that the war’s impact on the global food market alone could cause an additional 7.6 million to 13.1 million people to go hungry.

The World Food Program’s costs have already increased by $71 million a month, enough to cut daily rations for 3.8 million people. “We’ll be taking food from the hungry to give to the starving,” Mr. Beasley said.

Rising prices and hunger also present a potential new dimension to the world’s view of the war. Could they further fuel anger at Russia and calls for intervention? Or would frustration be targeted at the Western sanctions that are helping to trap food and fertilizer?

While virtually every country will face higher prices, some places could struggle to find enough food at all.

Armenia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Eritrea have imported virtually all of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine and must find new sources. But they are competing against much larger buyers, including Turkey, Egypt, Bangladesh and Iran, which have obtained more than 60 percent of their wheat from the two warring countries.

And all of them will be bidding on an even smaller supply because China, the world’s biggest producer and consumer of wheat, is expected to buy much more than usual on world markets this year. On March 5, China revealed that severe flooding last year had delayed the planting of a third of the country’s wheat crop, and now the upcoming harvest looks bleak.

“This year’s seedling situation can be said to be the worst in history,” said China’s agriculture minister, Tang Renjian.

Rising food prices have long been a catalyst for social and political upheavals in poor African and Arab countries, and many subsidize staples like bread in efforts to avoid such problems. But their economies and budgets — already strained by the pandemic and high energy costs — are now at risk of buckling under the cost of food, economists said.

Tunisia struggled to pay for some food imports before the war and now is trying to prevent an economic collapse. Inflation has already set off protests in Morocco and is helping stir renewed unrest and violent crackdowns in Sudan.

“A lot of people think that this is just going to mean that their bagels are going to become more expensive. And that’s absolutely true, but that’s not what this is about,” said Ben Isaacson, a longtime agriculture analyst with Scotiabank. Since the 1970s, North Africa and the Middle East have grappled with repeated uprisings. “What actually led to people going into the streets and protesting?” he said. “It starts from food shortages and from food price inflation.”

Countries afflicted by protracted conflict, including Yemen, Syria, South Sudan and Ethiopia, are already facing severe hunger emergencies that experts fear could quickly worsen.

In Afghanistan, aid workers warn that the humanitarian crisis has already been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, making it more difficult to feed the roughly 23 million Afghans — more than half the population — who do not have enough to eat.

Nooruddin Zaker Ahmadi, the director of Bashir Navid Complex, an Afghan imports company, said that prices were rising across the board. It took him five days in Russia this month to find cooking oil. He bought 15-liter cartons for $30 each and will sell them at the Afghan market for $35. Before the war, he sold them for $23.

“The United States thinks it has only sanctioned Russia and its banks,” he said. “But the United States has sanctioned the whole world.”

For the global food market, there are few worse countries to be in conflict than Russia and Ukraine. Over the past five years, they have together accounted for nearly 30 percent of the exports of the world’s wheat, 17 percent of corn, 32 percent of barley, a crucial source of animal feed, and 75 percent of sunflower seed oil, an important cooking oil in some parts of the world.

Russia has largely been unable to export food because of sanctions that have effectively cut it off financially. Ukraine, meanwhile, has been cut off physically. Russia has blocked the Black Sea for exports, and Ukraine lacks enough rail cars to transport food overland.

What is now becoming more worrisome is the next harvest, particularly in Ukraine. On March 11, Ukraine’s agriculture minister begged allies for 1,900 rail cars of fuel, saying that the country’s farms had run out after supplies were diverted to the military. Without that fuel, he said, Ukrainian farmers would be unable to plant or harvest.

There are other hurdles. The United Nations estimated that up to 30 percent of Ukrainian farmland could become a war zone. And with millions of Ukrainians fleeing the country or joining the front lines, far fewer can work the fields.

Russian and Ukrainian wheat is not easily replaced. Inventories are already tight in the United States and Canada, according to the United Nations, while Argentina is limiting exports and Australia is already at full shipping capacity. Over the past year, wheat prices are up 69 percent. Among other major food exports of Russia and Ukraine, corn prices are up 36 percent and barley 82 percent.

The war also threatens another longer-term shock to the food markets: a shortage of fertilizer.

Matt Huie, a farmer near Corpus Christi, Texas, said that skyrocketing prices had already forced him to stop applying fertilizer to the grazing fields that nourish his hundreds of cows, assuring that they will be skinnier come slaughter. Now he is worried he will have to also reduce fertilizer for his next corn crop, which would slash its yield. “We’ve gotten into uncharted territory,” he said.

Russia is the world’s largest fertilizer exporter, providing about 15 percent of the world supply. This month, just as farmers around the world prepared for planting, Russia told its fertilizer producers to halt exports. Sanctions already were making such transactions difficult.

Sanctions also have hit Russia’s closest ally, Belarus, a leading producer of potash-based fertilizer, critical for many major crops including soybeans and corn. But even before the Ukraine war, Belarus’s fertilizer exports were blocked because of sanctions over its seizure of an expatriate dissident who had been a passenger in a Ryanair jetliner forced to land in the country.

In another ominous signal to fertilizer customers, earlier this month European fertilizer producers said they were slowing or halting production because of soaring energy prices. Many fertilizers are made with natural gas.

The world’s major fertilizers have now more than doubled or tripled in price over the past year.

Brazil, the world’s largest producer of soybeans, purchases nearly half its potash fertilizer from Russia and Belarus. It now has just three months of stockpiles left. The national soybean farmers association has instructed members to use less fertilizer, if any, this season. Brazil’s soybean crop, already diminished by a severe drought, is now likely to be even smaller.

“They’re preventing fertilizers from getting to producing countries,” said Antonio Galvan, the soybean association’s president, criticizing international sanctions. “How many millions are going starve to death because of the lack of these fertilizers?”

Brazil sells most of its soybeans to China, which uses much of the crop to feed livestock. Fewer, more expensive soybeans could force ranchers to cut back on such animal feed, meaning smaller cows, pigs and chickens — and higher prices for meat.

Jon Bakehouse, a corn and soybean farmer in Hastings, Iowa, said he prepaid for fertilizer late last year because he worried about a looming shortage.



His fertilizer still has not arrived, and he now has less than a month to apply it to his corn crop. Without it, he said, his yields would be halved.

“You know when they show the cars jumping in slow motion and the passengers inside are up in the air? That’s what it feels like,” he said. “We’re all just kind of suspended in the air, waiting for the car to land. Who knows if it’s going to be a nice, gentle landing, or if it’s going to be a nosedive into the ditch.”
