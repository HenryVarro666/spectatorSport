Russia today launched all-out war on Ukraine with a multi-pronged assault on the country from the north, south and east after Vladimir Putin personally gave the order for his forces to attack.

Extraordinary video showed what appeared to be a cruise missile slamming into Ivano-Frankivsk airport, also in the west. Russian troops were filmed parachuting into Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city which sits on the eastern border with Russia.

While video filmed in Odessa, in the country's southwestern corner, showed the sky light up bright white by an explosion. Similar footage from Kharkiv showed a massive explosion within the city, though it was not clear what the target was.

Luhansk, Sumy, Kharkiv, Uman and Chernihiv in the east of Ukraine all reported coming under attack, but blasts were also reported in the west - in Zhytomyr and Lviv, close to the border with Poland.

Cruise missiles, guided bombs and GRAD rockets also took out targets from east to west - aimed at airfields, military bases, ammo dumps, and command posts.

Russian President Putin has targeted airports across Ukraine, among them Chuguyev airport near Kharkiv, in the country's east in what appears to be a strategic bid to cripple the country and take control of the skies as soldiers squeeze from the north, east and south.

Moscow has boasted of taking full control of the skies - though Ukraine reported that six Russian jets were shot out of the sky over the eastern Donbass region with 50 Russian troops killed.

Just after midday on Thursday, the skies Gostomel air base, just on the outskirts of Kiev, swarmed with a squadron of 20 Russian helicopters which pounded the air base's runway.

But Ukrainian ground forces launched a fight-back, moving in to retake the air field as jets streaking over the city, shooting down the Russian helicopters.

The attack underlined just how close the invaders were not to the capital. Soon after, the distant roar of fighter jets high above the city stoked another wave of panic.

US intelligence chiefs had already said the city was at particular risk of being targeted in a Russian invasion as it is close to the Ukrainian-Russian border.

Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister, said on Facebook that the Russian military had launched missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipro.

And on Wednesday night, a huge military convoy of more than 100 trucks with soldiers were heading in the direction of the city.

Russian troops have launched targeted missile strikes on Ukrainian military command facilities, air bases and military depots in what appears to be a strategic bid to cripple the country.

The invasion marks the most concerted attempt to up-end world order since the end of the Cold War, and risks sparking the bloodiest conflict in Europe since the end of the Second World War.

Explosion in Odessa

Video from Krasnopillia, near Odessa in the southwestern corner of Ukraine purported to show part of a ground invasion with blinding bright light and a smoke cloud hanging over the area

Video from Krasnopillia, near Odessa in the southwestern corner of Ukraine, showed the night sky lit up bright white following an explosion.

It came after Vladimir Putin gave an extraordinary early-morning address to the Russian nation - delivered during a UN meeting aimed at avoiding war - in which he declared a 'special military operation' to 'de-militarise' and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine in what amounted to a outright declaration of war.

The Russian strongman also issued a chilling warning to any country thinking of coming to Ukraine's aid, vowing 'consequences greater than any you have faced in history'.

Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a 'full-scale invasion' and said Ukraine will 'defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.'

Air raid warning sirens blare in Kiev

Video filmed in the capital Kiev showed air sirens wailing as residents woke up to a Russian invasion after weeks of warnings that Putin was preparing a land, air and sea assault.

Terrified citizens rushed to bomb shelters through the night despite no air raid warnings sounded in the capital until early morning - only the frequent muffled crump of missile or air strikes breaking through the pre-dawn stillness.

Others reported sheltering in subways and basements as the sounds of distant explosions became a constant backdrop.

Images from Kiev showed highways out of the city gridlocked as people tried to flee after Russian bombs started to fall - but with the whole country under simultaneous attack, there was little safety to be found.

Images and video posted to pro-Russian Telegram channels show the pizza shop—its windows blown out and the cyclist lying dead in the street.

Russia has insisted its operations have been targeted to knock out military and command infrastructure in Ukraine. These images, however, show the human toll already being levied on Ukraine.

Amid the bombardment, Breslav Union Bauman, a Jewish cultural center and charity, uploaded video of smoke rising from outside the city. “Uman residents were prepared,” the union’s leadership wrote in Hebrew.

“The place is equipped with heating and refreshments as well as with a stock of mattresses,” a spokesperson for the union told Foreign Policy. They have also opened a clinic and are trying to diffuse information to the local Jewish population.

“We hope for good news and pray very much for peace and that peace and quiet will return soon without further casualties and without sorrow,” the spokesperson added.

Irena Plantova, a lawyer for Breslav Union Bauman, told Foreign Policy that bombing began around 5 a.m. local time. At first, airstrikes targeted a military base outside the city. “After, they began to damage here,” Plantova said. She said it’s “unpredictable” where the strikes may hit. Strikes continued until around 1 p.m. Thursday and remained quiet as evening fell.

Plantova confirmed that one woman died in the town and said 25 individuals have been injured.

In the morning, she said there was a scramble to leave town, but many stayed. “First, it was panic,” she said. “Everybody was running to buy food.”

Uman has had a significant Jewish population since its inception in the 18th century. However, the local population was the target of anti-Jewish pogroms. Despite that, the Jewish population stayed in the town: By the start of World War II, Uman had a Jewish population of more than 22,000 people. An estimated 17,000 Jews were exterminated by the Nazi regime during the Holocaust.

Plantova drew the comparison to what the village faced then and now. “People are comparing Hitler and Putin,” she said.

Since the end of the war, Uman has reemerged as a cultural and religious hub for Jews in Ukraine and further abroad. Nachman of Breslov—father of the Breslov Hasidic sect and great-grandson of the rabbi considered the founder of the modern Hasidic movement—is buried in Uman. Every year, tens of thousands of pilgrims flock to Uman during Rosh Hashanah to visit Breslov’s grave. The most recent pilgrimage, in December 2021, earned it the title of “Jewish Burning Man.”

Even though some have fled, Plantova said she will stay in Uman. “I’m going to stay. I need to care about the grave,” she said.

First and foremost, though, she said, “We need to care about community.” She expects Uman will try and defend itself if Russian troops approach. “We are trying to help whenever we can,” she said.

“Right now, we can just prepare.”",https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/25/ukraine-russia-jewish-town-missiles/

When explosions first rang out across Ukraine around 5 a.m. local time on Thursday, residents scrambled for cover and headed for the country’s borders to flee to safety. Moscow had officially launched a series of attacks on the country, which Russian President Vladimir Putin had been foreshadowing.



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was under attack “from the south, north, east and from the air.” Russian ground forces entered regions across the country, bombs fell on major cities, and cruise and ballistic missiles targeted military control centers in the area of the capital, Kyiv. On the second day of the advance, as the capital was rocked by explosions, residents and leaders braced for the city to be overrun.

By Thursday afternoon, Russian forces had taken control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant north of Kyiv where a 1986 reactor explosion caused the release of large amounts of radiation into the environment.

The invasion represents what could be the largest security threat to Europe since World War II. Ukrainian officials reported that more than 100 Ukrainian soldiers and Russian soldiers have died, along with at least several civilians. The Ukrainian government warned residents in Obolon, a district north of the capital, not to go outside early Friday.

""The house is completely destroyed,"" she continued. ""There are no windows, no doors, one door even flew out, even the floor has been completely ripped off. I am just very lucky. I must have a very strong guardian angel for me to have stayed alive. I will stand up and go. I will do everything for Ukraine, as much as I can, with as much energy as I have. I will always only be on my motherland’s side.”

The United States observed Russia using short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and surface-to-air missiles, according to MSN.



The impacts of these missile strikes on the Ukrainian people are shown in videos shared across social media.

Hostomel airbase

As of Thursday evening, a fierce battle for the strategic airbase close to Kyiv appeared to be continuing after Russian helicopters and airborne troops attempted to establish a bridgehead outside the city.

Videos on social media – among the most dramatic to have emerged since the invasion began – depicted a swarm of Russian Ka-52 and Mi8 helicopters descending on the Antonov military airfield.

Ukraine said it had downed three helicopters in the initial assault, but a lunchtime report from CNN showed Russian forces in control of at least some of the base. Shortly after, however, Ukraine’s armed forces chief said Kyiv’s forces were fighting back in a critical early battle.

Justin Bronk​, of the Rusi thinktank, said if airborne assault troops could take and hold the airbase, the Russians could use it to rapidly build up forces ahead of heavy ground troops to put pressure on the capital. “However, it’s high risk because until ground forces link up, the airborne assault forces are deep in Ukrainian territory and dependent on aerial resupply, casualty evacuation and fire support,” he said.

Chernobyl and the north

A Ukrainian presidential adviser said Ukraine had lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site in the north, where fighting raged after Russian troops crossed the border from Belarus. The adviser said authorities did not know the current condition of the facilities at the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster.

Ukraine’s interior ministry warned that if artillery fire was to hit waste stored after the 1986 disaster, it could lead to “radioactive nuclear dust” being spread “over the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and the countries of the EU”.

The Chernobyl exclusion zone lies directly in the path of what western experts believe is the principal invasion route from Belarus to the west of Kyiv, where Ukraine’s presidential palace and key buildings are located.

Russian troops also advanced from the north on the city of Chernihiv. One axis of advance appears to have centred around the Senkivka border crossing to the north-east of Chernihiv. Crucial, perhaps, in this calculation is the fact that south of Chernihiv – which lies to the east of the Dnieper river – lies the E95 highway to Kyiv.

Kharkiv and the east

A substantial attack appeared aimed towards the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has a population of more than 1 million. Multiple reports from Kharkiv described explosions nearby – while Ukraine’s defence ministry said mid-morning that “fierce fights” were taking place in that area.

Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Ukraine’s former defence minister, said Russian forces were trying to surround Kharkiv. “It seems like Kharkiv at the moment is the main target,” he said.

Kherson and the south

Russian forces heading north into Ukraine from Crimea were not meeting any obvious resistance, at least initially. Border guards released security camera footage on Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea.

Social media footage appeared to show Russian forces reaching the city of Kherson on the Dnieper, 80 miles (130km) inside Ukraine. Shortly after, around lunchtime, the presidential adviser said fierce fighting was taking place there.

Film posted online was said to show Russian helicopters over the nearby Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Russian forces had also moved north-eastwards from Crimea to Melitopol, where the presidential adviser said they would meet resistance.

Zagorodnyuk said: “They are quite close to the city of Kherson now. The situation is really critical there.”

Missile strikes

Air and missile strikes appear so far to be mostly focused on military targets, including an air defence site in the frontier down of Mariupol, the Ukrainian naval base in Ochakiv and an arms depot in Kalynivka, 124 miles (200km) south-west of Kyiv, according to the defence intelligence specialists Rochan Consulting.

Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had destroyed 74 “objects of above-ground military infrastructure”, though this could not be confirmed. The US said it believed Russia launched 100 missiles and used 75 aircraft in the first wave of bombing.

Casualties

Information on casualties has been hard to verify, though on Thursday evening Ukraine’s health minister said 57 people had been killed and 169 injured.

Ukraine’s armed forces earlier reported that at least 40 soldiers had died. The Ukrainian presidential adviser said up to 10 civilians had been killed. The mayor of Mariupol said three civilians had been killed there and emergency services in Kharkiv said a boy had been killed after shelling struck an apartment building. The local administration in Odesa said 22 people had died in a strike on a military base.

How the militaries compare

Russia has amassed more than 150,000 combat troops on the borders of Ukraine, with a further 34,000 lightly armed separatist forces in the pro-Russian self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk. That amounts to an estimated two-thirds of Russia’s total ground forces. Half of Moscow’s air force is also deployed in the region.

Ukraine’s forces are considerably smaller. It has a regular army that numbers 125,600, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, but has mobilised reserves of at least 36,000.

Some of the Russian ambition has been aimed explicitly at demoralising Ukrainian civilians with the reach of the offensive. While much of the initial barrage was aimed at the east of Ukraine, so far, more sporadic strikes on cities in the west, from Uman to Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, seem designed to demonstrate the reach of Russian weapons.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/war-ukraine-kyiv-map-where-has-russia-attacked
