Videos appear to show missiles striking Russian oil depot

On April 1, reports and videos surfaced online showing a possible attack on Russia‚Äôs Belgorod oil depot. The facility in question is located roughly thirty-five kilometers from the border with Ukraine. While facility owner Rosneft gave no information about the cause of the fire, Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov blamed the attack on the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Reuters reported. ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äôs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he could not confirm or deny reports of Ukrainian involvement in the strike as he did not have military information,‚Äù the report added. ‚ÄúThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry and the general staff did not respond to requests for comment.‚Äù

In one video, several missiles appear to strike the facility as two helicopters fly over it. The DFRLab geolocated the video and confirmed that it was filmed just north of the Belgorod oil refinery. According to timestamps on CCTV footage from the scene, the attack was carried out around 5:43am local time.

Other videos and drone footage of the oil depot showed several fires at the site. There is speculation that an attack was carried out by two Mi-24 attack helicopters, launching multiple S-8 unguided missiles. This is supported by footage that shows helicopters flying at a low altitude.

South Ossetian soldiers depart Ukraine, returning to Georgia

On March 31, reports emerged in Georgian Telegram channels that up to 300 South Ossetian soldiers left their posts and hitchhiked back home after being sent to fight against Ukraine. The former president of the Russian-occupied region of South Ossetia, Eduard Kokoity, confirmed that some soldiers had traveled back to South Ossetia. ‚ÄúNobody has the right to judge these guys or accuse them of cowardice,‚Äù Kokoity said. ‚ÄúWe need to look at the root causes of what happened and find out how their participation was organized. We will deal with this in the most serious manner.‚Äù

Images circulated in Telegram channels allegedly depict the returned South Ossetian soldiers near the Russia-South Ossetia border. The DFRLab geolocated the images to Nizhny Zaramag, a border checkpoint between South Ossetia and North Ossetia.

300 Russian-Ossetian soldiers reportedly left Ukraine on their own and returned to Tskhinvali region.

The Telegram channel VChK-OGPU (–í–ß–ö-–û–ì–ü–£), which describes itself as a platform exposing the ‚Äúsecrets of officials, oligarchs, gangsters, and strongmen,‚Äù offered an explanation for the South Ossetian soldiers‚Äô return. According to the channel, the soldiers did not run away but were brought back by Kokoity. The channel claims that the soldiers sent to Ukraine were listed as volunteers and not as servicemen of the Russian 58th Army. In addition, the soldiers reportedly lacked bulletproof vests and traveled to Ukraine without weapons or equipment. At this time, the DFRLab cannot independently verify these claims.

Accusations fly as Russian deputy threatens Azerbaijan with nukes and Azerbaijan puts him on Interpol wanted list

On Monday, the Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that it would launch an investigation into the actions of the Russian peacekeeping contingent in Nagorno-Karabakh. The decision came after the Russian Ministry of Defense accused Azerbaijan of violating the Nagorno-Karabakh peace agreement by occupying the village of Parukh (Farukh in Azerbaijani) before eventually evacuating it. The Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense accused Russia of spreading false claims, saying they had not evacuated the village, while Armenia expressed frustration at Russia for making the same claim. This indicates that Armenia and Azerbaijan both have concerns about Russian peacekeepers, who have been deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh since November 2020, following a six-week war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

The previous day, Mikhail Delyagin, Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Economic Policy in the Russian State Duma, escalated matters when he told the Rossiya24 TV show ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù that Russia needed to ‚Äúpunish Baku‚Äù because Azerbaijan aggravated the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh while Russia is occupied with Ukraine. Following the broadcast, Delyagin posted a poll on his Telegram channel with the question: ‚ÄúDo you think it would be justified to use tactical nuclear weapons to eliminate the oil industry of Azerbaijan due to its aggression triggered by belief in the powerlessness of Russia, whose military resources are diverted to Ukraine?‚Äù As of March 31, more than 21,000 users had voted in the poll, with 56 percent of them selecting ‚Äúno, it is unacceptable‚Äù and 31 percent selecting ‚Äúyes, this is necessary ‚Äì Turkish proxies in Baku will not understand anything else.‚Äù

In response to the provocative poll, Azerbaijan‚Äôs Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office has opened a criminal case against Delyagin and added him to an international wanted list through Interpol. Azerbaijan is charging Delyagin with using the media to call for aggressive war; threats to commit an act of terrorism; and incitement of national hatred by threatening the use of force. The prosecutor‚Äôs office stated that Azerbaijan had sent requests to several partner countries to arrest and extradite Delyagin if he traveled to their territory.

Delyagin has since apologized for his statement and claimed the comments and Telegram poll were not addressed to the Azerbaijani people or state, but targeted at a part of the Azerbaijani bureaucracy, which he said had decided to take advantage of Russia‚Äôs focus on Ukraine and neglect its peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh.

On March 28, the Press Council of Azerbaijan criticized Russia for blocking Azerbaijani media outlets due to their reporting on Ukraine. The council said that Azerbaijani media websites were blocked because Russia is unhappy with them taking an objective position on the Russia-Ukraine war. The council underlined that Russia neglects freedom of speech and expression and prevents Russians from receiving objective information. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Russian censor Roskomnadzor blocked access to four Azerbaijani media websites, including Haqqin.az, Minval.az, baku.ws, and Oxu.az. Some news organizations said their websites were blocked without any formal notice from Roskomnadzor. In response to Roskomnadzor‚Äôs actions, Azerbaijan‚Äôs Ministry of Digital Development and Transport hinted that it might block Russian media websites if they disseminate information against Azerbaijan‚Äôs interests and territorial integrity.

Russia falsely accuses Hunter Biden of funding Ukrainian biolabs ‚Äì again

The Russian Ministry of Defense is attempting to breathe new life into the debunked conspiracy theory that the US and Ukraine are using biolabs to weaponize deadly viruses. In the latest iteration of the conspiracy, the Russian MoD claims that Hunter Biden, son of US President Joe Biden, is working with the Pentagon to fund a ‚Äúmilitary biological program in Ukraine.‚Äù The Russian MoD prepared slides that allegedly connected the US president‚Äôs son with ‚Äúsecret biolabs‚Äù in Ukraine.

In the slides, the Russian MoD shared biographies of Americans it believes are working on the biolabs program, including US Defense Threat Reduction Agency staff. The slides also included several images of documents that are difficult to read due to their size. Among these were one titled, ‚ÄúRisk evaluation of dangerous pathogens transmitted by birds during migration,‚Äù while another focused on the potential epidemiological threat of laboratory research taking place in Kherson. The slides also shared an authentic US patent for a mosquito-delivering drone called a ‚Äútoxic mosquito aerial release system.‚Äù

Another slide discussed Baykar, the Turkish company that produces the Bayraktar TB2 drone. A question-and-answer style document alleges to show responses from Baykar to Motor Sich, a Ukrainian airplanes engine manufacturer. The Russian MoD highlighted a question about the ability of the drone to carry and spray liquid or aerosols from a 20-liter container, implying the Ukrainians intend to use the drones to spray biological weapons. While the document‚Äôs legitimacy is questionable, Baykar‚Äôs response to the question was simply ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Furthermore, the document is written in Russian and English, which suggests it is not authentic as a genuine copy would more likely be written Ukrainian and English.

The biolabs conspiracy has been widely debunked. Hunter Biden‚Äôs alleged involvement was also debunked by the Washington Post. The US Embassy in Ukraine has also addressed the conspiracy by noting that its partnership with Ukraine aims to reduce biological threats.

Poll suggests Putin‚Äôs popularity is rising in Russia

Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs approval rating in the country has increased since the start of the war, according to independent Russian pollster Levada Center. The center, which Russia has labeled a foreign agent, published its latest poll on March 30.

According to the poll, Putin‚Äôs approval rating had reached 83 percent, a twelve-point rise since February. It is Putin‚Äôs highest rating since 2017, after which his popularity dropped due to pension reforms. Only 15 percent of Russians currently disapprove Putin, a 12-point decrease from February.

Meanwhile, the amount of respondents who believe that the country is generally moving in the right direction increased from 52 percent in February to 69 percent in March, while those who think it is moving in the wrong direction decreased from 38 percent to 22 percent.

Trust in Putin rose from 34 percent to 44 percent. He remains the most trusted individual in the country, followed by Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, whose trust rating increased from 12 percent to 28 percent. Trust in Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, and ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky also rose in the latest poll.

For the first time since October 2015, the share of those who approve of the State Duma (59 percent) surpassed the share of those who do not (36 percent). Seventy percent of Russians approve of the government‚Äôs activities, while 27 percent did not, a change of 15 points in each direction since February.

Russia‚Äôs IT regulator attempts to silence Wikipedia for the second time

Russian communications watchdog Roskomnadzor announced on March 31 that it is fining Wikipedia RUB 4,000,000 (more than USD $48,000) for not deleting ‚Äúfalse information on the subject of a special military operation of the RF Armed Forces in Ukraine, aimed at misinforming Russian users.‚Äù Wikipedia‚Äôs Russian branch said that it was not clear who would be the recipient of the fine. ‚ÄúPerhaps it will be the Wikimedia Foundation,‚Äù the local branch speculated. Earlier, on March 29, Wikipedia‚Äôs Russian branch said it had received a notification demanding it delete the article ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs Invasion in Ukraine (2022).‚Äù

This is the second time Roskomnadzor has demanded that Wikipedia delete an article about Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. On March 1, the Russian Wikipedia branch published the first notification they received from Roskomnadzor, which threatened to block Wikipedia in Russia. In response, Wikipedia published an article in Russian explaining what to do if Wikipedia is blocked.

Russians condemning the war in Ukraine face harsh backlash

On March 31, various Telegram channels belonging to independent media outlets in Russia reported on a schoolteacher facing ten years in prison for condemning Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine. On March 18, Irina Gen reportedly tried to explain to two of her eighth-grade students why they were prohibited from attending karate and swimming competitions in Europe. Gen became emotional and condemned Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, saying that it was ‚Äúright‚Äù to ban Russia from sports competitions in Europe. ‚ÄúUntil Russia starts behaving in a civilized way, this will continue forever,‚Äù she said.

Someone in the classroom recorded Gen‚Äôs words and submitted the audio recording to local police. On March 30, police reportedly detained her. Gen pleaded guilty and is now facing a ten-year sentence.

Elsewhere in Russia, on March 31, the documentary festival Artdocfest opened with the theme ‚ÄúNo war!‚Äù According to Current Time, an independent television program now banned in Russia, a festival theater was evacuated fifteen minutes prior to the start of a documentary. As attendees filed out to the street, an unknown man with a coffee cup approached festival organizer Vitaly Mansky and said provocatively, ‚ÄúI suggest that you hold this festival in the Donbas, where people have been dying for eight years‚Ä¶Why didn‚Äôt you do anything there?‚Äù Mansky turned away and did not respond. The unknown man proceeded to throw a red substance from the coffee cup on Mansky‚Äôs back, as seen in a video on the pro-Kremlin RTVI Telegram channel. Later, Mansky published a video from a kitchen where the festival organizers had gathered after the incident, announcing the immediate closing of the festival. ‚ÄúThere is no freedom beyond the kitchen in Russia,‚Äù Mansky said. The festival has faced pressure from Russian authorities since 2014.

On March 31, Anna Netrebko, a Russian opera singer, wrote on Facebook: ‚ÄúI expressly condemn the war on Ukraine, and my thoughts are with the victims of this war and their families.‚Äù Two days later, the Novosibirsk State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater announced that Netrebko‚Äôs June 2 concert had been canceled due to her condemnation of Russia. ‚ÄúWe are sure that the truth is with us,‚Äù the theater‚Äôs announcement concluded. ‚ÄúWe should not be afraid that there are cultural figures who renounce their homeland. Our country is rich with talents, and yesterday‚Äôs idols will be replaced by others with a clear civic position.‚Äù

South Ossetia announces plans to unify with Russia as Abkhazia intends to remain independent

On March 30, Anatoly Bibilov, the Kremlin-backed leader of the Russian-occupied region of South Ossetia, said that the region will take ‚Äúappropriate legal steps in the near future‚Äù to ensure unification with its ‚Äúhistoric homeland ‚Äì Russia.‚Äù

Andrei Klimov, deputy head of United Russia‚Äôs international cooperation commission, said that South Ossetia should hold a referendum to unite with Russia, Civil.ge reported. Following Klimov‚Äôs statement, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow would treat the proposed referendum with respect. ‚ÄúWe have not taken any legal or other actions in this regard. But at the same time, in this case, we are talking about expressing the opinion of the people of South Ossetia, we treat them with respect,‚Äù said Peskov.

On March 31, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that the US would not recognize any results ‚Äúof any effort by Russia or its proxies to divide sovereign Georgian territory.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúJust as the United States did not recognize Russia‚Äôs illegal seizure and attempted annexation of Crimea in 2014 and just as we did not recognize the Kremlin‚Äôs cynical attempt to recognize independence of the so-called DNR [Donestk People‚Äôs Republic] and LNR [Luhansk People‚Äôs Republic] in eastern Ukraine, just before it launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, we will not recognize the results of any effort by Russia or its proxies to divide sovereign Georgian territory.‚Äù

Following the South Ossetia announcement, Aslan Bzhania, the head of occupied Abkhazia, stated that Abkhazia does not plan to join Russia and will remain independent. ‚ÄúSovereign, independent Abkhazia is growing and will continue to grow brotherly, allied relations with Russia,‚Äù he added.

The previous day, RT editor-in-chief and Kremlin propagandist Margarita Simonyan visited Abkhazia. She stated in her Telegram channel that she met with Bzhania and opened a media center. She then questioned why Russia and Abkhazia needed a border crossing. ‚ÄúMillions of Russians who annually cross this border and our allies are now shedding blood for us,‚Äù she added. Telegram commenters supported Simonyan, replying that there should be no border between Abkhazia and Russia and that Abkhazia should follow the example of South Ossetia on becoming part of Russia. The post garnered 968 comments. Margarita Simonyan‚Äôs Telegram channel has more that 219,000 subscribers.

(We) appreciate that India is taking this situation in the entirety of facts, not just in a one-sided way,‚Äù Sergei Lavrov said in New Delhi as he met counterpart S. Jaishankar.

‚ÄúFriendship is the key word to describe the history of our relations and our relations were very sustainable during many difficult times in the past,‚Äù Lavrov said, speaking in English.

11:40am: Ukraine has shown ‚Äòmuch more understanding‚Äô of the situation in Crimea and Donbas, says Lavrov

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that some progress had been made at peace talks with Ukraine and that Moscow was preparing its response to Ukrainian proposals.

Speaking at a briefing after talks with his Indian counterparts, Lavrov said that peace talks with Ukraine needed to continue but that Kyiv had shown ‚Äúmuch more understanding‚Äù of the situation in Crimea and Donbas and the necessity of its neutral status.

11:15am: Russian forces withdrawing from Chernihiv area, says local governor

Russian forces are withdrawing from the Chernihiv region of northern Ukraine but have not yet left entirely, the local governor said in a video address on Friday.

‚ÄúAir and missile strikes are (still) possible in the region, nobody is ruling this out,"" Governor Viacheslav Chaus said, adding that Ukrainian forces were entering and securing settlements previously held by Russian troops.

Chaus said it was still too early for Ukrainian forces in the Chernihiv region to let their guard down as Russian troops ‚Äúare still on our land"". Russia said on Tuesday it would scale down operations in the Chernihiv and Kiev regions.

10:59am: ‚ÄòNot yet clear‚Äô if Mariupol evacuations will happen on Friday, says Red Cross

The Red Cross said it was ""not yet clear"" that the evacuation of civilians from the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol would go ahead as planned on Friday.

""We remain hopeful, we are in action moving towards Mariupol ... but it's not yet clear that this will happen today,"" Ewan Watson, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told reporters in Geneva, as an ICRC team of three cars and nine staff headed towards the city.

09:05am: Ukraine air strike on petrol depot in Russia's Belgorod, says local official

‚ÄúThere was a fire at the petrol depot because of an air strike carried out by two Ukrainian army helicopters, who entered Russian territory at a low altitude,‚Äù Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on his Telegram channel.

Two employees at the storage facilities were injured as a result of the fire, he said in another post. Some 170 personnel were trying to put out the blaze, according to Russia's emergencies ministry. Rosneft, which owns the facility, told Russian news agencies that it had evacuated staff from the premises.

On Wednesday, explosions could be heard from an arms depot in Belgorod but the authorities did not provide any explanation for the blasts.

Belgorod lies some 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Russia's border with Ukraine and some 80 kilometres from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, which has been pummelled by Russian forces since Moscow launched its war on February 24.

08:54am: French actor criticises Putin‚Äôs 'crazy, unacceptable excesses' in Ukraine

French actor G√©rard Depardieu, who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past, has criticised his ‚Äúcrazy, unacceptable excesses‚Äù in Ukraine.

Depardieu, who took up Russian nationality in 2013, told Agence France Presse on Thursday: ‚Äúthe Russian people are not responsible for the crazy, unacceptable excesses of their leaders like Vladimir Putin.‚Äù

Depardieu also said he would give all the proceeds from three nights of concerts in Paris from April 1 to ‚ÄúUkrainian victims of this tragic fratricidal war"".

08:14am: Russia preparing for 'powerful strikes', says Zelensky

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Russia is consolidating and preparing ‚Äúpowerful strikes‚Äù in the country‚Äôs east and south, including besieged Mariupol, where a new attempt will be made Friday to evacuate civilians from the devastated city.

Russia meanwhile threatened to turn off its gas taps to Europe if payments are not made in rubles, as US President Joe Biden ordered a record release of strategic oil reserves to ease soaring US prices.

Over a month into Russia's invasion of its neighbour, Vladimir Putin's troops have devastated cities like Mariupol with shelling, killing at least 5,000 people in the port city alone.

In peace talks this week, Russia said it would scale back attacks on the capital Kyiv and the city of Chernigiv, but Ukrainian and Western officials have dismissed the pledge, saying Moscow's troops were merely regrouping.

‚ÄúThis is part of their tactics,‚Äù said Zelensky in a late-night address.

07:15am: EU to push China at virtual summit to not support Russia

Chinese President Xi Jinping will hold the videoconference with EU leaders Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, carrying through on an annual exercise that was skipped last year as tensions simmered.

""The meeting will focus on the role we are urging China to play, to be on the side of the principles of international law without ambiguity and exert all the necessary influence and pressure on Russia,"" said French European affairs minister Clement Beaune, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency.

‚ÄúThis was not the initial purpose of the summit but it necessarily became one,‚Äù Beaune said, though he insisted other topics such as climate and trade ‚Äúwould not disappear‚Äù.

The EU-China summit is usually an effort to deepen trade ties. But, last year's exchange of tit-for-tat sanctions over the plight of China's Uyghur minority, followed by Beijing's trade coercion of EU-member Lithuania over Taiwan, soured preparations for the meeting.

KHRESTYSHCHE, UKRAINE ‚Äî This town is slowly fading away. Most residents have fled after nearly a decade of bloody conflict since Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Ukrainian provinces took up arms against the Ukrainian state. One morning this week, a half dozen elderly women, some of the remaining 1,500 residents in town, huddled outside the only church in the village.

They were nervous. Here on the most hotly contested front line of the conflict, Russian airstrikes have drawn closer and the din of war grows louder. The incessant thud of artillery striking a village 10 miles away, echoed through the valley below, interrupting their prayer. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know who, or what is being fired at,‚Äù said 65-year-old Valentina, who said she was too afraid to give her last name.

The eastern region of Ukraine, known as the Donbas, has emerged as the most critical battlefield at this stage in the war between Russian invaders and Ukrainian forces trying to protect their homeland. Russian President Vladimir Putin has set his sights on taking full control of this region as he withdraws his forces from the outskirts of Kyiv, according to intelligence assessments. Analysts believe Putin will redeploy forces here for a new offensive and in an effort to save face after humiliating setbacks elsewhere, setting the stage for increasingly brutal battles for control.

Washington Post journalists spent two days this week traveling the region, approaching within six miles of advancing Russian military units. They interviewed Ukrainian military commanders and soldiers, local officials in towns under increasing pressure from Russian bombardments and terrified civilians whose ravaged homes, schools, churches and businesses are suddenly on the front lines of a war that is drawing ever closer.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a dream, I can‚Äôt believe this is happening,‚Äù said 32-year-old Victoria Debediova, who fled with her son to this village last month, believing the rural hamlet would be safer than the nearby town of Slovyansk. ‚ÄúNowhere is safe now and the Russians are getting closer every day.‚Äù

As she spoke, another loud explosion boomed in the distance. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Russian airstrike,‚Äù said a Ukrainian soldier hurriedly passing through the small town. His weary fellow fighters led him away, admonishing him in whispered tones for sharing information with journalists.

The war has brought new arrivals to the area as people flee from towns close to the fighting. Residents interviewed watched as Ukrainian military vehicles barreled through their village, shuttling nervous young men toward the sound of war. Hundreds of the heavily armed soldiers now roam small villages and rural encampments dotting the region.

Twenty miles away, the mayor of the strategically important town of Izyum announced Friday that Russian forces had taken control of the town after three weeks of ferocious fighting. Russian forces had encircled the town on March 26, pummeling those trapped inside with airstrikes and salvos of heavy artillery. Local officials said 20,000 residents and Ukrainian fighters still in the town are facing a ‚Äúhumanitarian catastrophe‚Äù and uncertain future at the hands of Russian troops.

‚ÄúThe battle for Izyum is not over,‚Äù Mayor Valeriy Marchenko said in a written statement released Friday evening. ‚ÄúSoon our army will surely liberate the town from Russian occupiers and save the people of Izyum.‚Äù

Izyum is located at the highest point of elevation in the Kharkiv region, on a strategic piece of ground called ‚ÄúKramiyanets‚Äù or ‚ÄúFlint Hill.‚Äù The elevated position towers over the hills that define this land. From there, major roadways and adjoining villages are visible for miles. Taking it would give Russian forces the ability to control the surrounding areas and limit the movement of Ukrainian forces mounting any counteroffensive.

‚ÄúIzyum is the last fighting position for our forces before the Donetsk region, the town is the gate to Donbas,‚Äù said Maksym Strelnik, a member of the city council. He said Russian forces seem to be trying to surround Ukrainian forces in Donetsk and Luhansk, two provinces that make up the Donbas region. Russia has also supported separatists that have been fighting Ukrainian forces there for years and now seems to be prioritizing a military campaign to take full control.

The Ukrainian military announced Thursday that Russian forces are gathering strength ahead of a planned offensive toward the nearby regional capital of Kramatorsk, just under 30 miles from Izyum. If successful, that would threaten supply lines to embattled Ukrainian combat forces that have endured weeks of fighting to avoid being encircled by Russian forces.

As the fighting inched closer to Kramatorsk, local government workers and engineers from the Ukrainian military placed concrete barricades and ‚Äúhedgehog‚Äù antitank barriers across the city along all possible avenues of approach by invading forces. Fortified artillery firing positions, camouflaged from Russian reconnaissance units, were seen placed in wooded areas surrounding major towns and villages.

Over the course of two days, reporters from The Post observed more than 15 truckloads of heavily armed Ukrainian military personnel traveling toward the fighting in Donetsk. The military columns were made up of at least two dozen military vehicles, including air defense systems, armored troop carriers and tanks. They were supported by groups of soldiers who were seen patrolling country roads as backhoes cut through the black soil to create fortified trenches capable of withstanding Russian artillery strikes.

Ukrainian defensive lines close to borders that define separatist territories remained largely intact despite ceaseless missile barrages. Ukrainian officials have also alleged that separatist fighters from the Donetsk and Luhansk People‚Äôs Republic, as Russia refers to the areas, have also used white phosphorus, a highly flammable and deadly weapon. But Ukrainian military positions, hardened by eight years of war, have held, preventing a possible Russian advance from the eastern flank.

The governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, has embraced his role as a wartime leader helping to organize the effort to defend his homeland. He said in an interview Tuesday that after more than a month of war, the days blur together. He said he spends long hours reviewing the latest damage reports from Russian shelling and fielding calls from local officials organizing the evacuation of civilians.

What little sleep he gets is interrupted regularly by air raid sirens. The large network of air-defense systems in the region targets Russian bombers entering Ukrainian airspace. Just 20 miles from active combat, Kramatorsk has been spared the destruction suffered in places like Mariupol and Kharkiv, largely because those air defense systems have kept Russian pilots at bay and stopped many missiles.

Kyrylenko, too, is concerned by the risk of encirclement by Russian forces. ‚ÄúWe are looking at the map, all the time, every day, multiple times a day,‚Äù he said. As he spoke, with a Glock pistol on his hip and an assault rifle slung across his chest, he was interrupted by an air raid siren that forced him and visiting journalists to seek refuge in a bomb shelter.

‚ÄúThe risk definitely exists, and we are fortifying those locations where the enemy might target‚Äù so that ‚Äúthe Russian occupiers won‚Äôt just be pushed back but destroyed completely,‚Äù Kyrylenko said.

Preparations extend beyond fortifying defensive positions. Deep inside territory held by Ukraine, its security services have stepped up efforts to identify suspected collaborators and Russian intelligence assets operating within the region. Several have been captured.

The Ukrainian security services have found them with equipment to document coordinates of Ukrainian military positions. Officials found evidence that they have helped Russian forces adjust their artillery fire in real time. In addition, the Secret Service of Ukraine has arrested agents providing images and videos for Russian social media propaganda.

Kyrylenko said focusing attention on those agents ensures that Ukrainians ‚Äúwon‚Äôt get hit with a knife in the back.‚Äù He has suspended civilian rule and imposed military control in 11 districts near Kramatorsk previously controlled by the opposition party. On Tuesday, he submitted a request to President Volodymyr Zelensky to add another.

Since the start of the war in late February, the Secret Service of Ukraine has identified more than 550 suspected collaborators in the Donetsk region accused of treason. Many are in territory controlled by the Russian military. A Russian ballistic missile strike on March 6 obliterated the regional offices of the Ukrainian intelligence agency, further complicating the hunt for Russian collaborators. The powerful explosion also destroyed a nearby kindergarten.

In some cases, collaborators have included local government officials who have provided actionable intelligence to Russian forces, shelling neighbors and friends trapped inside their own towns, Ukrainian officials said. They have also used their detailed knowledge of the local terrain to help advancing Russian forces.

In Izyum, Strelnik said, a city council member from the opposition party guided a Russian armored column down an unguarded stretch of road to avoid the Ukrainian defensive positions. Ukrainian forces defending the city were encircled by the betrayal, he said. After a week of heavy fighting, Russians controlled the town.

Civilians continue to flee the area in record numbers. About 4,000 people from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions are evacuating daily on buses, trains and private vehicles, according to local officials. Those families able to evacuate on their own wait in packed vehicles for hours at lines stretching for miles at fortified checkpoints to have their documents checked.

Inside the Kramatorsk train station, the numbers of those fleeing the coming Russian forces has swelled in recent days. Many wait hours to secure a seat on the four trains leaving daily toward the relative safety of western Ukraine. Hundreds of people, mostly women and children, waited for one train to Lviv on Tuesday that had been organized by the local government.

Many of the recent arrivals to the train station are from Slovyansk. At least a fifth of those living in the city, located just miles away from Russian large artillery, and the deadly Smerch rocket systems, have fled, according to Vadim Liakh, head of city council.

‚ÄúThe whole city is a front line now,‚Äù said Lilya Borisova, who decided to evacuate her hometown after a heavy night of Russian bombardment. She gathered what belongings she could fit in two suitcases and took her teenage daughter to the Kramatorsk train station, hoping to secure a seat on a train evacuating civilians.

‚ÄúWe are trying to stay positive. Our parents, our husbands, are back protecting the city,‚Äù said Taesia Samoilenko, who left her husband behind in Slovyansk to protect their home. Her eyes briefly welled with tears as she spoke about her husband, looking away from her two children as she composed herself.

Back in the village of Khrestysche, those who remained waited nervously as Russian forces pushed closer to their homes. ‚ÄúIf we survive, I‚Äôll leave on foot with my suitcases,‚Äù said Debediova, standing outside a small store in the center of the village.

As she spoke, her voice cracked with emotion and she wiped away tears. She repeated over and over, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to live in Russia. I don‚Äôt want to live in Russia.‚Äù

4,f5a1d6da-f87c-4d04-9e00-4be4e0374cba,[],,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) ‚Äî Talks to stop the fighting in Ukraine resumed Friday, as another attempt to rescue civilians from the shattered and encircled city of Mariupol was thrown into jeopardy and Russia accused the Ukrainians of a cross-border helicopter attack on an oil depot.

The governor of Russia‚Äôs Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said an airstrike on Russian soil by a pair of helicopter gunships caused fires and wounded two people. Several nearby businesses were also reported hit.

‚ÄúCertainly, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks,‚Äù Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, five weeks into the war that has left thousands dead and driven more than 4 million refugees from Ukraine.

The Russian claim could not immediately be verified. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he could ‚Äúneither confirm nor reject the claim that Ukraine was involved in this, simply because I do not possess all the military information.‚Äù

Russia has reported cross-border shelling from Ukraine before, including an incident last week that killed a military chaplain, but not an incursion of its airspace. The depot, run by Russian energy giant Rosneft, is about 35 kilometers (21 miles) from the Ukraine border.

Meanwhile, Russian troops were withdrawing from areas around Kyiv, three days after Moscow said it would reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital and the northern city of Chernihiv to promote trust between the two sides and help the negotiations.

But Ukraine and its allies have warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating but regrouping, resupplying its troops and redeploying them to the country‚Äôs east for an intensified assault on the predominantly Russian-speaking Donbas region, which includes Mariupol.

The latest negotiations, taking place by video, follow a meeting Tuesday in Turkey, where Ukraine reiterated its willingness to abandon a bid to join NATO and declare itself neutral. In return, it proposed that its security be guaranteed by several other countries.

The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, wrote on social media that Moscow‚Äôs positions on retaining control of the Crimean Peninsula ‚Äî seized from Ukraine in 2014 ‚Äî and expanding the territory in eastern Ukraine held by Russia-backed separatists ‚Äúare unchanged.‚Äù

The International Committee for the Red Cross struggled to work out an operation to send emergency aid into Mariupol and bring civilians out by bus.

The strategic southern port city on the Sea of Azov has seen some of the worst suffering of the war, with weeks of heavy fighting and shortages of water, food and medicine. Around 100,000 people are believed to be in the city, down from a prewar 430,000.

‚ÄúWe are running out of adjectives to describe the horrors that residents in Mariupol have suffered,‚Äù Red Cross spokesperson Ewan Watson said. ‚ÄúThe situation is horrendous and deteriorating, and it‚Äôs now a humanitarian imperative that people be allowed to leave and aid supplies be allowed in.‚Äù

City authorities said the Russians were blocking access to Mariupol and it was too dangerous for people to leave on their own. Those who have fled have mostly done so via private cars, but working vehicles and fuel are in short supply.

‚ÄúWe do not see a real desire on the part of the Russians and their satellites to provide an opportunity for Mariupol residents to evacuate to territory controlled by Ukraine,‚Äù Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

He said Russian forces ‚Äúare categorically not allowing any humanitarian cargo, even in small amounts, into the city.‚Äù

On Thursday, Russian forces blocked a 45-bus convoy attempting to evacuate people from Mariupol, and only 631 people were able to leave in private cars, the Ukrainian government said. Russian forces also seized 14 tons of food and medical supplies bound for Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

In the past few days, the Kremlin, in a seeming shift in its war aims, said its ‚Äúmain goal‚Äù now is gaining complete control of the Donbas. Mariupol‚Äôs capture would be a major prize for the Russians, giving them an unbroken land bridge to Crimea.

The Donbas is the industrial region of eastern Ukraine where Moscow-backed separatists have been battling Ukrainian forces since 2014. The separatists have declared two areas independent republics.

Despite its pledge to scale back, Russian forces have subjected both Chernihiv and Kyiv to continued air- and ground-launched missile strikes. But Ukraine‚Äôs military said it has retaken control of 29 settlements in the two regions, where Russia has pulled back some of its troops.

Russian troops in the northeast also continued to shell Kharkiv, and in the southeast sought to seize the cities of Popasna and Rubizhne as well as Mariupol, the Ukrainian military said.

Invading forces also withdrew from the heavily contaminated Chernobyl site in northern Ukraine early Friday.

Ukraine‚Äôs state power company, Energoatom, said Russian soldiers had received ‚Äúsignificant doses‚Äù of radiation from digging trenches in the exclusion zone around the closed nuclear power plant. But the International Atomic Energy Agency said it could not independently confirm that, and there was no immediate comment from the Kremlin.

Energoatom gave no details on the condition of the soldiers and did not say how many were affected.
