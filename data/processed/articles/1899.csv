IRPIN, Ukraine—This suburb northeast of Kyiv has become one of the most fiercely contested and symbolic battlegrounds of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. It was claimed this week that Ukrainian forces had succeeded in vanquishing the invaders after hundreds of civilians were slaughtered in the Russian advance on the capital city.

A few days after the mayor announced that Irpin had been liberated, we set out to see for ourselves.

After a 20-minute drive from Kyiv on Thursday, a French colleague, myself, and our driver Sasha arrive in Stoyanka, on the western edge of the capital. The place is devastated: A gas station has collapsed under shelling, and burnt-out vehicles are spread on the highway leading to Jytomyr. This is one of the last checkpoints on the road to Irpin.

The exhausted members of the Territorial Defense manning it try to dissuade us from going any farther. “It’s not safe there!” warns Viktor, a twentysomething carrying an AK-74 on a sling. He invites us for coffee in their base, a former Georgian restaurant called Radio Tbilisi. We share a cigarette and discuss our idea of going to Irpin. He disapproves. The whole city has not been declared safe and it remains within range of artillery and rockets.

After weighing the risks, we decide to try our luck nonetheless. “It’s your responsibility,” sighs Viktor, as he shakes our hands.

A winding road through a forest takes us to the entrance of Irpin. As we approach the city, Sasha stops the car. Roughly 500 meters up ahead, a black car bearing a spray-painted white “V” is blocking the road. Its windows seem shattered, its trunk is open. We hesitate. “It could be the Russians,” our driver says warily. About five minutes later, a Ukrainian soldier emerges from the forest. We ask him if it’s safe to progress any farther. He shrugs. “Maybe.” We decide to go for it.

A few miles ahead, we encounter members of Ukraine’s special forces clearing out the city. After a bit of negotiating, their commanding officer, Phil, agrees to show us around the town. “I’ll only be able to take you around the area we’ve cleaned. The rest of the city is not safe,” he said. We set out on foot for a nearby two-story house, where soldiers are taking a break.

Phil barks orders in Ukrainian, and the men start picking up their gear. One of them shows off his Savage sniper rifle with child-like enthusiasm. “It’s American!” he tells us with a smile. Once they’re ready, Phil turns to us: “Have you guys ever seen a body without a head? It’s not pretty.” We’ve been warned that there are four civilians lying dead farther up the road, killed by either shrapnel or snipers. According to the mayor of the town, Oleksandr Markushyn, between 200 and 300 residents of Irpin have been killed since the beginning of Russia’s invasion.

“Let’s go,” says Phil. We snake through alleyways, keeping close to the walls of the houses. Every building in this residential area bears the scars of fighting: The windows are destroyed, the façades riddled with holes from bullets or shrapnel. Around the corner of a house, we come across a bus bearing a red cross that’s been shot at, its windows shattered. Inside, a teddy bear lies face down, covered in dirt. “They shoot at children, the fucking bastards!” a soldier exclaims. On the front seat of the bus, a first-aid kit has been opened, its contents scattered on the floor.

We move farther up the road. As we progress into the city, the rhythmic thud of air defense systems can be heard echoing through the surrounding forest. “It’s ours,” says one of the soldiers with a smile. We are taken through a building site where we encounter the first dead body, a man wearing blue jeans and a blue jacket. “Brace yourselves,” says Phil, as he points toward another body, a hundred meters ahead. It’s a man. His face has rotted away, exposing his skull. A part of the torso is missing. His belongings are scattered all around. Once we’ve received the all-clear from a spotter, we move ahead, covered at all times by a marksman. Behind us, soldiers are keeping watch.

“Watch your feet,” a soldier tells me as we make our way through an open field. “For mines?” I inquire. “Yes, that kind,” as he points toward the dogshit that litters the place. He laughs.

Around 50 yards ahead, the body of a man is rotting away, his ribcage exposed. Another, a woman, lies face-down next to a small crater. Her body has been covered with a jacket. “A mortar killed them,” says Phil. As we stop to take pictures of the scene, one of the soldiers escorting us discovers yet another body behind a nearby fence: It’s a woman in a pink jacket, still clutching her purse. “She’s probably been there for a couple of days,” he says, as he hangs her belongings on a nearby post. To facilitate her identification later, he tells me.

We walk back onto the main road, up to a gray Renault that, we’re told, has been run over by a Russian tank. Thankfully, no one seems to have been inside at the time. A school bag rests against the rear left wheel. That’s as far as we’ll go into Irpin. “The rest of the city is not cleared yet,” says Phil, as he points toward high-rise apartment buildings in the distance. On the way back, the Ukrainian soldiers insist on showing us a car that was supposedly stolen by Russian soldiers trying to flee the city. The car, a white BMW bearing a spray-painted “V” on its doors, is filled with laptops, phones, as well as ammunition. We’re told that the Russians looted the nearby houses on their way out of the city. We ask about the fate of the driver. “He was killed.” Despite our inquiries, we get no further details.

After having been assured over the radio that the way is clear, Phil leads us back to the entrance of the city. As we get into our car, he waves at us and shouts, “Glory to Ukraine!” before heading back toward Irpin.",https://www.thedailybeast.com/irpin-liberated-by-ukraine-but-the-scars-of-horror-remain

Here are the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:

– Ukrainian strike in Russia: local governor –

Ukrainian helicopters have carried out a strike on a fuel storage facility in Russia’s western town of Belgorod, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the border, according to the local governor.

“There was a fire at the petrol depot because of an air strike carried out by two Ukrainian army helicopters, who entered Russian territory at a low altitude,” Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on his Telegram channel.

On Wednesday, explosions could be heard from an arms depot in Belgorod but the authorities did not provide any explanation for the blasts.

– EU to urge China rethink on Russia –

The EU is set to hold a virtual summit with China against a backdrop of increasing alarm over Beijing’s growing proximity with Moscow and its reluctance to condemn its invasion of Ukraine.

French European affairs minister Clement Beaune says the meeting will notably include “the role we are urging China to play.”

– US warns India on Moscow links –

The US has warned India over its close Moscow links after Delhi abstained from UN resolutions censuring Russia over Ukraine.

India continues to buy Russian oil from its “longstanding and time-tested friend” but Daleep Singh, Washington’s chief sanctions strategist, has been quoted as saying on an India visit that Delhi cannot rely on Russia when it comes to relations with China.

“Russia is going to be the junior partner in this relationship with China. And the more leverage that China gains over Russia, the less favourable that is for India,” Indian media quoted Singh as saying.

– Russia preparing ‘powerful strikes’: Kyiv –

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky is warning that Russia is consolidating and preparing “powerful strikes” in the country’s east and south, including besieged Mariupol, where a new attempt was due to be made Friday to evacuate civilians from the devastated city.

NATO also says it is not seeing a pull-back of Russian forces in Ukraine and expects “additional offensive actions”, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg warns.

– EU parliament leader visiting Kyiv –

European Parliament President Roberta Metsola says she is on her way to Ukraine, making her the first EU leader to visit the war-torn country.

– Russia leaving Chernobyl with hostages –

Russian forces have begun to pull out of the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power site and move towards Belarus, but took an unspecified number of captive Ukrainian servicemen with them, officials in Kyiv say.

– Putin may be ‘isolated’: Biden –

US President Joe Biden says that Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin may be “isolated” and could have placed some of his advisors under “house arrest”.

In his first public remarks on Western assessments of Kremlin tensions over the war in Ukraine, Biden also says he is “sceptical” about Moscow’s claim to be scaling back its onslaught in parts of the country.

– New gas war front –

Putin says “unfriendly” countries, including all EU members, must set up ruble accounts to pay for gas deliveries from April, or “existing contracts would be stopped”.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz insists payments continue in euros or dollars, while France says Paris and Berlin are preparing for a cut in Russian gas deliveries.

– Buses en route to Mariupol –

Ukraine’s government is sending 45 buses to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol, where Russia has declared a local ceasefire following a global outcry over the suffering of civilians trapped by a month of relentless shelling.

– ‘Longer’ conflict possible: US –

Russia’s refocusing of its military efforts on the Donbas could herald a “longer, more prolonged conflict” as Ukrainian forces put up fierce resistance there, a senior US defence official says.

“It’s been fought over now for eight years,” the official says of the heavily contested region.

– Putin ratings up –

Putin’s ratings have received a boost since the start of military actions in Ukraine, Russia’s independent Levada Centre polling institute says, with more than 80 percent of Russians saying they support his actions.

The first poll the centre has conducted since the conflict began shows 83 percent of Russians back their leader, up from 71 percent in early February.

– Biden taps oil reserves –

Biden announces an unprecedented release of crude from US strategic oil reserves, saying it will “ease the pain” of rising fuel prices for Americans.

– New US sanctions –

The United States hits a series of Russian tech firms with sanctions, including the nation’s largest chip maker Mikron.

– Russia bans EU leaders –

Russia says it will expand the list of EU figures banned from entering the country following Western sanctions.

Faced with a Russian blockade of its own ports, Ukraine is seeking to export the farm goods that many countries depend on via the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta.

The solution is crucial both to Ukraine’s economy and to entire populations that rely heavily on its wheat and sunflower oil.

Bucharest has confirmed that discussions are underway with Kyiv, pointing out that Constanta already handles some imports to Ukraine and exports from it.

Before the war, Ukraine accounted for 12 percent of global wheat exports, 15 percent of maize and 50 percent of world sunflower oil.

“We and our partners are looking for alternative logistical routes to export our goods via European ports, including Constanta,” Ukrainian Agricultre Minister Mykola Solsky said recently.

– Ukraine ports blockaded –

The presence of Russian battleships and mines in Ukrainian waters renders commercial shipping there nearly impossible.

Since the start of the war, Russian forces have been blocking access to the southeastern Ukrainian ports of Berdiansk and Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, which opens into the Black Sea.

In the southwest, the crucial Black Sea port of Odessa lies perilously close to the frontline at Mykolaiv.

Odessa handles 90 million tonnes of shipments a year — 60 percent of the country’s total port traffic — and is in the Krelmin’s sights.

The Marine Traffic website, which tracks the position of all seagoing vessels, clearly shows the de facto blockade of these waters.

Commercial ships have been absent from the zone since missile attacks on vessels sent their insurance premiums rocketing.

According to the agriculture ministry, Ukraine is currently losing $1.5 billion (1.4 billion euros) a month because of the stranglehold on port exports.

Meanwhile countries that depend on Ukrainian farm exports, particularly on the southern coasts of the Mediterranean, are seeing a food crisis start to develop.

Kyiv says it has sufficient stocks to meet Ukraine’s own food needs for the next two years. But it is equally keen to ensure exports continue as normal.

“Ukraine wants to show it is defending its export markets as well as its territory and is conscious of its importance as a supplier of both foodstuffs and industrial goods,” said Paul Tourret, head of France’s Isemar Institute, which specialises in the maritime economy.

– Alternative options –

Kyiv is seeking to increase grain exports to Poland, Romanian and Slovakia by rail and, to a lesser extent, by lorry.

The Romanian and Ukrainian rail companies are discussing ways of cooperating, the Bucharest government said.

The goal is to export 600,000 tonnes per month, which nonetheless remains “marginal” compared to the export capacity of Ukraine’s sea ports, said Agritel analyst Gautier Le Molgat.

Tourret said Constanta represents the best option. Romania is a member of NATO, meaning its waters are protected. And as the EU’s second largest wheat exporter after France, it has the necessary infrastructure.

Constanta is the largest port on the Black Sea. It handled more than 67 million tonnes of exports in 2021, including more than 25 million tonnes of grains. It has a total capacity of 100 million tonnes.

The port is in a position to accept Ukrainian stocks because by this time of year, Romanian grain shipments have already left for their destinations.

However, if the blockade of Ukraine’s own ports were to last until the forthcoming harvests, Constanta’s storage capacity could be stretched to the limit.

“Romania also has something to gain from this … a moral benefit,” Romanian Defence Minister Vasile Dincu said recently.

The speaker of the Romanian parliament and the transport ministry announced earlier this week that new investments were planned for Constanta port.

– Getting to Constanta –

The crucial element is getting merchandise out of Ukraine and into Constanta.

There are several potential routes, Tourret said.

The most dangerous option is to transport goods by lorry from Odessa, along the Black Sea coast as far as the Danube river port of Galati and then by boat to the canal which links the river to Constanta. That takes one or two days.

A second possibility is to transport goods via Moldova, avoiding the border region of Transdniestr, which seceded in 1990 and hosts a Russian military base.

Avoiding this region under de facto Russian control can involve a detour of several hundred kilometres, depending on the starting point.

The third choice is the longest but currently the least hazardous. It entails crossing Ukraine’s western border, the area least affected by the war, straight into northern Romania.

This route is currently used, in the other direction, to supply Ukraine with essential goods.",https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/ukraine-eyes-romanian-port-for-key-farm-exports/article

The region that now encompasses the nation of Ukraine has known wars and uprisings for more than a millennium. Over the centuries, it has been variously ruled by the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires, among other powers, and it was part of the Soviet Union from 1922 until it gained independence in 1991, when the USSR fell apart.

Russia’s current president, Vladimir Putin, clearly believes that it should still belong to his country, and in 2014, he forcibly annexed the portion of Ukraine called Crimea, and he backed separatist rebels of the two republics in the Donbas region. On Feb. 21, Russia recognized the two republics as independent states. (Russia is high on the list of the countries with the largest militaries.)

All that was prelude to a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, beginning on Feb. 24 of this year. Since that time, the world has read daily stories about the conflict – the first major land war in Europe since World War II.

As the war waged, we have learned that the formidable Russian army is less competent than was believed, and that the Russians, frustrated by their lack of battlefield success, have taken to attacking civilian targets in many cities. We also learned that the Ukrainian people, civilians as well as armed forces, are willing and able to fight long and hard to protect their country and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a former television comedian, has evolved into a strong and determined leader.

Meanwhile, an estimated 4 million people have fled Ukraine to escape the war – the majority of them going to neighboring Poland – and another 6.5 million have left their homes within the country. (These are the countries where the most Ukrainian refugees are going.)

All of this has been well documented by photographers, Ukrainian and otherwise, working for major news organizations, photo bureaus, and nongovernmental organizations, as well as independently. 24/7 Wall St. has reviewed the latest photographs cataloged by Getty Images to assemble this group of images – some horrific, some depressing, some heartwarming – from approximately the past seven days, showing the effects of the war.

What started as a protest against the decision not to sign an agreement with the EU seems to have escalated into a ""Color Revolution"" or ""Arab Spring"" style movement to force the government to resign. By some reports, the police are using violent tactics to suppress the street protests.

The Western half of the Ukraine has historically felt closer to Europe , and wants to move Ukrainian society in that direction. Eastern Ukraine feels culturally closer to Russia, and favors closer relations with that country. The current regime of President Viktor Yanukovich is part of that camp. The current confrontations can be seen as a clash between these two halves of Ukrainian society.

EDIT (2/24/2022)

This thread was originally opened in 2013 during the beginning of the revolt in Ukraine that eventually over-threw the dictatorship of the Yanukovyich regime and instituted democratic elections soon afterward. As of this writing, in the aftermath of the Russian invasion that began on 2/23, it is not clear whether or for how long Ukraine will continue to exist as an independent country.

Statements made nine years ago still seem relevant: ""The Western half of the Ukraine has historically felt closer to Europe , and wants to move Ukrainian society in that direction. Eastern Ukraine feels culturally closer to Russia, and favors closer relations with that country... The current confrontations can be seen as a clash between these two halves of Ukrainian society."" Some people have expressed the view that the confrontation between Russia and Ukraine, beginning in 2014, never really ended.

The invasion is also a result of certain grievances proclaimed by Vladimir Putin, the current President of Russia, and used by him as justification for armed attack and occupation. Western governments, and others around the world, have joined together in condemnation of this attack.

While we do not know what the ultimate outcome of these events will be, this thread will continue to be made available as a place to record news, ask questions and express opinions about the ""Crisis in Ukraine.""
