CHISINAU. March 2 (Interfax) - Belarusian Ambassador to Moldova Anatoly Kalinin was urgently summoned to the Moldovan Foreign Ministry on Wednesday after an image of a map present at the Belarusian Security Council office indicating a military strike from Odesa upon Moldova was circulated on social media.

A Telegram video showed a meeting of the Belarusian Security Council, during which Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used a map to explain some details about Russia's special operation in Ukraine, which indicated a potential strike on Moldova, the Moldovan Foreign Ministry said.

Ambassador Kalinin explained to Moldovan State Secretary Ruslan Bolbocean that ""the information on the map was presented incorrectly by officials from the Belarusian Defense Ministry.""

Bolbocean called on ""the Belarusian embassy to intervene publicly to dispel the misunderstandings and rumors about a possible attack on Moldova circulating among the public.""

""In view of this, Moldovan authorities call for staying calm and seeking information from official and trustworthy sources,"" it said.

In view of the situation in Ukraine, the Moldovan parliament has declared a state of emergency for 60 days. Since February 24, about 100,000 refugees from Ukraine have entered Moldova, and most of them have travelled further to European Union countries, while some 50,000 refugees have been accommodated in Moldova.",https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/75104/

During the Security Council meeting, Lukashenko, with the help of a pointer, explained to defense officials why missiles were launched from the territory of Belarus toward Ukraine.

Lukashenko revealed where Belarusian and Russian troops were stationed along the border with Ukraine. According to him, Belarusian reinforced units were in the western part, near Brest and Pinsk. Russian forces were stationed in the east. Lukashenko also repeated the story about missile systems allegedly deployed by Ukraine and aimed at Belarus.

According to Lukashenko, he received information from Russian intelligence that Ukraine wants to launch a missile attack on Belarus. And as a preventive measure, he decided to strike first. Lukashenko did not explain why rockets continue to fly from Belarus every day, moreover, in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other cities of Ukraine, killing dozens of civilians every day.

He also showed a map of hostilities, which marked the main directions of strikes. The map shows the advancing troops striking at Kyiv from the Chernobyl zone and through the Chernihiv region in Ukraine's north. The Russian army is also expected to advance to the Zhytomyr region.

From the northeast, the strikes go through Sumy in the Cherkasy-Poltava region and through Kharkiv to the Dnieper. From the territory controlled by the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and the Luhansk People's Republic (LNR), there are planned attacks on the Dnieper region and toward Melitopol.

Two assaults come out of Crimea, on Melitopol and Mykolaiv. Finally, another arrow shows a sea strike against Odessa and further toward Transnistria, where a large Russian base is located.

Transnistria, also known as Prednistrovie, mainly covers a thin strip of Moldovan land along the left bank of Dniester River. Following clashes in 1992 and Soviet intervention on behalf of pro-Moscow and pro-Russian local groups, the region declared independence from Moldova and remains a frozen conflict zone ever since.

Since reports on a likely Russian invasion on Ukraine broke out, a naval landing to Odessa from Russian-dominated Black Sea and occupied Crimea, and link up with Transnistria was cited among possible invasion routes. The Black Sea port city, which has a diverse population using Russian as their primary language, had witnessed both pro-Maidan and pro-Moscow riots in 2014. It is often cited among key targets for Moscow to cut off Ukraine's direct access to seas, gain a strategically important site for Black Sea domination and Crimea's security, and establish a pro-Russian southern and eastern governance.

The ambassador of Belarus to Moldova was summoned to the Moldovan Foreign Ministry for an explanation about the map.

The Moldovan ambassador to the U.S. said Wednesday his country is prepared to defend its borders if Russia or Belarus were to invade the former Soviet republic.

""The country is prepared [for] any kind of scenarios, including the very worst-case scenario,"" Ambassador Eugen Caras told Fox News in an exclusive interview. ""So we will be defending what's to be defended.""

A day earlier, video surfaced showing Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko standing in front of a map that appeared to indicate the Moldovan breakaway state of Transnistria as a potential next target.

‘Mistake’ on the map?

Caras said the Belarusians told Moldovan officials that the placement of Moldova on the map was a ""mistake.""

A deputy-level foreign minister summoned the Belarusian ambassador to Moldova to the Foreign Ministry and was asked for clarity, according to Caras.

""From what I understand, the ambassador said that there was a mistake on behalf of the Ministry of Defense of Belarus,"" Caras told Fox News.

Caras said Moldova is not in a state of panic, though the country is worried about a potential threat.

""We are very concerned with this situation. We condemn this,"" Caras, who assumed his post in 2020, told Fox News. ""One cannot be sure 100% of the next phase. Will we be targeted or not? As of today, it seems that we are not a target.""

""But what happens in a week's time? I cannot predict,"" Caras continued. ""We are very vigilant. We are very concerned.""

Caras said the Moldovan defense forces were ""prepared"" and that there was not an ""imminent threat"" of invasion.

Belarus joined Russia, Eritrea, North Korea and Syria in opposing a United Nations resolution on Wednesday condemning the Russian invasion.

NATO membership?

Moldova, which has a neutrality provision written into its constitution, hasn’t sought NATO membership, but Caras told Fox News the war in Ukraine could change that.

""I wouldn't rule out that this could shape the perception in the people's mind of the security situation or the security needs and the requirements in the future,"" Caras said.

He said Moldova has been accepting Ukrainian refugees since Russia invaded a week ago.

""We have new and new refugees crossing into Moldova,"" he told Fox News. ""The latest figures are around 114,000 people crossing into Moldova since the war broke out.""

""Some of them, they use Moldova as a transit country, and they go on to the rest of Europe,"" Caras continued. ""But roughly … 55,000 people [are] staying in Moldova.""",https://www.foxnews.com/world/moldova-map-soviet-republic-possible-russian-target

Amid the war in Ukraine, a video of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is being talked about online, which appears to show planned Russian invasion of Moldova. The video is from his address to the country's security council on Tuesday and was posted online by the regime.

Lukashenko is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In the video, he is seen standing in front of a map, which shows Ukraine divided into four sections. According to New York Post, Lukashenko appeared to be talking about a planned attack from southern Ukraine into Moldova.

Moldova is a former Soviet republic that borders Ukraine and Romania.

The video further showed lines of attack, which has already been carried out by Russia. The Hill reported that the map showed troop movement plans and infrastructure targets in Ukraine, as well as targets in Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria.

It also said that some of the attacks are yet to take place, including an incursion into Moldova from the port city of Odessa.

The Post even quoted a Belarusian journalist Tadeusz Giczan, who talked about Moldova's invasion plan.

The video also strangely shows an inset map of the United States and Canada but without anything highlighted.

According to news agency AFP, Lukashenko announced sending more troops to the south of the country, by the border with Ukraine, at the same security council meeting.

But forces of Belarus would not be taking part in the attack on Ukraine, he added.

These battle groups will comprise hundreds of soldiers equipped with armoured vehicles and artillery, according to details of the meeting.

Lukashenko also said he was sending troops west to the country's border with Poland.

Last week, Lukashenko allowed Russian troops to use Belarusian territory to invade Ukraine from the north. The war entered its seventh day today, with Russian military claiming it has taken control of Ukraine's Kherson.

She noted that some of these worries relate to the Ukrainian refugees and the humanitarian situation. But some are also ""due to Transnistria, the Russian-backed breakaway region” between the Dniester river and the Ukrainian border.

Belarus’s President Alexander Lukashenko may have inadvertently revealed Vladimir Putin’s battle plan during a national security council meeting – and it appears to include Moldova.

In a short video posted by Belarusian journalist Tadeusz Giczan, Mr Lukashenko can be seen pointing to a map purporting to show Russia’s movements as it wages a war against Ukraine.

The map displayed by Mr Lukashenko, a key ally of Mr Putin, appears to divide Ukraine into four parts and show Russian troops crossing the border into Moldova from the Ukrainian port city of Odessa.

As the map appears to tally with Russian military movements so far, it has sparked concerns that Moldova is the Kremlin’s next target. But the scene also appeared highly stage-managed.

How likely is Russia to invade Moldova?

Russia has about 1,500 to 2,000 Russian troops stationed in its breakaway region of Transnistria, where it has been backing a pro-Russian government for the past three decades. Transnistria, which is located along the southwestern border with Ukraine, is internationally recognised as part of Moldova.

There are also paramilitary forces loyal to the secessionist regime in Transnistria’s capital, Tiraspol, estimated to be about 10,000 men. Moldova on the other hand, has only about 6,000 troops, according to the BalkanInsight.

The Moldovan President, Maia Sandu, on Friday voiced concern about the security situation over her country’s border with Ukraine following Mr Putin’s land, air and sea invasion of its former Soviet neighbour last Thursday.

“Yesterday morning, we woke up in a new world, more violent, more uncertain, more unstable. It is a world where unprovoked warfare is taking its toll near our borders. It is undoubtedly a world we hoped we would never like to live in,” she said.

The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said it saw Russian helicopters flying over Tiraspol, something Moldovan’s defence ministry said it could not confirm.

British Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, warned last week: “If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine we are going to see others under threat – the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with Nato.”

Nicu Popescu, Moldova’s deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday that Moldova was in a “very risky zone”, but while there was “anxiety and fear” among the population, he did not think his country was a target.

According to European security expert Edward Arnold, from the Royal United Services Institution, it is “highly unlikely” that Moscow intends to invade Moldova.

“Russian forces are currently already overstretched and face bloody battles for Ukrainian population centres,” he told i . “Therefore it is highly unlikely they would have the combat power to also invade Moldova which would represent a significant further escalation in this war.”

He went on to say the map shown by Mr Lukashenko is likely to contain disinformation given Russia and Belarus’s record of using the National Security Council meeting “as a theatre to try and influence Western and Ukrainian decision makers.”

Mr Arnold, who is ex-military, said: “It would be a highly unusual breach of operational security to publish operational military plans.”

He said the presence on the map of a smaller one of the western hemisphere, along with a US 1st cavalry division tactical recognition flash based in Fort Hood Texas, supports the theory that the plans on the map “are probably false”.

In a blog post for the London School of Economics (LSE), PhD researcher Dorina Baltag warned the “domino effect” of a potential puppet regime in Ukraine would be felt in Moldova.

“Putin would essentially dominate the entire northern coast of the Black Sea and control a vast territory, stretching from the current western borders of Russia to the borders of Romania and Moldova, through Transnistria, which is already conveniently located for Russia.

“It is for good reason that politicians in the Moldovan capital are now watching anxiously to see how the conflict develops,” Ms Baltag, from Loughborough University, said.",https://inews.co.uk/news/russia-invade-moldova-will-lukashenko-battle-map-putin-plans-after-ukraine-1493407
