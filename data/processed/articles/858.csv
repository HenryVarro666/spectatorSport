UK freezes Russian 'war chest'

The British Foreign Ministry said that the UK had frozen some $350 billion (€321 billion) in assets of what she called Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""war chest.""

""So far, our sanctions have had a crippling impact on those who feed and fund Putin's war machine. This week we will announce that we've frozen over $350 billion of Putin's war chest,"" British Foreign Minister Liz Truss said.

This made up over 60% of Moscow's $604 billion (€554 billion) foreign currency reserves, Truss said.

Britain's foreign minister said that ""coordinated sanctions are pushing the Russian economy back to the Soviet era.""

Truss also called for a ban on Russian ships docking in Western ports and urged for curbs on the gold trade and on other industries that are ""filling Putin's war chest.""

International criminal lawyer: Genocidal intent 'is a high threshold to prove under international law'

""There's strong evidence to believe that war crimes have been perpetrated in Bucha and allegedly in other areas,"" lawyer Kateryna Busol told DW Tuesday. ""There's also a possibility to claim the perpetration of crimes against humanity, which is a widespread or systematic attack against the civilian population. And indeed, there have been discussions about possible genocidal intent, which is a high threshold to prove under international law,"" she said.

Specialized in international criminal law, Busol, a Ukrainian who is currently an associate at the London-based think tank Chatham House, said: ""Given certain statements by Russia's top leadership, one could derive, or at least one could start thinking about, such intention. And of course, in law, the presumption of innocence in criminal law is paramount. But certain images are deeply disturbing in terms of, you know, the civilians seen with burned bodies and tied hands and shot from behind.""

'No safe place' for children in Ukraine

Amanda Brydon, global head of child protection policy and advocacy at Save the Children, told DW that there is ""no safe place for children in Ukraine.""

""For those in cities like Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, explosive weapons have devastated vital infrastructure,"" Brydon said.

""Children and their families are struggling to get food, heat their homes, find safety.""

She went on to say that the ""intensity"" is lower in Western Ukraine, but that ""hotels are booked out"" and ""air raid alarms are going off daily.""

Watch video 03:47 Several explosions in Lviv: DW's Fanny Facsar reports

""Children who are separated and unaccompanied are at a significantly increased risk of violence, trafficking and abuse,"" Brydon said, referring to children displaced by the conflict.

""The risks also increase at border crossing and transit points,"" Brydon said.

""It's been very difficult to track how many children there are,"" she added.

Asked on what mechanisms are in place to protect children, Brydon said that ""efforts are now being made to be coordinating between UN agencies and NGOs like Save the Children, as well as the authorities at border crossing points to set up a registration mechanism.""

""We're lucky that some of these neighboring countries have very strong child protection services,"" Brydon said.

""The key for this mechanism is to be identifying those children and then making sure that they're linked up so that they get the support that they need.""

European countries expel nearly 200 Russian diplomats

Italy, Spain and Slovenia were the latest countries in Europe to expel Russian diplomats from their soil, in response to the atrocities in the city of Bucha, Ukraine.

They follow the likes of Germany, Italy, Denmark and France, bringing the total number of expelled Russian embassy and consulate staff to almost 200.

European nations have said the expulsions had to do with alleged spying or ""national security reasons.""

Russia has rejected accusations that its forces were responsible for what happened in Bucha, saying the images are fake or the deaths occurred after they left the area.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the mass expulsions of its diplomats was ""a short-sighted move."" ""Narrowing down opportunities for diplomatic communication in such an unprecedentedly difficult crisis environment is a short-sighted move that will further complicate our communication, which is necessary to find a solution,"" Peskov said.

Doctors Without Borders (MSF) witnessed bombings

The medical charity group Doctors Without Borders, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), said in a statement that its team had witnessed bombings in Mykolaiv, Ukraine.

The incident ocurred during a hospital visit on April 4, where the staff managed to take cover and escape unharmed. MSF's team was there to help support people displaced by the war, working in concert with a local organization.

""Several explosions took place in close proximity to our staff over the course of about 10 minutes,"" said Michel-Olivier Lacharité, MSF head of mission in Ukraine.

""As they were leaving the area, the MSF team saw injured people and at least one dead body,"" he added.

MSF reported that the regional paediatric hospital was also hit.

""Bombing such a large area within a residential neighborhood in the middle of the afternoon cannot but cause civilian casualties and hit public buildings,"" Lacharité said.

US envoy in Berlin praises Germany's policy turnaround

Amy Gutmann, the new US ambassador to Germany, said she understood why Berlin was hesitant to approve an immediate Russian energy embargo.

""I see Germany as doing everything it can, short of harming itself more than it harms Mr Putin,"" the ambassador said at one of her first official appearances, during a panel discussion at the Free University in Berlin.

Gutmann, a former professor of politics with German roots, has been ambassador to Berlin for just under two months.

She praised Germany's recent effort to become less dependent on Russian energy, which she said was happening ""more rapidly than anyone thought was possible previously.""

Her remarks come as Germany has been under pressure to increase sanctions on the Kremlin and its politicians have been under fire for being too close to Russia in the past years.

Zelenskyy addresses UN Security Council

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke via video link to a special meeting of the UN Security Council, urging for tougher measures against Moscow over alleged killings of civilians, as his country expects continued Russian bombardments in the east and south.

It was Zelenskyy's first speech to the UN Security Council since Russia's invasion and it comes after he traveled to Bucha to assess the severity of the situation.

""Yesterday I returned from Bucha,"" the Ukrainian president said during his address. ""There is not a single crime they would not commit there.""

""They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies,"" Zelenskyy added.

""The massacre in our city of Bucha is only one, unfortunately only one example of what the occupiers have been doing on our territory for the past 41 days,"" he added.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned during the Security Council meeting that Russia's invasion of Ukraine represented one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order ""because of its nature, intensity, and consequences.""

Blinken: Bucha war crimes 'deliberate campaign'

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the killings in Bucha had not been a random act of a rogue unit but instead, it was a part of a deliberate Russian campaign to commit atrocities.

Blinken made the remarks prior to departing for the NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels.

""What we've seen in Bucha is not the random act of a rogue unit,"" he said. ""It's a deliberate campaign to kill, to torture, to rape, to commit atrocities. The reports are more than credible, the evidence is there for the world to see,"" the US top diplomat explained.

European Commission proposes new sanctions, including coal embargo

The European Commission has announced that it is planning a new raft of sanctions against Russia, in light of mounting evidence of atrocities committed against civilians by the Russian army.

Spain to expel Russian embassy officials

Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said ""at least 25"" people working at the Russian embassy in Madrid would be affected, as Spain becomes the latest country to react to allegations of Russian human rights atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine. Germany, France and Italy have also expelled Russians working at the embassies in their respective capitals.

NATO's Stoltenberg responds to Bucha deaths

NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg addressed the current events in Ukraine during a press conference, saying that the pictures from Bucha were of an ""unbearable brutality that Europe has not witnessed in many decades.""

The remarks come a day before NATO foreign ministers are to gather in Brussels to discuss more financial, military and humanitarian support for Ukraine

Stoltenberg warned that the findings in Bucha would likely not be the last, implying that such atrocities could be happenings in other areas that are still under Russian occupation.

""But when and if they withdraw their troops and Ukrainian troops take over, I'm afraid they will see more mass graves, more atrocities and more examples of of war crimes,'' he added.

The NATO chief rejected Russian claims that the evidence of the atrocities had been staged.

""These atrocities have taken place during a period in which Russia controlled these areas. So they are responsible. Second, we have information from many different sources,'' he said.

Stoltenberg also answered questions about the alliance's defense capability and even regarding the possibility of Finland and Sweden joining the group. Stoltenberg said it was those counties' decision, but that if they were to choose to do so, he expected members to welcome them.

'Victory' for Ukraine would be Russian forces back behind separatist lines

Speaking on Ukrainian television, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he would consider it a victory if Russian troops returned behind the ""line of contact"" in the Donbas region, which has separated Moscow-backed militias from the rest of Ukraine since 2014.

Zelenskyy said that if Ukraine tried to retake the occupied territories in Luhansk and Donetsk by force today, it would cost Ukrainians hundreds of thousands of lives.

However, the president stressed that Ukraine maintains sovereignty over the territory occupied by Russia.

""There should be no talk of calling Crimea as something other than Ukrainian. Donbas is also Ukraine, and as for the temporarily occupied territories following February 24, it is not even discussed.""

Zelenskyy says talks with Russia after Bucha challenging but necessary

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the possibility of holding more talks with Russia was very challenging, but there was no other option.

Speaking on Ukrainian television, Zelenskyy added that a face-to-face meeting between him and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin does not look likely.

The Ukrainian leader said the killings in Bucha showed the phrase ""needing denazification,"" which Putin used as justification for the invasion, applies more to Russia than to Ukraine.

He repeated that his country would need security guarantees as part of any peace settlement.

Zelenskyy said the Ukraine and Russia would not be able to agree on all points over Donbas at once but should work on it.

Detained Red Cross team released

A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been released after being held in Manhush, a town in the eastern Donetsk province, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has said.

In addition, 2,195 civilians have been injured, UN Political and Peacebuilding Affairs envoy Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN Security Council, referring to figures from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).

However, Russia has warned the West that the sanctions could prompt retaliation.

NATO expects more attacks

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said he wants to establish permanent US military bases in Eastern European NATO countries. © IMAGO / SNA NATO expects an intensified Russian offensive in eastern and southern Ukraine in the coming weeks, with the goal of capturing the entire Donbass region and creating a land bridge to occupied Crimea. The military alliance says it is strengthening its eastern flank. Washington's highest-ranking military official meanwhile came out in favor of establishing permanent bases in NATO countries in Eastern Europe. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley told Congress Tuesday he expected an increased US presence in the region for some time, in his first appearance since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. ""My advice would be to create permanent bases but don't permanently station, so you get the effect of permanence by rotational forces cycling through permanent bases,"" he said. The war is one of the greatest challenges to world peace since the United Nations was founded, said UN Secretary General António Guterres.

""Because of its nature, intensity, and consequences,"" the war was ""one of the greatest challenges ever to the international order and the global peace architecture,"" Guterres told the UN Security Council in New York on Tuesday.

Max Scherzer’s first pitch and first out for his new (my) team. Let’s go @Mets

Begs question; will US President, Vice President or Secretary of State do the same? Is the barrier security or fear of antagonizing Russia or a combination?

The anti-ship missiles are significant - aimed directly at raising costs for Russian seaborne assault on Odesa, much the way Javelins and Stingers raised costs for land assault on Kyiv.

“I don’t think we can differentiate between stages of hell that Ukraine is now going through. We already are facing genocide from Russian troops…Do we expect more genocide?” - Ukrainian MP @AnastasiaRadina tells me.

82 years ago, Soviet forces killed 22,000 Polish officers and intellectuals in the Katyn massacre - and history still remembers. What we are witnessing today in Bucha, Mairiupol and beyond now far exceeds those numbers - and we are all witnesses.

Three generations later, the West still celebrates its stand against Hitler in movies, memorials & politics. How will they measure its stand in Ukraine, as we again see aggression, and evidence of war crimes and genocide? Can today’s world generate similar unity and sacrifice?

So, instead of #Ukraine ’s “finlandization” he achieved #Finland ’s “ukrainization”. Putin is indeed a great strategist.

Russia says the cruiser Moskva was evacuated after a fire onboard. Ukraine claims it hit the ship with a missile strike. cnn.it/3Ea7qtn

For Ukrainian forces to render vulnerable Russia’s most advanced aircraft, helicopters, tanks and - perhaps - warships is remarkable for a force out-numbered and out-gunned by the fifth largest military in the world that had spent billions to modernize.

New: UN estimates nearly 2,000 civilians killed in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began — warning as it has since the beginning that ""the actual figures are considerably higher.""

!!: Russian warship Moskva has sunk, Russian state news agency TASS reports, citing Ministry of Defense: “During the towing of the cruiser Moskva to the port of destination, the ship lost its stability due to hull damage received during a fire from the detonation of ammunition.”

It’s hard to overstate the impact of this. If the Russian navy’s flagship can’t operate safely off the Ukrainian coast, a seaborne assault of Odesa becomes much harder.

Russia’s deputy prime minister (and former energy minister), is convinced that the EU will not be able to replace Russian gas and oil within 5-10 years. Hopefully they will prove him wrong.

European officials have told me they have plans to be down to a fraction of current gas purchases from Russia by the end of this year. Not clear this is a good bet by the Kremlin.

As speculation about the Russian nuclear threat grows, note reporting below: The US has been monitoring Russian military forces for any unusual movement of nuclear weapons and has not detected such movements to date.

Not true. As I reported, US found Ukrainian claim credible but had not yet verified on their own.

they also didn’t believe the Ukranians had hit it 26 hours ago…

Ukraine makes clear how four successive US presidents misread Putin - each believing he could “manage” him and Russia through some combination of personality, carrot and stick. The invasion has likely buried that approach for good, but only after years of missed warnings.

Świat zastanawia się czy Władimir Putin może użyć broni atomowej podczas wojny w Ukrainie. Według ekspertów Moskwa może użyć taktycznych bomb w celu zastraszenia Zachodu. Według dość przewrotnej filozofii Kremla nie spowoduje to odwetu państw zachodnich. Czy jest się czego obawiać?

Jak Rosjanie unikają sankcji? Statki zmieniają banderę po to, by uniknąć ograniczeń nałożonych na nie przez USA i Unię Europejską. Od teraz pływają w barwach Wysp Marshalla i St. Kitts i Nevis. Dotyczy to przede wszystkim tankowców. Odwrotna sytuacja jest w lotnictwie. Moskwa przerejestrowuje wydzierżawione samoloty na rosyjskie. Ma to uniemożliwić odzyskanie zachodnim firmom leasingowym swoich maszyn.
