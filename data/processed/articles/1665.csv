0,a0c82365-fe6a-49ac-b59d-95503c9d07eb,[],,"ISTANBUL, Turkey — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for a ceasefire as Russian and Ukrainian delegations met face to face in Istanbul on Tuesday, resuming their talks on Russia’s invasion of its neighbor last month.

In a speech he delivered at the start of negotiations, Erdogan said progress in the talks could pave the way for a meeting between the leaders of the two countries.

“We believe that there will be no losers in a just peace. Prolonging the conflict is not in anyone’s interest,” he said. “As members of the delegations you have taken on a historic responsibility. The whole world is awaiting the good news that will come from you.”

“The two parties have legitimate concerns, it’s possible to reach a solution acceptable to the international community,” Erdogan said. “It’s up to the two parties to put an end to this tragedy,” he insisted, adding that the “extension of the conflict is in no one’s interest.”

It is the first time that the two countries’ delegations, which arrived in Turkey on Monday, met after several rounds of talks by videoconference.

The delegations are scheduled to hold two days of talks in a government building adjacent to the 19th-century Ottoman palace, Dolmabahce, on the shores of the Bosporus.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was also due to meet the Ukrainian and Russian delegations on Tuesday.

Earlier talks between the sides, held in person in Belarus or by video, failed to make progress on ending the monthlong war that has killed thousands and driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes — including almost 4 million from their country.

Turkey previously hosted on March 10 a first meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Those talks in the southern city of Antalya failed to produce a ceasefire or make any other visible progress.

Turkey, which shares a Black Sea coast with both Russia and Ukraine, is seeking to maintain good relations with both and has offered to mediate since the start of the war.

Ankara is a traditional ally of Kyiv’s and has supplied the country with Bayraktar drones, which Ukraine has deployed in the conflict.

But it is also seeking to stay on good terms with Russia, on which Turkey relies heavily for gas imports and tourism revenues.

Turkey is also working with France and Greece on a “humanitarian operation” to evacuate people from the devastated Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which has been pounded by Russian forces.

Ahead of the current talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country was prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, in comments that might lend momentum to negotiations.

Zelensky said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over “the complex issue of Donbas,” the hotly contested region in the country’s east. It’s unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.”

Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelensky, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal.

As fighting raged throughout the country, the mayor of Irpin, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, said late Monday that the city had been “liberated” from Russian forces.

A senior US defense official said the US believes the Ukrainians have also retaken the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in the east.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss US intelligence assessments, said Russian forces largely remained in defensive positions near the capital, Kyiv, and were making little forward progress elsewhere in the country.

The official said Russia appeared to be deemphasizing ground operations near Kyiv and concentrating more on the Donbas, the predominantly Russian-speaking region where Moscow-backed rebels have been waging a separatist war for eight years.

Late last week, with its forces bogged down in parts of the country, Russia seemed to scale back its war aims, saying its main goal was gaining control of the Donbas.

The possible face-saving exit strategy for Russian President Vladimir Putin has raised Ukrainian fears the Kremlin aims to split the country, forcing it to surrender a swath of its territory.

In recent days, Ukrainian troops have pushed the Russians back in other sectors.

In the city of Makariv, near a strategic highway west of the capital, Associated Press reporters saw the carcass of a Russian rocket launcher, a burned Russian truck, the body of a Russian soldier and a destroyed Ukrainian tank after fighting there a few days ago.

In the nearby village of Yasnohorodka, the AP witnessed positions abandoned by Ukrainian soldiers who had moved farther west, but no sign of Russian troops.

Russia has destroyed more than 60 religious buildings across the country in just over a month of war, with most of the damage concentrated near Kyiv and in the east, Ukraine’s military said in a post on Tuesday.

It said the Orthodox church – the country’s majority religion – was the most affected but that mosques, synagogues, Protestant churches and religious schools were also destroyed.

A cyberattack knocked Ukraine’s national telecommunications provider Ukrtelecom almost completely offline on Monday. The chief of Ukraine’s state service for special communication, Yurii Shchyhol, blamed “the enemy” without specifically naming Russia and said most customers were cut off from telephone, internet and mobile service to ensure coverage for Ukraine’s military.

Also Monday, an oil depot in western Ukraine’s Rivne region was hit by a missile, the governor said, in the second attack on oil facilities in the region near the Polish border.

In other developments, Ukraine’s prosecutor general said at least 144 children have died in the war so far, most in Kyiv. The tally did not give a number for the besieged eastern city of Mariupol.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg News said it has suspended its operations in Russia and Belarus. Customers in both countries won’t be able to access any Bloomberg financial products and trading functions for Russian securities were disabled in line with international sanctions, it said. Bloomberg Philanthropies pledged $40 million, meanwhile, in support of Ukrainians and refugees.

Also, The Group of Seven major economies rejected a Kremlin demand that some countries pay in rubles for Russia’s natural gas. That demand appeared designed to support the Russian currency, which is under pressure from Western sanctions.

Putin’s ground forces have become bogged down because of stronger-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, combined with what Western officials say are Russian tactical missteps, poor morale, shortages of food, fuel and cold weather gear, and other problems. Moscow has resorted to pummeling Ukrainian cities with artillery and airstrikes.

The Pentagon may have to ask Congress for additional money to support Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s invasion, including replenishing America’s arsenal for weapons sent to Kyiv, officials said Monday.

Rolling out the Defense Department’s $773 billion request for fiscal 2023, Pentagon leaders said the budget was finalized before the invasion so it has no specific money for the war. Congress approved a $13.5 billion emergency funding package in early March.

The leaders said it was too early to predict how quickly Ukrainian forces will use up the weapons and ammunition already being provided, and how much the US will need to replace what it sends to Ukraine, such as Stinger and Javelin missiles or body armor and other equipment.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-kick-off-in-istanbul-erdogan-urges-end-to-tragedy/

The Turkish president further said that the progress in negotiations would pave the way for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.

Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed in a telephone call on Sunday for Istanbul to host a fresh round of talks.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the move, saying they must bring peace “without delay”, and signaling his government’s preparedness to compromise on key issues.

The previous rounds of talks have failed to produce a breakthrough, as both the warring sides have refused to compromise on their respective redlines.

Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov last week said the United States was looking to prolong the military conflict in Ukraine and hindering what he described as “tough” peace talks between Moscow and Kiev.

Biden says US training Ukrainians

US President Joe Biden has again landed himself in trouble with his Freudian slips. Speaking to media persons at the White House, Biden dropped another big bombshell before switching to damage control mode.

Biden seemed to suggest that the American troops are actively training Ukrainian forces to fight Russians, a stunning revelation made by the top US official for the first time.

The US president was responding to a journalist’s question about comments he made during his recent visit to Poland, in which he implied that US forces would be going to Ukraine.

“We were talking about helping train the troops in — that are — the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland,” he stressed, in a classic volta-face.

When he was prodded by the reporter, Biden said: “I was referring to being with, and talking with the Ukrainian troops who are in Poland.”

The remarks were construed to mean that American troops were training Ukrainian troops in Poland, as the armed conflict between Ukraine and Moscow rages on.

Biden’s remarks came days after the US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan denied that Americans were “currently” training Ukrainians.

The White House and Congressional Democrats were forced into damage control as Biden’s unscripted remark declaring that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, “cannot remain in power” has already threatened to bring the already strained US-Russia relations closer to collapse.

At the end of his speech from the Royal Castle in Warsaw on Saturday, Biden denounced Putin over Russia’s military operation in Ukraine, saying, he “cannot remain in power.”

Senator James Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the senate foreign relations committee, described Biden’s comment as a “horrendous gaffe”, urging the president to “stay on script.”

“There are Ukrainian soldiers in Poland interacting on a regular basis with US troops, and that’s what the President was referring to,” said a White House official.

According to a report in POLITICO, both American and British officials had privately agreed in the opening days of the military operation that Ukrainian troops could eventually be trained outside of Ukraine if the conflict dragged on for an extended period.

'Africa to feel food security impact from Ukraine crisis'

European Union’s economic commissioner has warned that the impact of the crisis in Ukraine on global food security could have ""dramatic consequences"" for African nations that depend heavily on grain imports.

Speaking during his visit to Bucharest, Paolo Gentiloni said the Horn of Africa was likely to feel the maximum impact of the raging conflict in Ukraine, amid soaring prices of food, oil, and fertilizers.

Gentiloni, however, said that food security will not be an issue in Europe, which is grappling with high inflation rather than low food supplies.

Russia and Ukraine supply about one-quarter of the world’s wheat, and 40 percent of Ukraine’s wheat and corn exports are shipped to the Middle East and Africa.

The African continent relies overwhelmingly on Russian and Ukrainian exports, mostly wheat, corn, sunflower oil, and fertilizers, compounding the impact of political uncertainty and drought in the region.

East African countries bank on Russia and Ukraine for almost 90 percent of their wheat import needs. Wheat and its products account for one-third of average national cereal consumption in the region.

Ukraine alone accounts for about 10 percent of the world’s wheat and ships huge quantities of grain to African countries.

Many parts of the East Africa region including Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya are already grappling with the worst drought in decades, made worse by a lackadaisical humanitarian response.

South Sudan is dealing with widespread food insecurity due to heavy flooding, putting millions of people at risk of severe hunger.

The global charitable organization Oxfam last week warned that East Africa faces “a profoundly alarming hunger crisis”.

It said that as many as 28 million people across East Africa face severe hunger if the March rains fail, calling for a massive 'no regrets' mobilization of international humanitarian aid to avert destitution.

Wheat prices have already hit a record high globally in the wake of a supply shortage because of the Ukrainian conflict, reaching levels comparable to those during the 2008 financial crisis.

“East Africa faces a profoundly alarming hunger crisis. Areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and beyond are experiencing an unfolding full-scale catastrophe. Even if the rains do arrive this month, full recovery will be near impossible unless urgent action is taken today,” said Gabriela Bucher, Oxfam Executive Director.

The military conflict in Ukraine has now entered its second month, with multiple rounds of tension-easing talks between Kiev and Moscow so far failing to produce a breakthrough.

Western countries, including the US, have decried Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine as unprovoked, but Moscow says the “special operation” aims to “demilitarize” and “denazify” the country after years of fighting between the Kiev government and separatists in the breakaway Donbas region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the military operation on February 24, which he said was aimed at “demilitarization” of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions in eastern Ukraine, largely populated by ethnic Russians.

In 2014, the two regions had declared themselves new republics, refusing to recognize Ukraine’s Western-backed government.",https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2022/03/29/679328/Russia-Ukraine-conflict-dramatically-affect-Africa

Türkiye's mediation efforts in the Ukraine-Russia conflict has received widespread praise as the country takes an active peace-making role in the region.

Türkiye's communications director noted that the country is a stabilising power in its region and around the world. (AA)

Türkiye continues to assume an active role in the resolution of global crises and ending regional conflicts, the country’s communications director has said.

Ankara ""always seeks to provide a roadmap toward building a sustainable global system in the service of peace and stability,"" Fahrettin Altun said on Twitter, after the latest round of negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations wrapped up in Istanbul on Tuesday.

Noting that Türkiye is ""a stabilising power in its region and around the world"" under the leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Altun said: ""In line with this vision, Türkiye is once again doing everything in its power to end the Russia-Ukraine war through effective diplomacy.""

He reminded that Erdogan has been “conducting meetings directly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin since the first day of the crisis” and the Turkish Foreign Ministry and diplomatic missions have been conducting mediation between the two sides.

""These efforts testify to the fact that Türkiye is a power that meets with both sides and brings the parties to the table,"" the communications director added.

On the latest round of talks that took place in Istanbul, he said: ""The meetings between Ukrainian and Russian negotiation teams in Türkiye have given us and the whole world hope of a swift resolution of the crisis.""

Altun stressed that Ankara has ""no illusions about the prospects about an easy solution"" but it will ""always push for peace and stability by facilitating and mediating between Ukraine and Russia.""

""Our region cannot afford more conflict and humanitarian crises,"" he said.

He called on all relevant parties to support Turkiye’s diplomatic initiatives.

Russia sent troops into Ukraine in what it called a “special military operation” on February 24. The conflict has met international outrage and Western countries have implemented tough financial sanctions on Moscow.

Türkiye has won widespread praise for its efforts to end the conflict, helped by its unique position in having friendly relations with both Russia and Ukraine.

While Ukraine has called for several countries, including Türkiye, to be guarantors in a possible future peace deal; Russia has announced it will significantly decrease military activities in the direction of the Ukrainian cities of Kiev and Chernihiv to increase trust for future negotiations.
