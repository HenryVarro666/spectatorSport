KHARKIV, Ukraine — In a downtown government office building, men and women in military fatigues carried rocket-propelled grenades through hallways lined with ornate white crown molding. Others had AK-47s with loaded clips slung over the shoulders. Sandbags rested along windows as protection in case of potential blasts. A public bus pulled up to the building. There were hundreds of boxes of bullets inside.

This was the scene of the makeshift headquarters of the Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces in the eastern city of Kharkiv on Saturday morning, right around the time artillery strikes from the Russian military hit the area for a third straight day. Even as the smell of sulfur wafted through the streets, more than 100 people waited in line to join the civilian reserve force.

The Ukrainian Territorial Defense Forces, which is believed to have more than 130,000 volunteers, has been conducting weekend training sessions for months in preparation to help defend its turf from Russia. Now that the attack has started, Ukrainians across the country are mobilizing and turning to the Territorial Defense Forces to arm them and send them into the fight. Anyone between 18 and 60 can join.

“What’s there to be afraid of?” said 19-year-old Yevgeniy Belinkyi, who was waiting to enlist in Kharkiv. “When I’m sitting around, I’m scared. And here there’s nothing to fear. Here, I know what’s happening, and I hope my loved ones will be all right. I will make sure they are all right.”

Ukraine's government has urged citizens to take up arms to repel the Russian invasion. Across the country, people from all walks of life are answering the call.

It’s the sort of civilian insurgency that Ukraine is counting on to help fend off a Russian military that has significantly more manpower and firepower. President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted Thursday, “We will give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities.”

But arming civilians, many of whom have little training, risks exacerbating the violence in cities across Ukraine and potentially giving the Russian military more pretext to fire indiscriminately.

In Kyiv, a line stretched down the block at a police station to receive weapons and bullets that officials handed out after brief background checks. Ukrainian Interior Minister Denis Monastyrsky said in a video message that volunteers in Kyiv alone were given more than 25,000 automatic rifles, about 10 million bullets, and rocket-propelled grenades and launchers.

Nearby, dozens of people huddled in a decades-old underground bunker to assemble molotov cocktails, or petrol bombs, carefully stuffing old wine and champagne bottles with packing material and flammable liquid before delivering them to groups of local defense forces nearby.

Across Kyiv, informal checkpoints and roadblocks have been installed. In some places, piles of tires or sandbags have been tossed in the roads to slow traffic. Messages on the Telegram app suggested citizens should remove road signs, so that Russian tanks might get lost.

The Territorial Defense Forces, now a division of the country’s armed forces, has already been praised by Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov for helping hold off the Russian assault on Kyiv since Friday. In the northeastern city of Sumy, 90 miles north of Kharkiv, a civilian defense force seized a Russian armored vehicle and interrogated the soldier in it, according to social media videos verified by The Washington Post.

At the Kharkiv headquarters, a man in camouflage and armed with an assault rifle tried to organize the growing crowd of volunteers. He asked those with military service experience to get in line on the right and everyone else to line up on the left.

He said he worked in an office until the start of the Russian invasion. “I just want to offer free hands,” one woman told him. “I can mop the floors.” He told her to line up on the left.

Men and women with military experience were ushered inside one group at a time. Many brought their own firearms with them. People edged around each other in the hallway. Some carried water or cartons of food while others carted in boxes of ammunition.

One group of men filed into the bed of a construction truck. The line of those waiting to sign up outside started cheering and wished them luck.

“They’re off to the front,” said Boris Redin, a democracy activist who uses a blue and yellow tent on the main square of Kharkiv as his headquarters. “Everything that Russia always threatened us with is now happening,” he said. “Now we’re simply forced to fight back and defend ourselves. But we’ll do it with fun and pleasure.”

In the western city of Lviv, just 55 miles from the border with Poland and considered one of the safest areas in the country because of its distance from Russia, Oleksii Palyhi, a lanky 22-year-old with a heart tattooed on his cheekbone, had never imagined himself having anything to do with the military.

His experience with weapons was taking potshots at bottles with an air rifle. After he dropped out of his university physics and astronomy course, a lung condition exempted him from compulsory conscription. “I was trying to avoid it,” Palyhi said. But now things are different. “We need to defend our motherland.”

Nearby, 70-year-old Orest Gaworsky had gathered a group, writing down their names and phone numbers to submit. He was happy with his new comrades.

“There are no losers here,” he said of the crowd. In 2015, he served as a civil volunteer in the eastern Ukrainian Donbas region, where the Ukrainian military has been engaged in eight years of conflict with Russian-backed separatists. His vehicle was hit in an explosion there.

“I’m too old to run with a gun, but I can sit and shoot,” Gaworsky said. “We will shoot, we will make molotov cocktails, we will do everything,” he added. “We’ll fight them with pitchforks!”

The press service of the Sumy regional military-civil administration reports has released the relevant report via Telegram, Ukrinform saw.

""Sumy update. The enemy convoy has been destroyed on Kurska Street. There’s a fire there,"" the statement reads.

Earlier it was reported that large convoys of fuel trucks were moving across the region in the direction of Kyiv. The Territorial Defense Force unit in Sumy engaged in a serious battle with the enemy. The wounded soldiers and bodies of those killed in combat were brought to the regional hospital.

The head of the regional center, Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, appealed to the soldiers with orders to capture, take away weapons, lock POWs, and treat them humanely, providing them with water and not resorting to torture.

As Ukrinform reported earlier, the leader of the aggressor power, Vladimir Putin, announced on February 24 the start of a special military operation “in Donbas.”

Martial law has been imposed throughout Ukraine. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has signed a decree on general mobilization.

Sounds of multiple explosions resonated all across the east-European country as the Russian troops launched the attack from the north towards the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, from the east towards Kharkiv, Sumy, Donetsk and Luhansk, and from Crimea in the south.

President Vladimir Putin called the invasion a 'special military operation' against Ukraine.

According to the Russian defence ministry, the military operation is designed to target the Ukrainian military infrastructure, air defence facilities, military airfields, and aircraft of the armed forces of Ukraine.

Outlook reached out to Maksim Maksimenko, a Ukrainian civilian who shared with us a detailed account of the present situation prevailing in the country.

“In our city only explosions are heard so far. There are fierce battles in Kyiv, Kharkov, Sumy, Zaporozhye, Kherson, Chernihiv and others. Most of the Russian troops are constantly moving to Kyiv through Chernobyl from the territory of Belarus.”

“Kyiv is getting bombed constantly. Civilians are spending nights in the subway. Women are giving birth on subway. The wounded are getting treatment over there as well.”

Ukrainian civilians taking shelter in subways

“Our army is heroically defending the country. Cases have been reported when people undermined bridges across rivers in order to prevent a column of enemy tanks.”

“Hungry Russian soldiers, mostly aged between 18-19, are going from house to house in the villages seeking food”, he added.

Russian troops

“Losses on both sides are in thousands. On the first day we all were all scared as a terrible panic engulfed us. The second day was all about a sense of inevitability and anger. Today as the situation reaches Day 3, everyone by now has understood that something has to be done. In all the cities where the fighting is taking place, people have been given weapons.""

""My wife and I went to the center of our small town Priluki to help the territorial defense as the civilians organized to defend the city. We left our three children with their grandfather and brother."", said Maksim to Outlook.

“Almost every family in Ukraine has relatives from Russia. After communicating with them, it is now very clear that they are completely clueless about the situation here. Their news channels are refraining from showing the real picture.”

“Ukraine needs international support. This is a clear understanding that this is Ukraine’s last chance to gain independence. Ukraine is defending not only itself but the entire democracy and civilization of entire Europe from Putin’s fascist regime.”

“We need to show the truth to the whole world. Call a spade a spade. We need humanitarian aid, weapons and international correspondents”

“The world reacts very slowly to the war. It imposes sanctions but that’s not enough.”

“Putin considers himself to be omnipotent who has the power to decide the fate of the entire state and it’s citizens. We are ready to fight with the last drop of our blood to gain freedom for our children and relatives.”

According to one of Maksim's relatives from Russia, President Putin considers himself omniotent who has the power to decide the fate of the entire country and it's citizen's.Showing the audacity to launch such a deplorablr attack on Ukraine is horrible.

“I think that Putin’s goal is to plunge the country, that raised its head, into shit. We just had started to live normally after the Crimea, Donbas and the pandemic."", his relative added.

""Ukraine needs international support. There is clear understanding that this is Ukraine's last chance to hain indpendence. Ukraine is defending not only itself but the democracy and civilization of entire Europe from Putin's fascist regime.""
