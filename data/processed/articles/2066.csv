As of 24:00 on March 11, the enemy continues to conduct an offensive operation against Ukraine, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine posted on Facebook[OL1] .

Russian troops bombed the border populated localities of Kopany, Bukhlychi, and Verkhny Terebezh in Belarus. No casualties were reported.

As the General Staff noted, the act is an insidious provocation carried out in order to involve the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus in a military operation against Ukraine on the side of Russia.

No offensive by the Russian invaders was observed in the Polissya direction.

The enemy continues to hold the line near the localities of Poliske, Kukhari, Borodianka, Andriyivka, Motyzhyn, Horenychi, Bucha, and Demydiv. In particular, the enemy took measures to restore combat readiness and regrouped troops.

In Siversky direction, the enemy is trying to conduct an offensive operation in the strip towards Zazymya and Vyshenky. In some areas, it is partially successful.

In order to block Chernihiv from the south-western direction, the enemy is trying to occupy Mykhailo-Kotsyubynske and Shestovytsia.

In Slobozhansky direction, the enemy amassed its forces in the areas of Severodonetsk, Svatovo, Kupyansk, Velyka Pisarivka, Moskovsky Bobryk, and Lebedyn, but did not carry out active offensive operations. Instead, it redeploys reserves to Sumy.

In Donetsk and Tavriya directions, the enemy focused its main efforts on capturing the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Severodonetsk.

In the South Buh direction, the Russian invaders hold the previously captured frontier. Separate units of the enemy established themselves in the area of the villages of Stepove and Shcherbaky and continue to carry out tasks in the area of Huliaypole.

As for the activity of the enemy’s air component, the Tu-95MS strategic bombers of the Russian Aerospace Forces fired air-launched cruise missiles on facilities in the cities of Lutsk, Dnipro, and Ivano-Frankivsk.

Thus, at least six Tu-95MS aircraft were involved in the missile strike, which launched at least 10 cruise missiles.

According to the General Staff, the enemy is unsuccessfully trying to restore the logistics of its units.

Anti-Russian rallies are taking place in the temporarily occupied territories.

For nearly three weeks now, Russian forces have poured over the Ukrainian border in what has become the largest ground conflict to hit Europe since the conclusion of World War II. However, despite Russia’s massive numerical and technological advantage, the aggressive nation’s forces have faced significant resistance, thus far failing to capture Ukraine’s embattled capital and proving largely unable to dominate the entirety of Ukraine’s airspace. But despite Ukraine’s successes, the odds remains stacked against them.

A NATO no-fly zone was already a bad idea

(U.S. Air Force photo)

The idea behind calling for a no-fly zone over Ukraine is largely based on previous NATO no-fly zone operations like those placed over Iraq, Bosnia, and Libya in past conflicts. These no-fly zones were fundamentally different than a no-fly zone over Ukraine for one glaring reason: they were enforced against minor regional powers with no real means to contest them, while Russia’s air force is among the largest in the world.

Instituting a no-fly zone over Ukraine sounds like a good idea because, in theory, it bars Russia from operating tactical aircraft and conducting airstrikes over Ukraine. But in practice, it means sending American fighters to war against Russian aircraft, and likely more.

Russia’s invasion force, which numbered somewhere near 190,000 troops at the onset of fighting, are bolstered by an air force that absolutely dwarfs that of Ukraine by a ratio of more than 20 to 1. However, a series of shortcomings have thus far limited Russia’s ability to dominate the skies over Ukraine, which has allowed some Ukrainian pilots to continue taking to the skies, as well as permitted a number of Ukrainian drone strikes against Russian convoys operating within the nation.

Throughout the conflict, Ukrainian officials have called on NATO and the United States to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO officials have repeatedly rejected the proposal, citing the high likelihood that instituting a no-fly zone would place NATO forces in direct combat with Russian troops, resulting in a rapidly growing conflict that could result in a global war—or worse—a nuclear exchange.

There are a number of reasons why a NATO-enforced no-fly zone over Ukraine would offer a great deal more risk than reward. Thus far, Russian aircraft have been less effective than Russian mortar and artillery attacks, which would continue undisturbed under a no-fly zone. Further, Russian air defense systems like the advanced S-400 Triumf have a range of some 250 miles, which means they would be able to engage NATO aircraft from inside Russian territory. That means, enforcing the no-fly zone would likely lead to airstrikes inside Russia and further escalation toward large-scale war.

There’s really no way around it: a NATO no-fly zone over Ukraine would almost certainly lead to a larger conflict, and now, it seems clear that it wouldn’t even stop missile strikes from taking place within Ukraine.

Russian bombers are now launching cruise missiles at Ukraine from inside Russia

Over the weekend, a shift in Russian tactics has now poked yet another hole in the concept of enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Russian strategic bombers have begun launching long-range cruise missiles at targets inside Ukraine from within Russian airspace. NATO aircraft would not be able to intercept or shoot down Russian aircraft flying over Russia under the guise of enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, and while American air defense systems may be able to intercept Russian cruise missiles, operating them would mean sending American troops into Ukraine to join the fighting—something President Joe Biden has repeatedly stated will not happen.

“More than a couple dozen” Russian cruise missiles were launched at the training center from aircraft, the senior U.S. defense official says.

Russia has previously demonstrated the capability to launch Kh-555 cruise missiles from both their Tu-95MS “Bear H” and the Tu-160 “Blackjack” bombers. The Kh-555 cruise missile is a modified iteration of a nuclear-cruise missile with the NATO reporting of AS-15 Kent. Considered a long-range standoff weapon, the Kh-555 has an operational range of nearly 2,200 miles, meaning Russian bombers can deploy these weapons while literally thousands of miles from Ukraine’s border and still engage their targets.

LVIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine’s president says nearly 125,000 civilians have been evacuated through safe-passage corridors so far, and a convoy with humanitarian aid is headed to the besieged city of Mariupol.

“We have already evacuated almost 125,000 people to the safe territory through humanitarian corridors,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video address released Sunday. ""The main task today is Mariupol. Our convoy with humanitarian aid is two hours away from Mariupol. Only 80km (left).”

“We’re doing everything to counter occupiers who are even blocking Orthodox priests accompanying this aid, food, water and medicine. There are 100 tons of the most necessary things that Ukraine sent to its citizens,” Zelenskyy said.

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis has decried the “barbarianism” of the killing of children and other defenseless civilians in Ukraine and pleaded for a stop to the attacks “before cities are reduced to cemeteries.”

In some of his strongest denunciations yet of the war in Ukraine, and in apparent reference to Russia, which invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the pontiff said that “there are no strategic reasons that hold up” in the face of such armed aggression.

Francis told about 25,000 people gathered in St. Peter’s Square for his customary Sunday noon appearance that Mariupol, the southern Ukrainian city which “bears the name” of the Virgin Mary, has “become a city martyred by the heartbreaking war that is devastating Ukraine.”

“In the name of God, I ask: ‘Stop this massacre,’” Francis said, sparking applause from the pilgrims, tourists and Romans, some of whom held Ukrainian flags, in the square.

Francis prayed for an end of the bombings and other attacks and for ensuring that humanitarian corridors “are safe and secure.”

ANTALYA, Turkey— Turkey’s foreign minister says his country is trying to evacuate Turkish citizens who were sheltering in a mosque in Mariupol.

Russian shells hit near the Sultan Suleiman Mosque Saturday. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the mosque had not been damaged and they had made contact with the Turkish nationals through satellite phones. He did not specify the number of people sheltering there. The Ukrainian Embassy in Ankara said Saturday 89 Turks, including 34 children, were at the mosque.

The minister said he spoke with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to ask for his support for a humanitarian evacuation corridor in Mariupol. Buses were ready for their evacuation Saturday but had not been able to enter the city because of clashes. Efforts continued Sunday.

Cavusoglu said 489 Turkish citizens had been evacuated Saturday from places where clashes continued, including Kherson and Kharkiv.

TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s foreign minister is condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, calling on Moscow to halt its attacks and end the conflict.

Yair Lapid’s criticism Sunday is among the strongest that has come from Israeli officials since the war began. His remarks set him apart from Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who has stopped short of condemning Russia.

Israel has walked a fine line in its response to the crisis. Bennett has voiced support for the Ukrainian people and the country has sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine. But Israel relies on Russia for security coordination in Syria, where Russia has a military presence and where Israeli aircraft have frequently struck enemy targets over recent years. Bennett has been attempting to mediate between the Kremlin and Ukraine.

Lapid made his remarks in Bucharest, Romania, where he met his Romanian counterpart.

LVIV, Ukraine — At least nine people were killed and 57 wounded when a Russian airstrike hit a military training base in western Ukraine close to the Polish border, a local official said Sunday.

The governor of the Lviv region, Maksym Kozytskyi, said Russian forces fired more than 30 cruise missiles at the Yavoriv military range, located 30 kilometers (19 miles) northwest of the city of Lviv and 35 kilometers (22 miles) from Ukraine’s border with Poland.

The assault brought the war closer to the border with Poland. A senior Russian diplomat has warned that Moscow considered foreign shipments of military equipment to Ukraine “legitimate targets.”

The United States and NATO have regularly sent instructors to the range, also known as the International Peacekeeping and Security Center, to train Ukrainian military personnel. The facility has also hosted international NATO drills.

Russian fighters also fired at the airport in Ivano-Frankivsk, a city in western Ukraine located 250 kilometers (155.34 miles) from Ukraine’s border with Slovakia and Hungary.

SUCEAVA, Romania — A widow fleeing the war in Ukraine with her teenage son has described the harrowing scenes they witnessed during their days-long journey from their bombed hometown of Chernihiv in north Ukraine.

The 44-year-old Elena Yurchuk worked as a nurse at a local hospital she says no longer exists. She says, “Our city is under siege and we barely escaped.”

She says, “People in cars are blown up by mines, a car with children and a young family was blown up … literally behind us.”

Yurchuk described Chernihiv as a “ghost town” with no electricity when they left. After reaching Suceava in north Romania, she's unsure where they’ll go next. They have earmarked Germany as a final destination, where she hopes to find work caring for the elderly.

She says, “I don’t know the language, it will be difficult for me.” She added that a lot of refugees have already arrived, saying, “I understand that no one needs us. ""

She says her house was in the center next to a hotel that was bombed in an airstrike, adding, ""I don’t know if I have a home or not.”

LVIV, Ukraine – Russia is trying to create new “pseudo-republics” in Ukraine to break his country apart, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address to the nation Saturday.

Zelenskyy called on Ukraine’s regions, including Kherson, which was captured by Russian forces, not to repeat the experience of Donetsk and Luhansk. Pro-Russian separatists began fighting Ukrainian forces in those eastern regions in 2014.

“The occupiers on the territory of the Kherson region are trying to repeat the sad experience of the formation of pseudo-republics,” Zelenskyy said. “They are blackmailing local leaders, putting pressure on deputies, looking for someone to bribe.”

City council members in Kherson, a southern city of 290,000, on Saturday rejected plans for a new pseudo-republic, Zelenskyy said.

Russia recognized the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic before invading Ukraine in February. Moscow said it had to protect the separatist regions, and is demanding that Ukraine recognize their independence too.

“Ukraine will stand this test. We need time and strength to break the war machine that has come to our land,” Zelenskyy said.
