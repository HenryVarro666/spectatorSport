These are the regional centers of Kharkiv, Kherson, Chernihiv, and Mykolayiv, the cities of Donetsk Volnovakha and Mariupol, Okhtyrka in the Sumy region and the suburbs of Kyiv, which took the main blow of the enemy’s attack on the capital – Gostomel, Bucha and Irpin. Unfortunately, it is already clear today that this list will be updated.

During the Soviet era, the honorary title of “city-hero” for heroism during World War II was awarded to 12 cities and the Brest Fortress. In Ukraine, Sevastopol (since May 1, 1945), Odesa (since May 1, 1945), Kyiv (since May 8, 1965), and Kerch (since September 14, 1973) have this title. According to the “Regulations on Orders, Medals, and Honorary Titles of the USSR” of 1979, the city awarded the title “Hero City” received the highest awards of the USSR – the Order of Lenin and the Medal “Golden Star”.

A similar honorary title – “hero city” was introduced in socialist Yugoslavia. Eight cities were awarded the “Order of the People’s Hero” there: Ljubljana (May 7, 1970), Drvar (May 21, 1974), Belgrade (October 20, 1974), Zagreb (May 7, 1975), Cetinje (May 7, 1975), Prilep (May 7, 1975). 1975), Novi Sad (May 7, 1975), and Pristina (May 7, 1975).

But the modern Ukrainian distinction is most similar not to the Soviet, but to the Italian counterpart, introduced during World War II, when Italy began to fall out of the power of the Third Reich.

Since the beginning of the Italian Liberation War, which lasted from October 1943 against the Germans and supporters of Benito Mussolini, state awards “For Military Valor” began to be awarded not only to individual soldiers – military or guerrillas, but also administrative units, communities, settlements (municipalities) , cities, provinces, autonomous regions), residential neighborhoods and universities, whose role in the Liberation War was recognized as important. Medals “For Military Valor” of various degrees (gold, silver, bronze, etc.) are awarded to settlements and administrative entities in Italy, after substantiating the facts of military heroism in their territory. The award winners now are 114 cities, 83 municipalities, 14 provinces and 2 autonomous regions of Italy.

The ongoing war in Ukraine demonstrates outstanding examples in the history of the world history of both individual citizens and entire territorial communities. Not only cities but also many villages are real outposts of the spirit. Their feat, which takes place every day during the repulse of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, will be duly celebrated.

1,b825baa4-4bea-4c6c-940c-c3d80cc211b2,"['Yesica Fisch', 'Cara Anna - Associated Press', 'Petros Giannakouris - Staff', 'Max Pshybyshevsky - Stringer']",,"ODESA, Ukraine (AP) — The Black Sea port of Odesa is mining its beaches and rushing to defend its cultural heritage from a feared Mariupol-style fate in the face of growing alarm that the strategic city might be next as Russia attempts to strip Ukraine of its coastline.

The multi-cultural jewel, dear to Ukrainian hearts and even Russian ones, would be a hugely strategic win for Russia. It is the country’s largest port, crucial to grain and other exports, and headquarters for the Ukrainian navy.

Bombardment from the sea last weekend further raised worries that the city is in Russia's sights.

Residents say Russian President Vladimir Putin would be insane to take Odesa with the brutal approach that has left other Ukrainian cities in ruins. Once a gilded powerhouse of the Russian empire, Odesa includes one of the finest opera houses in Europe and the famed Potemkin Steps between the city and the sea, featured in Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film masterpiece “Battleship Potemkin.”

But after a month of grueling war, people say they can’t predict anything anymore.

“The only thing we’re really afraid of is that the other side has no principles whatsoever,” said Valerii Novak, a local businessman. He never considered himself a Ukrainian patriot, but when Russia invaded, something “just clicked” in him. He has refused to leave Odesa and joined thousands of people in basic training in how to use a gun.

Now he and other Odesa residents watch Russian warships move closer, in provocation. Western officials call the Russian ships a mix of surface combatants and the kinds used to put naval infantry ashore.

The seizure of Odesa and the strip of land farther west also would allow Moscow to build a land corridor to the separatist Trans-Dniester region of neighboring Moldova that hosts a Russian military base.

A senior U.S. defense official said this past week the U.S. didn't see indications that ships in the Black Sea were firing on Odesa as they had last weekend. He spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject.

“It’s difficult to know what this indicates,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said of last weekend's bombardment. “Is it the prelude to an assault on Odesa? Is it a diversionary tactic to sort of hold and fix Ukrainian troops in the south so that they can’t come to the relief of their comrades in Mariupol or in Kyiv?""

The uncertainty adds to the anxiety in Odesa, where the initial panic has been followed by a wary calm.

Some residents are pitching in to strengthen the city’s defenses. On an unmined beach, sea captain Sivak Vitaliy joined others in packing sandbags for barricades.

“We will win,” he said, no matter how ghastly Russia’s invasion has become in cities like Maruipol or Kharkiv.

Ukrainian authorities assert that Russia appears to lack forces to quickly press an offensive on Odesa as its marine units are busy to the east with the siege of Mariupol, where they have suffered heavy losses.

Closer to Odesa, on the Black Sea coast, the Russian troops have taken Kherson and tried to bypass Mykolaiv, an important port halfway between Odesa and Russia-annexed Crimea, but fierce Ukrainian resistance has thwarted those attempts.

“Is our city the next one or not?” asked Hanna Shelest, an Odesa-based security analyst.

She said Russia needs Odesa to surrender, not to fight, to avoid the “blow to sentiment” that any destruction of the city’s cultural heritage would give to nostalgic Russians. Odesa was one of the largest and most cosmopolitan cities in the Russian empire, with a significant Jewish population as well as Greek, Italian and others drawn by the vibrant port.

Now the city's Italian baroque opera house, rebuilt in the 1880s, is one of the most heavily defended buildings in Ukraine. Major monuments elsewhere in Odesa are covered in sandbags. The contents of the fine arts museum, including Orthodox religious icons, have been moved into underground storage. Checkpoints are heavy throughout the historic city center.

Russian forces’ plans to take Odesa have been ruined by the Ukrainian resistance in Mykolaiv, a crucial land supply route, Shelest said. Without holding Mykolaiv, a Russian landing operation in Odesa from the sea would be suicidal.

“If the situation continues like this, there’s a chance for a big attack only if Putin becomes completely crazy,” she said. “From all considerations, he should not do it.”

Nevertheless, Shelest, like other Odesa residents, has gathered her documents in case she has to flee.

The mayor has estimated that 10% of the city's population of about 1 million has gone.

At the central train station, the iconic melody “At the Black Sea” played. The sound of the orchestra summoned up the 1950s Soviet-era as a man placed his hand against the cold window of a moving train in goodbye.

“It has taken a part of my heart from my chest when sending them away,” said another resident who gave just her first name, Ludmila. “I don’t know how it will be, what it will be.”

Russia’s invasion has created a wave of pro-Ukraine sentiment in a city whose population has shown significant pro-Russia feelings in the recent past. Shelest and other residents noted a survey published this month in which more than 90% of Odesa residents said they wanted to remain part of Ukraine.

“Nobody wants to be part of Russia anymore,” said Natalia Vlasenko, a local tour guide. She called any destruction of Odesa “my personal tragedy” and described a life of walking the streets of her great-grandparents and not wanting to leave.

The city might not be Paris or Rome, she said, but for Ukraine “it’s a gem.”

France's Macron says he is helping launch new evacuation effort in Mariupol France is helping launch a new evacuation effort in Mariupol, the southern Ukrainian port city that has been devastated after weeks of Russian bombardment, French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday. Speaking at the European Union Summit, Macron said the operation is being organized with Turkey and Greece “to evacuate all those who want to leave.” Macron said there had been discussions about the effort with the city’s mayor, and he planned on discussing it with Russian President Vladimir Putin within the next two days, he said. Some previous plans to help civilians flee the besieged city have worked, though several others have failed. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of shelling escape routes and capturing those fleeing the city. Officials in Mariupol said earlier Friday that roughly 300 people had died when Russian forces bombed a theater where more than 1,000 people were hiding earlier this month. NBC News has not independently verified the claim and Russia has denied targeting civilians. Share this -

U.S. man detained by Russians forces while fleeing Ukrainian city is released A Minnesota man who was detained by Russian forces while trying to flee the Ukrainian city of Kherson and held for 10 days has been released, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Friday. Tyler Jacob, 28, who was living in Ukraine, was taken by Russian forces around two weeks ago, her office said in a statement. “I am relieved that Tyler is safely reunited with his wife and daughter. Over the last two weeks, my team and I have been in close contact with his family, the State Department, and the U.S. embassy in Moscow working towards this outcome, and I am grateful that we were able to help bring him to safety,” Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, said in a statement.

Russian forces will refocus on 'complete liberation' of separatist Donbas region, military official says Russian forces have completed “the first stage” of what President Vladimir Putin has described as a “special military operation” in Ukraine and will now focus on the separatist Donbas region, a Russian military official said Friday. Speaking on the state-owned news channel Russia-24, Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoy, deputy chief of staff of Russia’s armed forces, said his country’s military is aiming for the “complete liberation” of the region. The Russian-backed breakaway “republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk have been involved in a low-intensity conflict with Ukrainian forces since 2014, when Russia also annexed Crimea. More than 14,000 people were killed in the conflict before Russia's invasion last month. Rudskoy’s comments come just over a month after Russia’s invasion began — and as its armed forces appeared to settle on a strategy of relentless assault after its military was hobbled by bad planning and stiff resistance from Ukrainians. A NATO official said the organization estimates that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian troops have died and tens of thousands more have been injured, captured or gone missing. Rudosky claimed that Ukraine’s ability to fight has been “significantly reduced, which makes it possible, once again, to focus the main efforts on achieving the main goal: the liberation of Donbas.” Read the full story here.

Pope Francis says 'vicious war' has 'overtaken so many people' Pope Francis prayed for peace in Ukraine on Friday and said the “vicious war that has overtaken so many people, and caused suffering to all, has made each of us fearful and anxious.” Francis said we “sense our helplessness and our inadequacy” but that “human reassurance is not enough.” “We need the closeness of God and the certainty of his forgiveness, which alone eliminates evil, disarms resentment and restores peace to our hearts,” Francis said. “Let us return to God and to his forgiveness.” Share this -

Russia no longer in full control of Kherson, official says Russian troops are no longer in full control of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after a counterattack by Ukrainian forces, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Friday. Russian forces captured Kherson in the first week of its invasion, the first major city to be captured after invading the country last month. “We can’t corroborate exactly who is in control of Kherson, but the point is, it doesn’t appear to be as solidly in Russian control as it was before. The Ukrainians are trying to take Kherson back,” the official told reporters. “We would argue that Kherson is actually contested territory again.” There was now ""heavy fighting"" underway in Kherson, the official said. The news came after U.S., British and Ukrainian officials said Ukrainian troops had stymied Russia's assault on the capital, Kyiv, and pushed back the Russians in some areas around the city. If Russia lost Kherson in the south, it would represent a major battlefield setback and complicate any attempt by it to capture the Black Sea port of Odesa, the Defense Department official said. If the Ukrainians took back Kherson, “that would be a significant development, no question about that,” the official added. Share this -







Russia sending reinforcements to Ukraine, U.S. official says The Russian military has started to move reinforcements to Ukraine from Georgia, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday. It was the first time Russia had deployed additional troops to Ukraine after having massed more than 150,000 forces around Ukraine before invading the country a month ago. The defense official told reporters in a phone briefing that “we've seen our first indication that they [Russians] are trying to send in some reinforcements from Georgia.” “So we have seen the movement of some number of troops from Georgia. We don't have any exact numbers,” the official said. Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and has kept troops in two secessionist areas, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Pentagon officials had indicated previously that Russia appeared to be considering bringing in more troops and supplies to bolster its forces in Ukraine. The move underscored how Russia’s attack on Ukraine has failed to produce a swift victory and has been plagued by logistical and communication problems, despite Russia’s overwhelming advantage in troop numbers and firepower.

Spotify pulls out of Russia Spotify said Friday it is pulling out of Russia due to legislation criminalizing certain types of news. ""Spotify has continued to believe that it's critically important to try and keep our service operational in Russia to provide trusted, independent news and information in the region,"" the streaming company said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, recently enacted legislation further restricting access to information, eliminating free expression, and criminalizing certain types of news puts the safety of Spotify's employees and possibly even our listeners at risk,"" it said. Spotify said it expected to have fully suspended its service in Russia by early April, after working through operational obstacles. Share this -







More than 1,080 civilians killed, 1,707 injured in Ukraine as of Thursday, United Nations says As of Thursday, more than 1,080 civilians have been killed and another more than 1,700 have been injured following Russia’s attack on Ukraine, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement Friday. A total of 1,081 civilians have been killed, including children, and 1,707 have been injured in regions around Ukraine, according to the United Nations. Most of the civilian deaths and injuries were caused “by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,” it said. The United Nations said it believes the actual figures are “considerably higher” given information delays and many reports pending confirmation. It also said a report from the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine said that as of 8 a.m. local time Friday, 135 children had been killed and 184 injured.

Ukrainian mother of 2 displaced by war: 'Pray that we win sooner' Yulia Zhdanova, a Ukrainian mother of two, fled her home in Chernihiv amid Russian bombing. She is now trying to survive in western Ukraine, where she described her new reality in stark terms. The people where she is sheltering ""cook food on the fire outside,"" Zhdanova said in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Friday. ""They don't have toilets because there is no water. ... They don't have gas, oil or electricity. No connection."" She said that trucks were bringing water to some regions, but stomach illnesses and other ailments were rampant ""because people can't even wash their hands."" Russian's attacks on bridges and other critical infrastructure make it especially challenging to access humanitarian aid, she said. Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces remain intent on ravaging her country, she said. ""They want to destroy everything of what we worshipped, everything [that] was precious to us,"" she said. ""We don't want them to do anything on our peaceful land, because before, we had a really good, peaceful life."" But she said she remains optimistic that Ukrainian troops and freedom fighters trying to resist Russia's assault will be triumphant in the end.

U.N. rights office says evidence growing of Mariupol mass graves The head of the U.N. human rights team in Ukraine said Friday that monitors had received more information about mass graves in the besieged port city of Mariupol, including one that appeared to hold 200 bodies. ""We have got increasing information on mass graves that are there,"" Matilda Bogner told journalists by video link from Ukraine, saying some of the evidence came from satellite images. The U.N. rights office, which has some 50 staff in the country, has so far counted 1,035 civilian deaths since Russia invaded Feb. 24. But verification difficulties meant that toll included ""very few"" from Mariupol, which has been under heavy bombardment for weeks, Bogner said. Bogner's team is probing alleged human rights violations, such as reports that Russian forces had shot and killed civilians in their cars as they were fleeing; dozens of cases of disappearances of Ukrainian officials and journalists; and the forced movement of civilians into Russian-held territory. Russia, which has called its actions since Feb. 24 a ""special operation"", has denied targeting civilians in Ukraine. Bogdan said her team have also received reports of violations by Ukrainian forces including indiscriminate shelling in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, and two alleged killings of civilians due to their perceived support for Russia. Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly said that they have never targeted civilians, adding that the people who are in Donetsk and Luhansk are Ukrainians. Share this -

Ukraine, Russia agree on evacuation corridors from Mariupol and Melitopol Ukraine and Russia have agreed upon two humanitarian corridors for Friday, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a televised statement. Vereshchuk said that an evacuation corridor was being established from the besieged city of Mariupol, which has been severely bombarded by Russian troops for weeks, to Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine. Evacuees were expected to arrange their own transport, she said. A centralized plan has also been approved from the port city of Berdyansk to Zaporizhzhia by bus for which 48 buses are already stationed at the entrance to Berdyansk, she said. A second humanitarian corridor links Melitopol to Zaporizhzhia, for which cargoes and buses have already arrived, Vereshchuk said. Russia has previously been accused of failing to uphold its end of agreements to provide safe corridors. Share this -







Ukraine asks E.U. to block land and sea transport with Russia and Belarus Ukraine has appealed to the European Union to completely block land and sea transport with Russia and Belarus and to prohibit the movements of goods, its ministry of infrastructure said Friday. In a statement on Facebook, it said that ""despite the restrictive measures already in place, Russian businesses are finding workarounds and continuing to operate in other countries.” It proposed that the European Commission prohibit the provision of custom services for goods delivered to the two countries. “These measures are necessary to stop the supply to the aggressor country of dual-use goods that can be used for military purposes,” it said. Earlier, the ministry had called on the E.U. to shut its ports for Russian and Belarusian related companies and demanded closure of the road network for their carriers, it said. Share this -







Israel tries to leverage Russia ties to try to end war in Ukraine JERUSALEM — On the surface, it seems like a doomed diplomatic gambit — the untested leader of Israel, which is known for its unresolved conflict with the Palestinians and wars with its neighbors, tries to help end the most serious combat in Europe since the end of World War II. That’s what happened when Prime Minister Naftali Bennett flew to Moscow on Feb. 26, a Saturday, two days after Russia invaded Ukraine, despite being an observant Jew for whom travel on the Sabbath is forbidden unless it’s a matter of life and death. Once there, he met with President Vladimir Putin for three hours in a bid to help end the war. Leaders from other top negotiator countries — NATO members France, Germany and Turkey — have spoken with Putin only by phone, according to Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the United States. Israel, which has failed to negotiate a two-state resolution with the Palestinians, could seem poorly cast as a diplomatic powerhouse in efforts to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The close ally of Washington has also been criticized for not having taken a stronger stance and joining many of its Western allies in sanctioning Russia. Read full story. Share this -

Biden says Putin using energy resources to 'coerce' neighbors as EU commits to transatlantic data flows President Joe Biden, in a joint statement with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said Putin has used Russia’s energy resources to ""coerce"" its neighbors, as the two leaders announced measures to reduce Europe’s dependency on Russian fuel. “I know that eliminating Russian gas will have costs for Europe. But it's not only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint, it's going to put us on a much stronger strategic footing,” he said in Brussels on Friday, as they announced the establishment of a task force. Von der Leyen also revealed a new framework for transatlantic data flow, enabling “predictable and trustworthy data flows between the EU and U.S.,” which Biden said will help “companies both small and large compete in the digital economy.” Share this -

Russia and Ukraine swap prisoners of war Russia and Ukraine have carried out their first ""full-fledged"" prisoner swap since the war began, according to Ukraine's deputy prime minister. Iryna Vereshchuk said in a Telegram post that 10 Russian prisoners of war were handed over in exchange for 10 Ukrainian servicemen. An additional 11 Russian civilian sailors rescued from a sunken ship were being exchanged for 19 Ukrainian sailors who hailed from the Sapphire rescue ship, she added. The Sapphire's crew was captured in late February when the vessel was trying to get troops off of Snake Island. Vereshchuk did not say when or where the exchange took place in her Thursday post. Russia's human rights commissioner, Tatyana Moskalkova, confirmed the swap, according to the Interfax News Agency. ""We, too, were involved in establishing contact with Ukraine on this issue. Work continues in the framework of the queries I receive from citizens,"" Moskalkova told Interfax. Share this -

Biden heads to Poland as country grapples with Ukraine refugee influx President Joe Biden on Friday plans to travel to southeastern Poland, where he intends to meet with U.S. troops and aid workers assisting refugees in a country on the front lines of the humanitarian and military crisis unfolding in Ukraine. Biden is scheduled to visit Rzeszow to thank the thousands of U.S. troops who began arriving at a military base there last month. The base in Poland is less than 100 miles from where Russian missiles struck a Ukrainian military post this month. Before he returns to Washington on Saturday, Biden said, he will try to meet with some of the refugees. “I’ve been to refugee camps, I’ve been in war zones for the last 15 years, and it’s devastating,” Biden said at a news conference Thursday. He said meeting with refugees in Poland would “reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks.” Read the full story here.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

Hitting and ambushing Russian forces behind the contact lines with fast-moving units, often at night, has proven among its most effective field tactics and is adding to the logistical missteps the Russians still have not been able to overcome, military strategists say. They add that the tactics are also demoralizing Russian troops.



""They're doing a tremendous job,"" said Colonel John Barranco of the Atlantic Council, a New York-based think tank.

""The Ukrainians have developed a very competent military with good leadership at the lower level and they're motivated. And this is why, when I looked at the Russian forces deployed for the invasion, I thought, this doesn't seem like a well thought-out effort.""

Barranco, who oversaw the U.S. Marines' initial operations in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks and served two tours in Iraq, said Russia miscalculated the resilience and capability of Ukrainian ground forces and the determination the Ukrainians would show in defending their territory. He said when he analyzed Russian forces arrayed along Ukraine's borders in February, before the invasion, he discounted the likelihood of a full-scale offensive.



""It seemed like the Kremlin attack plan might have been written in 2014. The Ukrainians have spent eight years building up their military and training,"" he said. Barranco credited training the Ukrainians have received since 2014 by U.S. National Guard units from California and other states in small-unit tactics for some of Ukraine's battlefield successes.





In the past 48 hours, Russian forces have struggled to maintain offensive actions northwest and east of Kyiv and have lost ground, with Ukrainian ground forces reoccupying territory they had lost, according to the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces. Ukrainians say they have now managed to encircle the Russian-occupied towns of Bucha, Irpin and the village of Hostomel northwest of Kyiv.

Earlier this week, the Ukrainians retook the strategically located village of Makariv outside Kyiv. Much of the success rests with the Ukrainians targeting Russia's already challenged supply lines.



Britain's Defense Ministry said the Ukrainians will likely continue to target logistical assets in Russian-held areas, forcing the Russians to ""prioritise the defence of their supply chain and deprive them of much needed resupply.""



British defense officials also confirmed Friday that Ukraine has reoccupied towns east of Kyiv. ""Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian Forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to re-occupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometers east of Kyiv,"" they said in a public intelligence update.



""In the south of Ukraine, Russian Forces are still attempting to circumvent Mykolaiv as they look to drive west toward Odesa, with their progress being slowed by logistic issues and Ukrainian resistance,"" they added.



Russian forces also appear to be preparing defensive positions around Kyiv, ready for a war of attrition. Earlier this week VOA reported that satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies, a space technology and earth-observation company, appeared to show Russians soldiers building protective dirt berms near the villages of Ozera, Zdvyzhivka and Berestyanka, northwest of Kyiv, and around Antonov Air Base.



The berms are likely being built to guard against Ukrainian counterattacks, Western officials said.



""The Ukrainians know their territory — they know their ground. They've thought about this for a long time, and they are outperforming the Russians at the small-unit level,"" Barranco told VOA.



He and other military analysts said the Ukrainians are using a variety of tactics to push the Russian forces onto the back foot.

Among them are setting up so-called kill boxes, or defined target areas, and then drawing their foes into them; unleashing highly focused and ferocious attacks on isolated Russian troops; creating fallback routes after ambushes as they set up a subsequent attack; and striking mechanized units when they are stalled.



Another advantage the Ukrainians are exploiting is competent leadership by noncommissioned officers (NCOs), the officials say, which is also consistent with U.S. military doctrine and training.



""The U.S. puts a lot of focus on building a professional, noncommissioned officer corps of corporals and sergeants who understand the big picture and are given the delegated authority to make decisions on the battlefield as they lead their units,"" Barranco said.



""Junior officers are also taught to work closely with professional NCOs. The Russian military has acknowledged they have a problem with poorly trained NCOs and have started an NCO academy because they realize they do not have good leadership at the lower levels,"" he added.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid tribute to Christians in Ukraine and referenced a Psalm in Ukrainian during his Easter message today.

In a video message on social media, Mr Johnson said: ""It's a time of year when our country bursts with new life and new hope.

""It's a time to be with family and friends and a time to reflect on what Christ's self-sacrifice and resurrection means for us all today.

""Whether it's Christians here in the UK loving their neighbours and carrying out the countless acts of kindness that are a hallmark of the faith.

""Those around the world facing fear of persecution, forced to celebrate their Saviour's rebirth in secret.

And of course, the Christians of Ukraine, whether they're marking Easter today or its Orthodox equivalent later this month, for whom Christ's message of hope, the triumph of life over death and good over evil will resonate this year perhaps more than any other.""

The 19 sailors defending Zmiinyi (Snake) Island were initially thought to have been killed by the invading Russian navy during the first week of the war, but it was later confirmed that they had been held as prisoners of war.

On Thursday, exactly one month after Russian troops invaded, the Ukrainian Parliament confirmed the sailors had been released as part of an exchange for 11 Russian sailors captured from a sunken ship.

In a Twitter post, the Ukrainian Parliament wrote: 'The first exchange of war hostages occurred on President Zelensky's order.

'Additionally, today, Ukraine exchanged 11 Russian sailors we rescued from a sunken ship near Odesa to 19 Ukrainian sailors (authors of the legendary phrase 'Russian warship go f*** yourself').'

The Ukrainian Parliament confirmed sailors who were captured after telling the Russian military to 'go f*** yourself' over the radio as they defended a small island in the Black Sea have been freed in a prisoner exchange with Moscow

The Ukrainian Navy previously confirmed that the soldiers on the island repelled two attacks by Russian forces on February 24, but were forced to surrender 'due to the lack of ammunition.'

They also said in the statement that Russian forces destroyed Snake Island's infrastructure, including lighthouses, towers and antennas.

The day after the attacks, an audio clip was shared online in which an officer from a Russian military ship could be heard telling the Ukrainian guards to 'lay down your arms immediately to avoid bloodshed and unjustified deaths', adding 'otherwise you will be bombed'.

The guards were then heard talking amongst themselves, agreeing 'this is it', before they responded to the Russian navy saying: 'Russian warship, go f*** yourself.'

Ukraine later lost contact with its forces defending the island after Russia conducted strikes from the air and sea, officials in Kyiv said.

A video circulating on Twitter also appeared to show the moment that the island was shelled. It showed a Ukrainian soldier staring at a camera before a shell landed nearby.

Ukrainian border guards protecting a tiny island in the Black Sea from Russia were thought to have been killed after telling Russian navy to 'go f**k yourself' but Russia confirmed they were captured

The Russian Defence Ministry released pictures which reportedly showed the guards boarding a bus after surrendering

Ukraine on Thursday said its 19 sailors were returning home from the rescue ship Sapphire which was captured by Russian occupiers while trying to withdraw Ukrainian troops from Snake Island.

'Under the exchange terms, the lifeboat will also be returned to Ukraine and sent to a Turkish port', the Ukrainian Parliament added.

The guards defending Snake Island, a strategically-significant speck of land south of the port of Odessa, were originally thought to have gone down in a blaze of glory during the attack and Zelensky even promised to posthumously decorate 'the heroic deceased border guards.'

But pictures released by the Russian Defense Ministry claimed the guards, part of the Ukrainian independent law enforcement agency, the State Border Guard Service, were still alive after 'voluntarily' surrendering their garrison to Russian troops.

Almost a dozen photos released by Russia purportedly showed the men boarding buses, being given bottled water and a food parcel, before being shown sitting in their seats.

Snake Island is strategically important because it allows Russia to claim territorial waters stretching 12 nautical miles out to sea.
