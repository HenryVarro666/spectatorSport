This week, several airlines around the world suspended their flights to Ukraine, with some airlines avoiding Ukrainian airspace altogether due to escalating tensions with Russia. Approximately 10 airlines including KLM and Lufthansa have suspended flights amid the warnings of an imminent attack on Ukraine.

According to the Ukrainian government, Ukraine's airspace is operating normally. Last Monday (21), Lufthansa suspended flights to Ukraine, joining KLM, which had suspended flights to the Eastern European country days ago. Lufthansa's suspension remains in place until the end of this month. Lufthansa Group flights to Lviv, located in western Ukraine, will continue as usual.

""The safety of our passengers and crew members is our top priority at all times. Due to the current situation in Ukraine, Lufthansa Group airlines are suspending their regular flights to Kyiv and Odesa,"" said Lufthansa Group in a statement.

The latest ch-aviation News article on the situation read HERE.

In terms of aerial access, all European Union member states along with Canada, Greenland, Albania, Iceland, Norway, and the United Kingdom have banned Russian aircraft, and by extension Russian airlines, from their respective airspace.

Ryanair, Wizz Air and SkyUp Airlines are the airlines that have been most affected by the closure of the Ukrainian airspace due to Russia’s invasion earlier today.

This graph shows the Market Share of the ten largest airlines in Ukraine by Seat Capacity:

With hard-hitting economic sanctions now almost certain, the following foreign lessors stand to be the most exposed in terms of potential impact. The graph below shows the Top 25 foreign lessors that manage aircraft placed with Russia-based airlines.

Here are the Top 25 lessors worldwide (including Russian entities), with the greatest exposure in Russia:

""The provision of air traffic services to civilian users of the airspace of Ukraine is suspended,"" UkSATSE said.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has issued an additional warning covering Belarusian and Russian airspace near the border with Ukraine.

""Operators should exercise extreme caution and avoid using the airspace within 100 nautical miles [185.2 kilometres] of the Belarusian and Russia-Ukraine border. [...] In particular, there is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft,"" the European agency advised.

Later, the EASA extended its advisory to 200 nautical miles (370.4 kilometres) from Ukrainian borders in the Russian airspace.

For its part, Russia initially closed a number of air routes in the Rostov Flight Information Region (FIR), an area adjacent to eastern Ukraine, on February 22. It later issued an additional NOTAM, effective on February 24 at 0500Z, declaring the entire length of the airspace at the border with Ukraine (and extending into Ukraine, beyond the formal boundaries of Rostov FIR) a temporary danger zone off-limits to civilian operators.

The closure of Ukrainian airspace has forced all airlines to cancel all flights to the country. Previously, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and all Lufthansa Group carriers cancelled flights to Kyiv Boryspil and airports in central and eastern Ukraine, although Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines continued to serve Lviv in the west.

Flightradar24 ADS-B data shows that the last flight to land at Kyiv Boryspil was Bees Airline' flight 7B922 from Sharjah, operated by a B737-900(ER) wet-leased from Ukraine International Airlines. UR-PSK (msn 36086) touched down at around 0320Z (0520L) on February 24.

ADS-B data indicates that there are at least 21 commercial aircraft grounded at Kyiv Boryspil, including the following aircraft:

Moldova also closed its airspace at 1202L (1002Z) on February 24 due to security concerns emanating from neighbouring Ukraine. The closure of the airspace forced the suspension of all operations to and from Chisinau, the country's only commercial airport.

After months of military buildup, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his decision to begin a ""military operation"" against Ukraine at around 0600L (0300Z) on February 24. Early reports indicate that the ground invasion was joined by Belarus with tanks filmed crossing the border into Ukraine from its northern neighbour.",https://www.ch-aviation.com/portal/news/112957-ukraine-closes-airspace-as-russia-invades

In the early hours of Thursday morning, Russia’s President Putin announced a ‘military operation’ in Eastern Ukraine. Observers fear the operation is a prelude to a full-scale invasion of Ukraine with the spectre of an attack on the capital Kyiv.

European air safety regulator EASA issued a ‘conflict zone information bulletin’ to operators on Thursday, ordering airlines based across the bloc to avoid flying through Ukrainian airspace and to exercise ‘extreme caution’ within 100 nautical miles of the Bielorussian and Russia-Ukraine borders.

The British government also issued an urgent ‘notice to air missions’ warning airlines of a hazardous situation within Ukraine. “This is due to the potential risk from dedicated anti-aircraft weaponry and heightened military activity”, the UK Department for Transport said in a statement.

Most European airlines had already suspended flights to and from Ukraine due to rising tensions in the last few weeks, with Lufthansa, KLM and Air France all grounding flights in recent days. Wizz Air and Ryanair confirmed on Thursday that it had now suspended operations in Ukraine.

“Due to the current events in Ukraine and the airspace closure, Wizz Air regrets to inform our customers that the airline must temporarily suspend all flight operations in the country,” the airline said in a statement on Thursday.

A spokesperson for Ryanair said the carrier would suspend Ukraine flights for an initial period of 14-days and would remove flights from sale for at least four weeks.

“We sincerely regret and apologise for these unprecedented disruptions and any inconvenience that they will inevitably cause to our Ukrainian customers,” Ryanair said in a statement.

Ukrainian airline Skyup Airlines flight PQ7980 from Tashkent to Kyiv was forced to divert to Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, after Ukraine suddenly closed its airspace on Thursday.
