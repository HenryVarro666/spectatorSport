President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday his government is ""carefully"" considering a Russian demand of Ukrainian neutrality, a key point of contention as negotiators for both sides prepare for a fresh round of talks aimed at ending the brutal month-long war.

""This point of the negotiations is understandable to me and it is being discussed, it is being carefully studied,"" Zelensky said during an interview with several independent Russian news organisations.

The UN estimates that at least 1,100 civilians have died and more than 10 million have been displaced in a devastating war that has gone on far longer than Moscow leaders expected.

The new talks -- starting in Turkey on either Monday or Tuesday, according to conflicting reports -- come after the Russian army said it would begin focusing on eastern Ukraine in a move some analysts saw as a scaling back of Moscow's ambitions.

But US President Joe Biden questioned that interpretation -- and may have roiled the coming talks by saying in Warsaw that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"".

The ad-libbed remark sparked outrage in Moscow and sowed widespread concern in Washington and abroad, seeming to undercut Biden's own efforts on a European visit to underscore a carefully crafted unity in support of Kyiv.

Asked by reporters Sunday if he had been calling for regime change, Biden responded: ""No."" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also told media that was ""not the objective of NATO, nor that of the US president.""

But France's President Emmanuel Macron warned that any escalation ""in words or action"" could harm his efforts in talks with Putin to agree on evacuating civilians from the devastated port city of Mariupol.

Neither intense diplomacy nor steadily mounting sanctions have persuaded Putin to halt the war.

But as the Russians face serious tactical and logistical problems, Ukraine's intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said Putin might be seeking to divide the country in Korea-like fashion -- to ""impose a separation line between the occupied and unoccupied regions"".

""After a failure to capture Kyiv and remove Ukraine's government, Putin is changing his main operational directions. These are south and east,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""It will be an attempt to set up South and North Koreas in Ukraine.""

Russia may try to establish a quasi-state of occupied zones with its own currency, he said, while adding that Ukrainian forces could foil those plans.

A neutral Ukraine?

A key demand from Putin, even before his troops rolled into Ukraine on February 24, was that it renounce its stated intention of eventually joining NATO.

The Kremlin earlier this month said Sweden and Austria offered models of neutrality that Ukraine could adopt.

Kyiv rejected the proposal, and in his interview with Russian journalists, Zelensky accused Putin of dragging out negotiations and prolonging the conflict.

NATO's 1949 treaty gives any European nation the right to apply for membership, and US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman said in January that ""we will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy"".

But NATO members have said Ukraine membership is a distant option at best. Were Kyiv to join the 30-member Western alliance, NATO would be committed to help defend it against any future attack.

The new round of talks come as Russia has de facto control over the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics in the country's eastern Donbas region.

The head of Ukraine's Lugansk separatist region said it may hold a referendum on becoming part of Russia -- a move immediately slammed by Kyiv.

As Russian forces continued a devastating siege of Mariupol -- a key obstacle to Moscow's ambition of gaining unbroken control from the Donbas to the Crimean peninsula -- its residents have recounted harrowing scenes of destruction and death.

Ukraine was making a new push to get civilians out on Sunday, with an aid route agreement for people to leave by car or bus, said Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk.

Several earlier attempts at establishing safe exit routes for the 170,000 civilians trapped in the city have collapsed amid mutual finger-pointing.

Macron said Sunday he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise ""a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of (Russian) troops by diplomatic means"" to allow full evacuation.

""If we want to do that, we can't escalate either in words or actions,"" he told broadcaster France 3, moving to dial down Biden's blunt words against Putin.

Counterattacks

Russia's original hopes of sweeping across Ukraine undeterred have faded, and with little progress in capturing key cities, its army has launched increasingly deadly attacks on civilians.

With Western-supplied weapons, Ukraine's fighters continue to hold off -- or even push back -- Russia's far-bigger military.

In the southern town of Mykolaiv, which had come under heavy Russian assault for weeks, the bombardments appeared to be easing.

Young Sofia suffered head injuries during shelling in early March near Mykolaiv.

""Now I can move my arms and legs a little. I still can't get up without my mother's help, but hopefully I can leave soon,"" she told AFP.

The frontlines appeared to have receded from Mykolaiv, with a counteroffensive being mounted in Kherson, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) to the southeast.

Shelling killed two people in a village near Kherson, the only significant city the Russian army has claimed to have seized.

In Kherson itself, around 500 people joined in anti-Russian demonstrations on Sunday.

Kyrylo, a paramedic who spoke with AFP by telephone, said Russians dispersed the peaceful rally with tear gas and stun grenades.

Boycott

The Ukrainian defence ministry said its forces had also recaptured Trostianets, a town near the Russian border.

It released images showing Ukrainian soldiers and civilians among heavily damaged buildings and what appeared to be abandoned Russian military equipment.

On the eastern outskirts of Kharkiv, a Holocaust memorial at Drobytskyi Yar commemorating 15,000 Jews murdered by the Nazis in World War II was damaged by Russian shelling.

Shelling also hit the village of Oskil, near Kharkiv, killing seven people, including two children, the regional prosecutor’s office said late Sunday.

Bombardments continued in Irpin, as well as other areas around Kyiv, said Ukrainian authorities.

Tamara Osypchuk, 72, told AFP she wrote poetry to calm herself in her Irpin apartment when the bombs rained down.

""The explosions were very strong -- like a volcano is exploding,"" she said, resting in a chair at an evacuation centre.

Ukrainian leaders meanwhile pushed the fight on the economic front, with Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba calling for a boycott of French retailer Auchan, which has continued doing business in Russia.

""If Auchan ignores 139 Ukrainian children murdered during this month of Russian invasion, let us ignore Auchan and all their products,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Today, March 28, Russia's military attack on Ukraine has been going on for thirty-three days. We're reporting on all the current news. The article will be constantly updated.

Key points?

Головне.

17,000 Russian servicemen have already been killed in Ukraine!

During the week, Allied forces repulsed 63 enemy attacks

Thanks to the skillful actions and skill of the servicemen of the Joint Forces, 5 enemy attacks have been successfully repulsed so far, according to the Joint Forces Operation.

In the past day alone, Ukrainian defenders destroyed two tanks, an infantry fighting vehicle, and an enemy car, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces shot down four Russian military planes, two drones, two cruise missiles, and a helicopter.

In one week, our troops destroyed 80 tanks, 72 armored units, 48 vehicles, 19 artillery systems, 7 unmanned aerial vehicles, 14 aircraft, a helicopter, and an enemy patrol boat. Also, the Joint forces destroyed the modern Russian electronic warfare system Leer-3 and captured five BMP-3 occupiers.

Yesterday, Russians launched new missile strikes on Lutsk, Kharkiv, Zhytomyr, Rivne, and didn't stop the carpet bombing of Mariupol. ""Russians have no more language, humanism, civilization. Only rockets, bombs and attempts to wipe Ukraine off the face of the earth. Does Europe really like it?"" Mykhailo Podoliak asks, reporting on the shelling.

Russian hostages include community leaders, activists, priests, volunteers, officials, and other Ukrainians who refuse to cooperate with the occupiers. As of March 26, there are 36 people on the list.

1119 civilians have fallen victim to the Russian occupiers since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Another 1,790 were wounded, the UN said. 3.8 million Ukrainians left the country, another 6.5 million became internally displaced. 13 million people are ""stuck"" in combat zones, they can not leave.

143 children died due to the armed aggression of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, another 216 were injured.

Putin underestimated Ukraine's response to the invasion. Russian troops will be depleted in the next 7-8 days; this forecast was given by the former commander of the US Army in Europe, General Ben Hodges. According to him, the Russians have problems, and they know about it, so they are asking for help from China and Syria. However, if they lose strength, they will still be able to fire missiles at cities.

Also, according to British intelligence, after the destruction of the Saratov ship, Russia is no longer sure about the possibility of operations off the coast of Ukraine. The morale of the occupiers is low, and Ukrainian troops are aggressively resisting the enemy.

Humanitarian corridors

On March 27, both declared humanitarian corridors in Ukraine worked, and 1,100 people were evacuated. More than half a thousand of them are from Mariupol, who reached Zaporizhzhia by their personal transport.

Seven humanitarian corridors were planned for March 28, but intelligence reported possible provocations by the occupiers along the routes. Therefore, for reasons of security of citizens, today we do not open humanitarian corridors, Iryna Vereshchuk informed.

French President Macron has found himself on a humanitarian mission. He said he planned to hold talks with Putin on the evacuation of Mariupol residents. Earlier, he announced the intention of France with the participation of Greece and Turkey to remove civilians from the city.

22:00 – A convoy of 15 buses from Berdiansk arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Another 881 people were evacuated.

Peaceful atom

Ukraine demands that the UN Security Council take immediate measures to demilitarize the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone captured by the Russian occupiers and establish a special mission there.

Energoatom said that according to the Russians, the occupiers seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant using heavy weapons to ""save the station from the Ukrainian Nazis, who were going to commit a terrorist attack."" This delusion was said by them during the International Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material.

Ukraine's talks with Russia

""A new round of talks is ahead because we are looking for peace. Our priorities are known. Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory. Our goal is obvious: peace and the restoration of normal life in Ukraine as soon as possible,"" said President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his address on the 32nd day of the war.

European Council President Charles Michel said it was necessary to continue dialogue with Russia on the situation in Ukraine. According to him, Russia has committed war crimes in Ukraine, but a dialogue with Putin is necessary, ""like it or not.""

20:00 – The President of Turkey will hold talks with the delegations of Ukraine and Russia before their meeting in Istanbul. This was stated by the President of Turkey following a meeting of the Turkish Cabinet. He noted that telephone talks with Presidents Zelenskyy and Putin ""continue in a positive light.""

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Media support is also important. The stars of world cinema wore badges or ribbons at the Oscar ceremony in support of Ukraine. A moment of silence in honor of Ukraine was also held at the ceremony. A text was launched on the screen stating that millions of families in Ukraine now need food, blood, and medicine. It is a pity that the Oscars ""forgot"" to mention that Russia is guilty of war crimes.

The First Lady of Poland brought from the United States two military hospitals for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Thank you!

The United States will supply Ukraine with diesel fuel. This was announced by the adviser to the Minister of Energy Lana Zerkal on the air of Radio NV.

As part of the international strategic initiative Help East, a humanitarian cargo of medical supplies arrived in Ukraine from France. This time, the National Military Medical Clinical Center in Kyiv and the Military Medical Clinical Center of the Eastern Region received assistance. The cargo consists of disinfectants, medicines, medical supplies, dressings, and hygiene products.

American actor Sean Penn and his NGO CORE will help IDPs in Lviv. This was reported in the press service of the Lviv Regional State Administration. ""Our organization wants to establish a partnership right here in Ukraine. We know how important it is to support the population in the struggle for freedom, so we will help everyone we can. Your experience is an example for the whole world,"" said Sean Penn.

After talking with the President of Azerbaijan, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Azerbaijan was ready to provide Ukraine with fuel for sowing.

An auction for the sale of Banksy's CND Soldiers anti-war painting has ended in London. The auction brought in more than 100 thousand dollars; this money is intended for the Kyiv Children's Hospital Okhmatdyt.

And US President Joe Biden has submitted a proposal to the budget for 2023. It provides for the allocation of billions to Ukraine to counter Russian aggression, according to CNN.

The G7 countries have said they will not pay for rubles in Russian gas, stressing that it is ""a unilateral and blatant breach of existing contracts."" In response, Peskov threatened that Russia would cut off gas to Europe in such a case. This threat is not equal to closing the valve in the kitchen. If Russia dares to do so, it will simply have to burn the extracted gas in the air.

What's in Russia?

After the end of the war, Russia will pay contributions and reparations to Ukraine for decades. This was announced during the All-Ukrainian TV Marathon by Presidential Adviser Oleh Ustenko. ""It is clear that the seized funds in Russia may not be enough for our full recovery. Plus, there will be additional lawsuits against Russia. Contributions and reparations will come into force here, which will be paid by Russia according to the international court, but this will happen over a long period,"" said Ustenko.

Bringing the enterprises of the Russian defense-industrial complex involved in the production of missiles to round-the-clock operation indicates a significant reduction in the arsenal of missile weapons. Moreover, the prospects for self-manufacturing of high-tech electronic equipment, which is an important component of the technological process of manufacturing missiles, are far from bright. Glory to the sanctions!

In Moscow, a girl who threw a bottle of the incendiary mixture at a police officer during a rally against the war with Ukraine on February 24 was sentenced to two years in prison.

Russian lies

Another fake from Russia: the occupiers are shooting stage videos where the Ukrainian military allegedly mocks Russian prisoners. This was announced by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi: Servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other legitimate military formations strictly adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law,"" Zaluzhnyi stressed.

""Russian humanitarian cargo"" means stealing Ukrainian products and a Ukrainian car and drawing a Russian z-swastika. Lies and theft in everything!

Anonymous, which is waging a ""cyberwar"" against Russia, said it had hacked the All-Russian State Television and Radio Company (VGTRK); they later promised to publish 870 GB of data on how selected Mordor lies were created.

Russia's censorship agency has threatened journalists who interviewed the Ukrainian president.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

The Czech Republic froze the property of Russian oligarchs for hundreds of millions of korunas. The Czech Financial Analytical Unit (FAU), which is responsible for enforcing sanctions, said some companies were trying to circumvent the sanctions, so the office froze accounts and opened a criminal case.

Foreign companies that continue to operate in Russia will pay 50% more taxes in Ukraine. Such an initiative was developed in the government and parliament.

South Korea has banned the export of 57 types of non-strategic goods to Russia and Belarus. It is a ban on the export of semiconductors and parts to computer equipment.

Nokia and Lexmark have suspended supplies to Russia. ""Companies have not only suspended the supply of their goods to the aggressor country but also donate to international organizations that support humanitarian work in Ukraine,"" said First Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation Oleksandr Borniakov.

Germany is against the deployment of NATO peacekeeping forces in Ukraine and the creation of a no-fly zone, said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. According to him, the main tool in the fight against Russia is now sanctions. Sanctions are, of course, good, but because of Germany's unwillingness to take risks, living people continue to die in Ukraine.

However, Germany itself does not rely on sanctions but plans to purchase a missile defense system, such as the Israeli Iron Dome. ""We need to understand that we have a neighbor who is willing to use violence to defend his interests,"" Scholz said. Some kind of double German morality.

Google has stopped licensing Russian Android smartphones.

There will be no money either. The UAE investment fund Mubadala Investment Company will suspend investments in Russia, said the chairman of the fund.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called for a solution to the situation in Mariupol and compared the situation in the city to the destruction of Aleppo, Syria. According to the Minister, if the West does nothing to help the civilians of besieged Mariupol, it will be a collective fault.

""During the last night, houses in Severodonetsk and Rubizhne were shelled. A child died and another was injured in Borovske. Yesterday, the Armed Forces expelled the enemy from one of the districts of Rubizhne. In total, in the Luhansk region and Donbas, we repulsed 5 massive attacks by the Russian army in one day; tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and enemy vehicles were destroyed,"" said Haidai, head of the Luhansk region.

Luhansk Regional Military Administration: In the morning the Russians fired on Severodonetsk. There are victims; an 86-year-old woman died.

As fighting raged across Ukraine and one of the country’s top military leaders warned that Russian forces may seek to split the nation in two, U.S. officials scrambled Sunday to clarify President Biden’s off-the-cuff condemnation of Russian President Vladimir Putin a day earlier, saying regime change in Moscow is not on Washington’s agenda.

President Biden’s dramatic Saturday declaration — “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” a reference to Putin — has prompted a frantic effort to walk back what appeared to be a White House endorsement of pushing the Russian leader out of office.

“We do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia, or anywhere else, for that matter,” Secretary of State Anthony J. Blinken told reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday. “In this case, as in any case, it’s up to the people of the country in question, it’s up to the Russian people.”

Later, asked by a reporter as he exited a church service in Washington whether he was calling for removal of Putin, Biden replied “no.”

Biden’s remarks in Warsaw at the finale of a rousing, pro-Ukrainian speech prompted an outpouring of criticism at a moment when some fear the Russian invasion could escalate into a larger, even more catastrophic conflict. Now in its second month, the war has turned into a grinding ordeal as Russian forces continue to besiege the north and south while Ukrainian counteroffensives have pushed Russian soldiers back from advancing on the capital Kyiv.

Biden’s comments “made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous,” Richard Haass, a veteran U.S. diplomat and chairman of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, wrote on Twitter. “This is obvious. Less obvious is how to undo the damage,” he added, suggesting that Biden’s team make it clear that they are indeed willing to deal with the current Russian leadership.

French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, warned against verbal “escalation” with Moscow

The concern is that Biden’s remarks played into Putin’s worldview that the West — with its NATO expansion and economic sanctions — wants to destroy Russia. In Jerusalem, Blinken said Biden’s comments were not meant to suggest that the Russian president should be replaced. Rather, Blinken said, Biden’s point was that Putin “cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else.”

The reaction in Moscow was predictably dismissive. “The president of Russia is elected by Russians,” Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, told reporters.

The Russian invasion has resulted in thousands of casualties and vast damage to Ukrainian cities, with a recent report from the Kyiv School of Economics estimating $63 billion in damage to the nation’s infrastructure since Putin launched his invasion in late February.

The fighting has displaced more than 10 million people, almost one-quarter of Ukraine’s population, and more than 3.7 million refugees have fled the country, according to the United Nations.

The images of destruction and mass displacement have clearly prompted Biden to ramp up his verbal attacks against Putin, whom he has labeled killer, war criminal and, while in Warsaw on Saturday, a “butcher.” The comments have come as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine to end the conflict appear to have stalled.

While Biden faced criticism for potentially escalating the conflict, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky knocked him and other Western leaders for lacking courage for failing to commit fighter jets and tanks to his nation’s battle against invading Russian forces.

Ukraine, Zelensky said in video remarks, has asked NATO and its allies for aircraft and tanks to help repel Russian forces. But Western leaders have repeatedly equivocated out of fear that giving weapons to Ukraine could spark a wider war.

“Ukraine cannot shoot down Russian missiles using shotguns, machine guns,” Zelensky said in a speech early Sunday in which he also alluded to the besieged eastern city of Mariupol, where images of shell-battered apartment towers, hospitals and shopping centers have come to epitomize the destruction wrought by the war.

“I’ve talked to the defenders of Mariupol today. I’m in constant contact with them. Their determination, heroism and firmness are astonishing,” Zelensky said. “If only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to hand over dozens of jets and tanks had 1% of their courage.”

Zelensky said that the war — which Putin has said was launched in part to protect Ukrainians with “blood ties” to Russia — was having the opposite effect: Stigmatizing a language that has long existed alongside Ukrainian as a native tongue for many Ukrainians, especially in the east and south.

“Russia itself is doing everything to ensure that de-Russification takes place on the territory of our state,” Zelensky said. “This is another manifestation of your suicide policy,” he added, directing his remarks at Moscow.

Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, said that Russia’s goal was to split Ukraine in two, like North and South Korea.

“The occupiers will try to pull the occupied territories into a single quasi-state structure and pit it against independent Ukraine,” Budanov said, although he predicted that guerrilla warfare by Ukrainians would derail such plans.

In recent days, Russia has said that it is focused now on consolidating gains in the contested Donbas region, home of two pro-Moscow breakaway republics.

Leonid Pasechnik, the leader of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic in the Donbas, said he may hold a referendum on his territory becoming part of Russia.

“I think that in the near future a referendum will be held on the territory of the republic, during which the people will… express their opinion on joining the Russian Federation,” Pasechnik said, according to Russian-state media organization TASS and other outlets.

Britain’s Defense Ministry said that Russian forces appear to be attempting to encircle Ukrainian forces arrayed against pro-Russia separatist fighters in that region.

Still, fighting and shelling have continued in other parts of the country.

Russian troops Sunday continued battling for control of several key Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv in the northeast and Mariupol in the south. In the village of Oskil, outside of Kharkiv, shelling killed seven people, including two children, according to local officials.

Mariupol Mayor Vadim Boychenko said on Telegram that while Russian forces have entered his city, Mariupol remains “under the control of Ukrainian armed forces.”

“There is a Ukrainian flag flying over the city,” he said.

Ukrainian forces have put up stiff resistance in other urban areas, including in Kyiv, the capital. Ukrainian military officials said Sunday that some Russian troops had been withdrawn to regroup in Belarus, a Moscow-friendly country 125 miles north of Kyiv.

The western city of Lviv, a hub for the war-displaced multitudes that has otherwise been largely spared from the war, was hit Saturday afternoon by a pair of Russian air strikes. Many residents speculated that the volley of missiles, which hit a fuel depot and a military installation, was intended as a message to Biden, who was in nearby Poland when the attacks occurred.

“With these strikes the aggressor wants to say, ‘Hello,’ to President Biden,” Andriy Sadoviy, Lviv’s mayor, said late Saturday.

No one was killed in the two strikes in Lviv, authorities said. Both volleys appeared to hit their objectives with precision, despite the proximity of residential districts to the targets.

Lviv appeared calm Sunday as people attended church services, stopped at busy cafes and restaurants, and strolled in the streets of the cobble-stoned historic center. But the attacks were another reminder that the war was not just isolated to the embattled environs of Kyiv, 335 miles to the east, and to beleaguered cities in the far-away south, east and north.

“Of course it makes one nervous — this conflict is not a video game any more,” said Borys Babelashvili, 59, a shop owner who was walking his dog in the esplanade facing the city’s 19th-century opera house. “It’s natural to be worried. But one has to go on with one’s life.”

Nearby, two displaced families from the war-battered northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-most populous after Kyiv, said they heard about the strikes after arriving here by train late Saturday. That Lviv was now in the cross-hairs of Russian cruise missiles wasn’t a welcome development. They had already experienced too many air and artillery attacks in Kharkiv.

“I hope the war is not following us here,” said Natasha Barsukova, 17, who was traveling with two siblings and her mother. “No, we don’t feel safe in Lviv either. We are moving on.”

The two families — two women and four children — were planning to leave the next day for Dusseldorf, Germany.

Still remaining in Kharkiv are the children’s fathers who, as military-aged men, are barred from leaving the country. Such separations are the norm in Ukraine now, as men bid goodbye to departing friends and family members who daily escape besieged areas on foot, and in cars, buses and trains for the relative safety in the country’s west and beyond.
