Russia’s deputy energy minister said Thursday that the electricity lines to the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant site have been repaired, but the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said there was no confirmation that power to the former plant has been restored. Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight Yevgeny Grabchak was quoted in the ministry’s news service Thursday as saying that Belarus has reestablished electricity lines to the Chernobyl site. But the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said communications were too “shaky” to confirm.

Earlier, Ukraine’s national electricity grid operator, Ukrenergo, said it had a team ready to restore power at the closed Chernobyl nuclear power plant and was waiting for a safe corridor to be created. It also rejected an offer from neighboring Belarus to send specialists to help fix the high-voltage power transmission line.

The site of a catastrophic 1986 nuclear accident was disconnected from the grid by Russian forces, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday, potentially jeopardizing the cooling of nuclear material still stored at the site and sparking global concern.

“Ukrenergo expects a safe corridor that will enable the reconstruction of the line to power Chornobyl,” it said in a Facebook post Thursday, using Ukraine’s spelling for the plant. “Our repair teams are ready to restore the line immediately, despite the threat of being shot by the enemy and are waiting for permission.”

The controversy over the transmission line repairs comes amid another, over poor and stressful working conditions at the Chernobyl plant: limited access to medicine, no cellphone or landline connections and now a disruption in electricity. Some 210 technical experts and guards inside the idle Chernobyl site face “worsening” conditions, unable to leave the facility since Russian forces took control two weeks ago, Ukrainian officials said.

Over 340 miles southeast of Chernobyl, workers at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, a part of which was set ablaze by Russian forces as they captured the complex last week, are in “very bad psychological conditions,” according to Petro Kotin, head of Ukraine’s state-owned atomic energy firm Energoatom. Nuclear technicians are being forced to work at gunpoint, Kotin told local media outlets Wednesday, adding that the plant is completely locked down by Russian forces.

Nuclear experts have raised concerns about the conditions faced by employees at both facilities as their occupation continues. The IAEA, a nuclear watchdog for the United Nations, says sufficient rest is a pillar of nuclear safety. Employees must be able to rest and work in regular shifts and be able to make decisions free of “undue pressure,” it said.

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk also appealed in a video posted Thursday on Telegram for crews to be allowed into Chernobyl to repair a “special power transmission line” that she said has been damaged by Russia.

“We demand that a repair team immediately be allowed access to get rid of the damage,” Vereshchuk said. “We ask the global community to focus its attention on this problem.”

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Thursday he has instructed Belarusian specialists to ensure the power supply to the Chernobyl plant, the Belarusian BelTA news agency reported, according to Reuters.

Ukrenergo rejected the offer in an online post Thursday and said it did not need Belarusian assistance to repair the high-voltage lines.

“All the reports of the Russian and Belarusian media about the fixing/restoring of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by Belarus are a provocation aimed at exacerbating the situation,” Ukrenergo said.

“We need a cease-fire and the admission of our repair teams, who have been waiting for approval to leave for repairs since yesterday. … Just stop the shelling and let our teams do their job!” the utility added.

Electricity is needed for cooling, ventilation and fire-extinguishing systems at the closed site. Emergency diesel generators are powering the plant for now but have limited fuel, according to Ukrenergo.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Wednesday demanded a cease-fire with Russia to allow for repairs.

He warned that after reserve diesel generators run out of fuel, “cooling systems of the storage facility for spent nuclear fuel will stop, making radiation leaks imminent.”

However, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday that the power loss “violates [a] key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply,” but it added that “in this case IAEA sees no critical impact on safety.”

The U.N. nuclear watchdog said factors including the volume of cooling water at the Chernobyl site were “sufficient for effective heat removal without need for electrical supply.”

Ukraine’s parliament reiterated demands for a cease-fire Thursday and made a formal plea for IAEA specialists to come to Ukraine to “assess the situation.” It said repairs at Chernobyl are “currently impossible.”

“The situation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is difficult. ... We don’t know what to expect from the occupiers. They are monkeys with a grenade,” Andrii Herus, chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on energy and housing, said in a Telegram post.

“We invite IAEA specialists to Ukraine not only to learn from our words what is happening at Ukrainian nuclear power plants but also to see for themselves what the occupiers are doing.”

Officials at Energoatom said in a post on Telegram on Thursday that two of the four power lines at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the country’s largest, have also been “damaged by the occupiers.” It warned that if the other two power lines are damaged, it could lead to a “catastrophe.”

“At the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which like Chernobyl is under the control of the occupying forces, personnel continue to work under the barrels of machine guns,” Kotin, head of Energoatom, told local media.

Nuclear experts have raised concerns about the conditions faced by the hundreds of technical employees and guards at both the Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl sites as the Russian invasion continues, with reports of limited access to food, medicine and communications.

The IAEA also said Wednesday it has “lost data transmission from its safeguards systems” installed to monitor nuclear material at both the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. Grossi, head of the IAEA, tweeted that he was in Antalya, Turkey, on Thursday joining diplomatic officials to discuss the “urgent issue” of ensuring the safety and security at Ukraine’s nuclear facilities.

The Chernobyl catastrophe ranks as the world’s worst nuclear power plant accident, after explosions and fires in 1986 sent a huge radioactive cloud over parts of Europe and left contaminated soil and other fallout, which remains dangerous, at the plant site.

The Chernobyl zone is still one of the most radioactively contaminated places in the world despite being decommissioned. A small number of people still live in the area — mostly elderly Ukrainians who refused to evacuate. Robots inside the shelter work to dismantle the destroyed reactor and gather up radioactive waste. It is expected to take until 2064 to finish safely dismantling the reactors.

Last month, the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that its forces had taken control of the area near the site as part of Russia’s wider invasion of Ukraine, sparking global alarm.

The IAEA this week reiterated an offer to both sides for its teams to travel to Chernobyl and other sites in Ukraine to help protect nuclear facilities amid the continuing conflict.

The daughter of a overnight staffer being held hostage in Chernobyl has warned the plant is being held by Russian forces who 'have no clue about nuclear security protocols' after Kyiv's intelligence agency claimed Putin's forces are preparing to fake a terror attack at the site to try to blackmail the world.

Natalia Ruemmele has warned that staffers who usually work 12 hour shifts have been maintaining the nuclear plant at gunpoint for more than two weeks since Russian forces seized control of the site as she pleaded with Moscow to agree to a ceasefire and allow a shift change.

Ukrainian intelligence earlier warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his troops to create a 'man-made catastrophe' at Chernobyl which he plans to blame on Ukrainian 'saboteurs' in order to justify further escalating his war against the ex-Soviet country.

Ukrainian spies say the 'terrorist attack' will be carried out by Russian operatives who moved in yesterday amongst a group of 'specialists' sent by Belarus to take over safety operations at the partially-destroyed nuclear power plant, which was seized by Russian forces in the opening days of the invasion.

Belarus sent the team in after Putin's men disconnected Chernobyl from monitoring systems which report the status of its nuclear safety systems to UN watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and cut power to the plant - meaning water used to keep its fuel rods cooled will no longer automatically top itself up.

Power to the plant was cut more than 40 hours ago leaving the reactors reliant on diesel generators that 'have a 48-hour capacity' before radiation leaks become 'imminent, according to transmission system operator Ukrenergo.

Nuclear safety experts say Chernobyl has diesel generators which should have automatically kicked in after the power was disconnected to keep pumps running, after which water which cools nuclear fuel rods at the plant will start to evaporate - exposing the rods which could then start to burn and create a cloud of radioactive ash. All that should be needed to prevent that is for Russians to top up the water manually, which could be done with a water truck.

Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency on Friday that technicians have started repairing damaged power lines at the decommissioned Chernobyl power plant in an effort to restore power supplies, the UN nuclear agency said.

The Ukrainian nuclear regulator said Friday that workers repaired one section of the lines, but there still appears to be damage in other places. Repair efforts would continue despite 'the difficult situation' outside the plant, which was taken by Russian forces early in the invasion, the IAEA said.

The Ukrainian regulator said additional fuel was delivered for generators, but it remains important to fix the power lines as soon as possible. The IAEA reiterated that the disconnection 'will not have a critical impact on essential safety functions at the site.'

But Kyiv's Main Intelligence Directorate believes Moscow's actions show it is laying the ground for a manufactured nuclear catastrophe. They say Russian forces have been collecting the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers who died fighting at Hostomel airport - the site of clashes close to Kyiv - in refrigerated lorries so they can be taken to Chernobyl and posed up as saboteurs.

Putin's motivation is to 'blackmail the global community' for sanctioning Russia and providing weapons to Ukraine, which have battled the Russian leader's forces to a near-standstill with heavy losses. At the same time, the disaster - which would almost certainly cause radioactive fallout to land on Russia - would also be used to justify the use of further force against Ukraine.

Though Kyiv's account cannot be independently verified, it comes against the backdrop of Russian attacks on other nuclear reactors in the country - at Zaporizhzhia in central Ukraine and Kharkiv in the east - which Ukraine has said are 'nuclear terrorism'.

Zaporizhzhia power plant was attacked last week, sparking a fire near one of the reactors which Russian forces initially prevented fire crews from extinguishing. Kharkiv's Institute of Physics, which houses a reactor, was also shelled this morning - though no damage was caused to the nuclear facility.

Meanwhile the head of a nuclear research facility in the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv said on Friday that the grounds of the institute had been struck by Russian shells during recent fighting, but the core housing nuclear fuel remains intact.

He warned, however, that any future damage to equipment in the core could pose a danger.

'The facility, in working condition, doesn't present any danger whatsoever,' said Mykola Shulga, director general of the National Science Centre Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology.

'However, if there is physical damage, a nuclear fuel leak is possible, radioactive elements (could escape) outside,' he said, speaking inside the facility. 'This obviously would be a huge, huge problem for the environment. In other words, what would happen would be comparable to a similar situation at any nuclear power station.'

While the inner areas of the institute were unscathed, some of the outer walls of the building were damaged by shrapnel and windows were blown in.

It comes against the backdrop of western governments saying Russia appears to be laying the groundwork to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine - an attack that would also be blamed on Kyiv with the aim of justifying a further increase in violence.

Ukraine has also today accused fighter jets of staging a 'false flag' attack on Belarus as a pre-text to getting Alexander Lukashenko's troops involved in the fighting.

Kyiv said two Su-25 bombers crossed the border from Belarus this afternoon, carried out attacks on Ukrainian soil, and then bombed Belarus itself. Defence minister Olexiy Reznikov said the attack was planned by Russia.

'The purpose of this provocation is to force the current leadership of Belarus into war against Ukraine. Moscow is trying to bind you with blood,' he said.

Lukashenko has so-far refused to get his men involved in the war, after commanders reportedly quit rather than join the fighting. The 'false flag' operation came immediately after the dictator met Putin in Moscow to discuss trade links, and agreed Russian would supply Belarus with modern military equipment.

Ukraine's defence ministry later said it expects Belarusian forces to cross the border and join in the fighting at 9pm (7pm GMT) tonight - though is not yet any sign that Minsk has joined the invasion.

But Russian forces continued pounding the city of Mariupol on Friday night and elsewhere Moscow's men stopped some buses of people trying to flee the Kyiv region, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.

In a video address, Vereshchuk said some planned evacuations were successful, including 1,000 people who were evacuated from the village of Vorzel in the Kyiv region. Ukraine says 1,582 civilians have died there in 12 days after the invasion.

Jen Psaki, spokesman for the White House, said Russia is engaged in an 'obvious ploy' to justify its own use of chemical weapons in Ukraine by pumping out disinformation that America is secretly developing the weapons in Ukraine in laboratories close to the Russian border.

'Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,' she said earlier this week.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a similar statement yesterday, saying: 'The stuff that you're hearing about chemical weapons is straight out of their playbook.

'They start saying that there are chemical weapons that have been stored by their opponents or by the Americans. And so when they themselves deploy chemical weapons, as I fear they may, they have a... fake story ready to go.

'You've seen it in Syria. You saw it even in the UK. That's what they're doing. It is a cynical, barbaric government.'

Joe Biden warned Friday that Putin will pay a 'severe price' if he uses chemical weapons in Ukraine - but again repeated that American troops would not be sent into the country to prevent the outbreak of World War Three.

'The United States and our allies and partners continue to work in lockstep to ramp up the economic pressures on Putin and to further isolate Russia and the global stage,' Biden said in his announcement from the White House.

Biden also said he will revoke Russia's 'most favored nation' trade status over its invasion of Ukraine, another step in the series of harsh economic sanctions he and U.S. allies have imposed on Moscow.

He noted that revoking the favored trade status 'is going to make it harder for Russia to do business with the United States, and doing it in unison with other nations that make up half of the global economy will be another crushing blow to the Russian economy that's already suffering very badly from our sanctions,' he said.

He also reiterated that American troops will not fight in the Ukraine.

'We will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine,' adding that a 'direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War III– something we must strive to prevent.'

Meanwhile civilian volunteers trained in Odessa on Friday, learning to use rifles and other defence techniques as the city's mayor warned that Russian forces could soon surround the southern Ukrainian port city on three fronts.

In a different part of the city, a group of women crafted camouflage nets by cutting up old pieces of cloth.

It came a day after Russia's deputy energy minister, Yevgeny Grabchak, said power had been restored to the decommissioned plant, after Ukraine said earlier this week that Putin's forces had cut the electricity.

However, the intelligence update disputed this, and repeated an earlier warning that if the electricity is cut, the plant's emergency diesel generators that provide back-up power to safety systems can only last 48-hours.

Earlier this week, Ukraine pleaded with Russia to observe a ceasefire so engineers could go into Chernobyl and restore the power. This was refused, Ukraine said.

'The occupiers refused to grant access to the station to Ukrainian repairmen,' the update continued.

'Instead, 'Belarusian specialists' went there on the instructions of Alexander Lukashenko. Among them, under the guise of nuclear power plants, Russian saboteurs also come to organize a terrorist attack.'

On Wednesday, IAEA also said it had lost contact with the captured Zaporizhzhia power plant, just hours after warning of a potential unfolding disaster at Chernobyl.

The agency said warning systems at Zaporizhzhia - Europe's largest nuclear power plant - had stopped broadcasting updates in the days since Russian forces shelled the site, resulting in international condemnation.

IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said Wednesday he was 'concerned about the sudden interruption' of the data flows to the watchdog's Vienna headquarters.

He added that the reason for the disruption in updates from the power plants was not clear but the IAEA was still receiving data from other nuclear facilities in Ukraine, including three other operational nuclear power plants.

Also on Wednesday, Ukraine warned Chernobyl could be 48 hours away from leaking radiation, and the country's nuclear company Energoatom warned that radioactive substances could be released if an electricity outage at the site continues any longer, as it makes it impossible to cool spent nuclear fuel.

Energoatom has said that work to repair the connection and restore power to the plant - the site of the world's biggest nuclear disaster in 1986 - has not been possible because fighting is under way in the region.

The company said there were about 20,000 spent fuel assemblies at Chernobyl that could not be kept cool amid a power outage.

Their warming could lead to 'the release of radioactive substances into the environment. The radioactive cloud could be carried by wind to other regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and Europe,' it said in a statement.

Without power, ventilation systems at the plant would also not be working, exposing staff to dangerous doses of radiation, it added.

Russia took control of the defunct atomic plant on the first day of the invasion and has since captured a second nuclear site - Zaporizhzhia - the biggest in Europe.

Energy operator Ukrenergo also said their power has been entirely cut to the plant and its security systems.

The plant 'was fully disconnected from the power grid,' Ukrenergo said in a statement on its Facebook page, adding that military operations meant 'there is no possibility to restore the lines'.

The recent developments have now added increasing concern about safety and security around the region.

Last week staff at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were captured on video pleading with Russian soldiers directing fire on the building before they overtook it.

The nuclear power plant, which creates around 20 percent of Ukraine's electricity, was captured after a fierce gun battle between Russian President Vladimir Putin's men and Ukrainian defenders that sparked a fire in a six-story training building.

Eventually, emergency crews were allowed to go in and douse the flames at the Zaporizhzhia plant before Russian troops moved in and occupied the site.

The United Nation's nuclear monitoring agency said that, fortunately, none of the site's six reactors had been directly damaged and radiation levels remained normal.

The IAEA said later on Wednesday it saw 'no critical impact on safety' from the power cut at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine.

The Vienna-based U.N. nuclear watchdog said Wednesday that Ukraine had informed it of the loss of electricity and that the development violates a 'key safety pillar on ensuring uninterrupted power supply.'

But it tweeted that 'in this case IAEA sees no critical impact on safety.'

The IAEA said that there could be 'effective heat removal without need for electrical supply' from spent nuclear fuel at the site.

Speaking to MailOnline Claire Corkhill - Professor of Nuclear Material Degradation at Sheffield University - said that while power being cut at Chernobyl was concerning, the spent nuclear fuel would not lead to a nuclear 'meltdown'.

'With the electricity supply to the Chernobyl site unavailable, there are several areas of concern with regards to the safety of the nuclear material stored there,' she said.

The first issue, she explained, is that spent fuel from reactors one and three is kept cool in metal casings in a pond (that looks like a large swimming pool).

'This material produces heat through radioactive decay and requires constant cooling, which is achieved by pumping fresh cool water into the ponds,' she said.

'With no power supply, this water could slowly evaporate, potentially resulting in contamination of the building by low levels of radioactive isotopes.'

The second issue, she said, concerns the monitoring of radioactivity levels in reactor four - the reactor that exploded in 1996.

'It is essential that radiation monitoring systems are able to constantly monitor the situation inside reactor 4 so that we can be aware of any potential reasons for concern about the exposed nuclear fuel that resides there,' Prof. Corkhill said.

'Another serious concern is the maintenance of the ventilation system in the New Safe Confinement structure,' she continued. The Chernobyl New Safe Confinement is the huge cover - or sarcophagus - that was placed over reactor four in 2016.

'This prevents further degradation of Reactor number 4 and the hazardous exposed nuclear fuel within, and is essential to the future decommissioning of the site.

'If there is no power to this structure, we could see the complete failure of the 1.5Bn euro decommissioning programme to make the site safe once and for all.'

While Prof. Corkhill said there the loss of power would unlikely lead to a wide scale released of radioactivity, she said it was more likely there would be 'severe contamination within one of the spent fuel storage facilities.'

Prof Corkhill's research focuses on understanding the long-term evolution of radioactive waste material in disposal environments and she provides independent advice to the UK government's radioactive waste management and disposal policies.

She is leading a British team that is making a key contribution to the huge clear-up operation at the stricken Fukushima nuclear power station in Japan after developing material that simulates the most dangerous radioactive debris remaining in the reactors.

On February 24, Russia invaded Ukraine and seized the defunct plant, site of a 1986 disaster that killed hundreds and spread radioactive contamination west across Europe.

The Chernobyl site has been under the control of Russian troops since last week.

The cause of the damage to the power line serving it was not immediately clear.

On Tuesday the UN atomic watchdog IAEA said that the site was no longer transmitting data and voiced concern for staff working under Russian guard.

The situation for the staff 'was worsening', the IAEA said, citing the Ukrainian nuclear regulator.

The defunct plant sits inside an exclusion zone that houses decommissioned reactors as well as radioactive waste facilities.

In 2016, the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement was put in place to cover the reactor. It was designed to prevent further release of radioactive contaminants for 100 years.

More than 2,000 staff still work at the plant as it requires constant management to prevent another nuclear disaster.

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi on Tuesday called on 'on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there.'

He also repeated his offer to travel to Chernobyl or elsewhere to secure 'the commitment to the safety and security' of Ukraine's power plants from all parties.

'The Director General indicated that remote data transmission from safeguards monitoring systems installed at the Chernobyl NPP had been lost,' the IAEA said in a statement yesterday.

Safeguards keep track of nuclear material and waste products generated by nuclear power plants.

The IAEA urged Russian authorities to allow the 210 staff members who are being held captive at Chernobyl to leave, arguing that although radiation levels in the area are relatively low, it is necessary to ensure a 'safe rotation' of staff.

It comes after the Vienna-based UN body said Ukrainian authorities reported an attack on a nuclear facility in Kharkiv on Sunday - though no increase in radiation levels had been reported at the site.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10602703/Putin-planning-man-catastrophe-Chernobyl-Ukrainian-intelligence-claims.html

Ukraine claims Vladimir Putin is planning a 'terrorist attack' on Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

The Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine believes the Russian despot is planning a 'technological catastrophe' at the power station.

Intel chiefs warned that the disaster will be blamed on the Ukrainians and said Putin is prepared to commit 'nuclear blackmail' on the world if his invasion fails.

The Intelligence Directorate wrote on Facebook: ""According to the available information - Vladimir Putin ordered the preparation of a terrorist attack at the Chernobyl nuclear station.

""The creation of a technological catastrophe is planned at the controlled Russian forces of the CAEC (Chernobyl), the responsibility for which the occupiers will try to translate to Ukraine.

""At the moment, the CAEC is completely disconnected from the monitoring systems of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAGATE). The station has been disrupted. The resource of existing diesel generators is calculated for 48 hours of security systems to support.

""Occupiers refused to give access to the station Ukrainian repairman. Instead, there, according to the instruction of Alexander Lukashenko, ""Belarusian specialists"" came in. Among them, under the guise of atomic (experts) also enter Russian dissidents to organise a terrorist attack.""

Ukraine's intel chiefs added: ""Without getting the desired result from the ground military operation and direct negotiations, Putin is ready to commit to the nuclear blackmail of the world community for the sake of actions to support Ukraine.""

It comes after the Ukrainian nuclear regulator said Russia had committed an ""act of nuclear terrorism"" in bombing a research facility containing a reactor.

The State Nuclear Inspectorate of Ukraine said the reactor core at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology in the city of Kharkiv had been loaded with fresh nuclear fuel just prior to the start of Russian aggression.

Russian forces carried out an airstrike on the science research centre in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, sparking fears of radiation exposure, according to reports.

In a statement, the nuclear watchdog said they were still assessing the damage to the site, adding: ""This list of injuries is not complete at this time.""

They said: ""Prior to the Russian aggression, the Source of Neutrons was at the stage of physical start-up, during which the core was loaded with fresh nuclear fuel.

""On February 24, 2022, the unit was transferred to a deep subcritical state by the operational personnel of the Source of Neutrons.""

In a report on the state of the reactor, which is used in scientific research at the institute, the Inspecorate said critical buildings at the site had sustained damage during the attack but the reactor was currently in a ""deep subcritical state"" and ""completely de-energized"".

Chernobyl plant still without external power supply, Ukrainian inspectorate says

Ukraine’s State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate says the electricity supply to the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant has not yet been restored, despite Russia’s energy ministry claiming on Thursday that Belarusian specialists had fixed the issue.

Russia could surround Odesa on three sides, mayor warns

Such a move could cut Odesa, which sits on the Black Sea, off from the rest of Ukraine.

Putin has said Russia should allow volunteer fighters from Syria and other countries to join Moscow-backed separatists fighting Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine.

But Energoatom warned staff at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which was captured by Russian troops last week, are now facing psychological pressure from Moscow’s forces which negatively affects their work and “endangers nuclear and radiation safety”.

“Employees of the station are under strong psychological pressure from the occupiers, all staff on arrival at the station are carefully checked by armed terrorists,” the company said.

Dnipro attack ‘to have ripple effect’

Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid said the aerial attack on Dnipro took place at about 6:15am local time (04:15 GMT), targeting an industrial complex in Ukraine’s third-largest city.

“We do know that a heavy machinery factory was hit, along with what was described as a coal-enhancing factory and a third location next to the kindergarten,” Abdel-Hamid added.

“This is the first time this city is targeted since the beginning of the war. Many people were expecting this to happen, saying it was not a matter of if but when,” she said, noting that the attack was “certainly going to have a ripple effect on the people living here”.

Where are the Russian forces near Kyiv now?

A huge Russian military convoy that had been stationed outside Kyiv since last week appears to have dispersed, according to a United States-based satellite-imaging company, as the city braces for a possible ground assault.

Maxar Technologies said satellite images taken on Thursday showed that the 64km (40 miles) long line of vehicles, tanks and artillery has broken up and been redeployed.

The assessment came as a senior US defence official said on Thursday that Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from the northwest had edged 5km (3 miles) closer to the city in the previous 24 hours, placing them just 15km (9 miles) from its centre.

Meanwhile, a separate tranche of soldiers advancing on the capital from the northeast was about 40km (25 miles) from the city, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added at a Pentagon news briefing.

The official said the “multiple lines of advance towards Kyiv” indicate Moscow aims to encircle the city.

Welcome to Al Jazeera’s continuing coverage of the Ukraine-Russia crisis.

Read all the updates from Thursday, March 10, here.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/10/ukraine-tells-iaea-it-lost-contact-chernobyl-plant-liveblog
7,4e20bffd-733f-411a-a936-22636bc05c15,[],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Lukashenko,

Thank you for coming. We meet regularly, exchange information by telephone, and adjust our actions.

First of all, before we get down to our agenda, I would like to congratulate you on the successful referendum on amending your country’s constitution. I know that the turnout was high, and popular support across Belarus very solid.

President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko Lukashenko AlexanderPresident of Belarus : More than at the presidential elections, by the way, by 1.5 percent.

Vladimir Putin: Good. I believe the political process that you initiated, the dialogue that you have with your people is extremely important for the situation to remain sustainable and stable. This kind of situation, I mean stability and sustainability, is essential for economic development.

In this regard, I would like to note that last year, our mutual trade increased by more than a third, more than 34 percent, and now that the annual results are being summed up, this is becoming quite obvious.

The overall developments are positive. Of course, there are also problems caused by the current events, the restrictions and sanctions we all know of, and so on. But, as you and I have previously said, we have seen this before – attempts to limit our development, to contain it. Now they are being made on a larger scale; this much is obvious, of course. I am sure that we will get through the difficult period and, in fact, will gain more competencies, find more ways to feel independent and self-sufficient, and will ultimately benefit, as it happened in the previous years.

I will certainly update you on Ukrainian developments and, above all, the progress of the negotiations, which are now being held almost on a daily basis. There are certain positive shifts there, as our negotiators have reported to me. I will tell you about all this in greater detail.

Alexander Lukashenko: Mr Putin, indeed, you and I communicate closely at all times. We had a premonition of hard times. I have told you over the phone more than once: the Russian Federation, and even more so Belarus, is always under sanctions, which have become more extensive today. However, we are already used to this, pardon my language, beastly Western behaviour. Why beastly? Because it is illegitimate, as they are fond of saying, and runs counter to international agreements and treaties, which they and we have joined, in part. So, once again, the third time round: this is just disgraceful from my point of view. I have already been through this, and you have had enough of it as well.

Here is my point. As I walked up to your office, the journalists hollered from a distance: “Will we survive the sanctions or not?” Listen, this is not the right approach to this matter. Today, sanctions represent an opportunity for us. I am a Soviet person, and you hail from the Soviet period as well, and you are well aware that we were always under sanctions, but we lived and moved forward notwithstanding. It is just that due to the current circumstances, which are not even related to sanctions, not enough time has passed, and our people are concerned. It is a good thing that people tend to realise over time what is really going on. It was not us who attacked them, not us, the armed forces of Ukraine started shooting when you and I were at your place two days before that.

Vladimir Putin: Unfortunately.

Alexander Lukashenko: Yes, you and I were in a helicopter, as [we] received updates. They were the ones to start this whole thing. I will now show you the location, which they planned to use as a base to attack Belarus. If there had not been a preventive strike on the positions – four positions – six hours before the operation – I will show you the map that I brought with me – they would have attacked the troops of Belarus and Russia, which were conducting exercises. So, we did not unleash this war, our conscience is clear.

It is good that they started it. Biological weapons, the largest nuclear power plants – they were ready to blow that all up. We are witnessing what is going on in Chernobyl, you asked me to supply electricity …

Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Alexander Lukashenko: …but they do not need it, do you see? They just do not need it. They do not care about what is happening there, and we used force to supply electricity to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, as promised.

Vladimir Putin: I am aware of that, thank you.

Alexander Lukashenko: These are their goals. But people are gradually beginning to understand what is what and who is right. Trust me, had we not done this 24 hours in advance, we would have drained this cup to the dregs with enormous losses several days later.

I will say it again: they were going to strike not only at Donbass but had also prepared their positions for a strike against Belarus. And today – as I said yesterday – these foreign mercenaries are walking along the Belarus border to the Chernobyl plant. There are three points here. They want to cut off the routes of moving Russian troops and stab them in the back, as I said. This is the first point. Secondly, they want to attack the positions of the troops that remained in Belarus after their joint exercises with Russia. And they still hope to draw us directly into this slaughter to make us leave the western section unprotected. They are not that simple. We still have to figure out what they want to do in Chernobyl.

So, we have no need to justify ourselves before anyone.

Vladimir Putin: No one is justifying themselves.

Alexander Lukashenko: You – yes. I see that some of our or your people tend to say that they did something wrong. They would have drained more from this cup than in the middle of the last century when the fascists were moving towards us.

So, this is a time of opportunity. If we find our bearings, believe me, in six months or by the end of the year people will forget this happened, in terms of the economy. And we should not say “we will survive the sanctions” or “we will not survive the sanctions.” Look, we have survived them so many times. We must develop our economy. We can do without them. We have everything we need for normal life and work.

I have a suggestion. We have always helped our allies. We helped the Kazakhs, and others as well. You opened your market to some, I will not mention their names because they will take offense. Well, we have to meet somehow in the CSTO and the EAEU. We must unite. Everyone says we must be together. Let us get together. And, believe me, if we add these markets to our cooperation we will forget about the sanctions in a month. So, the CSTO and the EAEU. I am making a proposal. After all, I do have the right to make a proposal…

Vladimir Putin: Of course.

Alexander Lukashenko: I think you will support me. We need to gather around the table in Moscow, sit at the negotiating table and come to terms: we sell this to you and you sell this to us, and build our common economic policy on this foundation.

This is why I came to Moscow today in a normal mood. I am confident we can do it better than we did after collapse of the USSR, and even in the USSR. This is not a situation where we should bother and get worried about some event. We simply need the time – a lot can be seen from a distance.

Vladimir Putin: You are absolutely right. The Soviet Union indeed always lived in conditions of sanctions but developed and achieved enormous success. I said yesterday: even after 1990, the sanctions imposed on the USSR were retained and then extended to the new, recent times. These are CoCom lists, restrictions on high technology. This is how it was done.

Now a massive blow is being dealt at the economy. But practice over the past few years shows that wherever the West imposed restrictions on us, we acquired new competences and restored our old skills at new technological levels. And all this is working. We have of course become stronger in this respect, you are right. This is indeed a time of opportunity when we must strengthen our technological and economic sovereignty.

This is why we are meeting today, we will talk about everything in more detail.

Thank you.

A broader war in Ukraine could displace 15 million people, Switzerland's justice minister said on Friday, citing estimates from the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. ""If you assume the hostilities continue, that the Russian army advances more strongly in the West (of Ukraine), that perhaps there are escape corridors, then it could be that practically 1 million people leave the country each week,"" Karin Keller-Sutter told a news conference in Bern on the Swiss approach to taking in refugees.

""There are now estimates from UNHCR that you have to reckon with around 15 million displaced persons -- that is the highest number...It is said around half the population minus men who are of course in the armed forces and defending the country.""

A UNHCR spokesperson said the agency had not for now revised its initial projection for 4 million refugees leaving the country but it was closely following the situation. United Nations agencies have said more than 2.5 million refugees have fled the fighting in Ukraine since Russian forces invaded on February 24. Moscow denies it has been targeting civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine.",https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/russia-ukraine-war-news-live-updates-putin-zelenskyy-bioweapons-kyiv-mariupol-kharkiv-odesa-moscow-nato-us-eu-12795402.htm
