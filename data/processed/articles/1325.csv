The Government will also align itself with the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia and will ensure that its sovereign wealth fund divests its Russian assets.

‘Russia’s military attacks in Ukraine are causing widespread loss of life and suffering in the civilian population, destroying vital infrastructure and forcing people to flee their homes. In the light of this, we are increasing our humanitarian support in connection with the crisis in Ukraine to NOK 2 billion,’ said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

Today, Norway and other members of the UN Security Council requested an emergency meeting of the Council to discuss the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.

Norway has already provided NOK 250 million in humanitarian support in response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine, primarily to the UN Refugee Agency, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund. This has now been increased to a total of NOK 2 billion.

‘Today I have met with several of the key humanitarian actors working in Ukraine. We share deep concerns over the grave impacts of the hostilities on the civilian population. A large number of people in Ukraine will be in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, and this will have major consequences for neighbouring countries experiencing an influx of refugees,’ said Minister of Foreign Affairs Anniken Huitfeldt.

The extraordinary allocation to Ukraine is intended to enhance the efforts of humanitarian actors to help the most vulnerable groups, including children. The funds will be used for humanitarian activities by the UN, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Norwegian humanitarian organisations in Ukraine and in the neighbouring countries that are receiving refugees. The support is being provided as flexible funding to ensure that the actors involved can target the areas where the needs are greatest.

Military equipment

The Government has decided to send military equipment such as helmets and bulletproof vests to Ukraine.

‘The Ukrainian people are fighting for survival against a superior military force. Under these special circumstances we are authorising the provision of military equipment to a country at war. The Government will be donating military equipment such as helmets and bulletproof vests to Ukraine. Russia’s attack on Ukraine is threatening European security in a way we have not experienced since the Second World War. It poses a threat to the norms, values and principles on which our democratic societies are founded,’ said Mr Gahr Støre.

‘This is equipment that Ukraine has requested and that we can donate quickly,’ said Minister of Defence Odd Roger Enoksen.

All the parliamentary leaders in the Storting have been consulted on the decision, and a meeting of the Enlarged Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence will be held later on Sunday evening.

Norway’s sovereign wealth fund to divest from Russia

The Minister of Finance will ask the Government Pension Fund Global, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, to freeze all its investments in Russia immediately. In addition, he will ask the fund to divest from Russia.

‘Given the way the situation has evolved, we consider it necessary for the fund to divest its Russian assets,’ said Minister of Finance Trygve Slagsvold Vedum.

Wide-ranging sanctions

Ever since the Russian occupation of the Crimea and the destabilisation of Eastern Ukraine, Norway has stood together with the EU, the US and other like-minded countries in responding to Russia’s violations of international law.

Together with the EU, Norway is now introducing historically harsh sanctions against Russia. The sanctions have been introduced stepwise, and further sanctions will be introduced today. These will also target Belarus.

The sanctions will isolate Russia financially by targeting its central bank, and will exclude a number of Russian banks from the Swift payment system.

In addition, the package of sanctions will have far-reaching consequences for individuals who are considered to have facilitated the military aggression against Ukraine.

Norwegian airspace will be closed to Russian aircraft.

‘The EU is imposing tougher economic sanctions in a number of areas. Sanctions are most effective if many countries introduce the same restrictions. We are therefore in close contact with the EU and our neighbouring countries, and preparations for implementing the wide-ranging package of sanctions are in full swing,’ said Prime Minister Støre.",https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/norway-to-increase-support-to-ukraine-and-provide-military-equipment/id2902406/

OSLO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The Norwegian government will send weapons to Ukraine, it said in a statement on Monday, the latest European nation to do so following Russia's invasion.

The decision overturns a Norwegian policy in place since the 1950s of not sending arms to non-NATO countries that are at war or at risk of armed conflict.

Norway will donate up to 2,000 M72 anti-tank weapons, the government said in a statement.

While Ukrainian forces are putting up real resistance in the face of the Russian advance, the Western countries have stepped up arms deliveries to Ukraine after its invasion.

However, Ukraine says it needs more in order to resist Russia's bigger and better-equipped army.

Here are the countries which have given or have promised to provide military equipment to the war-torn nation in a major shift of policy.

GERMANY

Among those sending military aid is Germany, which has, in a major policy shift, decided to send weapons like anti-tank missiles and air defence guns to Ukraine along with other nations to boost Ukraine's capabilities to take on a superior Russia.

Russia-Ukraine war LIVE updates

Germany has also decided to send 14 armoured vehicles to the war-torn country.

After facing criticism for refusing to send weapons to Kyiv, unlike other Western allies, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Berlin will supply Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles from Bundeswehr stocks.

Berlin also approved the delivery of 400 RPGs from the Netherlands and a request by Estonia to pass on old GDR howitzers to Ukraine. Finland had bought the howitzers in the 90s after the fall of the Berlin wall, and later re-sold them to Estonia.

Germany has a long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones, rooted partly in its bloody 20th-century history and resulting pacifism. Countries aiming to pass on German weapons exports need to apply for approval in Berlin first.

Germany has also decided to send 14 armoured vehicles to the war-torn country.

UNITED STATES

President Joe Biden instructed the US State Department to release up to an additional $350 million worth of weapons from US stocks to Ukraine.

In a memorandum to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden directed that $350 million allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act be designated for Ukraine's defense.

Ukraine has been asking for Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to shoot down aircraft.

The Javelin is one of the advanced portable anti-tank missiles in the world with a new tested range of five kilometers that is potent against tanks and armored personnel carriers that transport ground troops close to the areas of assault.

The Stinger missile is a lightweight, shoulder launched air defense system that can be rapidly deployed by ground troops. It has been used in major conflicts and is used extensively by US forces and at least 19 other countries.

Its supersonic speed, agility and a highly accurate guidance and control system give the weapon an operational edge against cruise missiles and all classes of aircraft.

UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPEAN UNION

The United Kingdom has already sent anti-tank weapons to the Ukrainian military to help counter Russian forces. Last month, the bulk of Britain’s C-17 transport aircraft fleet was involved in carrying thousands of NLAW anti-armour systems from Britain to Ukraine.

READ: Nuclear alert sounded after UK foreign secretary's remarks, claims Russia

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that the country will send additional lethal ‘defensive weapons’ to the war-hit country in the coming days, TASS news agency reported.

In mid-January, the UK government sent about 2,000 anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. Also, 30 military instructors arrived in the republic to train the Ukrainian military personnel to operate the missile systems that had been delivered.

Even European Union countries have agreed to provide fighter jets to Ukraine, it said in a tweet.

FINLAND

Another country to send weapons and ammunition to Ukraine in a shift of policy is Finland, Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Monday.

The shipment will include 2,500 assault rifles, 150,000 bullets, 1,500 anti-tank weapons and 70,000 food packages, Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen added.

The decision means a shift in policy for Finland, which has maintained an image of a non-aligned country since the Soviet Union in 1956 gave up a naval base it had leased in southern Finland after World War II.

The Nordic state on Sunday also decided it would supply Ukraine with helmets, bulletproof vests and first aid equipment and gave Estonia permission to donate Ukraine field guns previously owned by Finland.

FRANCE, BELGIUM, GREECE

France has decided to send defensive military equipment to Ukraine to support the country against Russia's invasion, a French army spokesman said last week, adding that the issue of sending offensive arms was still under consideration.

Belgium has also pledged to send 2,000 machine guns and 3,800 tons of fuel.

Meanwhile, Greece will be sending defence supplies to Ukraine in response to a request from the Ukrainian government. Two C-130 military transport planes will carry the supplies to Poland in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people, it said. It will then be transported across the border to Ukraine.

NORWAY

The Norwegian government will also send weapons to Ukraine, it said in a statement on Monday, the latest European nation to do so following Russia's invasion.

The decision overturns a Norwegian policy in place since the 1950s of not sending arms to non-NATO countries that are at war or at risk of armed conflict.

Norway will donate up to 2,000 M72 anti-tank weapons, the government said in a statement. On Sunday, Norway announced it would pull its sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, out of Russia and promised to send helmets, bullet-proof vests and other equipment to Ukraine.

THE NETHERLANDS

The Netherlands will also supply air defence rockets and anti-tank systems to Ukraine, the Dutch government said in letters to parliament last week.

The Dutch agreed to a Ukrainian request to rapidly ship 200 Stinger air defence rockets and 50 ""Panzerfaust 3"" anti-tank weapons with 400 rockets, the letters said.

Foreign volunteers rushing to join Ukraine in fighting Russian forces

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday urged foreigners to head to Ukrainian embassies worldwide to sign up for an “international brigade” of volunteers to help fight invading Russian forces.

“All foreigners wishing to join the resistance against the Russian occupiers and protect global security are invited by the Ukrainian leadership to come to our state and join the ranks of the territorial defense forces,” Zelensky said in a statement on the presidential website.

Latvia's parliament voted unanimously on Monday to allow its nationals to fight in Ukraine if willing, the parliament said in a statement.

""Our citizens who want to support Ukraine and volunteer to serve there to defend Ukraine's independence and our common security must be able to do so,"" said Juris Rancanis, chairman of the parliamentary defence, home affairs and corruption prevention commission, which drafted the law.

Canadians and Americans said that the Ukrainian resistance was inspiring them, despite both their countries refusing to send troops there out of concern of provoking a war. Many fear their democratic rights in the home and Europe will be under threat if they fail to act.

Denmark will also let its nationals join international brigades forming to fight in Ukraine against Russian forces, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Sunday.

“It's a choice that anyone can make. This goes for all Ukrainians who live here, but also for others who think they can contribute directly to the conflict,” she said in a press conference Sunday.

As the war between Ukraine and Russia continues to escalate after Moscow sent its troops into its neighbouring country, several countries across the globe are sending military aid to Kyiv.

According to Ukraine’s health ministry, the conflict has killed more than 350 civilians since the beginning of Russia’s invasion.

The UN’s refugee agency also believes at least 368,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries, mostly to Poland.

So, which countries are sending military assistance to Ukraine?

United States

On February 25, President Joe Biden instructed the State Department to release up to an additional $350m worth of weapons from US stocks to Ukraine.

In a memorandum to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden directed that $350m allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act be designated for Ukraine’s defence.

Ukraine has been asking for Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to shoot down aircraft.

The Pentagon said the weapons included anti-armour, small arms, body armour and various munitions in support of Ukraine’s front-line defenders. A State Department spokesperson said anti-aircraft systems were also included in the material.

Over the past year, the United States has committed more than $1bn in security assistance to Ukraine, Blinken said.

European Union

For the first time in its history, the EU is financing the purchase and delivery of arms after leaders agree to transport weapons worth 450 million euros ($502m) to Kyiv.

Foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says some nations are sending the Ukrainians fighter jets.

United Kingdom

In January, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK had “taken the decision to supply Ukraine with light anti-armour defensive weapon systems”.

On Wednesday, Downing Street promised military support to Ukraine, including lethal defensive weapons.

“In light of the increasingly threatening behaviour from Russia and in line with our previous support, the UK will shortly be providing a further package of military support to Ukraine,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament. “This will include lethal aid in the form of defensive weapons and non-lethal aid.”

France

France, which has already sent help, is dispatching more military equipment as well as fuel.

Paris said it has acted on earlier Ukrainian requests for defensive anti-aircraft and digital weapons.

The Netherlands

The Netherlands will supply air defence rockets and anti-tank systems to Ukraine, the Dutch government said in letters to parliament on Saturday.

The Dutch government agreed to a Ukrainian request to rapidly ship 200 Stinger air defence rockets and 50 “Panzerfaust 3” anti-tank weapons with 400 rockets, the letters said.

It is also jointly considering sending a Patriot air defence system alongside Germany to a NATO battle group in Slovakia, it said.

Germany

Germany will supply Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles from Bundeswehr stocks for defence against Russia.

It is a major shift from Berlin’s longstanding policy of banning weapon exports to a conflict zone.

“The Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a turning point. It is our duty to do our best to support Ukraine in defending itself against Putin’s invading army,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Saturday.

Canada

Ottawa is sending lethal military weaponry to Ukraine and loaning Kyiv half a billion Canadian dollars ($394m) to help it defend itself.





Sweden, Norway and Denmark

Stockholm is also breaking its historic neutral stance to send 5,000 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, with Denmark contributing a further 2,700. Norway is sending helmets and body armour and up to 2,000 M72 anti-tank weapons.

Finland

Neutral Finland takes the “historic” decision to supply weapons to Ukraine and will send 1,500 rocket launchers, 2,500 assault rifles, 150,000 rounds of ammunition, and 70,000 servings of field rations.

The pledge by Rome took the number of nations in line to deliver military hardware and funding to Kyiv to over a dozen, including the United States and Canada.

The Italian cabinet signed off on a measure authorizing the dispatch of Stinger surface-to-air missiles, mortars and Milan, or Panzerfaust, anti-tank weapons. Italian media had claimed Israeli-made Spike missiles would be included in the package but a defense source said that was doubtful since Israel would need to approve their use and would be unlikely to do so.

Among other weaponry on the Italian list, which will need to approved by parliament this week, were Browning heavy machine guns, MG-type light machine guns and counter-IED systems.

The consignment could be flown to Romania or Poland and delivered over the border to Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Germany has broken its long standing rule on not supplying weapons to countries at war with a promise to send 1,000 anti-tank weapons, 500 Stinger missiles, nine howitzers and 14 armored vehicles to Ukraine.

Sweden has pledged to send 5,000 anti-tank weapons, while Finland is is dispatching 1,500 rocket launchers and 2,500 assault rifles.

Norway is also reversing a policy of not supplying combatant countries by delivering up to 2,000 2,000 M72 anti-tank weapons. “Norway has strict policies regarding exports of military equipment, but Ukraine now faces extraordinary circumstances,” said prime minister Jonas Gahr Stoere.

The Netherlands will also send 200 Stinger missiles following a specific request to the European Union for the surface-to-air weapon.

The EU has in turn established a fund of 450 million euros ($504m) to reimburse member states for weapons they send to Ukraine.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called the move “a turning point in the history of European integration,” on Monday.

Describing Italy’s decision to send arms, Italian defense minister Lorenzo Guerini said, “This is an important response that gives a sign of the concrete solidarity for Ukraine. Whoever wanted to divide us has been disappointed. NATO is stronger, Europe is more united.”
