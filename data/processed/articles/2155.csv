Bank sanctions are a sharper sword than cutting Russia off SWIFT, German minister says

The package of banking sanctions that the European Union is imposing will hit Putin’s government harder than excluding Russia from the SWIFT payments system, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has said.

Excluding Russia from SWIFT would make it impossible to support civil rights groups in Russia from abroad, or for Russian students abroad to send money to help their grandmothers, she told ARD public television.

“The sword that looks hardest isn’t always the cleverest one,” she said. “It’s not just oligarchs who do financial transactions … The sharper sword at the moment is listing banks. Government bonds can’t be sold abroad any more.”

US defence official says Russian forces have lost momentum amid stiff resistance

Russia’s drive to seize control of Ukraine has lost momentum amid stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces, both on the ground and in the air, a senior US defence official says.

“Their momentum, particularly as it comes to Kyiv, has slowed over the last 24 hours,” the official told reporters at a Pentagon briefing on condition of anonymity.

Russian forces have yet to seize any of Ukraine’s major cities, or achieve air superiority over the country, the official said.

“They have not achieved the progress that we believe they anticipated they would … [and] are meeting more resistance than they expected” the official added. “A good indicator of that is no population centers have been taken. None.”

Russia puts ‘partial restriction’ on Facebook access

Russian authorities have announced access to Facebook will be partially restricted after the social media network banned the accounts of several Kremlin-backed news outlets over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

Russian state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it had demanded that Facebook lift the bans it had on Thursday placed on state news agency RIA Novosti, state TV channel Zvezda, and pro-Kremlin news sites Lenta.Ru and Gazeta.Ru. The agency said Facebook didn’t reinstate the media outlets.

Roskomnadzor cast its action as a move “to protect Russian media.” It said Russia’s Foreign Ministry and the Prosecutor General’s office found Facebook “complicit in violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as the rights and freedoms of Russian nationals”.

It did not clarify what exactly the move means.

Russia claims Kyiv has gone silent on talks

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said there is a “pause” in contact between Moscow and Kyiv over possible in-person talks between the two sides following a discussion over where any such meeting should take place.

Peskov said Moscow had offered to hold the talks in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, but Kyiv had instead proposed Warsaw as a venue.

He said the Ukrainians had then taken what he described as quite a long time-out. During that pause, he claimed Ukrainian “nationalists” had deployed missile systems in residential areas within the country’s big cities, mirroring claims made by Putin.

Peskov did not provide evidence to support his assertion but said it was a very dangerous development. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities.

Ukrainians build makeshift roadblocks to stall Russian advance

Some Ukrainians are building makeshift roadblocks in a bid to stall Russian troops.

Vladimir, a former coalmine owner who fled Ukraine’s eastern region of Luhansk for Kyiv in 2014, when Russian-backed separatists took control of swaths of territory there, is among them.

The 47-year-old’s fortification, which features several concrete slabs and about a dozen sandbags, stands in the town of Rzhyshchiv, on the outskirts of Kyiv.

It is manned by six men, including Vladimir, who declined to give his surname. Two of those guarding the site are armed with hunting rifles.

“We won’t stop tanks with it, but we can stop other vehicles,” he told Al Jazeera, adding he had paid for the supplies from his own pocket.

Dozens of similar roadblocks have reportedly sprung up around the capital and elsewhere in Ukraine.

‘The problem for the Kremlin is Zelenskyy’

Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith, reporting from Moscow, says Russia’s suggestions it is ready for talks with Ukraine in Minsk were made after Moscow called for Kyiv to “lay down its arms” and warned it could never recognise Zelenskyy’s government as democratic.

“It is worth reminding people that the current Ukrainian president was elected in 2019 with a landslide 73 percent share of the vote, so he was democratically elected,” Smith said.

“But clearly, the problem for the Kremlin is Zelenskyy, and whether they will be able to have talks while he remains in power is unclear,” he added.

Zelenskyy had appealed for talks with Putin prior to the Kremlin’s suggestions of a summit in the Belarusian capital, which has hosted previous rounds of discussions between officials from Ukraine and Russia.

“I would like to address the President of the Russian Federation once again. There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let’s sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people’s deaths,” Zelenskyy said in a video message to the nation.

Ejecting it from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network could cripple Moscow’s ability to trade with most of the world and deal a heavy blow to the Russian economy.

Kyiv’s residents take shelter in metro stations

Thousands of people have taken shelter in metro stations throughout the Ukrainian capital amid Russia’s assault.

“They always do the ugliest things at dawn, so I am spending the night here,” Tetyana Udovichenko, 61, told Al Jazeera overnight from inside the Druzhby Narodiv station.

Udovichenko, an accountant, said she had taken his 82-year-old mother Olha Krisevich underground with him. The pair were joined by dozens of other people, who arrived shortly after 7pm local time (17:00 GMT) on Thursday carrying blankets, suitcases and even, in some instances, pets.

Many looked distressed, but some opted for dark humour instead and aimed scornful jokes at Putin for ordering an invasion of their country.

Hungary opens humanitarian corridor for third-country citizens fleeing Ukraine

Hungary will open a humanitarian corridor for citizens from third-party countries like Iran or India fleeing Ukraine, letting them in without visas and taking them to the nearest international airport, in Debrecen, the Hungarian foreign minister says.

Peter Szijjarto also said in a video posted on his Facebook page that crossing from Ukraine was continuous at five crossing points but cars were queuing for up to three-five kilometres on the Ukrainian side.

His remarks came after Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, said he had requested Hungary’s assistance to evacuate Iranian citizens from Ukraine during a phone call with Szijjarto.

Iran’s foreign ministry had previously said it was seeking a permit to send a flight to Kyiv to repatriate its citizens, but it appears Russia’s offensive has eliminated that possibility.

The G-7 leading industrial nations are the U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, Germany and Japan. A meeting of the leaders of those countries, along with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel concluded before 10:30 a.m. ET.

Read the full statement below:

We the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) are appalled by and condemn the large-scale military aggression by the Russian Federation against the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, directed partly from Belarusian soil.

This unprovoked and completely unjustified attack on the democratic state of Ukraine was preceded by fabricated claims and unfounded allegations. It constitutes a serious violation of international law and a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and all commitments Russia entered in the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris and its commitments in the Budapest Memorandum. We as the G7 are bringing forward severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions. We call on all partners and members of the international community to condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms, to stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, and raise their voice against this blatant violation of the fundamental principles of international peace and security.

This crisis is a serious threat to the rules-based international order, with ramifications well beyond Europe. There is no justification for changing internationally recognised borders by force. This has fundamentally changed the Euro-Atlantic security situation. President Putin has re-introduced war to the European continent. He has put himself on the wrong side of history.

We are committed to uphold peace, stability and international law. We are united in our support for the people of Ukraine and its democratically elected government. In this dark hour our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine. We stand ready to support with humanitarian assistance in order to mitigate the suffering, including for refugees and displaced persons from the Russian aggression.

We call on the Russian Federation to stop the bloodshed, to immediately de-escalate and to withdraw its forces from Ukraine. We also call on Russia to ensure the safety of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. We also condemn the involvement of Belarus in this aggression against Ukraine and call on Belarus to abide by its international obligations.

We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russian President Putin's decision on February 21 to recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk self-declared entities in eastern Ukraine as ""independent"" states as well as his decision to send Russian military forces into these regions. We call on other states not to follow Russia's illegal decision to recognise the proclaimed independence of these entities. The decision by President Putin is a grave violation of the basic principles enshrined in the UN Charter, in particular the respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states and also a blatant breach of UN Security Council resolution 2202 – supported by the Russian Federation as a permanent member of the Security Council – as well as of the Minsk agreements, which stipulate the return of the areas concerned to the control of the Ukrainian Government.

We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders and territorial waters as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future and security arrangements. We reaffirm that illegally occupied Crimea and the self-declared ""people's republics"" are an integral part of Ukraine.

We condemn President Putin for his consistent refusal to engage in a diplomatic process to address questions pertaining to European security, despite our repeated offers. We stand united with partners, including NATO, the EU and their member states as well as Ukraine and remain determined to do what is necessary to preserve the integrity of the rules-based international order. In this regard, we are also closely monitoring global oil and gas market conditions, including in the context of Russia's further military aggression against Ukraine. We support consistent and constructive engagement and coordination among major energy producers and consumers toward our collective interest in the stability of global energy supplies, and stand ready to act as needed to address potential disruptions.",https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/24/ukraine-russia-news-vladimir-putin-orders-attack-as-explosions-are-reported.html

EU to sanction Russian banks, energy, others

European Union leaders have put on a united front after a six-hour meeting during which they agreed on the second package of economic and financial sanctions on Russia.

The EU Council president accused Russia of using ""fake pretexts and bad excuses"" for justifying its attack on Ukraine and said sanctions will hurt the government.

The legal texts for the sanctions agreed on are expected to be finalised overnight and be submitted for approval to EU foreign affairs ministers Friday.

EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the package includes targeting 70 percent of the Russian banking market and key state-owned companies.

She said Russia's energy sector also will be targeted ""by making it impossible for Russia to upgrade its refineries.""

And there will be a ban on sales of software, semiconductors, and airliners to Russia.

Japan, Australia announce additional sanctions on Russia

Japan and Australia have announced new sanctions targeting Russia over its actions in Ukraine.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the new measures include freezing the assets of Russian groups, banks and individuals and suspending exports of semiconductors and other sensitive goods to military-linked organisations in Russia.

Kishida said: ""Japan must clearly show its position that we will never tolerate any attempt to change the status quo by force.""

Earlier in the week, Japan suspended new issuances and distribution of Russian government bonds in Japan, aimed to reduce funding for Russia's military. It also banned trade with the two Ukrainian separatist regions.

Meanwhile, Australia imposed more sanctions against Russia targeting several of its elite citizens and lawmakers.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison also accused China of throwing Russia a lifeline by easing trade restrictions at a time much of the world is trying to stop the Russian attacks on Ukraine.

Morrison was reacting to a report in The South China Morning Post that China had announced it was fully open to Russian wheat imports.

Morrison noted that Australia, the United States, Britain, the European Union and Japan are imposing sanctions on Russia, and said China's easing of trade restrictions ""is simply unacceptable.""

In his words: ""You don't go and throw a lifeline to Russia in the middle of a period when they're invading another country.""

Russia begins 'military operation' in Ukraine



Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a ""military operation"" in Ukraine and warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to ""consequences they have never seen.""

He said the attack that began on Thursday was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine – a claim the US had predicted he would falsely make to justify an ""invasion"".

In a televised address, Putin accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia's demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and offer Moscow security guarantees. He said Russia's goal was not to occupy Ukraine.

US President Joe Biden denounced the ""unprovoked and unjustified"" attack on Ukraine and said the world will ""hold Russia accountable.""

Kiev shuts airports, Russia closes huge swath of airspace over eastern Ukraine

The Ukrainian government is closing airports in eastern Ukraine from midnight through 7 am [local time] because of the confrontation with Russia.

Ukrainian aviation authorities also have declared some airspace in the east to be ""danger areas"" because of attempts by Russian aviation authorities to seize control of the airspace.

Ukraine acted after Russia issued a ban on civilian air traffic in the airspace over eastern Ukraine.

Russia closed some airspace in the Rostov flight information region to the east of its border with Ukraine ""in order to provide safety"" for civil aviation flights, according to a notice to airmen.

Meanwhile, a conflict zone monitor said airlines should stop flying over any part of Ukraine because of the risk of an unintended shootdown or a cyberattack targeting air traffic control amid tensions with Russia.

Safe Airspace, which was set up to provide safety and conflict zone information for airlines after Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014, said it had increased its risk level to ""do not fly"".

""Regardless of the actual movements of Russian forces into Ukraine, the level of tension and uncertainty in Ukraine is now extreme,"" Safe Airspace said on its website.

""This itself gives rise to significant risk to civil aviation.""

Blinken says still time for diplomacy

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he believes Russia will invade Ukraine within hours after separatists asked for Russian help to repel ""aggression"" and as explosions rocked the breakaway eastern city of Donetsk.

Blinken told NBC News he expected Russian forces would attack Ukraine overnight although he still held out hope for diplomacy to pull Europe back from the brink of war.

""Everything seems to be in place for Russia to engage in a major aggression against Ukraine,"" Blinken said in an interview, adding he could not be precise about time or place.

UNSC members look to act on Ukraine but doomed to fail

United Nations Security Council members are preparing to put forward a draft resolution on Ukraine that will call out Russia over its actions toward its neighbor, said a Security Council diplomat, but the move is doomed to fail.

It will not be adopted by the 15-member council as Russia is a veto power –– along with the United States, France, Britain and China –– but it gives Washington and allies a chance to show that Moscow is internationally isolated over its actions on Ukraine.

""We work on the resolution in the Security Council.

I hope we can move to action in the next hours or days, ... and if we cannot succeed in the Security Council we'll go right away to the General Assembly,"" said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Zelenskyy: Russia approves offensive against Ukraine

Russia has approved an offensive against Ukraine, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin did not reply to his invitation to hold talks.

Zelenskyy made the remarks in a 10-minute address posted on Telegram during which he spoke in both Ukrainian and Russian.

""I initiated a telephone call with the president of the Russian federation. Result: silence,"" Zelenskyy said in a late-night address.

On the Ukrainian border ""nearly 200,000 soldiers are stationed, (as are) thousands of combat vehicles,"" Zelenskyy said, adding ""major war in Europe"" could be started by Russia soon.

""I am addressing you Russian citizens as a citizen of Ukraine. We share a more than 2,000 kilometre border, and there are almost more than 200,000 soldiers, thousands of combat vehicles.""

Zelenskyy said: ""We should stop, before it's too late. If the Russian leadership doesn't want to sit down at the negotiating table, they should sit at the table with you. Do Russians want war? I'd love to answer this question but the answer depends only on you.""

Venezuela announces support for Russia



Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has firmly announced his support for Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid what he described as plans by the West to ""surround Russia militarily and strategically"".

Maduro discussed the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine for more than half an hour during the meeting with his cabinet.

""President Putin denounced before the UN Security Council that they (NATO) intend to surround Russia, pointing all NATO weapons at Russia in order to attack and destroy it when the conditions are right,"" Maduro said.

""And what does the world expect from President Putin, that he should stand idly by and not act in defence of his people? That is why Venezuela announces its full support to President Vladimir Putin.""

Russia’s recognition of Ukraine’s rebel-held Donetsk and Luhansk as “independent” has triggered more sanctions by the West amid fears Moscow will retaliate by cutting off Europe’s gas.

Blinken cancels Geneva meeting with Russia's Lavrov

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has cancelled plans to meet his Russian counterpart in Geneva later this week as Russia presses ahead with recognition of separatist regions of Ukraine and sends troops there.

Russia's actions indicated Moscow was not serious about a diplomatic path to resolving the crisis, Blinken said during a joint press conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba at the State Department.

As a result, he said he had called off his Thursday meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Echoing President Joe Biden, Blinken said Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to recognise the independence of Ukraine's Donbass region was a violation of international law. And, he said the placement of Russian troops there constituted the beginning of an invasion.

Although he held out hope for a peaceful resolution through diplomacy, he said he did not believe a meeting with Lavrov would be productive at this time.

Kuleba, for his part, said Ukraine ""strongly"" believes that the time for imposing sanctions on Russia and its leadership is now, to prevent a further invasion.

""The world must respond with all its economic might to punish Russia for the crimes it has already committed and ahead of the crimes it plans to commit. Hit Russia's economy now, and hit it hard,"" he said.

Speaking to the press, Dincu said Romania does not expect a huge migrant flow to the country but is prepared to receive more than 500,000 refugees if necessary.

Dincu said the Defence Ministry and the Interior Ministry got together to designate areas to shelter refugees along the border in case of a war between Russia and Ukraine.

Urging Romanians to stay calm, Dincu said there will be no war on their land.

He said conditions for an armed conflict have appeared, adding: ""I hope diplomats will continue to talk, not soldiers.""

Biden announces first tranche of Russia sanctions

US President Joe Biden has announced what he called the ""first tranche"" of sanctions against Russia, including steps to starve the country of financing, saying Moscow had started an invasion of Ukraine.

""We're implementing full blocking sanctions on two large Russian financial institutions; VEB and their military bank,"" Biden said in a White House address, adding that the sanctions will target Russian sovereign debt.

""The measures also would target financial institutions, and Russian elites,"" the US leader added.

He declared that Moscow had flagrantly violated international law in what he called the “beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.”

Biden said more sanctions could be on the way if Russia's President Vladimir Putin proceeds further.

Russia has not stopped planning for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine since recognising the independence of separatist enclaves, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said.

""Every indication is that Russia is continuing to plan for a full-scale attack of Ukraine,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference, adding that ""more and more of the forces are moving out of the camps and are in combat formations and ready to strike.""

""We continue to call on Russia to step back ... it's never too late not to attack,"" he added.

The NATO chief called the military action a “further invasion"" of Ukraine by Russia which had already invaded its neighbour in 2014.

White House calls Russian moves on Ukraine an invasion

The White House has begun referring to Russian troop deployments in eastern Ukraine as an “invasion” after initially hesitating to use the term, a red line that US President Joe Biden has said will result in the US levying severe sanctions against Moscow.

“We think this is, yes, the beginning of an invasion, Russia’s latest invasion into Ukraine,” said Jon Finer, principal deputy national security advisor.

“An invasion is an invasion and that is what is underway.”

Lawmakers give Putin permission to use force outside Russia

Russia’s upper house of parliament has given President Vladimir Putin permission to use military force outside the country upon his request to utilise the Russian army to support separatists in Ukraine.

That could presage a broader attack on Ukraine after the US said an invasion was already underway there.

Putin: Ukraine peace agreement 'does not exist' anymore

Russian President Putin has said that Western-brokered peace agreements seeking to end a conflict in eastern Ukraine no longer existed, after he recognised the independence of the ex-Soviet country's separatist regions.

""The Minsk agreements do not exist now, we recognised the DNR and LNR,"" Putin said, using the abbreviations for the separatist regions in Donetsk and Luhansk.

He also called for international recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, an end to Ukraine’s NATO membership bid and a halt to weapons shipments there.

Ukraine minister urges EU to promise future membership

Ukraine's foreign minister has urged European Union member states to promise his country future membership in the bloc in response to Russia's attempts to isolate it.

""I called on the EU to put aside all the hesitation, all the reticence and skepticism that exists in European capitals and to give Ukraine the promise of future EU membership. That time has come,"" Dmytro Kuleba said.

""The best strategic decision Europe can make right now is to literally take Ukraine into itself.""

Putin pledges uninterrupted gas supplies as sanctions loom

Russia will continue uninterrupted natural gas supplies to world markets, Putin has pledged, after Germany halted a key gas pipeline's certification over Moscow's troop deployment to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.

""Russia aims to continue uninterrupted (gas) supplies, including liquefied natural gas, to the world markets, improve related infrastructure and increase investments in the gas sector,"" Putin said in written remarks for a gas summit in Qatar.

Europe secures some 40 percent of its gas needs from Russia and was looking into approval of a newly-built Nord Stream 2 undersea gas pipeline which connects Russia with Germany.

EU, US welcomes Germany's decision to halt Nord Stream 2

Europe's energy supply would not be affected if the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline designed to bring Russian gas to Germany was halted, since the pipeline is not yet operating, the European Commission has said.

""Nord Stream 2 is not yet functioning, is not supplying energy to Europe. It's not a different source of energy, it's a different pipeline for an existing supplier... There's no change in the current situation,"" a Commission spokesperson told a regular press briefing.

The White House welcomed Germany’s decision and said that US sanctions would be announced soon.

UNSC to meet urgently on Ukraine crisis

The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting over Ukraine.

The meeting comes at the request of Ukraine, the United States and six other countries. Russia, which currently holds the rotating council presidency, has scheduled it for 9 pm [New York time.]

Yet undetermined is whether the meeting will be open or closed.

Ukrainian UN ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said in a letter to his Russian counterpart that Kiev is requesting the urgent meeting because Putin's actions violate Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the UN Charter, and a 2014 UN General Assembly resolution.

It is virtually certain the Security Council will not take any action or issue any statement because Russia has veto power.

NATO member Türkiye, which shares a maritime border with both Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both its neighbours, and has offered to mediate the crisis, while warning Moscow against invading Ukraine. Ankara also opposes sanctions on Russia.

The full invasion began at roughly 4pm on Thursday (NZT) and a lot has happened overnight. Here is Reuters' latest wrap of the situation:

Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders around nearly all of the country's perimeter on Thursday after Moscow mounted a mass assault by land, sea and air in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

Missiles rained down on Ukrainian targets. Kyiv reported columns of troops pouring across the borders with Russia and Belarus stretching from the north and east, and landing on the coasts from the Black Sea in the southwest and Azov Sea in the southeast.

Fierce fighting was taking place in the regions of Sumy and Kharkiv in the northeast, Kherson and Odessa in the south, and at a military airport near the capital Kyiv, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office said.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said troops were trying to fend off Russians attempting to capture the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, just 90 km (60 miles) north of the capital. Regional officials said Ukrainian authorities had lost control of some territory in the Kherson region near Russian-occupied Crimea.

After President Vladimir Putin declared war in a pre-dawn televised address, explosions and gunfire were heard throughout the morning in Kyiv, a city of 3 million people.

The highway out of the city choked with traffic as residents fled.

The assault brought a calamitous end to weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by Western leaders to avert war, their worst fears about Putin's ambitions realised.

""Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in the WW2 years,"" tweeted Zelenskiy.

""Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself & won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks.""

Calling on Ukrainians to defend their country, he said arms would be given to anyone prepared to fight. He also urged Russians to take to the streets to protest against their government's actions.

U.S. President Joe Biden called the Russian action an ""unprovoked and unjustified attack"". EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would impose a new round of sanctions that would hit Russia's economy severely.

EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said: ""These are among the darkest hours of Europe since the Second World War.""

RUSSIAN BOMBING

In his address, Putin said he had ordered ""a special military operation"" to protect people, including Russian citizens, subjected to ""genocide"" in Ukraine - an accusation the West calls baseless propaganda.

""And for this we will strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine,"" Putin said. ""All responsibility for bloodshed will be on the conscience of the ruling regime in Ukraine.""

A resident of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second biggest city and close to the Russian border, said windows in apartment blocks were shaking from constant blasts.

Blasts could be heard in the southern port of Mariupol, near a frontline held by Russian-backed separatists. Civilians in Mariupol packed bags: ""We are going into hiding,"" a woman said.

Ukrainian officials said Russian helicopters attacked Gostomel, a military airport near Kyiv, and Ukraine downed three of them. Ukrainian border officials said the Russians were trying to penetrate Kyiv region and Zhytomyr region on the Belarusian border. They were using Grad rockets.

Unconfirmed reports of casualties included Ukrainian civilians killed by Russian bombardment and border guards defending the frontier.

Authorities in the southern Odessa region said 18 people were killed in a missile attack. At least six people were killed in Brovary, a town near Kyiv, authorities there said. Ukraine reported five people killed when one plane was shot down.

Ukraine's military said it had destroyed four Russian tanks near Kharkiv, killed 50 troops near a town in Luhansk region, and downed six Russian warplanes in the east.

Russia denied reports its aircraft or armoured vehicles had been destroyed. Russian-backed separatists claimed to have downed two Ukrainian planes.

'RUSSIA ALONE IS RESPONSIBLE'

Even with a full-blown invasion under way, Putin's ultimate aim is obscure. He said he did not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and purge it of nationalists.

The outright annexation of such a vast hostile country could be beyond Russia's military capabilities. But if the aim is just to replace Zelenskiy's government, it is hard to see Ukrainians accepting any new leadership Moscow might try to install.

""I think we must fight all those who invade our country so strongly,"" said one man stuck in traffic trying to leave Kyiv. ""I would hang every single one of them from bridges.""

Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to defend Ukraine, but Washington has reinforced NATO allies in the region with extra troops and planes. The West has pledged to impose severe sanctions.

""Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,"" Biden said.

Russia is one of the world's biggest energy producers, and both it and Ukraine are among the top exporters of grain. War and sanctions will disrupt economies around the world already facing a supply crisis as they emerge from the pandemic.

Stocks and bond yields plunged; the dollar and gold soared. Brent oil surged past $100/barrel for the first time since 2014.

At least three major buyers of Russian oil said they had been denied letters of credit from Western banks, needed for shipments to go ahead.

'WE'RE AFRAID'

A democratic nation of 44 million people, Ukraine is Europe's biggest country by area after Russia itself. It voted for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and aims to join NATO and the European Union, aspirations that infuriate Moscow.

Putin, who denied for months he was planning an invasion, has called Ukraine an artificial construct carved from Russia by its enemies, a characterisation Ukrainians see as an attempt to erase their more than 1,000-year-old history.

While many Ukrainians, particularly in the east, speak Russian as a native language, virtually all identify as a separate nationality.

In Kyiv, queues of people waited to withdraw money and buy supplies of food and water. Cars stretched for dozens of kilometres (miles) on the highway leading from the capital west towards Poland, where Western countries have prepared for the likelihood of hundreds of thousands of refugees.

""We're afraid of bombardments,"" said Oxana, trying to flee and stuck in her car with her three-year-old daughter on the backseat. ""This is so scary.""

Three hours after Putin gave his order, Russia's defence ministry said it had taken out military infrastructure at Ukrainian air bases and degraded its air defences.

Ukrainian media reported that military command centres in Kyiv and Kharkiv had been struck by missiles, while Russian troops had landed at Odessa and Mariupol.

Russia announced it was shutting all shipping in the Azov Sea. Russia controls the strait leading into the sea where Ukraine has ports including Mariupol. Ukraine appealed to Turkey to bar Russian ships from the straits connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.
