Kharkiv: Bombed but Not Defeated

My name is Yulia Ilyukha, I’m a children’s writer from Kharkiv. People who still remember the USSR like to call Kharkiv the “first capital,” because in 1919 the Bolsheviks really did proclaim it the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Only 40 kilometres separate Kharkiv from the Russian border, so it is only natural that the city had close ties — economic links, family links — with the country next door. I say “had,” because it no longer does.

Since February 24, 2022, my city has been under attack from Russian artillery fire. Russian planes are dropping bombs onto the streets of my city. My neighborhood in Kharkiv is called North Saltivka. It is constantly being bombed with Russian missiles: Grad, Uragan, Smerch. A shell landed in the yard next to my building and my son’s nine-year-old classmates have been sitting in a basement for six days. I saw Russian tanks with my own eyes on the ring road around the city. The world should know that the Russians are cynically lying when they say that they are not targeting residential areas — they are firing directly on high-rise apartment blocks and many people have been killed. Parts of the city are in ruins. A Russian plane dropped a bomb directly on to Freedom Square, which they say is the biggest city square in Europe. They were trying to destroy the Kharkiv regional state administration, where Kharkiv’s defence HQ is situated.

This is Putin’s revenge on Kharkiv for failing to capitulate. Kharkiv, which has traditionally been seen as loyal and friendly towards Russia, showed its teeth and raised its hackles: the only flowers these occupiers will be met with are the ones on their coffins. Men stand in line to join the Territorial Defense battalions that protect the city; they are deeply disappointed when they are turned away because of the sheer number of volunteers.

Russian saboteurs enter the city every day; Ukrainian soldiers eliminate them. A curfew is in place. The supermarkets are open for only a few hours every day. There are kilometer-long queues; people can’t get basic food supplies. On February 28, people who came out of their apartments and basements to get some water and food were killed in a Russian artillery strike. A woman with torn-off legs lying next to a store — an image like this was impossible to imagine just a few days ago in peaceful, independent, European Ukraine.

The Russians continue to lie blatantly to their citizens and to the whole world that they are pursuing some sort of mythical liberation mission in Ukraine. The only thing Russia is capable of liberating my Ukraine from is Ukrainians themselves. The Russians are killing my compatriots, but the only thing they’ve achieved is to win the hatred of the population of once-friendly Kharkiv. Kharkiv won’t give up. Kharkiv will survive. Kharkiv is united as never before: it was and will be Ukraine. We will overcome this! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Heroes!

Why Are They So Interested in Us?

I’m in Uzhhorod, the safest city in Ukraine, which is turning into Babylon in front of my eyes. Today is the fourth day of the Russian-Ukrainian war. 40,000 people have poured into a city of 112,000. The weather is beautiful today, sunny, the city is full of new people walking around with their children and their dogs. From the embankment, I go down to the river to take a walk along the bank. I used to do this often before the war. I would admire the flowing water, photograph a sleeping swan or a group of ducks, or examine a heron up close. This is the first time I’ve done it since the war began. On the second day of the war, I realized that I couldn’t remember life before the war, or, rather, I remembered life before the war, but I couldn’t remember what it felt like.

A gorgeous white retriever runs up to me: I immediately spot that this is a new dog. As I stop to stroke him, his owners worry that he might dirty my coat, but I tell them it’s nothing and that I really need the pleasure of stroking him right now. The owners are a man, a woman, a grandmother and three small children. The children scramble down the bank of the river Uzh and are probably surprised that rivers can be so small; it’s very possible they have never seen a river other than the Dnipro. Well, here’s their chance.

These are beautiful people. We get to know each other. They tell me their story, so similar to a million other stories that have taken place in these four days, when Ukrainians have been abandoning their homes so as to avoid death under a Russian air strike. They managed to get out of Kyiv on the second day of the attack.

“It’s like heaven here,” says the woman, “after what we’ve seen.”

I want to bring them a little bit closer to that heaven. I offer them help, but they refuse, they’re living with friends and have everything they need.

For four days now, I’ve been going out of my mind with worry in this heaven for those who are still in hell. My best friend, with her child, husband, and dog, spent two nights in a bomb shelter. Only on the final night did they manage to escape to a safer place outside Kyiv; they stayed with a friend whose husband was at that time in an unsafe place on the other side of Kyiv with his aging parents. Their building had been under intense shelling for several hours. Thirteen-year-old Varvara, my friend’s daughter, is in constant touch with her friends, Kyiv schoolkids, who only recently were discussing anime and falling in love, but now discuss their new normal: during the daytime curfew, while your dad is defending Kyiv in the Territorial Defense, your classmate’s mum sees a suspicious man enter their building. She takes a pistol, leaves her children at home, and goes to check who he is.

The most striking horror of war is the reaction of children. When the war started, eight-year-old Tymko, my friend’s son, said: “This is the worst day of my life.” He, his mum and dad, and their dog managed to get out of their building near Kyiv barely half an hour before the shelling started. When they got to their first destination, he started to cry, because he hadn’t brought the plants he’d been looking after. When they were still at home and heard shots and explosions, his mum comforted him: “Don’t be scared, they’re not interested in us, they’re interested in strategic targets: airports, military bases.” And when they were driving out of the city and heard more shots, Tymko said: “Let’s hope they’re not interested in us.”

Ten-year-old Marfa, my friend’s daughter, cried bitterly for the first hour of the war because she was worried that she wouldn’t be able to defend her rabbit. Then she took a pencil and a piece of paper and wrote on it in big letters “WE DON’T WANT WAR.” She stuck it to the window. Her mother photographed this for me. The photo is really striking — the letters, running back to front, are lit up in the window. A message for the world. A message for a Russian destroyer.

Five-year-old Charlotta is now safe. Her parents took to her to her grandad and grandma in their mountain village. Charlotta has two pigtails, huge blue eyes, and an enchanting smile. Charlotte says that she’s a tiger. That she’ll growl at the Russians, and they’ll run away.

That’s just how it will be.

And you know why?

Because the name “Charlotte” means free person.

It is also the first aid point for wounded soldiers, before they are sent to a nearby military hospital.

Volodymyr’s mother Dariya was trying to move her two boys - Volodymyr and his three-old-old brother Viktor - from the Saltivka district on the firing line in the north-east to Sergei’s place in a safer part of the city. The windows of their home had all been smashed; a Russian air strike had destroyed a building nearby. Dariya’s husband Stanislav Baklanov was in Uzbekistan on a business trip, so Sergei and his wife came to help them move. Dariya rushed her two little boys into one car, while Sergei and his wife followed in theirs. When they came to a checkpoint, they were fired at. Dariya was shot directly in the head and killed instantly, while Volodymyr was struck in the same string of rapid gunfire. “My wife was shot and she was killed, and my first child Volodymyr - he got shot in the head,” says the boy’s father, a 34-year-old engineer, who is now staying underground at the hospital. “They were shot at by an automatic gun... I don’t know from whose side [Russian or Ukrainian] because that day was a very dangerous day - there was a lot of shooting.”

Asked what his message was for Russia, he said: “Stop the war”. “Because it’s not only politicians who pay. Civilians struggle from this war.

Everywhere in Kharkiv, there are long lines outside pharmacies and petrol stations. After a fortnight of daily shelling, many districts lie in ruins and over 300 residential buildings have no heating. The death toll is still unknown in a city with no time to count the dead. Stanislav fears the city is running out of medicine. “We have a whole hospital of injured people, but without medicine,” he says.

POLICY

President of Ukraine

Information about the victims of yesterday's bombing of the maternity hospital and the children's hospital in Mariupol appeared last night. We lost three people, including a child, a girl. The number of wounded is 17. These are children, women, medical workers.

This topic was mentioned on Russian television. It was on their talk show. But not a word of truth was said. The Russians were lied to that there had been no patients in the hospital and no women or children in the maternity hospital. The Russians were lied to that ""nationalists"" had allegedly taken up positions there. They lie confidently, as always.

War crimes are impossible without the propagandists who cover them up. I want to tell them one thing: you will bear responsibility just as all those who give orders to bomb civilians. We will find all the property of the propagandists and their associates. We will do our best to confiscate it wherever it is. You love a rich life. Love prosperous countries. You will not have this anymore. And this is just the beginning.

You will definitely be prosecuted for complicity in war crimes. And then, it will definitely happen, you will be hated by Russian citizens. Everyone whom you have been deceiving constantly, daily, for many years in a row. When they feel the consequences of your lies in their wallets, in their shrinking possibilities. In the stolen future of Russian children.

War is never isolated. It always beats both the victim and the aggressor. The aggressor just realizes it later. But it always realizes and always suffers.

Today, we are once again providing humanitarian corridors for our cities. The buses have already departed, the trucks are already on their way - with food, water, medicine.

Mariupol, Volnovakha, Izyum, Sumy and the region. Cities and towns of the Kyiv region - Bucha, Borodyanka, Irpin, Hostomel... My heart is broken by what the invaders did to our cities, to our state! And by what they want to do to our people who need urgent help.

Russian troops have already created a humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine. But for them it is part of the plan. They want to humiliate our people. Make them take bread and water from the hands of the invaders standing on their knees. So that Ukrainians can save their lives just by going to the occupied territories or to Russia. That's why they are blocking Mariupol, that's why they are blocking Volnovakha, blocking other cities.

The invaders specially organize this torture to give their propaganda channels new material. Just for that. Monsters.

Despite everything, updated information was received every hour yesterday about people whom we managed to evacuate to the free territory of Ukraine. In total, more than 60,000 of our citizens were rescued yesterday plus those who did not have time until night and continued the evacuation in the morning.

I spoke today, in particular about that, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. About the torture of our cities, our people. I spoke with French President Macron.

I felt in a conversation with Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson that our anti-war coalition will soon become much stronger. Consequently, the pressure on Russia for peace will also be much stronger. For us, specifics in relations with world leaders, with European leaders are very important.

We are really fighting for our independence! For freedom, for equality for all on the continent! That is why we want to see from partners the decisions based on reality, not on declarations or abstract considerations.

These days, the EU leaders will convene to discuss Russia's war against Ukraine. To discuss our application for EU membership. We are waiting for a concrete signal. We look forward to strong support. Because it will be fair, real, human, European.

We know exactly the position of every leader. We know exactly who stands with us and who thinks that the European Union is just accounting, profits, expenses and nothing more. We will work, we will persuade. Life will convince them.

Ukrainians! Our defenders!

We all have been defending our state for the 15th day. We endured. The Ukrainian army is repelling attacks in key directions. Thanks to our military, National Guards, border guards, police, territorial defense and everyone who joined the defense of the state, we have not become slaves, and will never become!

Because this is our spirit, this is our destiny. Pride for our Armed Forces of Ukraine is boundless!

After the war, after our victory, we will rebuild everything that was destroyed.

Very quickly and with a very high quality. A special state program for reconstruction will be created for each affected city. I have already instructed the government to start the elaboration.

Chernihiv and Sumy, Okhtyrka and Zhytomyr, Izyum, Mariupol and all our beautiful cities to which evil has come will not see a single trace of the Russian invasion.

The best architects, the best companies, the best projects. For every city! I want to say this on the example of Kharkiv. Our Kharkiv, which is now experiencing the worst suffering since World War II.

Saltivka, Oleksiivka... Perhaps most Ukrainians know nothing about these names. But the people of Kharkiv will hear. Freedom Square will be such that everyone, all of us, all Europeans will be there!

Briefing of Counsellor of the Head of Presidential Office of Ukraine Oleksii Arestovych

After yesterday’s airstrike at the Mariupol maternity house and children's hospital, it became obvious that the enemy has totally changed the tactics, has turned to a “Syrian scenario” – encircling and terrorizing cities and towns to cause maximum suffering and psychological pressure to civilians. Currently, cities that suffer the most are Mariupol (which Russia is trying to wipe off the map), Kharkiv, Okhtyrka and in some sense Mykolaiv.

The military and political leadership of Ukraine, the leadership of all states in the world together with the international organizations are aware of the situation. There are daily attempts to establish the humanitarian corridors, and today they will be launched from many cities, including from Mariupol. However, the enemy is deliberately disrupting the evacuation from Mariupol. At the same time, the Ukraine’s army is defending the city and doing its best to ensure the evacuation.

The goal of Russia in Mariupol is to cause panic and frustration with the actions of the Ukrainian authorities by the citizens of Ukraine. He urged the citizens to remember that it is Russia that cause the war and is interested in the Ukrainian disunity. The developments during the war depend on actions from both sides.

When it comes to the general military situation, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have made at least 7 powerful strikes at the enemy, including the termination of two regimental commanders of the Russian army, near Brovary, Izyum, Nikopol and Kryvyy Rig. Our army near Kharkiv took control over Dergachi and have disconnected the part of Russian troops in the north from those located next to Izyum, and have created a serious tactical success.

Ukrainian aviation, rocket forces and artillery continue striking the enemy, and we expect the change of the situation in Ukraine’s favor in the closet time. Ukraine is doing much efforts to change the humanitarian situation in the blocked cities, as like it works on the elimination of the enemy from those and other cities of Ukraine.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine

On March 9, 2022 Ukraine evacuated 2000 foreign students from Sumy.

These are the first foreign students who managed to escape a horrible war zone, created by Russia on the territory of Ukraine.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba

In our meeting with FM Lavrov mediated by Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu I insisted on the urgent need to allow humanitarian help for Mariupol and a 24-hour ceasefire. Unfortunately, FM Lavrov seemed to have come to talk, not to decide. I hope he will convey Ukraine’s requests back in Moscow.

Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba speaking to the media following the meeting with the foreign ministers of Turkey and the RF on Russia ceasing its war against Ukraine.

[The talks] were both easy and difficult. Easy because Minister Lavrov shared his traditional narratives about Ukraine. Difficult because I did my best to at least find a diplomatic solution to humanitarian tragedy unfolding on the battle ground near besieged cities. The most tragic situation is now in Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, which is bombarded and is subjected to artillery fire.

I came here with a humanitarian purpose. Mariupol is in the most difficult situation. I came here with a humanitarian mission to open humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol for the people wishing to leave the city, and to bring assistance into the city.

Unfortunately, Minister Lavrov was in a position to commit himself to it, but he will correspond with respective authorities on this issue.

We also raised an issue of a 24-hour ceasefire to resolve the most pressing humanitarian issues. We did not make progress on this since it seems there are other decision-makers on this matters in Russia.

We agreed to continue doing our best to seek a solution for humanitarian issues on the ground. I will be ready to meet again in this format if there will be prospect for a solution.

I believe that when Foreign ministers meet, they have by definition to negotiate issues of peace and security. I am ready to continue this engagement with the purpose of ending the war in Ukraine and stopping the suffering of Ukrainian people and liberating our territory from the Russian occupational force.

[In Ukrainian] – Thanked Turkish Foreign Minister for good will and professionalism. Underscored that had 2 tasks: to organize humanitarian corridors and 24-hours ceasefire.

I hope that Russia will demonstrate compassion to human suffering and allow the functioning humanitarian corridors from Mariupol and from Sumy to Poltava. We cannot stop the war if the country that started it does not want to stop it.

Today I heard that Russia will not allow ceasefire until Ukraine meets the demands that had been put forward by President Putin. In this regard I’d like to underscore that Ukraine did not surrender, is not surrendering and will not surrender. We are ready for diplomacy, we are looking for solutions, but until they are there, we will continue fighting to offset the Russian aggression.

I hope that today’s format will be continued. I am ready to continue talks if the Russian side will be ready to a serious talk, but not repetition of well-known clichés and narratives about Ukraine. What we need today a serious, subject-based talk without clichés. When the Russian side is ready, we’ll be ready. We’ll do everything for peace because saving human lives is a priority for us.

Q&A:

1) Did you get the impression that these attacks will continue? Have you received a promise about receiving military jets from the US?

No, we did not discuss military supplies to Ukraine. Upon my initiative we dedicated most of the time to discussing humanitarian issues on the ground. Because it is of the utmost priority for diplomacy to help everyone, who is suffering. I appealed to him in the most constructive way. It was not easy for me to listen to everything he was saying. But I several times requested to address urgently humanitarian issues.

My impression is that Russia is not in a position at this point to establish the ceasefire. They seek a surrender from Ukraine, but that is not what they are going to get.

Ukraine is strong, Ukraine is fighting, Ukraine will not surrender. We made we are ready to seek a balanced diplomatic solution to end this war but we will not surrender.

2) Peskov said the invasion will stop if there is a commitment from Ukraine not to join NATO. Did Russia ask you about it?

No, Minister Lavrov said that all these issues must be discussed at a different track, the Belarus talks. He did not go into details on these issues, but he conveyed to me that they will continue their repression until Ukraine meets their demands. And the list of those demands is a surrender. That is why it is unacceptable to us.

The last thing I want is to kill hope. I shared with Mr. Lavrov one episode in a hope that he will respond constructively based on simple human values and with respect to human life. I talked to him about a civilian, who was driving in a car and made a wrong turn and was immediately shot by a Russian solider. This must be stopped. This is a war crime. And everyone involved will bear responsibility, eventually.

I hope, I sincerely hope, that Mr. Lavrov will follow up these conversation with the Russian government and the Russian army and they will organize humanitarian passage for thousands of civilians, on whose behalf I spoke to him today, first and foremost from Mariupol, to allow provision of humanitarian aid to Mariupol.

3) Ukraine’s leadership has talked about pursuing some non-NATO models to resolve the conflict if it receives certain security guarantees. During your meeting with Mr. Lavrov did any issues about Ukraine’s status came up? Minister Lavrov set up any red lines, such as insisting Ukraine disarm or recognizes Russian sovereignty over the Donbas. What did you respond to it?

He mentioned it very briefly without going into discussion again. He insists this issue has to be discussed between delegations on the Belarus talks.

I told him that in my view the ministers are invested with the power to discuss these matters. However, he had a different understanding of the role of foreign ministers in these talks, so we did not engage into specific discussion on this matter.

4) Director General of MAGATE is in Antalya. Do you plan to meet with him? Has Minister Lavrov touched the issue of security of nuclear power plants? Does Russia continue threats of nuclear button?

[In Ukrainian] Yes, by the end of the meting Mr. Lavrov touched upon the issue of nuclear safety. He proposed to hold trilateral talks with MAGATE. I told him that before Russian soldiers came to Ukraine our nuclear power stations operated properly and that Ukraine has always been and is a reliable participant of all verifications models of MAGATE and reliable implementer of treaties on nuclear nonproliferation.

The lie that they are trying to spread – that they had found in Ukraine the traces of [Ukraine] developing nuclear weapons – this is a lie. Nothing of that sort ever happened in Ukraine.

So, the best Russia can do now is to take its soldiers out of Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plants and allow their personnel to service them.

5) [inaudible, signal lost] – Question on NATO membership

Yes, it is written in our Constitution that Ukraine will eventually join NATO as a full member and receive security guarantees.

However, we understand that this is not going to happen in the foreseeable future. We also see from the reaction of NATO, as an Alliance, to the Russian aggression against Ukraine that NATO is not ready to act collectively to stop the war and protect civilians from Russian raids. It [NATO] delegated the authority to help to member-states on the bilateral basis.

This poses a question: How to ensure Ukraine’s security between now and eventual NATO membership? This is the question. My Constitution says something and I can’t speak against my Constitution.

But if we could reach an agreement were a similar system of guarantees, as envisaged by NATO, charter would be granted to Ukraine – by permanent members of the UN Security Council, including Russia, by Turkey, by all our neighbors – this is something that we are ready to discuss.

The war is happening now. Ukraine exists in a security vacuum. We have to think creatively on how to address this issue and ensure our security. So far it is our Army that ensures our security and a list of partners, including Turkey, who are helping us with that.

Iryna Venediktova, Prosecutor General of Ukraine

U.S. forms mobile justice expert teams to assist Russian war crimes investigations in Ukraine.

On 9 March we met with Kristina Kvien, U.S. Charge d'Affaires a.i. in Ukraine, and John Clint Williamson, the 3rd U.S. Ambassador for War Crimes and his team.

The support from the US for Ukraine is extraordinary right now. They will now assist us in the process of documenting war crimes. Mobile teams with international humanitarian law experts and military analysts with significant experience in international courts and tribunals will assist and support Ukrainian law enforcement in evaluating the evidence collected and their legal analysis. All of them will be used by us in national and international judicial institutions.

This is yet another confirmation that the international community is united to hold the military accountable.

ENERGY

Ministry of energy of Ukraine

Information on the operation of the Ukrainian power system

The frequency in the UES of Ukraine is maintained at 50 Hz.

The most successful restoration works were carried out in Sumy region: electricity supply to 62.8 thousand subscribers in 263 settlements was restored.

At the same time, according to operative information, as of 17:00 CET 9 March 2022, more than 1,250 settlements and about 11,000 transformer substations in Ukraine were left without electricity (completely or partially) due to damage caused by hostilities.

Ukrenergo

Ukrenergo expects a safe corridor that will enable the reconstruction of the line to power Chornobyl NPP. Our repair teams are ready to restore the line immediately, despite the threat of being shot by the enemy and are waiting for permission.

Data on the operational capabilities of the Ukrainian power grid

Ukrainian power system has been operating steadily for two weeks in a row in the face of fierce attacks by Russian invaders. Despite this, the frequency in the network is 50 Hz.

Repair crews of NEC Ukrenergo and distribution system operators (Oblenergo) are repairing damaged power lines and substations as soon as possible. Thanks to the heroism and kindness of today's people in the Sumy region, the light was restored in the homes of more than 50,000 consumers, part of Chernihiv and Kharkiv were healed. The high professionalism and devotion of regional power repairmen helped to restore electricity supply in Okhtyrka, where for several days the same enemy destroyed the local Okhtyrka CHP.

Ukrainian power plants generate enough electricity to meet the needs of the consumers. If you are safe, continue to use household appliances in the usual way - there is enough electricity in Ukraine for everyone.

But, unfortunately, the aggressors continue to destroy our energy infrastructure. Due to hostilities, Chornobyl NPP and the city of Slavutych (damage to the 750 kV line Chernobyl - Kyiv) were disconnected.

The outage of the Chornobyl nuclear power plant threatens Europe with environmental catastrophe, as apart from the reactor that exploded in 1986, there are spent fuel assemblies at the territory of the plant. The cooling system cannot work there without electricity. The storages are healed by diesel generators, but it is necessary to restore the power supply to their facilities as soon as possible.

Since the time Chornobyl NPP was seized, Ukrenergo was doing everything possible to keep its power supply on one power line instead of three, and had negotiations with the aggressors about the need to repair damaged lines. Once we got the consent, and our repair crew went for an inspection, but it all ended in brutal searches, shootings over the heads of our specialists and threats of execution. The brigade was not allowed to carry out repair work.

Ukrenergo calls on the IAEA, the EU and all civilised world not to remain silent, not to ignore Russia's nuclear terrorism, which the aggressor state is now targeting against Ukraine.

According to Energoatom, all two Ukrainian nuclear power plants are operating stably, despite the fact that the Zaporizhzhya NPP is also occupied by invaders. Ukrainian specialists take care of nuclear power units, so radiation, fire and environmental conditions at nuclear power plants and adjacent territories are within the current norms.",https://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/ukraine-war-bulletin-30-march-10-1030-est
