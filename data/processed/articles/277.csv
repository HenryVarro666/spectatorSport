American defense officials offered an assessment of the Russian air campaign, estimating that invading pilots are averaging 200 sorties a day, compared with five to 10 for Ukrainian forces, which are focusing more on surface-to-air missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and drones to take out Russian aircraft.

New commercial satellite images appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas between Russian forces and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from the big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, outside Kyiv, the company said.

In a devastated village east of the capital, villagers climbed over toppled walls and flapping metal strips in the remnants of a pool hall, restaurant and theater freshly blown apart by Russian bombs.

Russian President Vladimir Putin “created this mess, thinking he will be in charge here,” 62-year-old Ivan Merzyk said. In temperatures sinking below freezing, villagers quickly spread plastic wrap or nailed plywood over blown out windows of their homes.

“We are not going away from here,” Merzyk said.

On the economic and political front, the U.S. and its allies moved to further isolate and sanction the Kremlin. President Joe Biden announced that the U.S. will dramatically downgrade its trade status with Russia and also ban imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds.

The move to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status was taken in coordination with the European Union and Group of Seven countries.

“The free world is coming together to confront Putin,” Biden said.

On the ground, Russia’s forces appeared to be trying to regroup and regain momentum after encountering heavier losses and stiffer resistance than anticipated over the past two weeks. Britain’s Ministry of Defense said Russia is trying to “re-set and re-posture” its troops, gearing up for operations against Kyiv.

“It’s ugly already, but it’s going to get worse,” said Nick Reynolds, a warfare analyst at Royal United Services Institute, a British think tank.

With the invasion in its 16th day, Putin said there had been “certain positive developments” in Russia-Ukraine talks, but gave no details.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Ukrainian forces had “reached a strategic turning point,” though he did not elaborate.

“It’s impossible to say how many days we will still need to free our land, but it is possible to say that we will do it,” he said via video from Kyiv.

Zelenskyy said authorities were working on establishing 12 humanitarian corridors and trying to ensure food, medicine and other basics get to people across the country. Thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed in the invasion, along with Ukrainian civilians.

He accused Russia of kidnapping the mayor of one city, Melitopol, calling the abduction “a new stage of terror.” The Biden administration, citing American intelligence but no evidence, warned before the invasion of Russian plans to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine. Zelenskyy himself would be a likely top target.

So far, the Russians have made the biggest advances on cities in the east and south while struggling in the north and around Kyiv.

Russia said it used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in the west “out of action.” The attack on Lutsk killed four Ukrainian servicemen, the mayor said.

Russian airstrikes also targeted for the first time Dnipro, a major industrial hub in the east and Ukraine’s fourth-largest city, with about 1 million people. One person was killed, Ukrainian officials said.

In images of the aftermath released by Ukraine’s emergency agency, firefighters doused a flaming building, and ash fell on bloodied rubble. Smoke billowed over shattered concrete where buildings once stood.

The bombardment continued in Mariupol, where a deadly strike on a maternity hospital this week sparked international outrage and war-crime allegations.

Unrelenting attacks have thwarted repeated attempts to send in food and medicine and evacuate civilians from Mariupol, a city of 430,000. In a statement, the Mariupol mayor’s office said Friday that the toll of people killed during the now 12-day siege had risen to 1,582.

In the face of the unrelenting bombing, “the dead aren’t even being buried,” the mayor’s office said.

Elsewhere, temperatures were forecast to hit -13 degrees Celsius (8 Fahrenheit) in the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has come under heavy bombardment.

About 400 apartment buildings in Kharkiv lost heat, and Mayor Ihor Terekhov appealed to remaining residents to descend into the subway or other underground shelters where blankets and hot food were being distributed.

The latest assaults came a day after satellite photos appeared to show that the huge armored column that was stalled for over a week outside Kyiv had spread out near the capital.

Military analysts were divided over whether the maneuvering by the Russian convoy signaled the imminent start of a siege of Kyiv or was just an effort to disperse some vehicles to more protected positions. The photos showed howitzers newly set up in firing position, and armored units staged near the Antonov Airport north of the city, according to Maxar.

Americans point instead to other forces that are moving toward Kyiv from the northeast and are now about 20 to 30 kilometers (about 10 to 20 miles) east of the city center.

Hundreds of miles to the south of Kyiv, at Mykolaiv, shelling damaged a cancer hospital, according to the head doctor, Maksim Beznosenko. No one was killed.

The United Nations says it has verified 26 attacks on medical centers, medical workers or ambulances since the invasion began, with 12 people killed.

The U.N. political chief said Friday that the international organization had received credible reports that Russian forces were using cluster bombs in populated areas. The bombs scatter smaller explosives over a wide area and are prohibited in cities and towns under international law.

Russians and Ukrainians have held multiple rounds of talks near the Belarus border, and the two countries’ foreign ministers met again Thursday with no apparent progress. Various third countries have also made attempts to broker a stop to the fighting.

Some 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, according to the United Nations.

Melitopol, Kherson, Berdyansk, Starobilsk, Novopskov are among the cities and regions that are currently under the control of Russian forces. But the residents continue to resist the “occupiers”.

In the southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol, the internet connection has all but disappeared, making it nearly impossible to reach people by WhatsApp or Telegram call, or stay connected for more than a few minutes.

Melitopol mayor Ivan Federov said that ordinary phones are no longer an option for them.

“We cannot use (phone lines), too easy for the Russians to listen in,” Federov was quoted as saying by BBC.

The Melitopol mayor claimed that the Russian forces occupying the city have taken control of the city’s communication network and warned that they need to be wary of what they hear on TV and radio.

Ivan Federov and his team have been exiled to another location following the Russian occupation of the city a week ago.

""We are not co-operating with the Russians in any way,"" Federov said emphatically. ""They have not tried to help us, they cannot help us, and we do not want their help.""

Non-stop protests in Russian-occupied Ukrainian cities

When Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine, he claimed that Moscow does not plan to occupy Ukraine. He claimed that the “military action” announced by him will seek to ""demilitarize"" Ukraine and came in response to threats from Ukraine.

""We decided to launch a special military action aimed at demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine,"" Putin had said in a televised address.

But in Melitopol and a string of other mainly Russian-speaking Ukrainian cities, Putin’s forces have found themselves treated as occupiers.

""There are protests in Melitopol every day,"" said 33-year-old Yuliya Kovaliova, who before the invasion helped run her family business of electronics stores.

""At some point, the Russian army started shooting at us and one man got shot, but we have not stopped protesting,"" Kovaliova said. ""We are not afraid to protest because we are together. We are afraid to walk alone at night, but we are not afraid to protest.""

Videos have surfaced showing protests in Kherson, Berdyansk, Starobilsk, Novopskov.

""I don't know how to count the number of people protesting, I thought it was 2,000 at least,"" said Yunona, a 29-year-old IT worker in the southern city of Kherson.

""One of our friends was beaten and taken by the Russian soldiers and people got so angry they chased the occupiers down the street and took him back,"" Yunona added.

Residents also claimed that the Russian forces looked young, uncertain, and afraid.

Olha, a 63-year-old English teacher, said, ""We go to the protests every day and they are close to us but they look afraid.""

""We are all just waiting for the Ukrainian army to kick them out,"" she added.

The mayors of the occupied cities are facing a dilemma- whether to encourage their citizens to take to streets, or warm them against going near Russian forces.

""Our people need to protest but they also need to save their lives,"" said Federov, the Melitopol mayor. ""I have asked them - please do not go near the Russian soldiers, go around them.""

Speaking to BBC, Vadym Gaev, the mayor of Novopskov, said that there had been daily protests but they had stopped three days ago when Russian soldiers shot three protestors - non-fatally - and beat another. Gaev said the Russian troops told an intermediary they had authorisation to shoot protesters, so there should be no more protests.

In Starobilsk, mayor Yana Litvinova was also working remotely.

""A new 'administration' has been appointed. The only thing we know is that it is going around government buildings and asking people to co-operate, and they are refusing,"" Litvinova said.

The mayors, who have left the city to keep the administration running are also facing increased criticism from the residents. Some accused them of betrayal while others said they were grateful hat the administration was still able to work.

Two residents of Kherson claimed that they thought the mayor there had betrayed the city by co-operating with Russian forces - an accusation circulating in Telegram chat groups.

""If I had betrayed the city would I still be here? I am in the office every day, working with my team to keep things running,"" Kherson mayor Igor Kolykhayev said.

The priority was to restart food production and get people back to work,

Kolykhayev emphasised that the priority in the current situation was to restart production and get people back to work.

""We are running out of food and there is no aid coming in, it's just not happening,"" he said. ""So we are telling everyone in the city: make any food you can make, manufacture anything you can manufacture.""

Residents in the Russian occupied cities have flagged the food scarcity, with shops fast running out.

""Shops are almost empty. You can buy the things that are left but very few things are left,"" said Yuliya Kovaliova, the electronics shop owner from Melitopol. ""Pharmacies are empty and my mother can't buy her heart medicine.""

Distrust of Russian ‘humanitarian convoy’

City residents in Melitopol, Kherson, and other places have described Russian “humanitarian convoys” that are attempting to hand out food, but filming the act for alleged propaganda.

Kovaliova said that two Russian trucks with humanitarian markings came into Melitopol last week and attempted to hand out food, but they also brought a film crew.

Nearly everyone refused, she said.

""Later we saw on it on TV. Russia has taken over the TV towers here so we only have one Russian channel being shown now and it was showing people taking the food and saying how thankful they are to the Russian humanitarian convoy,"" Kovaliova said.

Maxim, a 22-year-old piano teacher in the city, also described the supposed humanitarian convoy.

""They were filming and people said actors arrived to take the food,"" he said.

Yunona, the IT worker in Kherson, said she saw the same thing there, and Ukrainian media reported on the phenomenon in Berdyansk.

Melitopol mayor Ivan Federov said he had heard about these 'humanitarian convoys' too. But there were ""no real Russian trucks and no real Russian food,"" he said.

""They could open humanitarian corridors at any time to allow food and medicine in, but they do not want to. We know, we have tried,"" Federov lamented.

Satellite images from Maxar showed some of the tanks moved into forests, others in towns near the Antonov Airport north of the city.

At least two Ukrainian servicemen were killed and six people wounded in Russian airstrikes Friday on the Lutsk military airfield, according to the head of the surrounding Volyn region, Yuriy Pohulyayko.

The strikes were far to the west from the main Russian offensive and could indicate a new direction of the war.

The western cities hit Friday are between 80 and 90 miles from Lviv, the city that has become a refuge for Ukrainians from across the rest of the country and a hub for global humanitarian aid and other support.

Ukraine is also accusing Russian soldiers of abducting Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov. The Ukrainians claim it was captured on video in the clip below.

Ret. Lt. Gen. Richard Newton told “NewsNation Prime” it was “typical Soviet tactics.”

A drone crashed on the outskirts of Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, and is suspected of having flown all the way from the Ukrainian war zone.

Croatian authorities said Friday the overnight crash caused a loud blast but there are no reports of injuries.

The “pilotless military aircraft” entered Croatian airspace from neighboring Hungary at a speed of 430 mph and an altitude of 4,300 feet, according to a statement issued after Croatia’s National Security Council meeting.

That means the large drone flew at least 350 miles apparently undetected by air defenses in Croatia and Hungary. Both countries are members of NATO.

The U.N. human rights office said it has documented 564 civilian deaths and 982 injuries so far, saying the toll and “general human suffering” are rising.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization said Friday it has verified 29 attacks on health care facilities, workers and ambulances in the hostilities, including a high-profile one on a maternity hospital in southeastern Mariupol on Wednesday. In those, 12 people have been killed and 34 injured, WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris said in an email to the Associated Press.

The figures from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, which run from the Feb. 24 start of the fighting to midnight Wednesday, focus on civilians in general. It uses a strict methodology and counts only confirmed casualties. It acknowledges that its tally is likely to underestimate the real toll.

“Civilians are being killed and maimed in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks, with Russian forces using explosive weapons with wide-area effects in or near populated areas,” spokeswoman Liz Throssell told a U.N. briefing.

“Civilian casualties are rising daily, as is general human suffering,” Throssell said.

As the conflict enters its 16th day, many experts are praising the Ukrainian resistance for stumping the Russians thus far. However, there are growing concerns about the safety of supply lines Ukraine needs to keep its capital city going. Russia has claimed enough southern territory that it could begin to take some of the country’s larger cities.

“They have reinforcements,” Lt. Col. Daniel Davis said on “NewsNation Prime.” “They have replacements.”

There are new concerns Russia may begin using chemical weapons in the fight as it tries to gain control. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed it had proof Ukraine and the U.S. were producing banned biological weapons. Russian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denied the accusation and warned it could be a sign of what could happen next.

“If you want to know Russia’s plans, they are what Russia accuses others of,” he said in his nightly address to the nation.

Ukrainian authorities were trying to open evacuation corridors and humanitarian aid delivery routes Friday, with the support of the Red Cross.

Their top priority remains freeing civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and to get aid to its hungry, thirsty, freezing and terrified population.

The United States is still unwilling to take any action Russian President Vladimir Putin could construe as an act of war. Some Republican senators are pressing President Joe Biden to give Ukraine more planes.

This week, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said the Ukrainians likely would not gain much by getting them and it could escalate Putin’s aggression in the country — and potentially outside it.

Biden Friday announced the U.S. will move to revoke “most favored nation” trade status for Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Biden also announced bans of imports of several goods imported from Russia.

“Putin is the aggressor,” Biden said. “With bipartisan cooperation, I’m looking forward to signing into law a bill revoking Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR). We’re also taking a further step, banning imports of goods from several signature sectors of the Russian economy including seafood, vodka and diamonds.”

Still, some are questioning whether NATO should be kowtowing to Russian threats.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., a member of the National Guard, tweeted now may be an opportune time to strike the Russian forces in Ukraine.

“I do believe we have done a lot, and the administration should be commended for that,” Kinzinger tweeted. “But it’s time to remember that our military with NATO cannot be defeated by Russia. It’s time to say that, and it’s time to be clear that Putin can go no further.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/russian-convoy-disperses-but-threat-to-kyiv-remains/

President Biden strongly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine during his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday. Here are some excerpts from his prepared remarks, as released by the White House.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world, thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.

He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.

He met the Ukrainian people.

From President Zelensky to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.

Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.

In this struggle as President Zelensky said in his speech to the European Parliament, “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian ambassador to the United States is here tonight.

Let each of us here tonight in this chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.

Please rise if you are able and show that, yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.

Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.

They keep moving.

And the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.

That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War II.

The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.

It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.

Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.

He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.

He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did.

We prepared extensively and carefully.

We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.

I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.

We countered Russia’s lies with truth.

And now that he has acted, the free world is holding him accountable.

Along with 27 members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.

We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.

Together with our allies — we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.

We are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian ruble, making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.

We are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.

Tonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime, “No more.”

The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.

We are joining with our European allies to find and seize their yachts their luxury apartments their private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.

And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy. He has no idea what’s coming.

The Ruble has lost 30 percent of its value.

The Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value, and trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling, and Putin alone is to blame.

Together with our allies, we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance.

We are giving more than $1 billion in direct assistance to Ukraine, and will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.

But let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.

Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies — in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.

For that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

As I have made crystal clear: The United States and our allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power. Every single inch.

And we remain cleareyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days, weeks and months will be hard on them.

Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.

And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backward.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I always promised I would be. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.

And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.

Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.

America will lead that effort, releasing 30 million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.

These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.

But I want you to know that we are going to be OK.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

While it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake, now everyone sees it clearly.

We see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.

In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.

This is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.

To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you.

Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.

He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/03/01/world/ukraine-russia-war

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.
