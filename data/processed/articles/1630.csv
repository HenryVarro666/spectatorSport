1,75af86dd-7ae2-44f7-9a3a-79bbdfb39a9a,"['Abc News', 'Darlene Superville', 'Aamer Madhani Associated Press', 'March']",,"President Joe Biden says he's not yet convinced that Russia’s announcement that it will scale back military operations near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv will lead to a fundamental shift in the war

WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Tuesday said he wasn't yet convinced that Russia's announcement that it would scale back military operations near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv will lead to a fundamental shift in the war.

Biden, during an appearance with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong following bilateral talks at the White House, said he was waiting to see what Russia offers in ongoing talks with Ukraine and how Moscow readjusts its troop presence.

U.S. and Western officials have expressed skepticism about Russia's announcement earlier on Tuesday that it would dial back operations in an effort to increase trust in ongoing talks between Ukrainian and Russian officials in Turkey.

“We’ll see,"" Biden said. ""I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are.”

White House communications director Kate Bedingfield later expressed an even greater skepticism, saying the administration views any movement of Russian forces as a “redeployment and not a withdrawal"" and “no one should be fooled by Russia's announcement.”

“The world should be prepared for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine,” Bedingfield said. ""Everyone should expect that we’re going to continue to see attacks across Ukraine.""

Biden expressed his caution about the latest development after meeting with Lee for talks in which he sought to assure Singapore and other Pacific allies that his administration remains focused on the Indo-Pacific region even as they deal with the fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Biden at the start of an Oval Office meeting with Lee said it was essential that his administration continue to work on bolstering relations with Singapore and other nations in the region. The president has made adjusting U.S. foreign policy to better reflect the rise of America’s most significant military and economic competitor, China, a central focus of his foreign policy, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has complicated the effort.

“Even as we address the crisis in Europe, my administration is strongly supportive of moving rapidly to implement the Indo-Pacific strategy,” said Biden, who also held a call Tuesday with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to discuss developments in Ukraine.

Biden and Lee discussed the relationship between the U.S. and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, promoting the return of democracy in Myanmar following last year's military coup and advancing economic growth in the region. Biden said he and Lee consulted on the situation in Ukraine and “freedom of the seas,” an issue of heightened importance in the region as Beijing has made territorial claims over most of the South China Sea.

Lee acknowledged that the timing of the visit underscored Biden's commitment to the region and that the U.S. would continue to ""strengthen its strategic interests in the region.”

“I’m sure you’re completely seized with what’s happening in Europe right now,” Lee said. ""But we doubly appreciate the time you’re giving Singapore and to southeast Asian countries generally, especially ASEAN.”

Biden’s national security team has been pleased that Singapore and other Pacific partners — Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea — moved relatively quickly to hit Russia with sanctions following the invasion.

Lee noted that “the war in Ukraine has implications for the Asia Pacific"" region, a seeming reference to China's saber-rattling toward Taiwan. Concerns were growing even before Russia invaded Ukraine about Beijing's calculations about Taiwan. Biden administration officials have said that Chinese President Xi Jinping has closely watched the U.S. and Western reaction to the Russian invasion.

White House officials have also said that China has offered Moscow military and economic help with its prosecution of the war.

Any conflict over the self-governing island democracy stands to involve the U.S., which is legally obligated to ensure Taiwan can defend itself and treats threats to the island as matters of grave concern.

The Biden administration has repeatedly underscored its “One China” policy, which recognizes Beijing as the government of China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. Biden also made clear that the U.S. strongly opposes China's unilateral efforts to change the status quo or undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.

“There are potential flashpoints and contentious issues in our region to which if not managed, well, could escalate to open conflict,” Lee said. “Countries with interests in the region need to pursue all efforts to settle disagreements through peaceful means, so that we can avoid reaching a point of no return.”

Singapore, which typically waits for United Nations backing before implementing sanctions, has imposed restrictions on some exports and a ban on financial institutions from doing business with Russian banks.

Biden thanked Lee for Singapore being a reliable ally, saying the island manages to “punch way above your weight.”

Biden was scheduled to host several national leaders from ASEAN this week, but the summit was postponed. Vice President Kamala Harris visited Singapore in August, announcing agreements involving cybersecurity, climate change and supply chain issues.

The president on Tuesday said he still planned to host the ASEAN summit this spring.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden adopted a cautious attitude on Tuesday to Russian vows to redeploy forces around Kyiv as the United States and its allies began discussion on a potential new $500 million aid package for Ukraine.

Speaking alongside Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Biden said the economic sanctions that have hobbled the Russian economy would continue while the United States and its allies monitor what Moscow does with its forces.

""We'll see. I don't read anything until it until we see what their actions are,"" said Biden.

Biden earlier spoke by phone for nearly an hour with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

He said the consensus among the leaders was to wait to see what the Russians offer.

A White House statement on Biden's phone call with the allies said they reviewed efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the millions affected by the violence inside Ukraine and those seeking refuge in other countries.

""They also discussed the importance of supporting stable energy markets in light of current disruptions due to sanctions,"" it said.

The call comes amid peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on Tuesday in which Moscow promised to scale back its military operations near the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv and Ukraine proposed a neutral status with international security guarantees while maintaining its territory.

""We are clear-eyed about the reality of what’s happening on the ground,"" said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""No one should be fooled by Russia's announcement. We believe any movement of Russian forces from around Kyiv is a redeployment, not a withdrawal.""

A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that the United States and its allies are discussing another possible round of assistance for Ukraine that could reach a collective $500 million.

Story continues

The U.S. official declined to confirm the figure but said the United States was ""actively working on how best to continue our support for the Ukrainian government through security, humanitarian and financial assistance.""

Biden returned from Europe where last week he visited with top European leaders in person and attended a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit on the Western response to Russia's more than monthlong invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

Macron was scheduled to talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.

BIDEN FACES COMPLAINTS HE EMBOLDENED RUSSIA BY MAINLY SAYING WHAT HE WOULDN'T DO

Biden provided his assessment after speaking with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Tuesday morning.

""There seems to be a consensus to see what they have to offer,"" Biden added.

Russian officials pledged to ""reduce military activity"" significantly near Kyiv, as well as in Chernihiv to the north. Ukrainian negotiators have also signaled a willingness to make concessions over Russian-occupied territory, including Crimea, over a 15-year period.

Biden made the comments Monday alongside visiting Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

During his remarks, Biden applauded the prime minister and Singapore for punching ""way above your weight."" Lee, in turn, was pressed to evaluate Biden's Asia policy, saying that ""each administration launches new initiatives"" but the president seems ""completely focused on achieving something lasting"" in Asia.

Biden told reporters in the Oval Office earlier that he and Lee were meeting during ""a critical moment for both our countries.""

We'll see if they follow through what they're suggesting,"" Biden said at the White House, where officials were busy digesting intelligence and reports from the ground that Russian troops were moving their focus away from Ukraine's capital toward other areas of the country.

Biden's don't-trust-but-verify approach reflects deep American skepticism at Russian President Vladimir Putin's motives amid his monthlong invasion of Ukraine. While the US has observed movements of Russian forces away from Kyiv, there remains doubt the Russian assault on Ukraine will end soon.

Some Western officials viewed Russia's moves as a mere tactical exercise amid a stalled campaign in Ukraine. US officials also said Russia could always reverse itself if the battle conditions allow.

Similarly, American officials appeared wary of voicing optimism about ongoing negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, which both sides suggested Tuesday had yielded progress. Instead, Biden was focused on ensuring the stringent sanctions regime he's enacted with European allies remains in place as the hostilities continue.

Meeting in Istanbul, Russian and Ukrainian teams began outlining the contours of a settlement, including discussions over the status of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and Donbas, the eastern region that Russia claims is independent. Ukraine's neutral status and international security guarantees are also up for discussion, as is a potential meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

US officials have questioned Putin's seriousness in negotiating an end to the violence from the start of the crisis. Some have also made plain they aren't certain of Zelensky's endgame in the talks and are wary of whatever concessions he may offer.

Speaking in the East Room alongside the visiting Singaporean Prime Minister, Biden said he'd discussed the nascent peace talks with European leaders on a 53-minute telephone call earlier in the day. He said there was a ""consensus"" among the leaders to ""let's just see what they have to offer. We'll find out what they do.""

""In the meantime, we're going to continue to keep strong the sanctions. We're going to continue to provide the Ukrainian military with their capacity to defend themselves and we're going to continue to keep a close eye on what's going on,"" Biden added.

Biden's aides echoed his sentiment, saying that while there were signs of troop movements, a new strategy did not appear afoot.

""We have no reason to believe that they have adjusted, that they've adjusted that strategy,"" White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said during a daily briefing. ""Obviously, we continue to do everything we can to impose costs for this decision.""

Speaking on a diplomatic visit to Morocco, Secretary of State Antony Blinken cautioned the pullback of troops could amount to ""a means by which Russia once again is trying to deflect and deceive people into thinking it's not doing what it is doing.""

""If they somehow believe that an effort to subjugate 'only' -- in quotation marks -- the eastern part of Ukraine and the southern part of Ukraine can succeed, then once again they are profoundly fooling themselves,"" Blinken said at a joint news conference with Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita.

And the Pentagon cautioned that while ""small numbers"" of Russian forces have moved away from Kyiv ""in the last day or so,"" Russia can still inflict ""massive brutality"" on the city.

""We believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we all should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas of Ukraine,"" said Pentagon press secretary John Kirby at a briefing. ""Nobody should be fooling ourselves by the Kremlin's now recent claim that it will suddenly just reduce military attacks near Kyiv, or any reports that it's going to withdraw all its forces.""

Kirby said that the number of Russian forces moving away from the Ukrainian capital is ""not anywhere near the majority of what they have arrayed against Kyiv,"" and that Russia has continued airstrikes against the city ""even today.""

He added, ""It does not mean that the threat to Kyiv is over.""

For its part, Moscow was quick to clarify its announced plans of deescalating near Kyiv did not amount to a ceasefire. Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky told Russian state-owned channel RT the first step agreed by Russia in talks with Ukraine ""concerns a gradual military de-escalation in two main directions, Kyiv and Chernihiv,"" adding, ""We understand that there are people in Kyiv who need to make decisions, so we do not want to expose this city to additional risk.""

Biden's phone call with European allies came days after he had returned to Washington from a last-minute trip to Belgium and Poland meant to reinforce American commitment to the region's security. He spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi.

Macron in particular has acted as an interlocutor between Putin and the West, and the two men spoke Tuesday after the group call with Biden. The French President had warned against escalating the crisis after Biden said in Warsaw that Putin ""cannot remain in power.""

The offer came as Russian and Ukrainian officials held a new round of talks and Ukrainian forces continued to mount fierce resistance in northern parts of the country against a relentless campaign of Russian shelling and missile attacks that has destroyed residential neighborhoods, hospitals and fuel storage depots.

But rather than ending the war, it seemed more likely that Russian President Vladimir Putin was merely shifting focus to the eastern and southern parts of Ukraine, where his forces have moved deeper into the separatist Donbas region and battered the coastal town of Mariupol.

“There is what Russia says and there is what Russia does,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said. “We’re focused on the latter, and what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people, and that continues as we speak.”

In Tuesday’s talks, held in Istanbul, Ukraine also suggested it would accept a position of “neutrality” — giving up its aspiration to join NATO — as long as other outside entities, such as the European Union, guarantee its security. The negotiations also raised the prospect of a face-to-face meeting between Putin and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky if there were a draft peace agreement.

Yet even as that prospect was emerging, Ukrainian officials ahead of Tuesday’s meetings warned their delegation not to eat or drink anything because of reports of suspected poisoning of participants in previous talks. Russia has a history of poisoning enemies of the government, so building trust is still a formidable challenge.

Pentagon officials said there were indications that Russian forces may indeed have begun pulling back from Kyiv and the hard-hit city of Chernihiv — but only in very small numbers.

“We’re not prepared to call this a retreat or even a withdrawal,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. “We think that what they probably have in mind is a repositioning to prioritize elsewhere.”

But, Kirby added, “The threat to Kyiv is not over.”

President Biden on Tuesday spoke for an hour with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, to emphasize “their determination to continue raising costs on Russia for its brutal attacks in Ukraine,” the White House said.

Russian forces have been bogged down outside the capital for weeks, unable to break through into the heart of the city. In a sign that a reduction in attacks might already have begun, no new missile strikes were reported overnight in Kyiv. But regional officials reported shelling elsewhere Tuesday, including an attack that partially destroyed a government building in the southern port city of Mykolaiv, and an oil depot hit by a missile in Rivne in the northwest.

And it remains unclear whether Moscow’s recent statements about shifting its military focus to eastern Ukraine — which is home to a pro-Russia separatist movement — represent a real reevaluation of the aim of seizing Kyiv and toppling the Ukrainian government, or a temporary move to allow stalled Russian forces to regroup and prepare a heavier onslaught.

After Tuesday’s talks — the fifth round since Russia invaded its neighbor Feb. 24 — Ukraine suggested that it was open to discussing the status of the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014.

“It is offered to clearly record the parties’ intention to settle the issue exclusively through Ukraine-Russia bilateral negotiations within 15 years. It’s also offered not to resolve the Crimean issue by military means in any case,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Zelensky.

The statements and a possible Putin-Zelensky meeting were a shift from earlier in the day, when Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv was seeking to address “humanitarian questions” at least and a “sustainable” cease-fire at most. “We do not trade in people, land and sovereignty,” he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had said Monday that the world needed to “stop pandering” to Ukraine, accusing Kyiv of only “seeking to generate an image of negotiation” in its demands for Zelensky-Putin talks.

The stalemate at the negotiating table until now appeared to match the situation on the ground in Ukraine, which in recent days has seen a seesaw of gains and losses for both sides after nearly five weeks of armed hostilities.

The British Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that Russians had backed away from “a number of positions” around Kyiv but warned that they remained a “significant threat” to the capital.

The analysis matched that of the Ukrainian military and Zelensky, who said overnight that it was “too early to talk about security” in suburban areas such as Irpin, which Ukraine said it had “liberated” from Russian control. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry says Kyiv remains in danger, despite Russia’s statements on shifting its focus to the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine.

Speaking on national TV on Tuesday, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the Russian military would “concentrate attention and our main efforts on achieving the primary objective — that is, the liberation of Donbas.” As justification for its invasion, the Kremlin has alleged that Russian speakers in the Donbas are being subjected to ethnic cleansing by the Ukrainian government, an allegation that the U.S. and other nations have rejected as false.

Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin told the Interfax news agency that “in order to increase mutual trust and create necessary conditions for further negotiations ... a decision was made to radically, at times, reduce military activity in the Kyiv and Chernihiv direction.”

Despite the talk of a scaled-back Russian offensive, western Ukraine, which has hitherto been spared a large-scale assault, has seen stepped-up attacks in recent days. Authorities in the city of Lviv reported that two missiles were shot down Monday, two days after a pair of missiles hit targets in the city, a fuel depot and a defense compound. No fatalities were reported.

Russia has been targeting fuel supplies across the country in recent days, including strikes late Sunday on an oil-storage facility in the western city of Lutsk.

In a new report Tuesday, the Ukrainian military said that more than 60 religious buildings, largely belonging to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, had been destroyed in the war, mostly around Kyiv and eastern areas.

And a national telecom company, Ukrtelecom, said it was knocked offline Monday after a cyberattack. Yurii Shchyhol, an official at the State Special Communications Service, blamed “the enemy.” He said the company limited phone and internet access for customers in order to maintain coverage for the military.

Officials in some of the worst-hit areas, including Chernihiv and the southern port city of Mariupol, have pleaded for international aid and an end to daily attacks.

In Chernihiv, where the mayor said a Russian blast destroyed a bridge on a key aid route last week, the shelling has been near-constant, according to local officials. The city is about 80 miles from Kyiv.

In Mariupol, which has lost the majority of its prewar population of 430,000 to evacuations, the mayor said that close to 5,000 people have died amid strikes that have reduced the city to rubble. The number has not been independently verified.

Mariupol is “in the hands of the occupiers today,” Mayor Vadym Boichenko, who spoke from outside the city, said Monday. Boichenko said Russians controlled significant swaths of land in the area.

A Russian takeover of the city would give Putin a corridor to Crimea, which Moscow controls but which has no land connection to Russia.

After negotiations Tuesday, Zelensky advisor Podolyak said that, in addition to being open to discussing Crimea, Ukraine wanted a “security guarantees treaty.” He said it should involve the U.S., Britain, Turkey, France, Germany and other nations as “guarantor states” that would be “actively involved in protecting Ukraine from any aggression.”

Western intelligence and military analysts said they suspect Russia may want to split Ukraine and take strategic southern and eastern areas, either through force or negotiations. Zelensky said over the weekend that he could compromise on “the complex issue of Donbas.” But he has also insisted, seemingly irreconcilably, that “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.”

The Ukrainian leader said that he was willing to discuss Ukraine’s becoming “neutral” and dropping aspirations to join the NATO defense alliance as long as Ukrainians were able to vote on the matter.

In an overnight video, Zelensky also criticized international sanctions on Russia as too weak. Sanctions must be “effective and substantial,” he said, appealing once again for more weapons from allies. Zelensky has sharpened his criticism of Western nations in recent days after his pleas for tanks and warplanes were repeatedly turned down.

“Ukrainians should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine,” he said. “Fear always makes you an accomplice.”

Speaking on Monday to PBS, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had entered a phase of “total war” that included the West’s attempt to strangle the Russian economy through heavy sanctions.

He also said Russia has long feared the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include Ukraine: “For a couple of decades, we were telling the collective West that we are afraid of your NATO’s moving eastwards. We, too, are afraid of NATO getting closer to our borders with its military infrastructure. Please take care of that. Don’t push us into the corner.”

During the interview, which was conducted in English, Peskov clarified earlier remarks he made on CNN suggesting Russia had not taken nuclear attacks off the table. “No one is thinking about using” or “even about [the] idea of using a nuclear weapon,” he said.

Russia’s invasion has killed at least 1,150 civilians, according to the United Nations, which acknowledges that the true toll is probably far higher. More than 10 million people have been displaced, including 3.8 million refugees.
