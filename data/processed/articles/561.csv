2,fa32a318-e61a-4685-86c9-e3798c42181b,['Chloe Taylor'],2022-03-09,"Russia is likely sending paid mercenaries into Ukraine to help along its invasion of the country, a British government ministry said.

The government of President Vladimir Putin ""almost certainly maintains extensive links"" with Russian companies that sell mercenary fighting services, the U.K. Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update released Wednesday night GMT.

Russian corporate fighters have been accused of committing human rights abuses in Syria, Libya and the Central African Republic while working on behalf of Moscow, the ministry said.

The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies said last year that Moscow gave security and military services through so-called ""private military companies"" to the government of the Central African Republic in exchange for the right to extract gold, uranium and diamonds.

Such mercenary services already operated in eastern Ukraine prior to Russia's current invasion, according to the U.S. government.

In 2017, the U.S. Treasury placed sanctions on the biggest Russian mercenary company, PMC Wagner, and its founder, Dmitriy Utkin, for ""actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine.""

Russian mercenary companies including Wagner ""have a poor track record—including operational failures and human rights abuses,"" CSIS said.

The U.S. Department of Defense said on Monday that Russia is trying to recruit mercenaries from Syria as well.

""We find that noteworthy that [Putin] believes that he needs to rely on foreign fighters to supplement what is a very significant commitment of combat power inside Ukraine as it is,"" the official said in a briefing.

United Nations reported 1 million Ukrainians have fled the country during first week of Russian aggression.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky had an honest and emotional conversation with foreign media in the Presidential Office.

Here are his main points:

About the Russian Army: ""Russian army is much bigger. No one counts how many(Russian soldiers) die in this war. Russian military commanders are not going to show the bodies of those soldiers to their mothers. They are meat.""

""The end of the world has already happened If we would not stop him (Putin).""

To Putin: ""You are not a monarch. You were chosen by your people, so you are a manager a CEO of the country. CEO, not a tyrant, not a furher.""

""What do you want from us? Get out of our land. If you don't want to leave, sit at the negotiations table with me. I am free. Sit with me, but not in 30 meters from me like you sit with Macron or other leaders. I am your neighbor. I won't bite you. I am a normal guy. Speak with me, what are you afraid of?""

About Ukraine: ""I don't know how much we can hold. We don't count the time. We are just doing our jobs. We are protecting our lives, our freedom.""

About fear for his life: ""As every other human being of course I am afraid for my life and for life of my loved ones. But as a president I can't afford to be scared. For me it is even scarier to lose my country.""

What the world can do: ""If you don't protect your unions, they would dissapear. If you don't stand firm against the aggressor. You have to be so strong, you can decide conflicts not by war. Their alliances have weaknesses. Look at what happened with Nord Stream-2. We've warned you about the gas prices, about the danger of this energy weapon.

If Ukraine doesn't stop all of this... I appreaciate all your help. But it has come too late. So many lives have been lost. If Ukraine falls, remember my words... Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Moldova, Poland would be next. The Russians will go as far as to the Berlin Wall.""

""The most important thing world can do is to impose no flight zone over Ukraine. Missiles and jet fighters flying from Belarus and Russia have been killing our people from the sky. Tell me how many people have to die for you to close the sky. We will wait until that moment. This is the same thing that happened with sanctions. I asked to impose sanctions before the attack.

But I was wrong -- again -- about the extent of Moscow's ambitions. (I have, since the first intelligence warnings about a full Russian invasion of Ukraine, felt the idea was so preposterous it must be born of an intelligence failure, not a historic intelligence success).

Russian troops did enter the city of Kherson, where they were reported to have looted shops , arrested men, and shot in the air at protestors. The residents here call them ""Orcs"" -- the lumbering monsters from the Lord of the Rings.

It is a marvel that Moscow was either so convinced civil disobedience would not be a problem or decided that they simply did not need a plan to deal with it. The Kremlin's attempt to film Russian aid trucks handing out the solution to the problem its invasion created was greeted with local scorn and profanity. The protests go on.

The port of Mykolaiv is next on the Russian route to Odessa, Ukraine's third-largest city. The Russian ""plan"" for Mykolaiv is even more disconcertingly opaque. Shelling is a big part of it; over a week they have hit civilian targets there multiple times.

Last weekend, when their missiles blew out the windows and roofs of civilian buildings as a consequence of a strike on Ukrainian armor in the city center, that may have been by accident.

But this weekend -- even at the most generous assessment -- it was through carelessness so extreme it was surely criminal. They seem to just be lobbing rockets, into the city's suburbs, CNN seeing three instances where apparent cluster munitions had landed in residential areas. NATO on Friday said it had seen the use of cluster bombs by Russia in Ukraine

And again and again on Mykolaiv's outskirts, the Russians keep coming. The attacks seem to falter every time. At one roundabout, we saw a Russian Tigr armored vehicle on fire on Saturday, Ukrainian troops lying in defensive prone positions around it.

Some 24 hours later, at the same spot, Ukrainian troops had found time to graffiti the unexploded rockets that landed around them with anti-Putin abuse, and the Russians had been pushed further back down the road.

Farmers were clambering over an abandoned T90 tank, trying to get it started and quite quickly diagnosing it had a steering problem. That, and the tank having been trapped the ruins of a collapsed bridge, perhaps explains why it had been abandoned.

But this was not a rare occasion. On Sunday, the regional governor Vitali Kim posted a video of himself inside another captured Russian Tigr vehicle.

Another video showed what seemed to be a significant Russian artillery unit in flames, destroyed or abandoned. The person filming joked that the scarred machines' remains were what ""is what's left of our 'brothers,' the ones that came to 'save us'"" -- a reference to Moscow's gibberish assertion that it is engaged in a special operation to demilitarize and ""de-Nazify"" Ukrainians subjugated under a vile regime.

The Kremlin's propaganda -- for years something so concentrated and cynical that it found its way into the information ecosystem, and even turned some souls -- is dismissed with the same disregard with which it was authored. It really is just nonsense, and it is refreshing to see most sensible media not even give it oxygen.

Odessa is the prize on the coast. On Monday morning as the city was blasted with horizontal snow, the sirens rang out, enflaming residents' fears of a Russian amphibious landing.

Those last three words sound ridiculous here, in a city with hipster dumpling stores hidden in stairwells, and a series of road signs that tell any new Russian arrivals to ""f**k off"" (straight ahead), ""also to f**k off"" (left) and to ""f**k off back to Russia"" (right).

The entire Russian project in Ukraine is the stuff of a malarial nightmare. Putin's plan still doesn't make sense. Did the Kremlin genuinely think that Ukraine would collapse in a week, its citizens welcoming them in?

If so, then why has the strategy swung so rapidly toward a form of collective punishment once it became clear they were not welcome at all? Was there no plan for something in between appreciation and annihilation?

Why are the Russian units we see trying again and again to hit the same targets, often using very similar approaches? Why are so many abandoning their vehicles and accepting capture? And why is the Russian air force, for years flaunted as Putin's new hi-tech toy, proving so very ineffective?

There is a temptation to seek rational answers to these questions. The reason we are in this dark place is the failure of the rational to dominate in the Kremlin.

Again and again, the war fails to make sense. It seems to be outside the reaches of what I thought our shared reality was. We can only hope it does not stay that way.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/07/europe/russia-southern-ukraine-military-analysis-intl/index.html
5,fa32a318-e61a-4685-86c9-e3798c42181b,[],,"It seems to me that more often than not tanks are a liability. If you're driving in a tank it's dead obvious where you are and you can be easily shot especially if the enemy has heat-seaking missiles and your tank does not have heat-masking equipment. I realize it may be the case that not every infantry unit has anti-tank missiles but still. Whereas if you're a solider and hiding behind some tree, it seems to me that you are much more difficult to gun down. According to this website(usual caveats about the easiness of faking pictures) 51 tanks have been destroyed or damaged and 71 have been captured. Suppose the Russians have 3000 tanks in the field, and suppose that 80% of a 4 man crew becomes casulaties then that's a 3.25% chance of becoming a casualty (152*4*.8)/(3000*4) = .0325. Now let's try to figure out the likelihood of becoming a casulty if you're not in a tank. I've seen estimates of the number of Russian casulties at around 3000, (of course I don't believe the Ukrainians who put the number at 11,000). If there have been 390 tank casaulties then there have been 2600 non-tank casulties. There are reports that now 100% of the entire 190,000 +/- 10,000 troops are now in the field though I frankly find that hard to believe. In any case, I'm obliged to defer to expert opinion. So, if there were 3000 tanks and 4 men per tank, that equals 12000 men in tanks and 178,000 men not in tanks. The casualty rate of non-tank soldiers would then be 2600/178,000 which is 1.46%. However, we have to keep in mind that I have not been able to factor in the casulties of the other clunky vehicles. Of course, you need some vehicles in order to conquer a country but it seems to me that the ratios the Russians are using is not the correct one.All of this reminds me of the line from Lawrence of Arabic where Lawrence says that the desert is an ocean on which no oar is dipped and on this ocean the Arabs go where they please and strike where they please. It seems that that is what the Ukrainians are doing except this time it is the woods. That is at least how things are portrayed in this videoAgain, I don't want to be naive. I realize these videos are selected for their propaganda purposes and they are designed to show the Ukrainians in a positive light and make the war look adventurous, just as Lawrence of Arabia was used as a figure to show the more heroic aspects of WWI. That being said, I think the calculations point to tanks being a liability or at least not used properly.",https://www.defencetalk.com/military/forums/t/the-russian-ukrainian-war-thread.15283/page-69

Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN)

Two weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, Russia's ""precision strikes"" have become much less precise and its ground forces are struggling to seize territory.

On the eve of the offensive, some US officials predicted that Kiev would fall within 48 to 72 hours of the start of hostilities.

However, the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag still hangs from its buildings.

There was simplistic talk that the Ukrainian state would be ""decapitated"";

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky still poses the challenge.

If, as Putin claimed, Ukraine was not a real country, surely it would have collapsed by now.

But even with 150,000 Russian troops inside their borders, according to US assessments, they control at most about 10% of Ukraine.

Traveling around Ukraine in the three weeks before the invasion, it seemed like a lot of people were in denial.

""We are sure that there will be no war,"" was the refrain in Mariupol, Zaporizhzia and Kyiv.

The Ukrainian government also downplayed the buildup of Russian forces, anxious not to scare its citizens and markets.

Then on February 24, it was like a switch had been flipped.

Overnight, denial turned into defiance.

Now the refrain is: ""I'm going to war. It's my land.""

Ukrainians demonstrate in Kherson on March 5 to protest the Russian occupation.

Serious defenses and countless checkpoints have sprung up around Kyiv.

Ukrainian forces, to the surprise of many observers, have been nimble and effective against Russian armor that has struggled to make progress.

Small mobile units that know the territory have reduced Russian convoys.

Anti-tank weapons purchased mainly from the US and UK have left smoldering wreckage on roads across the country.

Turkish-made attack drones have been deployed to precise effect.

In the few areas occupied by Russian forces, even those that are predominantly Russian-speaking, crowds of hundreds have hurled insults at bewildered Russian soldiers.

They have built mountains of tires to defend their villages and have painted street signs.

Not that the Ukrainians have the upper hand.

They cannot defeat a vastly superior Russian force, but the evidence so far suggests that, bolstered by weapons and other aid flowing across the border from Poland, they can still deny victory to Putin.

The longest fortnight in Ukraine

A British prime minister once observed that a week is a long time in politics.

The two weeks of this conflict seem like an eternity, in terms of how they have changed the world.

Four Ukrainians I was sitting with in Kyiv watched in horror in the early hours of February 24 as Putin's speech announcing a ""special military operation"" was broadcast on Russian television, imagining that the freedoms they had come to enjoy were about to be crushed.

Minutes later, the sky lit up as ballistic missiles slammed into Boryspil airport outside Kyiv.

Russian forces crossed the border, from Crimea, Belarus and western Russia.

And then not exactly nothing, but nothing overwhelming.

The supposedly impressive 40-mile (60-kilometre) column of Russian troops arriving from Belarus stood still, going nowhere: more trucks than tanks.

Ukraine's venerable air defenses did a better-than-expected job of taking out Russian cruise missiles and fighter jets.

And, more importantly, Russian efforts to seize the bridgeheads north and south of Kyiv in the early days of the campaign failed.

Even in the south of the country, where Russian units have met less resistance, they still have to take the port of Mariupol, half an hour's drive from the border.

Russian attacks have no limits, Ukrainian denounces 0:26

Explaining the invasion, Putin argued that Ukraine would otherwise become a platform for the West to invade and destroy Russia.

He may have miscalculated the likely response to his attempt to swallow up a country that, in his dark rewriting of history, had no right to exist.

""In taking this extraordinary gamble, he appears not to have remembered the events that set in motion the end of the Russian empire,"" write Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage in Foreign Affairs.

""The last Russian tsar, Nicholas II, lost a war against Japan in 1905. He later fell victim to the Bolshevik revolution, losing not only his crown but also his life. The lesson: autocratic rulers cannot lose wars and remain autocrats "".

Perhaps lulled by the anemic Western response to the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Putin underestimated the galvanizing effect of his ""war of choice.""

NATO itself has rarely seemed so focused, a far cry from the criticism that characterized the alliance during Donald Trump's presidency.

Trucks full of anti-tank weapons have arrived at the Ukrainian border.

Before this invasion, while a series of international sanctions against Russia were being discussed, even the hawks could hardly dream of isolating Russian institutions from the international banking system, hunting down the assets of Russian oligarchs, ending or reducing imports of oil and gas Russians and suspend the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Everything has happened now.

Company after company, from McDonalds to Zara to Apple, has severed ties with the country, depriving Russians of the consumer goods they had come to love since the end of communism.

The ruble is worth less than half of what it was worth in mid-February.

Outmatched on the battlefield, the Kremlin has also taken a beating in the court of public opinion;

not that that has ever bothered Putin.

Zelensky, a comic actor turned president, has met the challenge with a terse challenge and direct demands for a no-fly zone.

OPINION | Russia has the tanks and the troops. Ukraine has Zelensky

While there was speculation about how Zelensky might be evacuated from Ukraine, he said he needed ammunition, not a ride.

He recorded an almost brazen video message from the Presidential Palace, saying that he would not hide.

Zelensky, and Ukraine's resilience in the face of overwhelming odds, has struck a chord around the world.

Football stadiums across Europe have been decked out in Ukrainian colours, the Eiffel Tower shining blue and yellow.

Zelensky's seemingly endless stream of video messages has drawn crowds to the streets of Prague and Tbilisi and prompted standing ovations in the British and European parliaments.

Instead, Putin has seemed isolated, criticizing his subordinates, recording incoherent speeches or surrounding himself with Aeroflot flight attendants.

The big question now is whether a furious Russian leader, despite claiming the ""operation"" is still on schedule, doubles down on the vast arsenal at his disposal: ballistic and cruise missiles, devastating rocket systems and thermobaric bombs.

Will he turn Kyiv into another Grozny, the Chechen capital razed to the ground during his first year in power?

CIA Director William Burns assessed Tuesday that Putin is ""determined to dominate and control Ukraine"" and predicted ""ugly weeks ahead"" with ""little regard for civilian casualties"" in the face of opposition from the Ukrainian people.

Thursday's talks in Turkey between the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine may give us the first clue as to whether there is an alternative to those ugly weeks.

The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine recognize Russian sovereignty in Crimea, annexed in 2014, the independence of two puppet republics in eastern Ukraine and the country's neutrality.

Ukraine has said no, though Zelensky now appears to acknowledge that Ukraine's dream of joining NATO, enshrined in its constitution, may be even more distant than before.

For its part, Moscow appears to have abandoned its demand for what it has called the denazification and demilitarization of Ukraine, its absurd phraseology for regime change.

Meanwhile, the daily suffering of Ukrainian civilians continues.

Some are killed in missile strikes that bring down apartment buildings, others are pinned down by those less accurate artillery strikes.

The number is already in the many hundreds, but there is no official figure.

Two million have fled the country in total, mostly women and children.

When they return, they will find cities like Kharkiv, Sumy, Mariupol and Chernihiv almost unrecognizable.

In the absence of any progress in the coming days, a much longer list will be inevitable.
