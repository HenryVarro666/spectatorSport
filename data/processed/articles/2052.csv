It's been more than two weeks since the Russian invasion began and conversations with my friends back home in Ukraine have become more precious than ever.

Several of them are resolutely staying in Kyiv, some have moved to Lviv, the western city now bursting at the seams with evacuees, and many are strewn around the countryside where it is deemed to be safer than in cities and towns.

My very best friend, Oksana, is in the capital and on day 17 of the invasion many things have changed.

In her building, only 20 out of 60 flats remain occupied and the concierge, who used to watch the lobby and open the front door, is now gone.

The residents have set up a rota to replace her, each day split into four-hour shifts.

Oksana and I chat while she is “on duty”.

I overhear one neighbour walking in and asking Oksana if she’d seen an elderly lady from the ninth floor recently, they are worried if she has enough food and will now go and check.

A few minutes later another neighbour appears, offering Oksana a chicken.

“I was in the shop,” she says, “there was chicken available, so I bought a few, do you want one?” Oksana politely refuses but suggests the neighbour offers it on the building’s WhatsApp group.

I ask Oksana about food.

There isn't a shortage per se, she says, but things have become random. Like you can sometimes buy a pineapple and crayfish but not always bread or milk.

A third neighbour stops by and talks about evacuation.

She had been hoping to get on a coach going abroad but it was cancelled.

She is philosophical about whether this was a good or a bad thing and wonders if it's better to stay home after all.

It seems that the Kyivites who remained in the city this long are now more determined than ever not to abandon it.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-60717902/page/13

It's not clear whether the explosions were Russian or Ukrainian strikes, she said.

Fighting is continuing on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, with the city's administration saying areas to the north remain the most dangerous, including the suburbs of Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, as well as the district of Vyshorod further north of Kyiv. Fighting has also escalated in Brovary, across the Dnieper River, east of the city.

As Russian forces press in from several directions, ""the worry becomes ... that the intention is to fully surround the city, to starve the city, to bombard the city and then ultimately to try to overthrow (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky's government,"" Ward said.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told CNN the city currently only has resources — including food and medical supplies — for one to two weeks.

CNN's Ward added that ""Ukrainian forces are everywhere"" in Kyiv. ""They have dug up defensive positions along all the main thoroughfares leading into the city, they've put tank traps around.

Mr Dass said: “The refugee situation is a lot worse than I had thought.

“They’re sleeping on the concrete floor of the train stations and bus shelters on the way and all sorts of things.

“In the train station, it’s like seeing hundreds and hundreds of homeless people not knowing what to do next.

“The ones here have not got anything to sleep on. They’ve just got a day pack and a change of clothes.

“They don’t want clothes, though. They want carry mats and sleeping bags.”

“It’s so much easier to prevent death from happening, and destruction from happening, than to later restore it and deal with all the trauma.”

She said there is still time to stop President Vladimir Putin “once and for all”, adding: “A year ago, eight years ago was the time to do this, but nobody wanted to get involved.

“This is the same as 1938 when also the world and the United States in particular were averting their eyes from what was being done by Hitler and his Nazi Party.

“And then they stepped in when the death toll was going up by the millions.

“And it’s going to be the same thing here as well, because there’s just so much that humanity can take,” she said.

According to The Guardian, Mr Macron said this further exacerbated circumstances for those fleeing the war.

He added: ""Despite all the grand statements... the British government continued to apply current rules that meant they did not welcome Ukrainian refugees who wanted to reach British soil saying they have to travel hundreds of kilometres in order to apply for a visa.

""I would hope that the Ukrainian men and women who have lived through horror and crossed Europe to reach their families on UK territory will be better treated.""

In response to Mr Macron's reported remarks, the Home Office pointed to previous comments from Home Secretary Priti Patel, which stated: ""We are now making the process quicker and simpler by removing the need to physically visit visa application centres for many of those who are making the perilous journey across Europe.""

Today, March 14, is the nineteenth day Russia's military attack on Ukraine continues. We're reporting about all the current news. The article will be constantly updated.

What is today?

Key points.

The Command of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine informs: During the past 24hrs, four planes, three helicopters, and an unmanned aerial vehicle of the occupiers were hit by the air defense forces of the state.

In one of the strategic directions in the Kyiv region, a group of enemy aircraft of the Su-35, Su-34, and Su-25 types tried to launch missile and bomb strikes on the defensive redoubts of Ukrainian defenders. And while the Air Force fighters were in a positional air confrontation with the overwhelming forces of the occupiers, the air defenses fired anti-aircraft missiles at enemy air targets. Three hits on enemy planes were previously recorded.

Anti-aircraft missile forces also report the destruction of three Russian helicopters and one UAV.

The air defense of the North Operational Command destroyed another plane of the occupiers in the morning!

Total combat losses of the enemy from 24.02 to 14.03:

personnel – more than 12,000 people;

tanks – 389;

armored combat vehicles – 1249;

artillery systems – 150;

MLRS – 64;

air defense means – 34;

aircraft – 77;

helicopters – 90;

automotive equipment – 617;

ships / boats – 3;

fuel tanks – 60;

UAV of operational and tactical level – 8.

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has started using the face recognition system of the American company Clearview AI, which has access to a database of 10 billion photos. 2 billion of them are from the VKontakte social media. The system will help identify Russian assailants, fight misinformation and identify the dead.

The enemies will not be able to eat at the expense of Ukraine in captivity. All Russian prisoners of war will either be exchanged for captured Ukrainians, or will serve their sentences in Ukraine and work to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure.

""We are going through the worst ordeal in our history, in our lives. We protect the most precious thing we have. We must hold on, we must fight. And we will win. I believe in that,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Today is Volunteer Fighter Day! Ukrainian volunteers are a symbol of heroism, patriotism, and courage. We will win! Glory to Ukraine!

Important! Rescuers once again ask not to spread the exact coordinates of the impact of Russian missiles immediately after the shelling and not to help the occupiers ""finish"" certain objects. This also applies to those in power. Being the first doesn't always mean being useful, says Svitlana Vodolaha, a spokeswoman for the State Emergency Service in Kyiv.

The UN Security Council is convening an extraordinary meeting on the activities of the OSCE Mission to Ukraine. Last week, the OSCE monitoring mission evacuated all its international members from Ukraine and suspended its activities since 2014.

What's in Russia?

The State Duma Committee on Defense wants to ban the entry of stars, entrepreneurs, and journalists who have left Russia.
