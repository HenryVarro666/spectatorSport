Just hours later, Russia claimed that it had destroyed Ukraine’s air bases and air defences, AFP reported. Ukraine, meanwhile, has alleged that it shot down five Russian planes and a helicopter.

In a televised address early Thursday, Putin announced military action in Donbad and urged Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms and return home. He said that the military action was being launched in response to threats coming from Ukraine, AP reported. He said Russia doesn’t intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to demilitarize it and bring those who committed crimes to justice. Putin also accused the US and NATO of ignoring Russia’s demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO.

As Russian military forces and Russian-backed separatists continued striking targets across Ukraine on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the public to remain calm while declaring martial law.

Missile strikes and military barrages struck Ukrainian targets from the country's northern, eastern and southern borders.

The strikes drew quick international condemnation of Russia, from capitals across Europe to Asia. The invasion also shook financial markets around the world; global oil and gold prices soared, U.S. stocks tumbled and indices across Asia recorded significant losses while European markets opened with a downward reaction.

Zelenskyy said in his morning public address that he had been in touch with U.S. President Biden following the Russian invasion, reported NPR's Tim Mak. ""We are strong,"" Zelenskyy said in his address, adding, ""Glory to Ukraine.""

Biden called Putin's actions an ""unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine"" and warned of ""a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.""

Biden is to make an address to the U.S. public on Thursday after a meeting with G-7 leaders.

The U.S., the EU and their allies are hitting Russia with sanctions in response to Putin's decision to recognize two Ukrainian territories as independent republics — and send troops there. Biden ordered new sanctions Wednesday on the Russian-owned company that is building the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline between Russia and Germany as well as its officers. The American president vowed more sanctions to punish Russia.

Likewise, EU leaders are considering additional sanctions against Russia. ""We will not let President Putin tear down Europe's security architecture,"" tweeted Ursula von Der Leyen, president of the European Commission. ""He should not underestimate the resolve and strength of our democracies. The European Union stands with Ukraine and its people. Ukraine will prevail.""

The violence began as the United Nations Security Council held an emergency session late Wednesday night in a bid to stave off an invasion of Ukraine. But even as diplomats implored Putin to pull back his military forces, strikes began across Ukraine.

NPR correspondents heard explosions in the capital Kyiv, in the eastern city of Kharkiv, close to the border with Russia, and in the port city of Odessa in the south of the country. Explosions also were heard on the outskirts of Kramatorsk, a town in the Donbas region controlled by Ukraine. As the strikes began, NPR's Frank Langfitt reported loud explosions booming over the southern port city of Odessa while jets roared overhead. Lines formed at gas stations and traffic began to head out of town.

A pair of families from the city of Kherson packed their SUVs hurriedly at a hotel and headed for the western city of Lviv near the Polish border. ""I'm scared. I'm scared for my baby,"" said a lawyer, who gave his name only as Constantine.

Putin said the goal of the operation was the ""demilitarization"" of Ukraine. He urged Ukrainian troops to lay down their weapons and warned outside countries to not interfere. In the run-up to the invasion, Zelenskyy said his country was prepared to defend itself.

""Only I and our army will know the clear steps regarding the defense of our state. And believe me, we are ready for anything,"" Zelenskyy said.

A salty exchange in the Security Council

In the emergency Security Council meeting requested by Ukraine, the second this week, diplomats condemned Russia's movement of troops to the Ukraine border and warned of the consequences of military action not just on the region, but on the rest of the world, as well.

As word of the Russian invasion reached the chamber, Ukranian ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told the other diplomats: ""It's too late, my dear colleagues, to speak about de-escalation. I call on every one of you to do everything possible to stop the war.""

Kyslytsya asked Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia to pledge that Russia not bomb Ukrainian cities even as they spoke.

""You have a smartphone. You can call,"" Kyslytsya angrily told his Russian counterpart.

""There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell,"" Kyslytsya told the Russian.

Cyberattacks precede invasion

On Wednesday, a ""large-scale"" denial-of-service attack, which can render a website unavailable, hit Ukraine's security agency, its legislature, its Foreign Affairs Ministry and other agencies, according to Ukraine's Centre for Strategic Communications.

Administrators switched to another provider to try to minimize the damage, the center said, adding that even if the sites were back online, users could face delays.

NetBlocks, a nonprofit that tracks network disruptions, said Ukraine's ministries of Defence and Internal Affairs were also targeted, along with civilian websites.

""PrivatBank, the largest commercial bank in Ukraine and Oschadbank, the State Savings Bank of Ukraine, have again also been knocked out along with the defence and ministerial websites,"" NetBlocks said in an update.

The apparent attacks come after a separate spate of attacks last week. The White House National Security Council said on Friday that it has proof that Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, was linked to those cyberattacks in Ukraine.

Ukraine says Russia has sent 300 units of military equipment over the border

This week, Russia recognized two Ukrainian territories, Donetsk and Luhansk, as breakaway republics and pledged to send troops over the border into those regions — the most serious signs at the time of a full-scale invasion.

""Since the beginning of the week, a total of 300 units of military equipment of the Russian Armed Forces have been spotted"" in the Ukrainian territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukraine's Defence Ministry said Wednesday, adding that in the previous 24 hours, 166 units of Russian military equipment were seen in ""the temporarily occupied territory.""

The equipment includes tanks, howitzers and amphibious armored combat vehicles, the ministry said.

As it reported those movements, the ministry said patrols from an international monitoring mission to Ukraine were also being blocked from seven towns in Luhansk and Donetsk, adding that the mission's drones were being obstructed via GPS signal interference.

Ukraine's president approves call for a national state of emergency

Ukraine moved to declare a national state of emergency. The move will clear the way for new measures to boost security and protect Ukraine's economy.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry is telling any Ukrainians who are in Russia to leave immediately, warning that it won't be able to offer help or consular services.

Also on Wednesday, the head of Ukraine's military signed a conscription order calling reservists between ages 18 and 60 to service that will extend up to one year.

For the emergency declaration to take effect, it will need to be approved by parliament. Zelenskyy and the National Security and Defense Council agreed to the step during a meeting on Wednesday.

The emergency measures could take a wide range of forms, Ukraine's security chief, Oleksiy Danilov, said in an announcement on the presidential website. New restrictions could be placed on transportation: Vehicles could face inspections, he said, and people could be required to show identification documents.

Putin says Russia's interests are an ""indisputable priority""

Putin said Wednesday that ""Russia's interests and the security of our people are an indisputable priority,"" after his country was hit with a raft of international sanctions over Russia's incursion into Ukraine.

Putin made the remarks in a video address to mark Defender of the Fatherland Day, speaking to veterans and members of Russia's military.

The Russian leader said his country faces challenges in the form of ""the erosion of the arms control system and NATO's military activities.""

Putin said Russia is open to finding diplomatic resolutions ""to the most complicated issues."" But that claim will likely be met with skepticism.

""I have confidence in you, Russian soldiers and officers,"" Putin said, ""that you will guard the peace of our people and stand up for the national interests of our great country.""

American sanctions will hurt America's own people, Russia's ambassador to the U.S. warns

Putin's government will not bow to sanctions, Russia's ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, said.

""I don't remember a single day when our country lived without any restrictions from the Western world,"" Antonov said Tuesday evening.

The diplomat also predicted that economic sanctions will harm energy and financial systems not just in Russia but worldwide, adding that ordinary U.S. citizens will see prices go up.

Russia is not a member of OPEC, but it has a great deal of influence over oil and gas prices, as one of the world's top producers and exporters of petroleum.

U.S. consumers are already dealing with months of inflation. More recently, gasoline and natural gas prices have risen in both the U.S. and Europe.

Try refreshing your browser, or Moose Jaw man in Odessa, Ukraine woken by overnight bombing Back to video Shortly after, he heard what he believes was a fighter jet, based on the sounds that often echo from 15 Wing, the Canadian Forces Base in Moose Jaw where he lives. The explosions, he said, reminded him of the sound train cars make when they’re slammed together too hard at the CP rail yard. A writer for the Moose Jaw Independent, he got out of bed right away, did a little bit of research, reached out to some journalism contacts in Odessa and then wrote a headline the world has been preparing for but hoped would never be needed: “War Breaks Out In Ukraine.” “I have friends here and I told them don’t worry, I won’t let you down,” Thomas said in a phone interview Thursday morning. “I was here in 2014 when all the troubles happened then. I rode it out with the same people then. I said look guys, I’m not leaving.” jpg The explosions he heard were “precision-bombing” of a naval base and airport some two kilometres away, he said. So far, the city itself has been untouched, but he said German media is predicting Odessa would be in Russian hands by that night. Residents are being asked not to go out past dusk. In Odessa since Feb. 1, he said the mood in the port city on Thursday was drastically different than the days leading up to the attacks. People are panic buying and long lines have formed outside banks and at gas stations. At 6:30 a.m. he headed to the grocery store where baskets typically only filled with enough to feed families for two to three days at a time had been replaced with overflowing baskets and grocery carts. Shelves of bottled water were already half empty. Electronic payment systems down, Thomas said cash is king, but also harder to get. Getting money exchanged Thursday, he said he had to show his passport and there was a cap on how much he could trade, both things he hadn’t been required to do the day before.

Article content “They looked more worried and they were pretty quiet,” Thomas said. “Usually you get in the rows in a Ukrainian grocery store and they’ll bump into you and stuff. This morning they were bumping pretty hard because they were grabbing what they could.” jpg In Odessa for business and pleasure, he said he was supposed to do an interview about Operation UNIFIER — the Canadian Armed Forces mission to support the Security Forces of Ukraine — but they left the day he arrived. He said he knows Canadians have been advised to leave, but plans to stick it out. His return ticket is dated March 23. With friends throughout the country, Thomas said he has already given a few hundred dollars to some that live on the border of the breakaway republics — the self-proclaimed southeastern breakaway states of Donetsk and Luhansk known collectively as Donbas. They got bombed, he said, and had nothing so he sent money for them to buy food and gas. The last message he got from a friend in Kharkiv said apartment buildings were being shelled there. While he says he’s not scared for himself, he fears for the fate of his friends. “Leading up to this, people were laughing about it. They said, ‘We’ve heard this before, since 2014, how many times? It never happened,’ ” Thomas said. “So people weren’t stocking up. Myself, I was stocking up slowly everyday.” Despite the panic and the presence of fire truck and ambulance sirens throughout the day, he said the city is still relatively quiet. Transit buses continue to run, people are walking their dogs and going to work. The government is telling residents to stay calm and stay in place. A list with the locations of the city’s bomb shelters is being circulated.

Article content “Please pray for peace for both sides. Stop the fighting. Right now they say there’s dozens of people killed. Let’s have it so maybe we don’t have it hundreds and thousands of people killed,” Thomas said. “The people who are going to pay the price for this are just ordinary people.” Terry Kuzyk, president of the Regina branch of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, said people with in the city with family in Ukraine are feeling sadness and anger over the invasion, but also fear over the uncertainty of what will happen next. Kuzyk said people are wondering whether Vladimir Putin will stop at taking over territories in eastern Ukraine, or push things further. “Who would have thought in today’s day and age that we would see something like this. This is an eye opener for a lot of people who think their freedoms are being taken away, because this is what it looks like,” said Kuzyk. A vigil will be held on Friday at 6:30 p.m. at St. Basil’s Ukrainian Catholic Church at 1747 Toronto St. Russia launched a barrage of missile, artillery and air attacks on Ukraine early Thursday, triggering the worst security crisis Europe has witnessed in decades. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry warned that the capital, Kyiv, was being targeted and urged citizens to go to shelters. Ukraine’s border guard said that it was being shelled from five regions, including from Crimea in the south and Belarus to the north, and that Russian forces had crossed into the country. — with files from the National Post, Mark Melnychuk jackerman@postmedia.com The news seems to be flying at us faster all the time.
