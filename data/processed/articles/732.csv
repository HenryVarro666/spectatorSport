Russia’s defence ministry says it attacked Ukraine with cruise missiles from ships in the Black and Caspian Seas, and with hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace.

Russian defence ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said on Sunday that the Kinzhal (Dagger) hypersonic missile hit a Ukrainian fuel depot in Kostiantynivka near the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv.

He added: “Kalibr cruise missiles were launched from the waters of the Black Sea against the Nizhyn plant that repairs Ukrainian armoured vehicles damaged in fighting.”

The attacks marked the second day in a row that Russia used the Kinzhal, a weapon capable of striking targets 2,000km (1,250 miles) away at 10 times the speed of sound.

Konashenkov added that another attack by air-launched missiles hit a facility in Ovruch in the northern Zhytomyr region where foreign fighters and Ukrainian special forces were based.

The previous day, the Russian military said the Kinzhal had been used for the first time in combat to destroy an ammunition depot in Diliatyn in the Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine.

‘Kamikaze drones’

Russia prides itself on its advanced weaponry, and President Vladimir Putin said in December that Russia was the global leader in hypersonic missiles, whose speed, manoeuvrability and altitude make them difficult to track and intercept.

The Kinzhal missiles are part of an array of weapons unveiled in 2018. Russia first used the hypersonic missile during its military campaign in Syria in 2016.

Putin has called the Kinzhal missile “an ideal weapon” given its speed and ability to overcome air-defence systems.

“This is a missile capable of carrying nuclear warheads and is believed to be undetectable by western air defence systems,” said Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, speaking from Moscow. “It is being called an unstoppable ballistic missile.”

Putin announced an array of new hypersonic weapons in 2018 in one of his most bellicose speeches in years, saying they could hit almost any point in the world and evade a US-built missile shield.

The following year, he threatened to deploy hypersonic missiles on ships and submarines that could lurk outside US territorial waters if Washington moved to deploy intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe.

The US has actively pursued the development of hypersonic weapons – manoeuvering weapons that fly at speeds of at least Mach 5 – as a part of its conventional Prompt Global Strike programme since the early 2000s, according to a new congressional report.

These weapons could enable “responsive, long-range, strike options against distant, defended, and/or time-critical threats [such as road-mobile missiles] when other forces are unavailable, denied access, or not preferred”, said former Commander of US Strategic Command General John Hyten.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/20/russia-says-it-used-hypersonic-missiles-in-ukraine-for-second-day

The city has been a site of intense fighting in recent weeks. (Alexey Kudenko/Sputnik/AP)

The south eastern city of Mariupol has been under siege for several weeks, with residents facing a constant barrage of deadly unprovoked Russian attacks. These have included deadly strikes on a maternity ward and the bombing of a theater, the losses from which are still unknown as the rescue operation continues.

Here's what we know about the situation in the besieged city:

Taken against their will: Residents of Mariupol are being taken to Russia against their will by Russian forces, the Mariupol City Council said Saturday. Captured Mariupol residents were forcibly taken to camps where Russian forces checked their phones and documents, then redirected some of the residents to remote cities in Russia, the council said.

Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko compared Russia's actions to ""horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people.""

Constant bombardment: A Ukrainian army commander told CNN people in Mariupol risk their lives each time they emerge from underground bunkers, and claimed the strategic port is facing the most intense fighting anywhere in the country. Major Denis Prokopenko, from the National Guard Azov Regiment, said air and land attacks on the city were now almost relentless.

Bodies in the street: Prokopenko said people in the city were reluctant to leave their underground shelters even to get hold of essentials, meaning they were trying to drink less water and eat less food, only emerging to prepare hot meals. Basic services like gas, electricity and water, are all out in the city. Bodies are being left in the street because there is either no one left to collect them, or it is simply too dangerous to try.

Theater attack: A new satellite image shows the Mariupol theater, which was bombed several days ago, almost completely destroyed, with just the western façade still standing. Still clearly visible in the photo is the Russian word for ""children"" painted by sheltering residents in large letters on the ground in front of the entrance. Hundreds of Ukrainians, including many children, were taking shelter inside the theater when it was attacked. Communications in the besieged city have been difficult for days and rescue work has been hampered by the danger of near-continuous shelling, according to reports from inside the city.

Zelensky: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the sustained Russian attack on Mariupol is an ""act of terror"" that will be ""remembered for centuries."" In a video message posted to Facebook early Sunday, the Ukrainian President said Mariupol will go down in history as an example of war crimes.

Steel plant: There are conflicting reports over the status of one of Ukraine’s key industrial facilities – the Azov Steel plant in Mariupol. Late Friday, a government advisor reported the plant was in Russian hands after ongoing battles with Ukrainian troops. But in an update Saturday, the Azov battalion, which has a large presence in Mariupol, said the plant remained in their hands.

The Russian defence ministry claimed to have used high-precision missiles to hit a weapons depot belonging to the Ukrainian army in Deliatyn, a village in south-western Ukraine only 100km from the border with Romania.

Moscow said the strike on Saturday was Russia’s first use of the Kinzhal, or Dagger, ballistic missile in their war on Ukraine. The missile was likely launched from the air from an MiG-31 warplane.

On Sunday, Russian defence ministry spokesperson said that the military had carried out a number of further strikes on Ukrainian targets.

Major General Igor Konashenkov said that a Kinzhal hypersonic missile hit a Ukrainian fuel depot in Kostiantynivka, near the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv.

The strike would mark the second day in a row that Russia had used the weapon, which is capable of travelling at 10 times the speed of sound.

Mr Konashenkov said that Kalibr cruise missiles had been launched by Russian warships stationed in the Caspain Sea on a fuel depot in Kostiantynivka. Further missiles were also launched from the Black Sea.

“Kalibr cruise missiles were launched from the waters of the Black Sea against the Nizhyn plant that repairs Ukrainian armoured vehicles damaged in fighting,” Mr Konashenkov said.

The Russian defence ministry also said that their military had launched hypersonic missiles from Crimean airspace.

The office of Ukrainian president Zelensky added on Sunday that there could be a risk of an attack on western Ukraine being launched from inside Belarus.

Officials said that the attack could be launched on Ukraine’s Volyn region, the country’s most northwestern province, but they did not clarify whether they thought it would be launched by Russian or Belarusian troops.

On Monday, after intense fighting, Ukrainian forces regained control of Makariv, a town west of Kyiv that had been battered by Russian airstrikes.

It’s tempting to view this small victory for Ukrainian forces as a shift of momentum in the battle for Kyiv: In better times, this suburb would be only an hour’s drive to Khreshchatyk, the capital’s central boulevard.

Kyiv once appeared to be the primary objective of what the Kremlin must have envisioned as a swift regime-change operation. The capital has been rocked by explosions in recent days, but it is far from encircled.

On the Azov Sea, the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol — despite being surrounded and mercilessly pummeled, block by block, by Russian firepower — still eludes Russian control. Its defenders rejected an ultimatum to surrender by Monday morning, thwarting a Russian effort to finalize a land bridge linking Crimea with the separatist republics of the eastern Donbas region.

Nearly a month after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian military has perceptibly shifted its messaging. The Russian military’s advances have been stymied, the Ukrainians say, forcing a shift in Russian tactics.

“Due to the lack of success of the ground phase of the operation, the enemy continues to actively launch missile and bomb strikes on important military and civilian infrastructure using operational and tactical aircraft, high-precision missile weapons and indiscriminate munitions,” the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a statement Tuesday.

There’s plenty of evidence to suggest that the Russians are taking more of a standoff approach, launching salvos of missiles from outside of Ukrainian airspace.

In a statement released Sunday, Russia’s defense ministry said warships in the Caspian sea launched Kalibr cruise missiles and aircraft launched Kinzhal hypersonic missile systems from the airspace over Crimea. Those missiles targeted what the Russians described as a large storage base for fuels and lubricants of the Ukrainian military near the settlement of Kostyantynivka, in the southern Mykolaiv region.

Separately, the Russian military said Kalibr cruise missiles were fired from the Black Sea, targeting a workshop for the repair of Ukrainian armored vehicles. Russian precision missiles also targeted what Russia described as a Ukrainian military training center near the settlement of Ovruch, in the northern Zhytomyr region.

There is an element of PR to such costly displays of firepower: Russia is keen to export a version of the Kalibr and it has touted the Kinzhal as being able to elude missile-defense systems.

The UK defense ministry, for one, was dismissive of Russian claims about the Kinzhal’s combat debut, saying its use was “highly likely intended to detract from a lack of progress in Russia’s ground campaign. Deployment of Kinzhal is highly unlikely to materially affect the outcome of Russia’s campaign in Ukraine.”

Such assessments, however, give little solace to anyone on the receiving end of Russian firepower. Dozens were killed Friday in a missile strike on a barracks housing soldiers in Mykolaiv, and Russian long-distance strikes have struck areas far away from the front lines: At least 35 people were killed in strikes on March 13 against the Yavoriv military training ground in the Lviv region of western Ukraine, not far from the Polish border. More than 30 missiles fired from warplanes over the Black and Azov seas hit the base.

Still, Russia has thus far not captured any major Ukrainian city in the offensive: neither Kharkiv in the northeast, nor Odesa in the southwest. Even Sumy and Chernihiv in the north, both of which are just across the border from major military staging areas inside Russia, remain under Ukrainian control. And in Kherson, a medium-sized city in the south under Russian control, Russian forces have faced another protracted problem: Angry locals who gather daily in the central square to tell Russian troops go home. One of those rallies ended Monday with one man seriously injured after Russian troops used gunfire and apparent stun grenades to disperse the crowd.

Military analysts worry about another consequence of this emerging phase of the war: As Russian ground forces become bogged down and make little new progress, their leaders resort more to the indiscriminate and punitive use of firepower against Ukrainian cities.

A March 19 assessment by the Institute for the Study of War gave precisely that grim prognosis.

“If the war in Ukraine settles into a stalemate condition, Russian forces will continue to bomb and bombard Ukrainian cities, devastating them and killing civilians, even as Ukrainian forces impose losses on Russian attackers and conduct counter-attacks of their own,” the assessment read.

“The Russians could hope to break Ukrainians’ will to continue fighting under such circumstances by demonstrating Kyiv’s inability to expel Russian forces or stop their attacks even if the Russians are demonstrably unable to take Ukraine’s cities. Ukraine’s defeat of the initial Russian campaign may therefore set conditions for a devastating protraction of the conflict and a dangerous new period testing the resolve of Ukraine and the West.”

Adding to that gloomy forecast, Ukrainian officials have begun warning of a potential new front in the war, with the country’s General Staff saying Sunday the threat of an offensive from Belarus in the direction of northwestern Ukraine was “high,” without giving further specifics.

Ukraine’s northwestern Volyn region borders Belarus to the north and Poland, a NATO ally, to the west. It could — theoretically — serve as a gateway for attacking forces from the north to approach Lviv, a strategic city in western Ukraine that is a hub for both government logistics and relief efforts, as well as a transit point for many civilians looking to flee fighting in other parts of the country.

Russia has already used Belarusian territory as a launching pad for its invasion, with Russian forces staging an offensive push toward Kyiv and central Ukraine from southern Belarus.

It’s unclear if Belarus would actively join the war. But the Ukrainian General Staff is already warning that Russia is now looking to bring in reserve forces to the borders of Ukraine.

If true, that speaks volumes. It attests to the high cost the Russian military has already paid in terms of lives — even though the Kremlin has not disclosed casualty totals since March 2. And it speaks to the political will of one person — Russian President Vladimir Putin — to continue expending blood and treasure in Ukraine.",https://theatlantavoice.com/ukraine-has-denied-russia-a-victory-for-four-weeks-a-grim-new-phase-could-be-coming/

FIRST BY NATSEC DAILY –– The leading theory for why Russia launched hypersonic missiles into Ukraine last week is it’s running out of precision-guided weapons to strike faraway targets, a senior U.S. defense official and Western official with assessments told NatSec Daily.

President JOE BIDEN confirmed Russia’s use of the weapons Monday, stating the Russian military launched them “because it’s the only thing that they can get through with absolute certainty.” But to date the best explanation Western governments have is that Moscow’s stockpile is quickly dwindling after launching more than 1,100 missiles into Ukraine since Feb. 24, leaving it with fewer weapons to reliably hit positions.

“We think that could be one reason,” a senior U.S. defense official told NatSec Daily. “They’re running out of material,” the Western official said. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive development.

Speaking Sunday on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” news show, Secretary of Defense LLOYD AUSTIN said Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN reached for the hypersonic missiles to gain momentum in his bumbling invasion. But he also hinted at another potential reason: A lack of available weaponry. “You kind of question why he would do this. Is he running low on precision-guided munitions?” Austin told anchor MARGARET BRENNAN.

As allies share information about the Russian attack — including where, precisely, the missiles hit — the answer to Austin’s hypothetical question appears to be “yes.”

“It’s really a significant sign of weakness,” the Western official said. “You only fire this thing if you’re desperate.”

The expectation is that Russia won’t launch many hypersonic missiles in the near term since they don’t have a lot of them. Instead, Moscow will likely drop more “dumb” bombs in the weeks ahead — almost certainly leading to more civilian casualties around Ukraine.

There are other theories the two people noted, namely Russia seeking leverage at the negotiating table with Ukraine, the Kremlin messaging to the West not to interfere any further and, as Biden suggested, growing frustrations with the success of Ukraine’s air and missile defenses.

“As all things with Russia, they could be signaling all of this even if the main reason they used the hypersonic weapon was because they had little else to shoot,” the Western official said.

For Kyiv, this news could bolster belief that Russia truly is struggling to win the war it launched — and further still, in some analysts' minds, that Ukraine is on the road to victory. To ensure that outcome, the U.S. and its allies will continue to supply Ukraine with advanced weapons.

SITUATION REPORT: We will only cite official sources. As always, take all figures, assessments and statements with a healthy dose of skepticism.

War in Ukraine:

— Since the war began on Feb. 24, Russia has lost around 15,300 personnel, 509 tanks, 1,556 armored combat vehicles, 252 artillery systems, 80 multiple-launch rocket systems, 99 warplanes, 123 helicopters, 1,000 vehicles, three ships and 35 drones. (Ukrainian Ministry of Defense)

— The U.S. believes Russia’s casualty count is in the thousands (White House)

— “Despite heavy fighting, Ukrainian forces continue to repulse Russian attempts to occupy the southern city of Mariupol. Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine have endured yet another day of limited progress with most forces largely stalled in place. Several Ukrainian cities continue to suffer heavy Russian air and artillery bombardment with the UN reporting that more than 10 million Ukrainians are now internally displaced as a result of Russia’s invasion.” (U.K. Ministry of Defense)

— “The Russian occupation forces operating in Ukraine have stockpiles of ammunition and food for no more than three days. The situation is similar with fuel, which is replenished by tank trucks. The occupiers were unable to organize a pipeline to meet the needs of the grouping of troops.” (Ukrainian Ministry of Defense)

— There are indications that Ukrainians are “able and willing” to “take back” areas captured by Russians. (Senior U.S. defense official)

Global Response:

— U.S.: The U.S. will impose further sanctions on Russia and will be rolled out in conjunction with European allies on Thursday, national security adviser JAKE SULLIVAN told reporters.

— Italy: Italian Prime Minister MARIO DRAGHI endorsed Ukraine’s bid to join the European Union. “Italy wants Ukraine to join the EU,” he said following Ukrainian President VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY’s address to Italy’s parliament. “I want to tell President Zelenskyy that Italy stands alongside Ukraine in this process.”

— E.U.: Per a draft document seen by Agence France-Presse, the European Union plans to establish a “trust fund” to help Ukraine rebuild after the war. The document didn’t contain details about how much money would be in the pot or how the fund would work.

NAVALNY CONVICTED ON NEW CHARGES: Jailed Kremlin critic ALEXEI NAVALNY has been found guilty of additional embezzlement charges, as well as a charge of contempt of court, following a criminal trial in a Russian prison colony outside Moscow, per AFP.

Navalny’s allies have attacked the Kremlin for conducting his latest trial inside the faraway IK-2 penal colony in Vladimir, where he is already serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence at the prison for a separate embezzlement charge.

But Navalny’s new conviction will lengthen that term of imprisonment by nine years. The prosecutor has called for him to serve 13 years behind bars, to be transferred to a “strict regime” penal colony and to pay a fine of 1.2 million rubles.

DOD WORKING WITH INDUSTRY TO PRODUCE JAVELINS AND STINGERS: “The Pentagon is rushing to replace thousands of U.S.-made Javelin and Stinger missiles pulled from European and American stockpiles for use in Ukraine. But the multibillion-dollar effort is still waiting on the military and defense industry to figure out how to ramp up production quickly,” our LEE HUDSON, PAUL McLEARY and CONNOR O’BRIEN reported.

There appear to be two main hurdles to hurry up the resupply. “First, the hundreds of small suppliers that form the backbone of the industrial base are working to locate the required components to build new missiles, including rare earth materials and electrical components that can be difficult to source quickly,” they wrote. “Second, companies are also waiting to ensure funding is locked in before investing in increasing production capacity, over worries that investments in raw materials and manufacturing capability won’t be paid for.”

How the Pentagon and industry work this out matters, of course, as Javelins and Stingers have proven wildly effective on the battlefield for Ukraine.



USS TRUMAN IN THE IONIAN: Our HANNAH ROBERTS was on USS Harry S. Truman as the U.S. Navy patrolled the Ionian to make its presence felt during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“Accustomed to the Pacific Ocean and the seas of the Middle East, the USS Truman’s strike group are now in the northern Ionian Sea, its fighter jets and radar planes patrolling NATO’s eastern borders and looking east, to a Ukraine now under invasion from Russian armed forces,” Roberts wrote. “Since the invasion almost a month ago, these jets have flown more than 75 patrol missions across NATO’s eastern flank up to the Ukraine border, from the Truman. The so-called Enhanced Air Policing mission is part of NATO’s Assurance Measures introduced in 2014, after Russia’s illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula, and is aimed at defending NATO airspace, preventing incursions by Russians.”

“There are numerous Russian ships and subs in the Mediterranean today and that’s why it’s important for NATO to have an equal presence, to deter them,” Navy Secretary CARLOS DEL TORO told POLITICO, adding: “The only thing Putin understands is strength.”

There is still no sign the U.S. or NATO plan to send troops into Ukraine. The mission is both for training with allies and sending a political message to Russia: We’re here, watching, and resolved to step up if you cross the line.

PAKISTAN’S PM FACES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE: IMRAN KHAN, the cricket star-turned Pakistan’s leader, is facing a no-confidence vote organized by political opponents and without the backing of the country’s powerful military.

“Pakistan has been buffeted by double-digit inflation, leading to widespread dissatisfaction and fueling criticism that he has mismanaged the economy,” The New York Times’ SALMAN MASOOD reported. “In addition, he has lost the backing of the military, seemingly over his effort to place a loyal aide and former spy chief, Lt. Gen. FAIZ HAMID, in charge of the army over the objections of the top brass.”

Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country, has drifted further from the U.S. and moved closer to Russia and China with Khan in charge. His government is also friendly with the Taliban-led administration in Afghanistan. The worry is that Khan will rally millions to his cause, potentially leading to broad-scale violence as the vote next week likely will oust the prime minister from power.

“Three major allied political parties that are part of the governing coalition have now indicated that they could side with the opposition in the parliamentary vote. That would be enough to topple Mr. Khan’s government,” Masood wrote, which would continue Pakistan’s streak of not allowing a political leader to finish their time in charge.

“Khan’s rise and potential demise is reflective of the capriciousness of Pakistani politics and weak democratic institutions. If he loses the no-confidence vote, he will join the ranks of all past Pakistani prime ministers, none of whom have been able to complete a five year term,” SAMEER LALWANI, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, told NatSec Daily. ""Any political volatility is concerning in a state with nuclear weapons, but it’s certainly not surprising. American foreign policy is not indifferent but it has weathered Pakistan’s fratricidal civilian politics for decades, and this time it is far less dependent on Pakistan than it has been since 2001.”

“It has spurred the biggest price shock in decades and choked imports of basic commodities, triggering shortages especially tough for poorer nations that were already far behind in their economic recovery from the pandemic,” per The Wall Street Journal’s SAEED SHAH, NAZIH OSSEIRAN and NICHOLAS BARIYO. “In Kenya, bread prices recently jumped by 40% in some areas. In Indonesia, the government has imposed price controls on cooking oil. In Brazil, the state-owned energy-giant Petrobras said earlier this month it couldn’t hold off inflationary pressures and raised gasoline prices to distributors by 19%.”

They also wrote of a Beirut bakery that has survived 120 years, doing business despite civil war, the pandemic and Lebanon’s decadeslong financial problems. But with flour selling on the black market at 1000 percent higher than normal, ZOUHAIR KHAFIYEH may have to shutter his doors within a month.

“We cannot continue like this,” he told WSJ.

RUSSIA DENIES CYBERATTACK COMING: DMITRY PESKOV, Putin’s spokesperson, asserted Russia isn’t preparing to launch cyber attacks against the West — even after the Biden administration openly warned about that possibility.

""The Russian Federation, unlike many Western countries, including the United States, does not engage in state-level banditry,"" Peskov told reporters Tuesday.

The denial follows Biden’s Monday statement that cyberattacks were “coming,” asking companies to harden their defenses against the strikes. JOHN KIRBY, the Pentagon spokesperson, told MSNBC on Tuesday that ""We haven't seen anything affect our infrastructure or critical U.S government infrastructure … We wanted to make sure that leaders knew and were aware that the Russians would probably try this kind of tactic going forward.""

Experts are surprised Ukrainian and other Western targets remain unharmed in cyberspace, even more than three weeks into the war. The expectation, though, is that cyberattacks will come in due time, despite the Kremlin’s denials. After all, Russia insisted it had no plans to invade Ukraine and, well…



The Complex

'DAY ONE': Biden's pick to lead Pentagon acquisition efforts told senators that speeding up efforts to get weapons and equipment to Ukraine — and replace diminished inventories of that hardware — will be at the top of his to-do list, O'Brien wrote in.

""If confirmed, one of my first things to do on day one [would be to] accelerate all equipment and capabilities to both the Ukrainians, as we agreed to, and also helping our NATO partners and replenish our stockpiles,"" WILLIAM LaPLANTE told the Senate Armed Services Committee during a confirmation hearing.

Lawmakers provided the Pentagon with billions of dollars to replenish stocks of weapons — including thousands of Javelin and Stinger missiles — the U.S. and European allies have shipped to Ukraine. There's also bipartisan concern in Congress over whether the Pentagon and industry can replace those munitions quickly, and LaPlante told senators the Pentagon needs ""multiple hot production lines"" for munitions, drones and other key programs.



AIRCRAFT CARRIER LOBBYISTS HIT THE HILL: Our friends at Morning Defense (for Pros!) report that the Aircraft Carrier Industrial Base Coalition is walking around Capitol Hill today and tomorrow for its annual push for funding.

The group has scheduled more than 170 meetings over the next two days — in person and virtually. More than 300 people have registered so far.

The Navy last year proposed retiring the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman early rather than pay for its midlife maintenance overhaul, but Congress blocked it. The coalition not only wants to head off any new attempts to retire carriers early, but will also argue that funding advance materials on future ships can save money, RICK GIANNINI, coalition chair and president — who is also CEO of Milwaukee Valve Company — told our own LEE HUDSON.

Giannini said congressional funding for the future carriers Enterprise and Doris Miller shielded most of the industry’s nearly 2,000 businesses in 45 states, but some suppliers were hit by the global supply chain crisis. The spread of Covid-19 also hurt workforce retention, but the Navy has started programs in Virginia and Pennsylvania to accelerate trade school training for shipyard workers from two years to four months.



On the Hill

LAWMAKERS WANT WAR CRIMES INTEL DECLASSIFIED: All 23 members of the House Intelligence Committee signed a letter that was sent this week to Director of National Intelligence AVRIL HAINES, demanding that the U.S. intelligence community “work diligently to declassify information related to Russia’s planned or actual war crimes or other atrocities” in Ukraine, reports our own NAHAL TOOSI.

“Doing so might deter Russia from continuing down this path or further demonstrate to the world Russia’s callous disregard for the lives of civilians, and the indiscriminate assault that has killed thousands of Ukrainians, and displaced millions more,” the lawmakers wrote.

The letter to Haines comes amid growing global concern about Russia’s attacks on civilians in Ukraine, as well as Moscow’s veiled warnings about using chemical and biological weapons. Biden last week called Putin a “war criminal,” and observers worry Putin will continue to violate traditional rules of war to make progress in his invasion.

SENATE STUCK ON RUSSIA BILLS: Senate Democratic leaders want to quickly approve a bill this week revoking normal trade relations with Russia, but the chamber’s Republicans are demanding the legislation be paired with a separate House-passed measure banning Russian oil imports, per our own ANDREW DESIDERIO and BURGESS EVERETT.

Sen. MIKE CRAPO (R-Idaho), the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said both sides “are negotiating, and my hope is that we will merge the two House bills” — both the trade and oil sanctions packages. “The House voted for both bills with over 400 votes. And that kind of bipartisan agreement is still in existence over here on both bills,” he said.

Crapo indicated that Republicans want to take a harder line than Biden’s executive action banning Russian oil imports, and he vowed that he would try to amend any effort from Democrats to move the trade bill on its own. “The [trade] issue needs to be something that’s part of the economic pressure that we build” on Russia, added Senate Minority Whip JOHN THUNE (R-S.D.).

YACHTS FOR UKRAINE: A new bipartisan House bill would send seized Russian asserts to Ukraine for rebuilding purposes.

The Yachts for Ukraine Act — led by Reps. SETH MOULTON (D-Mass.), MIKE GALLAGHER (R-Wis.), JAKE AUCHINCLOSS (D-Mass.) and PETER MEIJER (R-Mich.) — would permanently turn the yachts into humanitarian assistance and reconstruction efforts for Ukraine.

“Now these oligarchs will know that the U.S. will do everything in its power to seize their assets for good — and finally put them to good use, rebuilding the country their acquiescence has helped destroy,” Moulton said in a statement. “The cost of this humanitarian crisis should be paid for by Putin and the cronies who have supported him, and converting proceeds from their seized assets to help Ukraine is an obvious way to punish these thugs and increase aid for Ukrainians,” Gallagher added.

Western authorities have seized dozens of vessels collectively worth billions, including the $578 million sailing megayacht — the world’s largest of its kind — belonging to Russian industrialist ANDREY MELNICHENKO.



Broadsides

TOOMEY: IMPOSE SECONDARY SANCTIONS: Sen. PATRICK TOOMEY (R-Penn.), the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Biden-led sanctions “have been economically damaging to Russia, but not crippling.”

He argues the American ban on Russian oil imports barely register in Moscow since the U.S. doesn’t take in that much. To hit the Kremlin where it hurts, Toomey suggests “the administration and Congress should impose secondary sanctions on the entirety of Russia’s financial sector. These penalties would effectively prohibit foreign banks anywhere in the world, under the threat of U.S. sanctions, from making payments to Russian banks, including for oil and gas. They would force the world to make a choice: Do business with the U.S. or do business with Russia. But you can’t do both.”

Imposing secondary sanctions would compel China from doing business with Russia, thus cutting off Moscow’s biggest lifeline. Separately, Toomey wants Europe to be weaned off its dependence on Russian energy and the U.S. to do more to be energy independent.

To do that, he recommends the administration reverse “its disastrous anti-fossil-fuel policies: restart the Keystone XL pipeline, expedite approvals of natural gas pipelines and LNG facilities approvals, and repeal its broad and punitive regulations and restrictions on U.S. oil and gas production.”

Our own AMERICA HERNANDEZ has a good piece on why oil sanctions hurt Putin.

On Saturday, Russia said it had used the Kinzhal hypersonic missile

Russia said on Sunday it has again fired its newest Kinzhal hypersonic missiles in Ukraine, destroying a fuel storage site in the country’s south.

The Russian defence ministry also said it killed more than 100 members of Ukrainian special forces and “foreign mercenaries” when it targeted a training centre in the town of Ovruch in northern Ukraine with sea-based missiles.

“Kinzhal aviation missile systems with hypersonic ballistic missiles destroyed a large storage site for fuels and lubricants of the Ukrainian armed forces near the settlement of Kostyantynivka in the Mykolaiv region,” the defence ministry said.

The ministry said the base had been used for the main supplies of fuel for Ukrainian armoured vehicles in the country’s south.

The Kinzhal (Dagger) hypersonic missiles were fired from airspace over Russian-controlled Crimea, the ministry said, adding that Kalibr cruise missiles launched from the Caspian Sea had also targeted the depot.

On Saturday, Russia said it had used the Kinzhal hypersonic missiles to destroy an underground missile and ammunition storage site in western Ukraine close to the border with NATO member Romania.

The Ukrainian armed forces confirmed to AFP on Saturday that the depot had been targeted but said they had “no information of the type of missile.”

Russian analysts said the use Friday of the Kinzhal hypersonic missiles in Deliatyn, a village in the foothills of the Carpathian mountains, was the first combat use of such weapons in the world.

The Russian defence ministry said that it also used long-range precision weapons against other facilities in Ukraine on Saturday evening and early Sunday.

Russian forces fired the Kalibr missiles from the Black Sea to target a plant in the northern city of Nizhyn used to repair armoured vehicles, the ministry said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russia-says-has-again-fired-hypersonic-missiles-in-ukraine/article65243039.ece

Meanwhile, Ukraine sees a high risk of an attack on western Ukraine’s Volyn region being launched from Belarus, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office said on Sunday, citing the military.

The Russian invasion has mostly focused on northern, southern and eastern areas of Ukraine, though missiles also hit the Yavoriv military base last week, close to the Polish border.

It was not immediately clear whether Ukraine saw the threat of an attack on Volyn from Russian forces or the Belarusian military, which has so far not publicly committed troops to supporting Russia.",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russia-strikes-ukraine-with-cruise-missiles-from-black-sea-and-caspian-sea
