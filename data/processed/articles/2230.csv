KYIV, Ukraine — As sirens blared in the streets of Kyiv, signaling that residents should head to underground bunkers, Washington Post journalists headed to their hotel’s basement where staff and their families were also sheltering. There, hotel workers served up heaping plates of spaghetti bolognese and Greek salad — a welcome surprise considering the restaurant is closed and supplies are dwindling.

With a shortage of plates, some guests shared, and others took turns waiting for plates or silverware to be washed. One man handed out pieces of carpet for guests to put over the cold tile floor. The elderly and children have been given priority for seating. Afterward, a jovial hotel staffer walked around mopping up spilled sauce and lettuce.

The shared sense of camaraderie in the basement bunker was a glimmer of light in an otherwise dark time.

""This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a late-night video message Friday. ""This night we have to stand ground. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.""

Earlier Saturday, videos from eyewitnesses showed explosions taking place in an area north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There is a military base in the area.

CNN teams in the capital also reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city Saturday. Shortly afterward, Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications said clashes are underway in an eastern suburb as well -- as Russian forces close in on the capital from multiple sides.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces reported heavy fighting around the city of Vasylkiv, some 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv.

""Heavy fighting is currently underway in the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, where the occupiers are trying to land a landing party,"" the armed forces said.

Russian forces are close to Kyiv, Zelensky confirmed in his message Friday, advancing on the capital from the north and east after seizing control Thursday of an airbase just north of the city. But ""Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically,"" he said.

Russia's military claimed earlier Friday its forces had staged a ""successful landing operation"" to capture Hostomel airfield, viewed as strategically important, on Kyiv's outskirts.

Zelensky's comments came hours after a video was posted on his Facebook page, showing him with a group of men, saying, ""We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.""

Before dawn Friday, explosions lit up the sky above the capital as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later.

""Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,"" Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center. Videos from the area showed chaotic scenes as civilians tried to hide from small arms fire.

Ukrainian military vehicles move past Independence Square in central Kyiv on February 24, 2022.

A tweet from the ministry asked citizens of the district to report any suspicious movements, adding: ""Make Molotov cocktails and take down the occupier.""

CNN witnessed a group of Ukrainian security forces leave the city police headquarters with weapons and ammunition -- apparently heading towards Obolon.

Meanwhile, 92 people working at the Chernobyl power plant, the site of the world's worst-ever nuclear disaster, have been taken hostage, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said Friday. Russian forces took control of the site on Thursday, sparking fears that the fighting could interfere with the operation of nuclear waste facilities.

As Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence.

However, the latest British defense intelligence assessment said Russia had made ""limited progress"" Friday in its attack.

""Fighting continues in key locations. Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities. Ukrainian MOD reports that Russian forces have arrived in the suburbs of Kyiv,"" the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted

A senior US defense official told reporters that the Russians have ""about a third of their combat power"" in Ukraine out of the total combat power they have amassed on the country's borders right now, but ""that does not mean that they will not commit more.""

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier said that airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million.

A Ukrainian firefighter walks between fragments of a downed aircraft in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, February 25, 2022. It was unclear what aircraft crashed and what brought it down.

For now, Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that ""enemy sabotage groups"" had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,"" he said.

""Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,"" he said. ""Such attacks on our capital haven't occurred since 1941.""

In an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were ""showing their true heroism"" but that they were defending their country ""alone."" The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are ""not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,"" he said.

A few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. ""There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let's sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people's deaths,"" he said, speaking in Russian.

Shortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.

""As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,"" Peskov said, according to RIA. The talks would concern ""neutral status,"" he suggested. Peskov said later Friday that the Ukrainian side had countered with a proposal to meet in Warsaw and then dropped contact.

Zelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees.

""Ukraine has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace. This is our constant position,"" Sergii Nykyforov, a spokesperson for Zelensky, said late Friday. He also denied what he called ""claims that we have refused to negotiate.""

Meanwhile, Putin called on Ukraine's armed forces to overthrow their government in remarks to his security council Friday.

""Do not let Banderites (Ukrainian nationalists) and neo-Nazis use your children, wives and old people as human shields,"" Putin said in remarks aired on Russian state television. ""Take power into your own hands, it looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.""

Putin frequently repeats the baseless and inaccurate claim that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a ""Nazi"" or ""fascist"" regime. The language has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish.

Asked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow's plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: ""Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine.""

In an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being ""simply crazy"" in wanting to ""come here to kill Ukrainians"" -- and vowed they would resist. ""We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,"" he said.

Homes damaged

The advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions -- and questions about Putin's wider ambitions for the country and its capital.

It's unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are much better equipped and have superior air power.

Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured.

Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.

Separately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city.

As they approach, many Ukrainians are preparing to fight back. Some 18,000 guns with ammunition have been distributed to reservists in the Kyiv region alone since the Russian invasion began early Thursday, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, with more weapons on their way.

Outside the Kyiv region, fighting continued in cities including Sumy, in the northeast, Chernihiv in the north and Kherson to the south.

A CNN team that visited a bridge crossing from Russian-held areas into the southern city of Kherson saw four large shell craters, 10 discarded Ukrainian armored vehicles and several bodies, but the Ukrainians appeared to have been able to push Russian forces back.

Low-flying jets could be seen overhead and air raid sirens wailed across the city.

A Russian defense ministry spokesperson said in a statement that a ""counter-offensive"" was underway in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, and that Ukrainian service members had surrendered to Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. CNN could not immediately check the veracity of those claims.

Makeshift bunkers

Officials in the country believe Russia's plan is to overthrow the Ukrainian leadership and install a pro-Russian government.

Those fears were shared with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Thursday that he's ""convinced"" Moscow is going to try to overthrow the Ukrainian government.

If that happens, Blinken said he believes ""Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses -- and potentially worse -- on the Ukrainian people.""

The fighting in Ukraine appears to be some of the worst conventional warfare Europe has seen since World War II and the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s. Preliminary figures indicate 137 Ukrainian solders have been killed, including every soldier defending an island in the Black Sea that was taken over by Russian troops, according to President Zelensky.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy makes a statement in Kyiv, Ukraine, February 25.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said its armed forces had caused around 800 casualties among Russian forces since the attacks started early on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed and CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine's figures.

By the end of Thursday, Putin's forces had launched ""in total more than 160 missiles for airstrikes,"" a senior US defense official said, prompting a response reminiscent of the late 1930s, with vulnerable children evacuated by train from eastern Ukraine and packed subway stations turned into makeshift bunkers as air raid sirens wailed.

A family takes shelter along with other Kyiv residents in an underground parking garage on Friday. Some areas of the Ukrainian capital were hit by aerial attacks.

In an ominous sign a ground war could escalate, Zelensky barred male citizens between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.

Zelensky also ordered a general military mobilization ""in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations, in a declaration signed late Thursday.

More than 100,000 people have already fled areas most at risk of attack within Ukraine, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The mass movement followed warnings from the US Ambassador to the UN, who said Russia's actions in Ukraine could create one of the largest refugee crises facing the world today, displacing as many as five million people.

Polish officials reported an increase in the number of people crossing into the country from Ukraine in the hours after the Russian invasion began.

Sanctioning Putin

The United States will impose sanctions on Putin and Lavrov, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday, hours after the European Union and United Kingdom said they would do the same.

The EU also announced a slew of other new sanctions on Russia, designed to have ""maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the sanctions would hit Russia's financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.

""We want to financially isolate Russia, we want to cut all the ties between Russia and the international financial system,"" said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.

Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Russia's attack on Ukraine as a ""brutal act of war.""

The alliance activated the NATO Response Force (NRF) for the first time ever in response to the invasion. The NRF is made up of land, air, sea and special operations forces from the allies that can deploy quickly in support of the NATO alliance.

""We have over 100 jets at high alert, operating in over 30 different locations, and over 120 ships from the high north, to the Mediterranean. We activated the defense plans yesterday, and now elements of this force are being deployed,"" Stoltenberg said during a press briefing on Friday, following an extraordinary meeting of NATO Heads of State and Government in Brussels. He also clarified that while the United States, Canada and European allies have ""deployed thousands more troops"" to the eastern part of the alliance, NATO is not deploying the entire Response Force.

A big concern for NATO is whether Putin's intentions lie beyond Ukraine, a prospect that risks drawing all 30 members -- including the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany -- into a wider conflict on European soil.

""You don't need intelligence to tell you that that's exactly what President Putin wants. He has made clear he'd like to reconstitute the Soviet Empire, short of that he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around the neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc,"" said Blinken on CBS Evening News.

Blinken said NATO would stand in the way if those were Putin's ultimate goals.

""Now, when it comes to a threat beyond Ukraine's borders. There's something very powerful standing in his way. That's article five of NATO, an attack on one is an attack on all,"" the top diplomat said.

On Thursday, the US Secretary of Defense ordered the deployment of 7,000 US service members to Europe. The deployment brings the number of US troops moved towards eastern Europe at more than 14,000.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-friday-intl-hnk/index.html

Putin said the “special military operation” in Ukraine’s Donbas region was to “protect people” but clashes between Ukrainian and Russian forces were “inevitable” and “only a question of time”.

At 5am local time or 2:30pm AEDT, reporters in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv as well as the Ukrainian cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv hundreds of kilometres away and have recorded audible explosions in their broadcasts. Newswire service Reuters also reported witnesses in the city hearing loud noises similar to the firing of artillery.

The CNN was quickly placed into safety gear and confirmed the explosions heard in Kyiv were in fact missile strikes.

Explosions reported around Kyiv’s airport and heard in the city. It’s 05:30am here. — Polina Ivanova (@polinaivanovva) February 24, 2022

During the address Putin said that Russia did not intend to occupy Ukraine and the responsibility for any bloodshed would rest with the “Ukrainian regime”.

This comes two days after Putin ordered troops into contested Ukrainian territory on Tuesday, which world leaders including Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the beginning of the Russian invasion.

Morrison warned on Wednesday we were in the “last stage before a full invasion”, which could begin within 24 hours because all signs pointed to Russia following through on its threats.

It is clear an invasion is now underway.

US President Joe Biden released a statement this afternoon saying Putin had “chosen premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life”. He called it an “unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine” and the world would hold Russia accountable.

He said NATO would deliver a “strong, united response”, but Putin has sent a warning to NATO allies.

“To anyone who would consider interfering from the outside: if you do, you will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history. All relevant decisions have been taken. I hope you hear me,” Putin said in his address.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy responded to the address in an emotional TV appearance and said the invasion could cost tens of thousands of lives.

“The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,” he said.

“But if we come under attack, if we face an attempt to take away our country, our freedom, our lives and lives of our children, we will defend ourselves. When you attack us, you will see our faces, not our backs.”

Russian, Ukrainian forces clash in streets of Kyiv

Russian and Ukrainian forces clashed in Kyiv on Saturday as authorities urged citizens to help defend the city. Heavy, frequent artillery fire and intense gunfire, apparently some distance from the city centre, could be heard, a witness in Kyiv said. The Ukrainian military said Russian troops attacked an army base on a main avenue but the assault was repelled. Gunfire was heard after dawn near government buildings in the city centre, a witness said. The air force command reported heavy fighting near an air base at Vasylkiv southwest of the capital, which it said was under attack from Russian paratroopers. It also said one of its fighters had shot down a Russian transport plane, but those claims remain unverified.

Ukrainian officials said Russian forces fired cruise missiles from the Black Sea at the cities of Sumy, Poltava and Mariupol and there was heavy fighting near the southern city of Mariupol.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, speaking in a video message from outside his Kyiv office, was defiant.

“We will not put down weapons, we will defend our state,” Zelenskiy said.

China’s embassy in Ukraine reverses advice for citizens to identify themselves amid backlash

Days after encouraging people to put Chinese flags on their cars if they were travelling, China’s embassy in Ukraine is now warning citizens in the country not to “display identifying signs.”

The advice comes amid unconfirmed reports on social media of a backlash against Chinese in Ukraine after Beijing publicly backed Russia’s invasion of the country.

On Friday night, Beijing’s representative abstained from a vote condemning Moscow’s actions at the United Nations Security Council. Earlier in the day, President Xi Jinping had a phone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in which he urged negotiation with Kyiv but also acknowledged Russia’s “legitimate security concerns.”

”The Chinese embassy in Ukraine would like to remind our compatriots that during the current security situation, we should attach great importance to friendly relations with the Ukrainian people, avoid disputes on specific issues and strive to resolve issues through friendly means,” the embassy said Friday night in a post on WeChat.

”Minimize security risks by staying away from military installations, military personnel and gunmen. Do not take pictures of people in the crossfire, or without their consent.

”Some 6,000 Chinese citizens live in Ukraine, according to the embassy, which earlier said there were charter flights available for those trying to leave the country.

Ukraine says two commercial ships hit by Russian missiles near Odesa port

Ukraine said Russian warships shelled a Moldovan-flagged chemical tanker and a Panamanian-flagged cargo ship due to load grain near Odesa port in the Black Sea.

Ukraine’s infrastructure ministry said that the Moldovan-flagged vessel, the Millennial Spirit, was carrying 600 tonnes of diesel at the time of the attack from a Russian military ship.

Earlier on Friday Moldova’s naval agency said the crew of the Millennial Spirit was Russian and that two of them had been seriously injured.

According to the Ukrainian ministry, the cargo ship Namura Queen was also hit by Russian missiles on Friday.

At a Ukrainian Saturday school in Oakville, Ont., students typically learn about their culture, participate in dance lessons and study the language.

This weekend, however, classes at Oakville Ridna Shkola will have a more sombre tone: The younger children will write letters to soldiers and high-school students will listen to a guest speaker’s lecture about misinformation and how to find reliable sources of news about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“We want them to have an understanding of what the real facts are, what is really happening. And the most important thing is to distinguish between the true information and fake information,” said Oksana Levytska, principal at the school.

Oakville Ridna Shkola is one of many institutions across the country that are providing spaces for young people to share how they feel during an uncertain time. Educators are balancing the possibility of spreading fear among students with the benefits of helping them understand the events unfolding in Ukraine.

After day of protests, Ukrainian-Canadians focus on fundraising amid Russian advance

Canadians rushed to provide war-torn Ukraine with material aid, selling donuts to raise money, offering furniture to future refugees, and trying to purchase military equipment for veterans on the front lines.

After a day of protest, attention turned to the difficult task of giving a beleaguered nation the help its government was seeking, in ways large and small. The Ukrainian military took the dramatic step of asking international supporters for cash donations, while Canada’s federal government offered to match individual contributions to the Canadian Red Cross.

Two more groups, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress and the Canada-Ukraine Foundation, teamed up at the end of January to launch a fundraising drive called the Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal. The pair has collected $2.4-million of its $5-million goal, according to the tally on CUF’s website.

Canadian tech firms with Ukraine offices struggling to get employees out of country as Russian forces advance

Canadian technology firms with offices and employees in Ukraine are trying to help staff flee the country, but efforts to get them access to Canada have so far largely gone nowhere.

Chief executives at several tech companies said the Canadian government has not provided work visas or approved refugee applications for their Ukrainian staff.

Sean Fraser, Canada’s Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, said his department has already approved more than 1,800 Ukrainian immigration applications on a “priority basis,” and is expediting applications from Ukrainians who are trying to escape the conflict.

But Anna Sainsbury, chief executive officer of Vancouver cybersecurity firm GeoComply Solutions Inc., said her experience has been far from what the immigration minister described. Her company has been attempting to get federal officials to create streamlined or priority immigration applications for Ukrainian employees since early February, but has not heard back from Ottawa.

Trudeau calls for Russia to be cut out of crucial SWIFT pay system in new wave of sanctions over Ukraine invasion

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is calling for Russia to be cut out of the SWIFT system for international banking payments.

Trudeau, U.S. President Joe Biden and the European Union all imposed sanctions directly on Mr. Putin and his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, freezing any assets they own in these three jurisdictions.

The Canadian Prime Minister went a step further and openly pushed for a ban on Russian banks using SWIFT, the service that allows for cross-border financial transactions, including paying for traded goods. It is particularly crucial for Russia to collect the fossil fuel royalty payments that fund its government.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced Canada’s new sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin personally, as well as foreign minister Sergeĭ Lavrov, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues. Trudeau also announced Canada’s support of removing Russia from the international banking system SWIFT, and said personal donations from Canadians to Ukraine relief efforts would be matched by Ottawa up to $10-million. The Globe and Mail

“We have made it clear that all options are on the table when it comes to imposing steep costs on Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked invasion,” Mr. Trudeau said. “Excluding Russian banks from SWIFT would make it even more difficult for President Putin to finance his brutalities.”

Mr. Trudeau’s announcement now makes him the most vocal proponent of the measure among G7 leaders. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also favoured ejecting Russia from SWIFT, while the EU, led by Germany, has been most opposed.

Russia vetoes UN resolution to end Ukraine invasion

Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution telling Moscow to stop attacking Ukraine and withdraw all troops immediately.

The veto was expected, but the United States and its supporters argued that the effort would highlight Moscow’s international isolation.

The 11-1 vote – with China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining – showed significant but not total opposition to Russia’s invasion of its smaller, militarily weaker neighbour.

The resolution’s failure paves the way for backers to call for a swift vote on a similar measure in the 193-member UN General Assembly, where there are no vetoes. There was no immediate timetable for a potential Assembly vote.

Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions aren’t legally binding, but they can function as statements of world opinion. In an Assembly meeting Wednesday as Moscow’s invasion loomed, dozens of countries condemned Russia or expressed solidarity with Ukraine. Russia and ally Syria defended Moscow’s moves.

Canada to sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada will sanction Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of a third set of severe, co-ordinated sanctions against the country over its invasion of Ukraine.

Canada will also bring in sanctions on Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and Putin’s chief of staff.

Trudeau says these men bear the greatest responsibility for the death and destruction occurring in Ukraine.

Wall Street sharply higher for second day after Ukraine shock

U.S. stocks ended up sharply for a second day on Friday, with the Dow registering its biggest daily percentage gain since November 2020 as the market rebounded from the sharp selloff leading up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Oil prices fell below $100 a barrel, easing some concerns about higher energy costs.

Investors also are assessing news that Russian President Vladimir Putin told his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in a call that Russia was willing to hold high-level talks with Ukraine, according to China’s Foreign Ministry.

Some strategists say stock-selling may have been overdone. The S&P 500 confirmed earlier this week it was in a correction when it ended down more than 10% from its Jan. 3 record closing high.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 96.04 points, or 2.25%, to end at 4,384.74 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 223.28 points, or 1.66%, to 13,695.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 834.16 points, or 2.51%, to 34,058.55.

Opinion: How Nord Stream 2 became a geopolitical blunder for both Russia and Germany

No pipeline in decades has carried as much geopolitical risk as the Nord Stream 2, the megaproject that was supposed to bring Russia and Germany closer together economically, stuff Western Europe with cheap fuel and accelerate the demise of dirty coal power plants.

Those risks, apparent from Day 1 in 2015, when NS2 was announced, finally overwhelmed the pipeline this week. NS2 is effectively, although not officially, dead; it now has zero chance of obtaining an operating licence from Berlin in the next few years, if ever. The war in Ukraine finally tipped it over the edge, an example of savage politics overwhelming serious commerce.

A painted map of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany is shown at the natural gas receiving station in the Lubmin industrial estate in Lubmin, Germany, on Nov 16, 2021.Stefan Sauer/The Associated Press

Many countries, not just Ukraine, opposed the pipeline. They argued it would make Germany and a few other countries slaves to Russian gas, opening the door to blackmail and intensifying Europe’s fossil fuel reliance when it should be devoting its might and creativity to renewable energy.

The U.S. slapped sanctions on NS2, but they were too narrow and ultimately proved entirely ineffective. One of the targets was pipe-laying ships in the Baltic. The Russians solved that problem by finding ships that were not subject to the sanctions.

In the end, Russia lost an enormous pipeline that could have earned Gazprom fortunes for decades and made Europe even more reliant on imported gas. Germany’s endorsement of NS2 until Mr. Scholz banished it, showed the country had woefully misjudged the pipeline’s geopolitical risks, making it look naive and feckless. There were no winners in this saga, just lessons.

Canada to match individual donations to Red Cross for Ukraine

The federal government is planning to match donations made to the Canadian Red Cross for humanitarian relief for Ukraine. The campaign, which is slated to begin Friday and run until March 18, would see the government match donations by Canadians dollar for dollar to a maximum of $10-million, said a senior government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public.

The head of Save the Children Canada also urged Canadians to donate funds as part a US$19-million global appeal to help the humanitarian efforts on the ground as the fighting continued across Ukraine.

The Globe and Mail has also compiled a list of organizations taking humanitarian donations for Ukraine.

Ontario Liberal leader asks LCBO to pull Russian products over Ukraine invasion

The leader of Ontario’s Liberal Party is asking the LCBO to stop selling Russian products following that country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Steven Del Duca wrote to the CEO of the provincial Crown liquor corporation asking that the LCBO pull Russian items until troops are withdrawn.

In his Friday letter to George Soleas, Del Duca said Ontario should follow the lead of the federal government, which has issued sanctions against Russia and taken a stand against the invasion. He said Ontario can’t say it’s standing with Ukraine “while continuing to be (Vladimir) Putin’s customer.”

Auto makers idle production following Russia’s invasion, other firms also scramble

Several companies, including auto makers Volkswagen and Renault and tire maker Nokian Tyres, on Friday outlined plans to shut or shift manufacturing operations following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The United States announced sweeping export restrictions against Russia on Thursday, hammering its access to global exports of goods ranging from commercial electronics and computers to semiconductors and aircraft parts. That could lead companies to alter manufacturing plans or seek alternative supply lines.

The invasion was a factor in consulting firms J.D. Power and LMC Automotive slashing their 2022 global new-car sales outlook by 400,000 vehicles to 85.8 million units. The auto industry had already been dealing with a tight supply of vehicles due to the global semiconductor shortage.

Telus is waiving all roaming charges for calls, text, and data overages for customers in that country, and long distance and SMS fees for those in Canada reaching out to friends and family there.

Opinion: A travel ban on Russians could avert further conflict in Ukraine

As I write this in the Dominican Republic, thousands of Russian tourists are sunning themselves on local beaches, drinking tequila in the bars and partying to beat the band. Simultaneously, there are Russian rockets raining down on Kyiv, civilians dying in droves and a despot in the Kremlin with access to nuclear weapons, threatening any country that dares intervene while remaining oblivious to diplomatic entreaties and indifferent to all the announced international sanctions.

If history is a guide, Vladimir Putin will see a bump in his domestic popularity if the invasion of Ukraine succeeds, and most Russians will shrug if the economy eventually shrinks again.

Nevertheless, domestic opposition to the invasion remains one of the best hopes for taming Mr. Putin’s aggression. And while Russians have bravely taken to the streets in cities across the country, with hundreds already detained for doing so, more people there need to understand that their government’s terrible actions have painful consequences for them, and for how they are seen around the world. On this, the typical slate of economic sanctions do not appear to be doing the job.

There is, however, another set of sanctions that would bite, and could quickly help turn popular opinion against Mr. Putin: An indefinite ban of travellers from Russia by democratic nations.

Russia booted from Eurovision Song Contest over invasion of Ukraine

The European Broadcasting Union says that Russia will not be allowed an entry in this year’s Eurovision Song Contest.

The union said in a statement Friday that given the unprecedented crisis in Ukraine, the inclusion of a Russian entry would bring the competition into “disrepute.”

“The EBU is an apolitical member organization of broadcasters committed to upholding the values of public service,” the union said on Twitter. “We remain dedicated to protecting the values of a cultural competition which promotes international exchange and understanding, brings audiences together, celebrates diversity through music and unites Europe on one stage.”

This year’s finale is being held in Turin, Italy, on May 14.

Russia has not yet announced an entrant for the splashy contest.

Ukraine will be represented by Kalush Orchestra, which organizers describe as a “hip-hop band with a fondness for folk.”

Battle for Kyiv rages as residents urged to fight

The battle for this city of three million people began in earnest on Friday, as Russian troops and armoured vehicles entered parts of Ukraine’s capital, which started handing out weapons to citizens planning to resist.

The Defence Ministry said Russian reconnaissance units were in the northern Obolon neighbourhood of the city, close to Kyiv’s historic Podil district, a place of cafés and cobblestoned streets that is now a frontline. “We ask citizens to inform about the movement of equipment!” the official statement said. “Make Molotov cocktails, neutralize the occupier!”

Russia’s authoritarian President Vladimir Putin called on the Ukrainian army to overthrow the elected government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. “Take power in your own hands. It seems like it will be easier for us to agree with you than this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,” Mr. Putin said, referring to Mr. Zelensky, who is Jewish.

The Ukrainian government said they had destroyed three bridges on the northern approach to the capital to slow the Russian advance. A few hours later, as fighting moved closer to the centre of the city, the Interior Ministry announced it had distributed some 18,000 assault rifles to residents.

Friday’s fighting followed a night of fierce bombing in and around Kyiv. In the eastern Pozniaky district of the city, a 10-storey apartment block had its windows blown out and façade badly damaged when a Russian cruise missile slammed into the ground directly in front of the residential building, leaving a two-metre-deep crater while narrowly missing a kindergarten. Three people were injured.

Amnesty International said on Friday that Russia’s war against Ukraine “has been marked by indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and strikes on protected objects such as hospitals,” and that at least six civilians had been confirmed as killed in the first day of attacks. Agnès Callamard, the group’s secretary-general, said some of the attacks on civilian areas “may be war crimes.”

Moscow cracks down on protesters as Russian troops invade Ukraine

Police on Thursday detained more than 1,600 Russians who protested against Russia’s multi-pronged military operation in Ukraine, while authorities threatened to block media reports that contain what Moscow described as “false information.”

In acts of cautious, but unusual dissent, Russian pop stars, journalists, a television comedian and a footballer opposed the war online after President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday.

By 2 p.m. ET, police had detained 1,667 people at rallies in 53 cities, the OVD-Info rights monitor said – easily the biggest tally since last year’s crushing of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny’s network ushered in an ice age in activism.

Protesters defied a warning issued on Thursday by the Investigative Committee, a kind of Russian answer to the FBI, that explicitly threatened criminal action and even jail time for people calling for or taking part in protests.

“I was detained on my way out of the house,” Marina Litvinovich, a Moscow-based activist, wrote on Telegram after she called on Russians in a Facebook post on Thursday morning to protest later that evening.

As Marek Mahdal watched news reports of Russian air strikes pounding Ukraine, he didn’t feel he could sit at home in Prague and do nothing.

So he and two friends jumped in their cars Thursday night and drove 770-kilometres to the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing near Przemysl in eastern Poland. They arrived at around noon on Friday and stood on a sidewalk outside the pedestrian gate holding a sign written in Ukrainian that offered free rides to Prague and help finding shelter, food and work.

“It’s unthinkable what’s happening and I would be really quite happy if someone showed up with this offer,” said Mr. Mahdal, a 22-year old student. “We’ve got the time and, most importantly, we’ve got the means.”

The trio were part of an informal network of families, friends and do-gooders that have descended on the Polish border crossing to fetch loved ones, offer shelter or just spoon out free soup.

China blames U.S., NATO for provoking Putin, but Beijing wary of support for invasion

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this week shocked the world, even after months of sabre-rattling by Moscow, but China in particular seems to have been wrong-footed by the unprovoked attack.

As Russian missiles began striking Ukrainian positions early Thursday morning, China’s representative to the United Nations was in the middle of telling the Security Council that “the door to a peaceful solution to the Ukraine issue is not fully shut, nor should it be shut.”

After Beijing backed Russia’s calls for an end to NATO’s eastward expansion following a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping in early February, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said this week that “the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries should be respected and safeguarded … and that applies equally to Ukraine.”

Since the invasion began, Beijing has swung behind Russia, blaming Washington and NATO for provoking Mr. Putin’s invasion and reiterating Russian justifications for the war.

No Russian pavilion, bans for ‘handful’ of firms at Mobile World Congress: organizer

There will be no Russian pavilion at the telecoms industry’s biggest annual gathering and a “handful” of Russian firms will be barred from it because of sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, the event’s organizer said on Friday.

The organizers of the Mobile World Congress condemned Moscow’s actions, but have no plans to cancel or postpone the gathering scheduled between Feb. 28 and March 3 in Barcelona, John Hoffman, the chief executive of event organizer GSMA, told Reuters.

He said “a handful, a few” Russian companies and their executives would be banned but did not name them, saying the sanctions lists were evolving.

Swiss freeze bank accounts of Russians on EU sanctions list

Switzerland told banks on Friday to freeze the assets of people and entities on a European Union sanctions blacklist that the neutral country has adopted to ensure it is not used to circumvent measures against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

The instruction from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) ratchets up the pressure Bern is exerting in solidarity with the West while still trying to keep the door open to a potential role as a mediator.

“Financial intermediaries are requested to block the corresponding assets immediately and to report such business relationships to (government agency) SECO in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance,” FINMA said on its website.

The government had earlier amended its ordinance to include 363 individuals and four companies the EU put on its sanctions list this week to punish Moscow.

FINMA did not specify how much money would be frozen. Russians held nearly 10.4 billion Swiss francs ($11.21 billion) in Switzerland in 2020, Swiss National Bank data show.

Russia sanctions to add to higher energy, grain prices amid Ukraine war: IMF chief

International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Friday that international financial sanctions against Russia will add to the economic impacts of the war in Ukraine, which are primarily being transmitted through higher energy and grain prices, adding to inflation.

Georgieva, speaking at a Georgetown Law School event on Black History Month, also said that greater financial market uncertainty caused by the conflict may cause capital “outflows from emerging markets, when we need exactly the opposite – more financing going there.”

She also said that heightened regional tensions may impact economic activity in countries and regions surrounding Ukraine, such as Moldova and the Caucasus.

“We have already seen actions taken in terms of sanctions that would add to the economic impact of this crisis, and will primarily transmit through energy prices, as well as grain, adding to what has been a growing concern of inflation and how it can be countered,” she said.

Russia is among the world’s biggest oil exporters and also is a major grain exporter, along with Ukraine, whose Black Sea ports have been closed to shipping.

Insurance costs of shipping through Black Sea soar after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine

Insurers have raised the cost of providing cover for merchant ships through the Black Sea, adding to soaring rates to transport goods through the region for vessels still willing to sail after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ship owners pay annual war-risk insurance cover as well as an additional “breach” premium when entering high-risk areas. These separate premiums are calculated according to the value of the ship, or hull, for a seven-day period.

Ship insurers have quoted the additional premium rate for seven days at anywhere between 1 per cent to 2 per cent and up to 5 per cent of insurance costs, from an estimated 0.025 per cent on Monday before Russia’s invasion began, according to indicative rates from marine insurance sources.

This would mean additional costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars for a ship voyage depending on the destination.

“Given the Russian offensive from land, sea and air, it would not be surprising if some insurers will be reluctant (to provide cover),” one insurance source said.

A Moldovan-flagged chemical tanker was hit by a missile on Friday near Ukraine’s port of Odesa, seriously wounding two crew.

On Thursday, a Turkish-owned ship was hit by a bomb off Odesa with no casualties and the ship sailed safely into Romanian waters.

Turkey says it cannot stop returning Russian warships from accessing Black Sea

Turkey cannot stop Russian warships accessing the Black Sea via its straits, as Ukraine has requested, due to a clause in an international pact that allows vessels to return to their home base, the Turkish foreign minister said on Friday.

Ukraine has appealed to Turkey to block Russian warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits which lead to the Black Sea, after Moscow on Thursday launched a full-blown assault on Ukraine from land, air and sea.

Russian forces landed at Ukraine’s Black and Azov Sea ports as part of the invasion.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the straits and can limit the passage of warships during wartime or if threatened, but the request has put the NATO member in a difficult position as it tries to manage its Western commitments and close ties with Russia.

Canadian dollar gains as investors weigh targeted Russia sanctions

The Canadian dollar strengthened against the greenback on Friday as preliminary domestic data showed wholesale trade rising in January and currency traders walked back some of the large moves seen the day before in reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The safe-haven U.S. dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, and stocks globally rose as investors welcomed co-ordinated Western sanctions on Russia that targeted its banks but not did not block it from a global payments system and left its energy sector largely untouched.

The price of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, gave back some recent gains, with U.S. crude oil futures falling 1.1 per cent to $91.76 a barrel.

Investors doubt that the start of war in Ukraine will stop the Bank of Canada from hiking interest rates next week for the first time since October 2018. Money markets expect the central bank to lift its policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.50 per cent at its policy announcement next Wednesday and six times in total this year to fight inflation.

The Canadian dollar gained 0.3 per cent to 1.2775 per greenback, or 78.28 U.S. cents, after trading in a range of 1.2754 to 1.2820.

On Thursday, the currency touched its weakest intraday level in more than two months at 1.2877. It was on track to decline 0.2 per cent for the week.

And this is why we will take in all the people that are fleeing now,” Baerbock said, adding she had already started to co-ordinate the distribution of Ukrainian refugees with countries such as Poland and Canada.

Pope Francis makes personal appeal in remarkable Russia embassy trip

Pope Francis visited the Russian Embassy on Friday to personally “express his concern about the war,” the Vatican said, in an extraordinary, hands-on papal gesture that has no recent precedent.

Usually, popes receive ambassadors and heads of state in the Vatican, and diplomatic protocol would have called for the Vatican foreign minister to summon the ambassador. For Francis, the Vatican head of state, the decision to leave the walled city state and travel a short distance to the Russian embassy to the Holy See was a sign of his anger at Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and his willingness to appeal personally for an end to it.

Vatican officials said they knew of no such previous papal initiative.

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni confirmed the visit, and the Vatican said Francis travelled to and from the embassy in a small white car.

“The Holy See press office confirms that the pope went to the Russian Embassy to the Holy See on Via della Conciliazione, clearly to express his concern about the war. He was there for just over a half-hour,” Bruni said.

Francis has called for dialogue to end the conflict and has urged the faithful to set next Wednesday as a day of fasting and prayer for peace in Ukraine. But he has refrained from publicly calling out Russia, presumably for fear of antagonizing the Russian Orthodox Church.

Ukraine says military targeted by Belarusian hackers

Ukrainian cybersecurity officials say hackers from neighbouring Belarus are targeting the private email addresses of Ukrainian military personnel “and related individuals.”

In an announcement posted to Facebook, Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said the hackers were using password-stealing emails to break into Ukrainian soldiers’ email accounts and using the compromised address books to send further malicious messages.

The CERT said blamed a group code-named “UNC1151″ for the hacking, identifying its members as Minsk-based officers of Belarusian military.

Ukraine has been buffeted by digital intrusions and denial of service actions both in the run-up to and during the Russian invasion which began earlier this week. Belarus has offered its territory as a launch pad for Russian forces, allowing Moscow’s forces to rapidly push toward Kyiv.

Two ships struck by Russian missiles in the Black Sea

Before Russian attacks on Thursday, Ukrainian government officials and shipping companies had kept ports open, preserving the movement of ships across the Black Sea despite a huge exclusion zone imposed by Russia, which said it was conducting exercises in the area.

On Friday, however, two ships were struck - a development with potentially significant implications for Black Sea shipping that is economically and logistically critical to Ukraine.

Namura Queen, a Panamanian-flagged bulk carrier carrying grain, was hit, injuring one and igniting a fire.

Millennial Spirit, a Moldovan-flagged bunker carrying 600 tonnes of oil and diesel, was also hit. Ten crew were rescued, two badly injured. All were Russian citizens, according to the Ministry of Infrastructure, which warned about an “ecological disaster.”

It was “taken out by a Russian ship,” Andrey Stavnitser, one of Ukraine’s most important port investors, said in a Facebook post.

“There is no communication with the vessel.”

Britain’s spy chief claims intelligence scoop on Putin’s invasion of Ukraine

Spies in the United States and Britain scored an intelligence scoop by uncovering Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to order the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, Britain’s foreign spy chief said.

For months, U.S. and British ministers and Western security sources had warned that Russia could invade Ukraine. They stepped up warnings that an invasion was imminent in the weeks and days ahead of Putin’s declaration.

Ahead of the Russian invasion, Moscow repeatedly dismissed those claims as anti-Russian hysteria or disinformation designed to tempt Putin into a war.

“U.S. and U.K. intelligence communities uncovered Putin’s plans for Ukraine,” Richard Moore, the chief of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6, said on Twitter.

“We exposed his attempts to engineer ‘false flag’, fake attacks to justify his invasion,” Moore said. “This attack was long planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression.”

Russian invasion could drive 5 million Ukrainians to flee abroad, UN says

Fuel, cash and medical supplies are running low in parts of Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, which could drive up to 5 million people to flee abroad, UN aid agencies said on Friday.

At least 100,000 people are uprooted in Ukraine after fleeing their homes since Russia launched its assault on Thursday, while several thousand have already crossed into neighbouring countries including Moldova, Romania and Poland, UN refugee agency spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said.

“We are looking at ranges of 1-3 million into Poland for example … A scenario of 1 to 5 mln including all surrounding countries,” Afshan Khan, UNICEF’s regional director for Europe and Central Asia, told a UN briefing in Geneva.

U.N. human rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said that it had reports of at least 127 civilian casualties in Ukraine - 25 killed and 102 injured - “caused by shelling and air strikes.” This was likely a significant under-estimate, she said.

UEFA moves Champions League final from St. Petersburg to Paris in wake of Ukraine invasion

UEFA has moved this year’s Champions League final from St. Petersburg to Paris in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, European soccer’s governing body said in a statement on Friday.

UEFA also said the home games of Ukrainian and Russian club and national teams competing in UEFA competitions would be played at neutral venues “until further notice.”

The governing body thanked French President Emmanuel Macron for his “personal support and commitment” in taking on the final.

It added that it would “fully support multi-stakeholder efforts to ensure the provision of rescue for football players and their families in Ukraine who face dire human suffering, destruction and displacement.”

The Champions League final was set to be staged at Zenit St. Petersburg’s stadium on May 28 with thousands of supporters from across the continent expected to attend the showcase match in European club soccer.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call: “It’s a shame that such a decision has been made. St. Petersburg could have provided all favourable conditions to hold this festival of soccer.”

The move to strip St. Petersburg of the final follows calls from a group of European lawmakers who asked UEFA on Thursday to change the venue and stop considering Russian cities for major international soccer competitions.

Ukraine urges allies to stand by promises of unprecedented sanctions against Russia

The West is under mounting pressure to take stronger measures against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, after the world’s wealthy democracies failed to kick Moscow out of the SWIFT system of international payments and omitted other tough actions from sanctions packages announced this week.

The Ukrainian government, along with legislators in the United States and Europe, called on leaders to make good on preinvasion promises of unprecedented economic pain for Russian President Vladimir Putin if he attacked Ukraine.

The U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and several other countries on Thursday announced sanctions on Russian banks, oligarchs and technology exports. EU foreign ministers told reporters in Brussels on Friday that they would also freeze European assets belonging to Mr. Putin and his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov.

But the measures did not personally sanction Mr. Putin, block Russian exports of oil and natural gas or prohibit Western companies from doing business with Russia. They also allowed Russia to remain part of SWIFT, which banks depend on for performing cross-border transactions and Moscow uses to collect the fossil fuel royalty payments that fund its government.

Early Friday, Ukraine’s government, besieged by Russian forces attacking Kyiv, called on Europe to do more.

Opinion: The West needs to support the Ukrainians - for their sake and ours

In the early fog of a war that is just beginning, I see four things the West needs to do. We need to secure the defence of every inch of NATO territory, especially at its eastern frontiers with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, against all possible forms of attack, including cyber and hybrid ones.

We have to offer all the support that we can to the Ukrainians, short of breaching the threshold that would bring the West into a direct hot war with Russia. Those Ukrainians who choose to stay and to resist will be fighting, by military but also civilian means, to defend the freedom of their country, as they have every possible right in law and conscience to do, and as we would do for our own countries.

But there are still things we can do. Not only can we continue to supply weapons, communications and other equipment to those who are entirely legitimately resisting armed force with armed force. As important in the medium term, we can help those who will be using the well-tried techniques of civil resistance against a Russian occupation and any attempt to impose a puppet government. We must also stand ready to assist the many Ukrainians who will flee westward.

Merkel condemns Russian invasion as legacy comes under scrutiny

Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine marked a “deep rupture in Europe’s history following the end of the Cold War” even as her own legacy comes under fresh scrutiny in light of the assault.

Merkel, who led Germany for 16 years until last December and was long seen as the West’s key interlocutor with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said she was following the unfolding events with “great worry and sympathy.”

“There is no justification for this blatant breach of international law, and I wholeheartedly condemn it,” said Merkel, who grew up in the former communist East Germany and speaks fluent Russian.

Germany has joined its European Union partners and other Western countries in agreeing sweeping economic sanctions on Russia. But until this week it had been less inclined than the United States or Britain to accept that an attack on Ukraine was imminent and had backed a heavier focus on dialogue with Moscow.

People in Kyiv were told to make Molotov cocktail petrol bombs on Friday as they hid in makeshift shelters and basements, awaiting a Russian assault on the Ukrainian capital.

“Make Molotov cocktails, neutralize the occupier!” the Defence Ministry said, while local authorities told people in the northwestern Obolon area of the city to stay off the streets because “active hostilities” were approaching.

Some residents took refuge in subway stations being used as air-raid shelters, or rushed to basements of apartments blocks or other buildings when air-raid warnings sounded.

Zelensky and Putin both say they are willing to negotiate as war rages in Ukraine

Russian troops have entered Kyiv from the north, Ukraine’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that called on residents to prepare to fight, even as the presidents of both Russia and Ukraine said they were willing to negotiate.

As Russian forces pushed toward his office in the centre of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I want to appeal once again to the President of the Russian Federation. Fighting is taking place all over Ukraine. Let’s sit down at the negotiating table to stop the deaths of people,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video address from inside the Presidential Administration building in the capital.

Separately, Mr. Putin reportedly told Chinese President Xi Jinping that he was willing to hold high-level talks with Ukraine.

“The United States and NATO have long ignored Russia’s reasonable security concerns, repeatedly reneged on their commitments, and continued to advance military deployment eastward, challenging Russia’s strategic bottom line,” Mr. Putin told Xi, according to China’s state-run CCTV. “Russia is willing to conduct high-level negotiations with Ukraine.”

NATO leaders meet to reassure allies near Russia, Ukraine

U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts will seek Friday to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank that their security is guaranteed as Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine closes in on the capital Kyiv.

With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealing for help, NATO members ranging from Russia’s neighbour Estonia in the north down around the west of conflict-hit Ukraine to Bulgaria on the Black Sea coast triggered urgent consultations about their security. Only Hungary refrained.

The leaders, meeting via video conference, plan to take stock of NATO’s own military buildup. The world’s biggest security organization previously had around 5,000 troops stationed in the Baltic countries – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – and Poland, but has significantly beefed up its defenses over the last three months.

“Make no mistake, we will defend every ally against any attack on every inch of NATO territory,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who will chair the summit, told reporters Thursday. “An attack on one ally will trigger a response from the whole alliance.”

The leaders are likely to consider Friday whether to activate the NATO Response Force, which can number up to 40,000 troops. A quickly deployable land brigade that is part of the NRF – made up of 5,000 troops and run by France alongside Germany, Poland, Portugal and Spain – is already on heightened alert.

Taiwan to join ‘democratic countries’ in sanctions on Russia

Taiwan will join “democratic countries” in imposing sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, the government said on Friday, with the world’s largest contract chipmaker TSMC saying it would comply with all export control rules.

The crisis is being watched closely in Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory and which has faced increased military pressure from Beijing over the last two years.

“We very harshly condemn such an act of invasion and will join democratic countries to jointly impose sanctions,” Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters in Taipei without giving details.

The foreign ministry echoed that message while Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua said the island would “harshly scrutinize” exports to Russia and “co-ordinate” with unspecified allies on further actions. She also did not elaborate.

Final moments of Ukrainian border guards’ fierce stand on Snake Island against Russian war ship become rallying cry

A defiant last stand by a small group of Ukrainian border guards defending a Black Sea outpost has become a new rallying cry for a country under attack by Russian forces – and those in Russia who oppose the war.

Thirteen people were stationed on Snake, or Zminiy Island, a low-lying piece of land 35 kilometres from the Ukraine coast that has long delineated the country’s southwestern border.

On Thursday, as Russian forces invaded Ukraine from numerous directions, a warship approached the island, just 0.17 square kilometres in size, and ordered the men to stand down.

“I suggest you surrender your weapons and capitulate. Otherwise, I will open fire,” a male voice says, in audio posted to the Internet that has now been viewed millions of times. “Do you copy?”

“This is it,” one Ukrainian border guard says. “Should I tell him to go fuck himself?”

“Just in case,” another man says.

The first man then responds to the warship: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.”

Moments later, the Russian forces attacked, killing all 13 men.

Their defiance earned praise from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who named the 13 men and said they had “died heroically.” Each man will be honoured as a “hero of Ukraine,” he said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is Russia’s ‘number one target’

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed on Friday to stay put in the capital Kyiv as Russian troops launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine from several fronts.

“(The) enemy has marked me down as the number one target. “My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.”

As Russian forces pushed toward his office in the centre of Kyiv, Zelensky also called for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I want to appeal once again to the president of the Russian Federation. Fighting is taking place all over Ukraine. Let’s sit down at the negotiating table to stop the deaths of people,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video address from inside the Presidential Administration building in the capital.

An estimated 100,000 people fled as explosions and gunfire rocked major cities. Mr. Zelensky said over 130 military personnel and civilians had been killed in the fighting.

Russia’s target appears to be capturing Kyiv and toppling the government, according to U.S and Ukrainian officials.

Opinion: Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is a bigger gamble than he imagines

It happened exactly as American intelligence officials said it would; the only unknown was the timing. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin filled in that final detail when he launched an invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea.

Ukrainians who just wanted to live their lives in peace awoke to shells, missiles and air attacks, striking at military bases and airports across the country, and around the capital of Kyiv. Russian troops streamed across multiple borders. The Ukrainian military fought back as best it could. Traffic jams of refugees streamed west.

This unprovoked attack, justified by nothing more than invented grievances, takes the world back to a darker, lawless age. “President Putin has reintroduced war to the European continent,” the leaders of the G7, which includes Canada, said on Thursday.

Mr. Putin’s assault on decency is so outrageous that strongly worded condemnations from the G7, and co-ordinated Canadian, U.S. and European sanctions – on Russia, its banks, its government officials and the oligarchs that benefit from Mr. Putin’s tyranny – feel inadequate.

Russian troops push in to Kyiv

Russian troops have entered Kyiv from the north, Ukraine’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that called on residents to prepare to fight.

The Defence Ministry said Russian reconnaissance units were now in the Obolon neighbourhood, close to Kyiv’s historic Podil district. “We ask citizens to inform about the movement of equipment!” the statement said. “Make Molotov cocktails, neutralize the occupier!”

The Ukrainian government said they had destroyed three bridges on the northern approach to the capital to slow the Russian advance.

A few hours later, as fighting moved closer to the centre of the city, the Interior Ministry announced it had distributed some 18,000 assault rifles to residents.

Overnight, there were loud explosions audible in the city. The site of one blast that was visited by The Globe on Friday appeared to have been caused by a projectile that landed metres from an apartment block in the city’s Darnitsky region, blowing windows and part of the outer wall off the 10-storey building. The Ukrainian military said it was a Russian cruise missile that had been shot down by the city’s air defences. Residents said many ambulances had arrived, but they were unsure how many people had been killed or injured.

Analysis: Biden’s tool box for dealing with Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is limited

Ground troops – out of the question. Contemplating a no-fly zone over Ukraine – far too late for that. Moral suasion – it produced nothing. Sanctions – they may bite but won’t prompt Russia to balk.

What’s an American President possessing the world’s most powerful military force and at the head of an alliance of 28 countries on the continent of Europe to do?

This is a vital question when a determined Russian President with nearly a million troops decides to have his way with a country possessing a military about a quarter that size and a fighter aircraft force a tenth the size of Russia’s?

Ukrainian forces down aircraft over Kyiv

Ukrainian forces downed an enemy aircraft over Kyiv in the early hours of Friday, which then crashed into a residential building and set it on fire, said Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister.

It was unclear whether the aircraft was manned or whether it could be a missile. Kyiv municipal authorities said at least eight people were injured when the object crashed into an apartment block.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Kyiv had come under a missile attack.

A series of explosions were heard in Kyiv earlier, which Herashchenko said were the sounds of air defences firing at the aircraft. Further explosions could be heard just before dawn, a Reuters witness said.

Airline industry shifts attention to Russia risks after Ukraine closure

Alaska’s Anchorage Airport said airlines have started making inquiries about capacity in case routes over Russia are impacted due to the Ukraine crisis, in a sign of the conflict’s growing fallout for the global aviation industry.

The airport was a popular refuelling hub for long-haul flights during the Cold War, when Western airlines were unable to access Russian airspace on routes from Europe to Asia.

Japan Airlines cancelled its Thursday evening flight to Moscow, citing potential safety risks, while Britain closed its airspace to Russian airlines, including Aeroflot, as the conflict’s impact on the industry widened beyond Ukraine to Russia.

Airspace in Ukraine, Moldova, parts of Belarus and in southern Russia near the Ukraine border was closed, giving airlines a narrower range of routing options.

Emirates said it had made minor routing changes to Stockholm, Moscow, St. Petersburg and some U.S. flights that were hit by the airspace closings, leading to slightly longer flight times.

OPSGROUP, an aviation industry co-operative that shares information on flight risks, said any aircraft travelling through Russian airspace should have contingency plans in place for closed airspace due to risks or sanctions.

Several explosions heard in Kyiv early Friday as Russian forces pressed on with assault

Explosions were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv early Friday local time as Russian forces pressed on with a full-scale invasion in the first full day of fighting and could eventually rewrite the global post-Cold War security order.

After using air strikes on cities and military bases, Russian military units moved swiftly to take on Ukraine’s seat of government and its largest city in what U.S. officials suspect is a brazen attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to dismantle the government and replace it with his own regime.

Ukrainian leaders pleaded for help as civilians piled into trains and cars to flee, and hotels in Kyiv were being evacuated amid early indications of an assault.

One senior U.S. defense official described the attack so far as the first salvo in a multi-phase invasion aimed at seizing key population centers and “decapitating” Ukraine’s government.

Opinion: Are allies willing to bear the high cost of making Putin pay?

“We cannot allow this to be the end of the post-World-War-Two rules-based order,” Chrystia Freeland told reporters on Thursday. “It could be.”

Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister often talks about the rules-based order, and it can sound academic, but in this case it was an appropriately ominous warning.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has, at any rate, shattered norms that the world counted on to deter catastrophe, using great-power military might to invade a democracy.

Ukrainians now face bombs and bloody war, but Ms. Freeland’s point was that the threat is not only to Ukraine, but a challenge to the order that has protected democracies from domination by stronger powers. For a long time, autocrats didn’t dare do this, and if nothing is done now, someone – not necessarily just Mr. Putin – will do it again.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted, more than once, that Mr. Putin can’t be allowed to benefit from invasion – and it should be obvious that Canada has every interest in uniting with other democracies to make Mr. Putin pay.

The threat of sanctions didn’t deter Mr. Putin from invasion, but Mr. Biden argued that the effects of the measures – especially over time – will so weaken Russia’s economy that Mr. Putin will face a difficult choice.

Russian embassy in Canada says NATO ‘created immediate danger’

The Russian embassy is Canada released a statement Thursday that attempted to justify President Vladimir Putin’s actions.

It said the “political-military situation” and NATO’s military posture in Europe “created a clear and immediate danger for Russia that could not have been mitigated by any other means than those Russia has to use today.”

The embassy said Russia’s repeated efforts to negotiate a new security arrangement in Europe have been scorned by the West.

It warned “attempts by the West to turn Ukraine into a kind of ‘anti- Russia’ will not succeed.”

The embassy said for two decades Moscow had expressed concern over enlargement of NATO, a development it called “a clear threat to our security.” The embassy said Russia had proposed solutions premised on principles including “not strengthening security at the expense of others.” It said this included efforts to incentivize Ukraine to “join this dialogue.”

The embassy said however Russia’s efforts were “put on the back burner or haughtily ridiculed.”

It concluded by saying “the road to peace remains open” and that Russia remains receptive to “meaningful dialogue” on a new security arrangement in “Europe and the Euro-Atlantic.”

Afghan refugees stuck in Ukraine with no exit in sight

Afghan refugees who fled to Ukraine after the Taliban takeover of their home country are terrified that they have once again found themselves in a war zone, with no obvious exit.

“Everything is finished,” said Jawed Haqmal, who worked as a translator for the Canadian military in Afghanistan and has been living in a Kyiv hotel with his family since the end of August. “Just like a war zone, everyone is running to the shelters, streets are full of the army. Just like war, the same as what was going on in front of the airport of Kabul on the last day. The same thing is going on here.”

Haqmal’s family of 12 arrived in Ukraine after being evacuated from Afghanistan by Ukrainian special forces, a mission that was carried out following a request from The Globe and Mail to the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Their stay in Ukraine was supposed to be a temporary stop on their way to Canada. The family, and others, are now trapped in Ukraine due to a bureaucratic delay.

Aidan Strickland, a spokesperson for Immigration Minister Sean Fraser, said IRCC “has been made aware of complex cases of Afghan citizens who are seeking resettlement to Canada, but are currently in Ukraine.”

Ukrainian-Canadian community rallies as Russian forces attack Ukraine

Canada has the largest Ukrainian population in the world, outside Russia and Ukraine. About 1.4 million Canadians are of Ukrainian ancestry, not counting significant additional populations of non-ethnic Ukrainians, among them Mennonites, Jews, Poles, Romanians and Swedes.

At the Ukrainian Cultural and Education Centre in Winnipeg, Yulia Zmerzla had a sleepless night watching the news in both Ukrainian and Russian. She came to Canada eight years ago and still has many friends and family in Ukraine, including her parents. “I spoke to my parents today, and they told me that life will never be the same again after today,” she said, through tears.

On Thursday, demonstrations were popping up in Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver to denounce Russia’s attack on Ukraine, and fundraisers were being set up to raise money both for humanitarian aid and military supplies for the country.

Jurij R. Klufas, president of the Ukrainian National Federation of Canada, said he, too, was having trouble reconciling the reality of what was happening in Ukraine, something he said seemed more like a relic of a primitive past, “when everybody used to resolve issues with war.”

“It’s very troubling to see at this time, in modern society, having somebody push in a military way their colonial convictions from the last two centuries,” he said. “It’s kind of almost crazy, surreal, to be seeing this kind of thing happening in today’s modern society, and in Europe.”

Taiwan to join countries sanctioning Russia

Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said the island will join “democratic countries” to put sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, although he did not give details.

The crisis is being watched closely in Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory and has faced increased military pressure by Beijing over the last two years.

”We very harshly condemn such an act of invasion and will join democratic countries to jointly impose sanctions,” Su told reporters in Taipei without giving details. Taiwan Economy Minister Wang Mei-hua told reporters the island will “harshly scrutinize” exports to Russia and “co-ordinate” with unspecified allies for further actions. She did not elaborate.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed on Friday to stay in Kyiv as his troops battled Russian invaders who are advancing toward the capital in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials say Russia aims to capture Kyiv and topple the government.

“(The) enemy has marked me down as the number one target,” Zelensky warned in a video message. “My family is the number two target. They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state.”

“I will stay in the capital. My family is also in Ukraine.”

UN gives $20-million to scale up Ukraine humanitarian aid

The United Nations announced it is immediately allocating $20 million to scale up UN humanitarian operations in Ukraine.

Secretary-general Antonio Guterres made the announcement saying the UN and its humanitarian partners “are committed to staying and delivering, to support people in Ukraine in their time of need … regardless of who or where they are.”

“With deaths rising, we are seeing images of fear, anguish and terror in every corner of Ukraine,” the UN chief said. “People – everyday innocent people – always pay the highest price.”

UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said the $20 million from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund will support emergency operations along the contact line in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk and in other areas of the country, and will “help with health care, shelter, food, and water and sanitation to the most vulnerable people affected by the conflict.”

Watch: History professor from Kyiv on Ukraine’s response to Russia invasion

They came in a steady stream, looking weary and confused as they made their way through the train station in Przemysl, a small Polish city about 10 kilometres from the border with Ukraine. Some had come from Kyiv, others from Lviv, in western Ukraine, and still more from farther east.

Olgah Martynyuk, a history professor at Kyiv’s Polytechnic Institute, made a mad rush for the train after hearing bombs drop around the capital Thursday morning. “I woke up from blasts in the morning and I packed up,” Prof. Martynyuk said as she sat in Przemysl’s train station after a 14-hour journey. She was happy to be safe but felt unsettled about leaving her country. “I still feel enormous guilt,” she said. “What did we do wrong that all of this is happening?”

Poland has been bracing for months for the possibility of as many as one million refugees from Ukraine in the wake of a Russian invasion. Preparations have been slow to roll out, and on Thursday officials in Przemysl, the Polish city closest to the border, still appeared to be scrambling to come up with some kind of support structure.

On Thursday night the train station was expecting as many as 2,000 refugees to arrive on two trains from Kyiv early Friday morning. But just two local officials were on hand to help. “I’m afraid that we will lose control,” one said.
