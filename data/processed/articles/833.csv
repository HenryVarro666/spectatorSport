KYIV, Ukraine -- Associated Press journalists around Ukraine and beyond are documenting military activity during Russia's invasion. With disinformation rife and social media amplifying military claims and counterclaims, determining exactly what is happening is difficult. Here’s a look at what could be confirmed Friday.

Activity with direct witnesses:

-- Explosions heard from central Kyiv, about 800 meters (half a mile) from the president’s headquarters.

-- Multistory apartment building in Kyiv hit by shelling, with major damage, on the eastern side of the Dneiper River that cuts through the capital, 13 kilometers (8 miles) southeast of the government quarter.

— Shooting near a main thoroughfare leading into central Kyiv from the south.

— Ukrainian soldiers evacuating an unmarked military vehicle damaged by gunfire in Kyiv, in the Obolon district about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of the government quarter.

— Ukrainian military establishing defensive positions at bridges around Kyiv. Armored personnel carriers driving through Kyiv streets. Ukrainian authorities placed snowplows at some spots along Kyiv roads to force traffic to slow down.

— Russian missile launcher seen on the edge of the northeastern city of Kharkiv, shelling heard in the distance.

— A bridge destroyed at Ivankiv, some 60 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of Kyiv.

Announced by Ukrainian and Russian authorities, and others:

— A second Russian military transport plane was shot down Saturday near Bila Tserkva, 50 miles (85 kilometers) south of Kyiv, according to two American officials with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine.

— Russian Airborne Forces on the outskirts of Kyiv early Saturday attacked Ukrainian units on three sides, but Ukrainian troops were able to repel some of the assaults, according to two American officials with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine.

— Ukraine’s military said Friday it had shot down a Russian military transport plane carrying paratroopers near Vasylkiv, a city 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Kyiv, an account confirmed by a senior American intelligence official. It was unclear how many were on board. Transport planes can carry up to 125 paratroopers. Russia has not commented on the incident.

— A senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of conditions on the ground in Ukraine said the capital city of Kyiv was under missile bombardment late Friday night. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had no immediate information on what targets might have been hit.

— Russia's military said it has taken over Melitopol, a city in the Zaporizhzhia region in southern Ukraine 50 kilometers (about 31 miles) off of the Azov Sea coast. The claim could not be independently verified.

— Ukraine's nuclear energy regulator said higher than usual gamma radiation levels have been detected in the area around the Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the world’s worst nuclear accident, after it was seized by the Russian military. The International Atomic Energy Agency said the reported levels don’t pose any danger to the public. The Russian Defense Ministry said radiation levels in the area have remained normal.

— Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said gunfire and explosions in several parts of the city came as Ukrainian troops were fighting groups of Russian saboteurs. He also said five explosions hit an area near a major power plant on the city’s eastern outskirts. No electricity outages were immediately reported.

— U.K. Defense Intelligence Chief Sir Jim Hockenhull says Russia launched a series of strikes on targets in Kyiv overnight and that multiple rocket launchers have been employed in Chernihiv and Kharkiv.

— Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that 137 “heroes,” including 10 military officers, had been killed. The Ukrainian military said it has killed over 1,000 Russian troops while fending off Moscow’s invasion. The Russian military hasn’t reported any casualties during the attack. Neither claim could be independently verified.

— The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said its staffers have so far verified at least 127 civilian casualties, 25 people killed and 102 injured, mostly from shelling and airstrikes.

— The Russian military said it took control of an airport outside the Ukrainian capital. The airport in Hostomel, a town 7 kilometers (4 miles) from Kyiv, has a runway long enough to receive all types of aircraft, including the biggest cargo planes. Its seizure allows Russia to airlift troops directly to Kyiv’s outskirts.

— The Russian Defense Ministry said its forces sealed the cities of Sumy and Konotop in northeastern Ukraine. It said they have knocked out 211 military infrastructure facilities. The claims couldn’t be independently confirmed.

— The mayor said a school building was hit by a Ukrainian shell in the rebel-held city of Horlivka in eastern Ukraine, killing its headteacher and a teacher; rebels who hold Donetsk said the city's main hospital was damaged by shelling but there were no casualties.

— Moldova’s national naval agency said a Moldovan-flagged ship was hit by a missile in “neutral waters” in the Black Sea, leaving two crew members seriously injured.

— A U.S. defense official said a Russian amphibious assault was underway, and thousands of Russian naval infantry were moving ashore from the Sea of Azov, west of Mariupol. The official said Ukrainian air defenses have been degraded but are still operating, and that about a third of the combat power that Russia massed around Ukraine is now in the country.

— British Intelligence Chief Sir Jim Hockenhull says Russia launched a series of strikes on targets in Kyiv overnight and that multiple rocket launchers have been employed in Chernihiv and Kharkiv.

A Ukrainian senior appears to scold Russian soldiers laying siege to a city in southeast Ukraine on Friday night, according to a video shared on social media.

The man, who has not yet been identified, can be seen in the video reprimanding two Russian soldiers in the city of Melitopol in Ukraine's southeastern Zaporizhzhya region.

In the video, according to a translation, the man can be heard saying in Russian: ""What the fuck are you doing here?""

He goes on to say: ""You have your country. We have ours. Don't you have problems in your own country to solve?""

The footage, circulated on Twitter, Telegram and appears to have originated on TikTok. An army vehicle in the video can be seen with the 'Z' emblem painted on it, as seen on other Russian military vehicles involved in the invasion of Ukraine.

Further up the street, under a sign for Melitopol, a tank and other armored vehicles can be seen.

Russia claims it captured Melitopol on Friday night. The country's defense ministry said that troops were welcomed into the city, having been met with little resistance. ""Some elderly citizens took to the streets [waving] red flags,"" the defense ministry said on Saturday, per the Russian news agency Tass.

The UK disputes this. On Saturday, British armed forces minister James Heappey said that Melitopol remains in Ukrainian hands and that Russian troops have been ""held up"" by ""incredible"" Ukrainian resistance.

Russian assaults were also met with fierce resistance in Kyiv overnight, BBC News reported.

There were ""heavy battles ongoing"" in the Vasylkiv district of Kyiv, the Ukrainian Armed Forces said on Facebook on Saturday.

Zelenskyy calls on EU to 'do more' after member states refuse to fast-track Ukraine's application to be a member

In a Friday video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed European Union leaders for refusing to fast-track Ukraine's application to join the bloc and called on them to ""do more.""

Leaders of the 27 EU member states met in Versailles, France, on Thursday, and ultimately concluded that the bloc would not speed up Ukraine's application.

Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland were in favor, while France, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands were not, The Guardian reported. Accession to the EU typically takes multiple years.

Zelenskyy said on Friday: ""A very important meeting of the leaders of the European Union took place yesterday ... We know what was said at this meeting. What all leaders said. Who specifically spoke. Who supported. Who remained silent.""

""How do we evaluate the decision made? It's very simple: it must be stronger. This is not what we expect.""

He said: ""The European Union must do more. It must do more for us, for Ukraine. And for itself.""

Notably, Zelenskyy could be seen outdoors in the video. Most of his video addresses were filmed indoors amid multiple reports suggesting he was the target of assassination attempts.

Ukraine is a heavily industrialised country, with many mines, chemical processing plants and metallurgical works, risking a large technological catastrophe. On the 24th, residents of Odesa were warned that the Odesa Port Plant might be hit. The plant, one of the largest in Ukraine, produces ammonia, urea and other chemical products. Such sites are high risk objects, not just through direct damage, but also through forced shutdown, power cuts or lack of personnel to operate them safely, situations that can arise when they get caught up in fighting. Industrial control systems can also be affected by cyber operations. Many of Ukraine’s major cities contain potentially hazardous industries, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih, Mariupol and Odesa. On the 25th a huge fire was reported at the Kharkiv Tractor Plant.

During the last eight years, there has been significant concern over the risks of an environmental emergency in the heavily industrialised Donbas region. Communities and forces on both sides of the line of contact are aware of the threats but the intensification of conflict carries with it greater risks of an incident, particularly where the largely static line of contact moves. On the 22nd the area around Luhanska Thermal Power Plant came under heavy shelling and a transformer was struck, causing a fire, while on the 25th, there were reports of a fire at an oil tank farm in the Kirovsky district of Donetsk. The site was alleged to have been struck by a drone in September 2021.

A slower onset environmental disaster may already be locked in for the Donbas due to the abandonment of groundwater pumping from the region’s coal mines. Research coincidentally published on the 24th showed the extent to which the ground has been deforming due to rising groundwater. Mine drainage is typically polluted with high levels of salts and metals and is already contaminating wells and drinking water sources, while subsidence can damage buildings and infrastructure. There are particular concerns over the discharge from the Yunkom mine, site of a nuclear test in the 1970s.

Beyond chemical, metallurgical and energy infrastructure, a grain elevator in the city of Uman was damaged on the 24th. Ukraine and Russia are major grain exporters and it is feared that price spikes will impact food security internationally, with particular concern over countries like Yemen. On the 24th the World Food Programme said: “The escalation of conflict in Ukraine is likely to further increase fuel and food prices and especially grains in the import-dependent country.”",https://ceobs.org/ukraine-invasion-rapid-overview-of-environmental-issues/
