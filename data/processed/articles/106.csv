Reach Her At', 'Tucker Reals']",,"A Fox News cameraman and a local producer working for the network were killed Monday in the same attack that left the network's correspondent Benjamin Hall injured as they reported near Ukraine's capital Kyiv, Fox News said confirmed Tuesday. The network said cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and fixer Oleksandra ""Sasha"" Kuvshynova were killed when their vehicle ""was struck by incoming fire"" while in the field with Hall.

Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott said Zakrzewski, who was based in London, had ""covered nearly every international story for Fox News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us,"" adding that ""his passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched.""

""He was profoundly committed to telling the story and his bravery, professionalism and work ethic were renowned among journalists at every media outlet,"" Scott said.

""Pierre Zakrzewski was an absolute legend at this network and his loss is devastating,"" Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer said on the air Tuesday. He quoted Fox president Jay Wallace as saying that other staff ""always felt an extra sense of reassurance when they arrived on the scene, and they saw that Pierre was there.""

""He was a professional, he was a journalist, and he was a friend,"" said Hemmer. ""We here at the Fox News Channel want to offer our deepest condolences to Pierre's wife, Michelle, and his entire family. Pierre Zakrzewski was only 55 years old, and we miss him already.""

Just last year, the network honored Zakrzewski with a Fox News Media Spotlight Award, which are meant to recognize ""extraordinary employees who go above and beyond, inside and outside the workplace.""

Scott said the 24-year-old Kuvshynova was ""incredibly talented"" and had spent weeks helping the network's crews navigate Kyiv, gathering information and communicating with sources, ""operating around the clock to make sure the world knew what was happening in her country.""

""Our team in Ukraine tells me that Sasha had a passion for music, the arts and photography and was a joy to work with,"" Scott said. ""Several of our correspondents and producers spent long days with her reporting the news and got to know her personally, describing her as hard-working, funny, kind and brave. Her dream was to connect people around the world and tell their stories and she fulfilled that through her journalism.""

Fox News senior producer Yonat Friling tweeted a tribute to Kuvshynova, calling her a ""beautiful brave woman.""

""She loved music and she was funny and kind,"" Friling wrote. ""She was 24 years old. She worked with our team for the past month and did a brilliant job. May her memory be a blessing.""

Fox offered no update on the condition of Hall, their correspondent wounded in the same attack, but said he remained hospitalized on Tuesday.

Anton Gerashchenko, advisor to Ukraine's ministry of internal affairs, said Kuvshynova and Zakrzewski were killed by ""artillery fire from Russian-fascist forces,"" but the network has not attributed their death to a specific nation.

Gulnoza Said, the Committee to Protect Journalists' Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, said in a statement that she was ""deeply saddened"" by reports of Zakrzewski and Kuvshynova's deaths.

""Reporting on this war is a vital public service, and it has already claimed the lives of at least two other journalists in just a few weeks,"" she said. ""Ukrainian and Russian authorities must do their utmost to ensure safety of all journalists, and to thoroughly investigate attacks on the press.""

On Monday, the network confirmed that Hall ""was injured while newsgathering outside of Kyiv in Ukraine.""

Scott said in a Monday memo to employees that the network had a ""minimal level of details right now, but Ben is hospitalized and our teams on the ground are working to gather additional information as the situation quickly unfolds.""

News of the attack on the Fox crew came just a day after another American journalist, Brent Renaud, was shot and killed in Ukraine. The head of Kyiv's regional police force said Renaud was killed and another journalist was wounded by Russian forces in the town of Irpin, outside the capital of Kyiv, as they were traveling to film refugees.

Hall recently made headlines for rebuking Greg Gutfield, co-host of the Fox News political talk show ""The Five,"" after he said on-air that the reporting from Ukraine ""is a lot like other stories that we've gone through in the digital age in which an image is taken and then played over and over and over again to create some kind of emotional response out of you, because that makes a profit for news companies.""

""This is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response,"" Hall said. ""This is absolutely what's happening.""

""It is an absolute catastrophe,"" he added. ""And the people caught in the middle are the ones who are really suffering.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pierre-zakrzewski-fox-news-killed-kyiv-ukraine-attack-benjamin-hall-wounded/

A Fox News crew came under fire yesterday while reporting in Horenka, outside of Kyiv, Impakter learned last night, as was subsequently confirmed by Fox News in an article. Two journalists, members of the crew, were fatally hit: Producer Oleksandra Kuvshynova and veteran cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski (age 55) were killed. Reporter Benjamin Hall was injured with shrapnel wounds in his legs and has been hospitalized and put in intensive care.

Benjamin Hall’s situation is stable and he’s responding well to the surgery and recovering. He is awake and speaking, but going through more medical care, as confirmed by sources from the Territorial Defence Forces headquartered in Kyiv.

“The safety of our entire team of journalists in Ukraine and the surrounding regions is our top priority and of the utmost importance,” said the released statement of Fox News.

Hall, who currently covers the State Department for Fox News, started his career as a war correspondent, reporting from the Middle East and Africa. He has worked for several global publications since then, including The New York Times, Sunday Times, Agence France-Presse, and BBC.



The day before Hall was injured, on Sunday, March 13, US journalist Brent Renaud was shot dead in Irpin by the Russian army. Russian troops opened fire on the car of Renaud and another journalist in Irpin, about 10km (6 miles) northwest of the capital, the Kyiv police force said on Sunday.

That same day, Irpin Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn announced that all journalists will be forbidden from entering Irpin, a measure the mayor said was put in place to protect journalists and Ukrainian soldiers alike.

American journalist Juan Arredondo has also been hospitalized after being wounded by Russian forces in Ukraine. In the social media footage of him at Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv, Juan describes being shot at by Russian forces while driving through a checkpoint in Irpin, Ukraine, while on the way to film refugees leaving the city.

On Monday, March 14, the Sky News team faced several shootings from the Russian army. Chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay and his team were attacked near Kyiv. Camera operator Richie Mockler took two rounds to his body armour, Stuart was wounded.

The first reported case of an attack on a foreign journalist was on March 7, when Russian occupying forces shelled the car of Swiss journalist Guillaume Briquet and robbed him in the Mykolaiv region. They stole his passport, 3,000 euros in cash, personal staff, a helmet, video footage and his laptop.

Press freedom groups have denounced the violence journalists are facing while covering the war. The Committee to Protect Journalists, after the death of Renaud, called on Russian forces to “stop all violence against journalists and other civilians at once.”

As Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott pointed out, “This is a stark reminder for all journalists who are putting their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from a war zone.”

Killed in the attack were Pierre Zakrzewski, a longtime war photojournalist for Fox News, and Oleksandra Kuvshynova, a Ukrainian journalist. Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall was seriously injured and remains hospitalized.

""The truth is the target,"" Ukraine's Ministry of Defence said Tuesday, commenting on the attack of journalists in the Fox News crew.

Zakrzewski's death was announced by Fox News Media chief executive Suzanne Scott. Scott said in a memo to employees that he was killed when the vehicle the Fox News crew was travelling in came under fire.

Kuvshynova's death was announced by Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Ukrainian interior minister. Gerashchenko blamed artillery shelling by Russian forces.

The deaths come as journalists working in Ukraine increasingly find themselves coming under fire. Brent Renaud, an award-winning American documentarian, was killed Sunday in an attack that also injured journalist Juan Arredondo. A Sky News team released footage earlier this month showing them being violently ambushed.

Scott on Tuesday remembered Zakrzewski as a journalist who was ""profoundly committed to telling the story and his bravery, professionalism and work ethic were renowned among journalists at every media outlet.""

""He was wildly popular — everyone in the media industry who has covered a foreign story knew and respected Pierre,"" Scott said.

Scott described Zakrzewski's talents as vast and said that ""there wasn't a role that he didn't jump in to help with in the field - from photographer to engineer to editor to producer. She said that he ""did it all under immense pressure with tremendous skill.""

Zakrzewski was a veteran photojournalist who had ""covered nearly every international story for Fox News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria,"" Scott said. He had been reporting from Ukraine since February.

Tributes immediately poured in from Zakrzewski's colleagues at Fox News.

Anchor Bill Hemmer, who broke the tragic news on the channel's air, described Zakrzewski as ""an absolute legend"" at the network.

Anchor John Roberts said he had worked with Zakrzewski ""many times around the world"" and described him as ""an absolute treasure.""

Foreign correspondent Trey Yingst, who is also reporting from Ukraine, wrote on Twitter, ""I don't know what to say. Pierre was as good as they come. Selfless. Brave. Passionate. I'm so sorry this happened to you.""

Zakrzewski's counterparts at other networks also remembered him.

Clarissa Ward, CNN's chief international correspondent, said she had ""the great privilege"" of having worked with Zakrzewski and ""the even greater privilege of calling him a friend.""

""An extraordinary spirit and tremendous talent and one of the kindest, most gracious colleagues on the road,"" Ward wrote on Twitter. ""Absolutely heartbreaking.""

Fox News had just recognized Zakrzewski in December as one of the network's ""unsung heroes."" He was described at the time as a journalist who ""risks his life in war zones to get the story for Fox News.""

Another journalist, Benjamin Hall, was injured in the attack.

CEO Suzanne Scott said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon that Ms Kuvshynova, 24, was killed when the vehicle the three were traveling in was struck by incoming fire in the field.

She was working as a freelance consultant for the Fox News team in Ukraine at the time of her death.

The attack also claimed the life of Fox News cameraman Mr Zakrzewski and hospitalised State Department correspondent Mr Hall, the network previously confirmed.

Ms Scott said they held off on reporting the death of Ms Kuvshynova earlier “out of respect for her family whom we have been in touch with throughout and we extend our deepest condolences to them”.

In a memo sent to Fox News staff, the CEO described the 24-year-old as “incredibly talented” talent with a “passion for music” who had spent several weeks with the team on the ground making sure “the world knew what was happening in her country”.

“In our efforts to keep you updated on yesterday’s tragic events, we want to report that journalist Oleksandra ‘Sasha’ Kuvshynova was also killed alongside our cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire yesterday while in the field with Benjamin Hall,” she wrote.

“Sasha was just 24 years old and was working as a consultant for us in Ukraine. She was helping our crews navigate Kyiv and the surrounding area while gathering information and speaking to sources.

“She was incredibly talented and spent weeks working directly with our entire team there, operating around the clock to make sure the world knew what was happening in her country.

“Our team in Ukraine tells me that Sasha had a passion for music, the arts and photography and was a joy to work with. Several of our correspondents and producers spent long days with her reporting the news and got to know her personally, describing her as hardworking, funny, kind and brave.

“Her dream was to connect people around the world and tell their stories and she fulfilled that through her journalism.”

The network shared a photo of Ms Kuvshynova alongside Mr Zakrzewski and correspondent Trey Yingst.

Anchor Martha MacCallum paid tribute to the freelancer for her “courageous, courageous work” live on air on Monday afternoon.

“We ask you to think of [her family], to keep them in your prayers as they struggle with the loss of their young daughter,” she said.

“Just 24 years old doing courageous, courageous work. Of course, along with the family of Pierre and so many others who have lost loved ones during the war.

“We will miss him and we are grateful for the extraordinary work and the opportunity to work with him over the years as well.

“We await more news, which we will share with you when we can, on the condition of our Benjamin Hall.”

Senior Field Producer Yonat Friling also paid tribute to the “beautiful brave woman” who had worked with the team for around a month, doing a “brilliant job” in a social media post.

“In yesterday’s attack near Kyiv, we have lost a beautiful brave woman - Oleksandra Kuvshinova - Sasha,” she tweeted.

“She loved music and she was funny and kind. she was 24 years old. She worked with our team for the past month and did a brilliant job. May her memory be a blessing.”

Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence earlier said on Twitter that both Mr Zakrzewski and Ms Kuvshynova had been killed in Monday’s attack, while Mr Hall had lost part of his leg.

Fox previously announced that Mr Hall - a British-American journalist who has previously written for The Independent - had been hospitalised with injuries close to Kyiv on Monday afternoon.

The network said it had a “minimal level of details” about what happened and the extent of his injuries were unclear.

“Earlier today, our correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured while news gathering outside of Kyiv in Ukraine,” the Monday memo read.

“We have a minimal level of details right now. Ben is hospitalised and our teams on the ground are working to gather additional information as the situation quickly unfolds.

“The safety of our entire team of journalists in Ukraine and the surrounding regions is our top priority and of the utmost importance.

“This is a stark reminder for all journalists who are putting their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from the war zone. We will update everyone as we know more. Please keep Ben and his family in your prayers.”

The network did not confirm the deaths of the cameraman or freelance consultant at the time.

On Tuesday morning, Fox News then announced that Mr Zakrzewski was killed in the same attack.

“It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that we share the news this morning regarding our beloved cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski. Pierre was killed in Horenka, outside of Kyiv, Ukraine. Pierre was with Benjamin Hall newsgathering when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire,” the statement from Ms Scott read.

“Pierre was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for FOX News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us. His passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched. Based in London, Pierre had been working in Ukraine since February. His talents were fast and there wasn’t a role that he didn’t jump in to help with in the field - from photographer to engineer to editor to producer - and he did it all under immense pressure with tremendous skill.

“He was profoundly committed to telling the store and his bravery, professionalism and work ethic were renowned among journalists at every media outlet. He was wildly popular - everyone in the media industry who has covered a foreign story knew and respected Pierre.”

“We extend our deepest condolences to Pierre’s wife Michelle and family - please keep them all in your prayers. And please continue to pray for Benjamin Hall, who remains hospitalized in Ukraine. We will continue to be in touch with any further updates as needed.”

Hours later, Ms Kuvshynova’s death was also confirmed by the network.

The US State Department said that the Biden administration will do “everything possible” to help Mr Hall and said its thoughts were with Mr Zakrzewski’s family.

“All of us know Ben, we’ve travelled the world with him. Many of you knew Pierre... our thoughts are with Pierre’s loved ones and his family... all of us here at the department are rooting for Ben,” said spokesperson Ned Price in a press briefing on Tuesday.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also sent her condolences to the cameraman’s family on Tuesday.

Monday’s attack came just one day after an award-winning American journalist was shot and killed by Russian forces in Irpin while on an assignment for TIME magazine.

Brent Renaud was in a car on route to report on Ukrainian refugees trying to evacuate when the vehicle was ambushed by Vladimir Putin’s troops, according to Ukrainian officials.

TIME confirmed later that the filmmaker had been “in the region working on a TIME Studios project focused on the global refugee crisis”.

A second American journalist Juan Arredondo was also shot in the attack.

In a video filmed as he was being treated in a nearby hospital, he recalled how a group of foreign journalists were traveling through a checkpoint in Irpin on their way to film Ukrainian refugees fleeing the city.

He said they made their way across one of the first bridges in Irpin and got into a car headed to a second bridge, when they came under fire.

“There was two of us, my friend Brent Renaud, and he’s been shot and left behind… I saw he was shot in the neck,” he said in the video.

A third journalist also traveling in the same car was also wounded, according to Ukrainian officials.

Mr Putin’s forces have repeatedly targeted journalists covering the war in Ukraine while also censoring coverage back in Russia as he tries to control the narrative around the unprovoked attack.

Back on 1 March, Ukrainian journalist and cameraman Yevhenii Sakun was one of five people killed when Russian forces shelled a TV tower in Kyiv.

Days later, two journalists for Sky News were shot by Russian forces but survived.

As the Fox News community mourns the deaths of Mr Zakrzewski and Ms Kuvshynova and prays for Mr Hall’s recovery, some of the networks own hosts have come under fire for promotive misleading narratives about the Russia-Ukraine conflict that increasingly flatter the Kremlin’s version of events.

The most controversial host is Tucker Carlson , whose show is reliably among the most-watched pundit on cable news. Having often questioned before the conflict why anyone in the US should root for Ukraine (a well-established American ally) against Russia (an authoritarian adversary), he has lately helped introduce a conspiracy theory about US-funded and operated biolabs in Ukraine that have supposedly been developing bioweapons.
