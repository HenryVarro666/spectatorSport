CNN cannot independently verify that there was any kind of chemical strike, or how many casualties were caused by any such incident.

Here's what we know:

Who reported the alleged attack? The reports emerged in a Telegram statement on Monday night from the Azov battalion, a Ukrainian unit defending Mariupol. They said Russian forces dropped ""a poisonous substance of unknown origin"" from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) onto Ukrainian military and civilians in the city.

Victims showed signs of ""respiratory failure,"" and the consequences ""were being clarified,"" the statement added.

Andriy Biletsky, Azov's first commander, said on Telegram that three individuals suffered from the effect of the unknown substance.

What did Mariupol officials say? A chemical attack has not been confirmed, Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, posted on Telegram. He said city officials were awaiting additional information from military forces, and speculated that in one possible scenario, the ""discharge of an unknown chemical"" could be ""a test for the reaction in general.""

How about the Ukrainian government? President Volodymyr Zelensky did not confirm a chemical attack but warned the possibility of one should be taken seriously. In his nightly address Monday, Zelensky said Russia could be preparing a new stage of terror.

""Today, the occupiers issued a new statement, which indicates that they are preparing a new stage of terror against Ukraine and our defenders. One of the occupiers' spokesmen said that they could use chemical weapons against the defenders of Mariupol. We take this as seriously as possible,"" Zelensky said.

What was he talking about? Zelensky may have been referring to an earlier statement by a spokesperson for the militia of the pro-Russian separatists in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) in eastern Ukraine.

In a Russian state television talk show, DNR spokesperson Eduard Basurin alluded to using chemical weapons to attack a Mariupol steel plant that is a stronghold for Ukrainian forces.

""Azovstal is a factory that was built during Soviet Union times,"" Basurin said. ""It is made of lot of concrete and iron. There are multilevel underground floors there, so it makes no sense to take this target by storm. Because you can lose a lot of your soldiers, and the enemy will not suffer the same losses.

""So at the moment we need to deal with blockade of this plant, find all exits and entrances — it is possible to get this done. And then turn to, I think, the chemical troops who will find a way to smoke moles out of their burrows.""

What have other countries said? The US has not confirmed the use of chemical weapons in Mariupol, but had previously warned the Ukrainians that Russia could use chemical agents in the city, State Department spokesperson Ned Price told CNN Monday.

In a statement Monday, press secretary John Kirby said The Pentagon cannot confirm the reports but US officials remain concerned about the potential Russian use of riot control agents.

Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss tweeted about working ""urgently with partners"" to verify the unconfirmed reports.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-12-22/h_90b112509e49989c66a0e86942f3a0f1

Ukrainian officials have reported further shelling by Russian forces and civilian casualties in parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which have become the focus of Russian attacks.

Serhii Haidai, head of Luhansk regional military administration, said the cities of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Kreminna, Novodruzhesk and Rubizhne had been targeted again, with 12 residential buildings struck in the last day.

""Unfortunately, there were casualties in Lysychansk -- one man died, three more people were injured,"" Haida said. ""The number of missile and air attacks on the Luhansk region has increased significantly.

Yesterday Lysychansk was bombed from planes and there was a missile attack.""

""It is most difficult to evacuate people from the cities of Popasna and Rubizhne,"" he said, as they were partially occupied by Russian forces. ""Our troops repel constant attacks. We can't go to certain areas of cities and pick up people due to constant shelling.""

""In the cities of Kreminna, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk evacuation takes place daily,"" Haidai said, adding it can sometimes be as many as 2,000 people.

He said that hospitals are still operating in Lysychansk and Severodonetsk.

Haidai said that heavy rains could impede Russian efforts to advance.

""Within last two days they began to collect hundreds of units of heavy equipment, pulling it closer to the front line. This suggests that the offensive should begin today and tomorrow, but it is raining today. According to the forecast, it will rain for several days.""

He said the rains would force vehicles to use roads, ""and this makes an easy target for our defenders. I hope the rains slows down the offensive.""

Ukrainian officials say Russian attacks by air are moving further west to the borders of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Mykola Lukashuk, head of Dnipropetrovsk Regional Council, said that the night in the Dnipropetrovsk region was ""restless.""

""We had two air attacks on Synelnykiv district at the border of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions,"" Lukashuk said, adding there were no casualties.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Tuesday that Russian forces continued to regroup along Ukraine's eastern borders and said it expected further ground attacks towards Popasna in Luhansk region and Kurakhove in Donetsk, ""with the aim of reaching the administrative boundaries of Donetsk region.""

It accused Russian forces of ""placing their military equipment and troops directly in residential facilities,"" as well as in ""agricultural enterprises, energy and social infrastructure facilities.""

The Armed Forces claimed that six Russian attacks in the east had been foiled Monday and tanks, armored vehicles and artillery systems had been destroyed.

As the fighting in the east continues, the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced nine evacuation corridors Tuesday, including from Mariupol and Berdiansk on the southeast coast, and Severodonetsk, Rubizhne and Lysychansk.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-12-22/h_5a51b6aadb4de60f0f4473977b1df362

It is very symbolic that Mr. Medvedchuk was detained on Cosmonautics Day. He has been hiding for 48 days. And finally decided to try to escape from our country. Well, for this ‘astronaut’ - in the bad sense of the word - the famous ‘Let’s go!’ did not work. I think it is especially cynical of him to use military camouflage. He tried to disguise himself like that. Such a ‘soldier’. Such a ‘patriot’.” Zelenskiy then proposed a prisoner exchange. Well, if Medvedchuk chose a military uniform for himself, he falls under the rules of wartime. I offer the Russian Federation to exchange this guy of yours for our boys and our girls who are now in Russian captivity. It is therefore important that our law enforcement officials and military also consider this possibility.” Speaking to Russians directly, the Ukrainian president added: “And let Medvedchuk be an example for you. Even the former oligarch did not escape, not to mention much more ordinary criminals from the Russian boondocks. We will get everyone.”

4d ago 23.49 The Pentagon will host leaders from the top eight US weapons manufacturers on Wednesday to discuss the industry’s capacity to meet Ukraine’s weapons needs if the war with Russia lasts years, two people familiar with the meeting said on Tuesday. Demand for weapons has shot up after Russia’s invasion spurred US and allied weapons transfers to Ukraine. Resupplying as well as planning for a longer war is expected to be discussed at the meeting, the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The Pentagon’s office of Acquisition and Sustainment, the weapons buyer for the US Department of Defense, will host the 90 minute meeting and Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks was expected to attend, one of the people said. The Pentagon has said that the most useful weapons are smaller systems such as Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which Washington and allies have been shipping to Ukraine on a nearly daily basis. The intense usage, as well as the battlefield effectiveness displayed by Ukrainian forces, has driven interest in restocking these weapons. Raytheon Technologies and Lockheed Martin Corp jointly produce Javelins, while Raytheon makes Stingers. Other top weapons makers are Boeing Co Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics and L3Harris Technologies .



4d ago 23.19 Chemical weapons watchdog ‘concerned’ by Mariupol reports The world’s chemical weapons watchdog has said it is “concerned” over reports of the use of chemical weapons in the besieged Ukrainian port of Mariupol.

Reports first emerged Monday from Ukraine’s Azov battalion that a Russian drone had dropped a “poisonous substance” on troops and civilians in Mariupol. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said in a statement: The Technical Secretariat of the OPCW is monitoring closely the situation in Ukraine. The Secretariat is concerned by the recent unconfirmed report of chemical weapons use in Mariupol, which has been carried in the media over the past 24 hours. This follows reports in the media over the past few weeks of shelling targeted at chemical plants located in Ukraine, together with accusations levelled by both sides around possible misuse of toxic chemicals. All 193 OPCW Member States, including the Russian Federation and Ukraine, are parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international treaty of major importance in the field of disarmament that has been in force since 1997. In doing so, they have solemnly and voluntarily committed never to develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, transfer or use chemical weapons.” The Secretariat has received from both the Russian Federation and Ukraine correspondence regarding threats of use of toxic chemicals as weapons and shared it with all 193 Member States of the OPCW as requested. — OPCW (@OPCW) April 12, 2022

4d ago 22.20 US President Joe Biden’s administration is expected to announce another $750 million in military assistance for Ukraine as soon as Wednesday, two US officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. The equipment would be funded using Presidential Drawdown Authority, or PDA, in which the president can authorise the transfer of articles and services from US stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency. One of the officials said final determinations were still being made about the mix of equipment. A senior congressional aide said the equipment to be announced would likely include heavy ground artillery systems to Ukraine, including howitzers. The White House said last week that it has provided more than $1.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the 24 February invasion of Ukraine.

The congressional aide said some lawmakers had been informed within the last 24 hours about the upcoming announcement, which was expected within the next 24 to 48 hours. Weapons shipments have included defensive anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles, as well as ammunition and body armour.





4d ago 22.02 Around 400 civilians have been buried in the town of Severodonetsk near the frontline in eastern Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion, the governor of the Lugansk region said on Tuesday. “In Severodonetsk, pits are dug with a tractor and graves are systematised in the register... During the 48 days of the war about 400 burials,” Sergiy Gaiday said, referring to civilians. In the nearby town of Lysychansk, he said, the dead “are buried in mass graves”. In smaller areas on the frontline, “burials are carried out by residents in the yards of residential areas” or “the bodies remain lying in the streets”.

4d ago 21.24 The European Union should impose an embargo on Russian oil as soon as possible and transition plans for other suppliers can be done “within a few weeks”, the chairmen of three parliamentarian committees has said. The EU is drafting proposals for an oil embargo on Russia although there was no agreement to ban Russian crude. EU diplomats said Berlin, which is heavily reliant on Russian oil, is not actively supporting an immediate embargo. Germany’s government expects to be able to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. German foreign affairs committee chairman Michael Roth said on Tuesday after a visit to Ukraine that cutting Russian oil would be a very important signal because it would affect Russia’s main source of income, Reuters reports. A quick EU decision could be combined with a transition phase like the import ban on Russian coal, which will come into effect from mid-August after EU ambassadors agreed on it last week, Roth said. “It can be done within a few weeks because there are other suppliers,” said Anton Hofreiter, the head of the Bundestag’s Europe’s Committee, adding that phase-out period to implement a ban on Russian coal was too long.



4d ago 21.18 The White House has just released the transcript of Joe Biden’s follow-up remarks about his earlier comments on genocide. Biden first used the word in passing on Tuesday at a domestic policy event in Iowa about the use of ethanol in petrol. “Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide half a world away,” he said. 01:03 Joe Biden accuses Vladimir Putin of committing genocide in Ukraine – video Questioned later as he boarded Air Force One for take off from Des Moines International Airport, Biden told journalists: Yes, I called it genocide. It has become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being - being able to be Ukrainian. And the amount - the evidence is mounting. It’s different than it was last week. The - more evidence is coming out of the - literally, the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine. And we’re going to only learn more and more about the devastation. And we’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.”

The equipment is considered to be “one of the best examples in its field” and the body cameras provided will be used by investigators and forensic scientists to capture traces of war crimes, the statement continued.



4d ago 20.25 Ukrainian security services have said “shackles are waiting” for all pro-Russian traitors of Ukraine after earlier announcing the arrest of Vladimir Putin’s closest ally and opposition politician, Viktor Medvedchuk. You can be a pro-Russian politician and work for the aggressor state for years. You may be hiding from justice lately. You can even wear a Ukrainian military uniform for camouflage… But will it help you escape punishment? Not at all! Shackles are waiting for you. Pro-Russian traitors and agents of the Russian secret services, remember - your crimes have no statute of limitations. And hiding places, wherever we find you!” Chairman of the SBU, Ivan Bakanov, said he thanked all officers involved in Medvedchuk’s arrest. No traitor will escape punishment and will be held accountable under the Law of Ukraine. For all the severity, for all the crimes of today, which led to his personal actions, including.” Ти можеш бути проросійським політиком і роками працювати на державу-агресора. Ти можеш ховатися від правосуддя останнім часом. Можеш навіть одягнути українську військову форму для маскування… Але чи допоможе тобі це втекти від покарання? Аж ніяк! Кайдани чекають на тебе.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, has been giving the daily US update on the war in Ukraine on Monday, April 11

He said the US believes those units could be refitted and resupplied and then sent into eastern Ukraine.

“We have seen some early indications that the Russians are in fact trying to resupply and reinforce their efforts in the Donbas,” Kirby said.

He referred to images of a column of Russian vehicles heading south towards the town of Izyum. “We believe that these are the early stages of a reinforcement effort by the Russians in the Donbas,” he said.

It’s not clear to us how many vehicles are in this convoy and what exactly they’re bringing. It does seem to be a mix of personnel-carrying vehicles as well as armoured vehicles and maybe some artillery, maybe some enabling capabilities.

Kirby had no confirmation on Russian claims to have struck Ukraine’s recently-acquired S-300 anti-aircraft system.

“We have seen the Russians hit airfields in the last couple of weeks... just over the last day or so,” he said.

What exactly they’re targeting at those fields is not perfectly clear to us, but I would just say this about Ukrainian air defense: they still have a lot of their air defense capability available to them. They have been asking for more, and so we are working with allies and partners to help get long-range air defense systems into Ukraine.

Highlight: Russian forces captured the Mariupol fishing port on April 10 / Infographics: The Institute for the Study of War

08:47 Institute for the Study of War: Russian forces made territorial gains in Mariupol in the past 24 hours and bisected Mariupol from the city center to the coast on April 10, according to the US-based Institute for the Study of War. Russians have isolated the remaining Ukrainian defenders in two main locations – the main port of Mariupol in the southwest, and the ""Azovstal"" steel plant in the east:

""Several geolocated videos released by pro-Russian accounts on April 10 confirm that Russian assaults from downtown Mariupol captured the fishing port west of the Azovstal steel plant, likely confirming Russian control of the city center as well""

In other directions, Russian forces again made little to no progress in frontal assaults in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but continue to cohere further reinforcements. Among other units, they are reinforcing the offensive in Izyum to link up with Russian positions in Luhansk Oblast.

08:32 General Staff: operational information as of 06:00, 11.04.2022 regarding the Russian invasion. Key points:

Russians continue to form an offensive group in the Slobozhanshchyna direction and are likely to continue the advance

Russia is preparing some units for redeployment into Ukraine, struggling with the enlistment of drivers to the army

There is a possibility of provocation by Russian forces in the territory of the unrecognized Transnistria region of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring country

It is expected that the invaders will continue to attack transport infrastructure to thwart the supplies to the frontline

the enemy continues the shelling and blockade of Kharkiv, recon of Ukrainian positions in Izium and assault on Mariupol. In the latter, fighting continues near the ""Azovstal"" plant and in the port area

in the Donetsk and Luhansk operational directions, Ukrainian forces repelled four attacks over the past 24 hours. 5 tanks, 8 armored and 6 soft-skinned vehicles, and 8 artillery systems were destroyed by the Ukrainian army.

07:18 (Updated) UK Ministry of Defence has published an intelligence update on Ukraine:

Russian forces' prior use of phosphorous munitions in the Donetsk Oblast (Region) raises the possibility of their future employment in Mariupol as fighting for the city intensifies.

Russian shelling has continued in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with Ukrainian forces repulsing several assaults resulting in the destruction of Russian tanks, vehicles, and artillery equipment.

Russia’s continued reliance on unguided bombs decreases its ability to discriminate when targeting and conducting strikes while greatly increasing the risk of further civilian casualties.

Previous intel on the Russian war crimes, recorded on April 10:

Further evidence of alleged Russian war crimes continues to emerge following Russian withdrawal from northern Ukraine. This includes the reported discovery of a makeshift grave containing deceased Ukrainian civilians near Burzova.

Allegations of sexual violence perpetrated by Russian military personnel persist.

It is likely that the mentioned mass grave is the one in Buzova village, where dozens of civilians were found dead after Russian forces withdrew at the end of March. Taras Didych, head of the Dmytrivka community that includes Buzova and several other nearby villages, told Ukrainian television that the bodies were found in a ditch near a petrol station, according to Reuters. The number of dead is yet to be confirmed, the Guardian reports.

A later report from Reuters said a grave with at least two civilians' bodies has been found in Buzova village.

Police members carry the body of a civilian after they exhumed him along with another body from a well at the fuel station in Buzova, Kyiv region. According to the head of the village, the person was killed by Russian soldiers / Photo credit: Reuters

01:00 The World Bank new report: Ukraine's economic output will likely contract by a staggering 45.1% this year as Russia's invasion has shuttered businesses, slashed exports and rendered economic activity impossible in large swaths of the country.

The World Bank also forecast Russia's 2022 GDP output to fall 11.2% due to punishing financial sanctions imposed by the United States and its Western allies on Russia's banks, state-owned enterprises and other institutions.

The World Bank's ""War in the Region"" economic update said the Eastern Europe region, comprising Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, is forecast to show a GDP contraction of 30.7% this year, due to shocks from the war and disruption of trade.

Growth in 2022 in the Central Europe region, comprising Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Romania, will be cut to 3.5% from 4.7% previously due to the influx of refugees, higher commodity prices and deteriorating confidence hurting demand.

For Ukraine, the World Bank report estimates that over half of the country's businesses are closed, while others still open are operating at well under normal capacity. The closure of Black Sea shipping from Ukraine has cut off some 90% of the country's grain exports and half of its total exports.

The World Bank said the war has rendered economic activity impossible in large swaths of the country, and is disrupting agricultural planting and harvest operations.

Estimates of infrastructure damage exceeding $100 billion by early March - about two-thirds of Ukraine's 2019 GDP - are well out of date ""as the war has raged on and caused further damage.""

The Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Hanna Maliar

""People are waiting for news every day, but certain military operations take days and sometimes weeks. And what’s happening now seems to be a kind of stabilization, but in fact it’s not. Now the enemy is accumulating forces, there is no calm, no stabilization. The Russian army is trying to fulfill its minimum plan – to seize the east of Ukraine. If they continue to change their plans in line with the operational situation, we must understand that their ultimate goal is the whole of Ukraine,"" said Maliar.

- Ukrainian citizens in the occupied cities rally against the Russians; on their part, the occupiers began to kidnap activists and authorities; locals are being forcibly ""evacuated"" to Russia with the following deportation to the depressed areas and appointment of jobs

- thousands of civilian volunteers join the Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine; Ukraine has established an International Legion for foreign volunteers willing to fight for Ukraine, thousands have joined already

- Ukraine has had several rounds of negotiations with Russia; still, no significant progress towards ceasefire and peace, the main question, for now, is the provision of concrete security guarantees for Ukraine; the negotiations continue ""non-stop"" in an online format; President Zelenskyy expressed readiness to directly talk with Putin.",https://en.defence-ua.com/news/day_47th_of_war_between_ukraine_and_russian_federation_live_updates-2513.html

The US was “not in a position to confirm” recent reports of chemical weapons use in Ukraine but was working to determine what happened, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said.

Ukraine said earlier it was checking unverified information that Russian forces may have used chemical weapons while besieging the city of Mariupol.

“We’re in direct conversation with partners to try to determine what actually has happened,” the top US diplomat told reporters.

“We had credible information that Russian forces may use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents that would cause stronger symptoms to weaken and incapacitate entrenched Ukrainian fighters and civilians, as part of the aggressive campaign to take Mariupol,” he added.

Mayor calls Mariupol killings ‘genocide’

The mayor of Mariupol says more than 20,000 civilian residents of the port city have been killed since the start of the Russian invasion.

In televised comments, Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said it was difficult to calculate the exact number of casualties since street fighting started.

He said, “We know and there is evidence that bodies disappear from the streets. We know that there are so-called ‘concentration places’ where they hide bodies and they then plan to destroy the evidence of tortures they committed in the city of Mariupol. We call it ‘genocide’, we call it ‘war crime’.”

What did Putin say?

Putin has spoken extensively on the conflict in Ukraine at a joint news conference with Lukashenko. Here are some of his claims:

Western sanctions imposed on Moscow in a bid to make it change course have failed, the Russian president said, adding the “blitzkrieg on which our foes were counting on did not work”.

He blamed Ukraine’s “inconsistency” for derailing talks between the two sides, suggesting the discussions had reached “a dead end”.

Putin also said Ukrainian allegations that Russian servicemen killed civilians in Bucha were false.

In a bleak comparison, he said the Bucha allegations evoked what he called staged chemical weapons attacks in Syria aimed at incriminating the country’s leader, Bashar al-Assad.

Ukraine says it thwarted Russian cyberattack on power grid

Ukrainian officials have accused Russian hackers of attempting to launch a destructive cyberattack on the country’s electricity grid.

The group, dubbed “Sandworm” by security researchers and previously tied to destructive cyberattacks attributed to Russia, deployed destructive and data-wiping malware on computers controlling high voltage substations in Ukraine, the Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) said in a statement on its website.

“The victim organisation suffered two waves of attacks. The initial compromise took place no later than February 2022. The disconnection of electrical substations and the decommissioning of the company’s infrastructure was scheduled for Friday evening, April 8, 2022,” the CERT-UA statement said.

Officials managed to prevent the attack from taking place, it added. The statement did not say which Ukrainian energy provider was targeted. Russia has consistently denied accusations it has launched cyberattacks on Ukraine.

The Biden administration already made it clear it does not want to see a significant uptick in Russian energy imports by India, which has purchased at least 13 million barrels of discounted Russian crude since the country invaded Ukraine in late February.

He said the situation is worse in cities like Mariupol and Kherson in the south, which have been besieged by Russian forces and where children and their families have spent weeks without running water, sanitation or a regular supply of food.
