0,289c3e82-53b5-49a1-812e-8efd5656d9a0,[],2022-02-23 00:00:00,"MADRID, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Spain recommended Spaniards to leave Ukraine temporarily as soon as possible given the worsening of the security situation, Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said on Wednesday.

""We recommend to temporarily leave the country as soon as possible and advise against travelling to Ukraine under any circumstances,"" Albares told a parliamentary committee.

Russia's recognition of Donetsk and the neighbouring self-proclaimed Lugansk People's Republic on Monday was declared illegal by Western countries, which have imposed new sanctions against Moscow.

Albares said 334 Spaniards remain in Ukraine, down from 445 when the crisis began, a few weeks ago.

1,289c3e82-53b5-49a1-812e-8efd5656d9a0,[],,"I am appearing after the National Security Council presided over by the Head of State, King Felipe VI, and the first thing I would like to convey to the Spanish people is the resounding condemnation; the total and resounding condemnation by our country, Spain, of the unacceptable military actions of Putin's government in Ukraine.

The facts, as you know, are both very serious and very simple. A nuclear power has violated international law and begun an invasion of a neighbouring country, while threatening retaliation against any other nation that comes to the aid of the attacked country.

It is therefore, from every point of view, a flagrant violation of international law, national sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. And it is something more. It is a frontal attack on the principles, on the values - above all, the value of peace - that have brought Europe years of stability and prosperity.

This is a crisis that undoubtedly causes unbalances far beyond the countries directly involved in the conflict. It is certain to have far-reaching consequences, which is why UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres' clear-cut appeal to President Putin to withdraw his troops from Ukraine and stop the conflict is understandable.

Spain shares interests with the European Union, but above all we share values. And these values are at the basis of our Constitution, of the Spanish Constitution, and are, moreover, values and principles widely shared by Spanish citizens. The values of peace, respect for international law, solidarity and humanitarian cooperation with the peoples affected.

And it is precisely these values that will inspire us in this crisis. Spain will defend international legality, Spain will strive to restore peace, Spain will show solidarity with the peoples affected by this conflict.

We are, without a doubt, committed to peace and to the way in which we must guarantee that peace, which, if we want it to be effective, we must try to stop this aggression as soon as possible.

That is why the European Union and the rest of the European Union's allies have adopted a first package of sanctions with a clear objective, which is to prevent further aggression by Putin's government, which has already, unfortunately, cost too many lives. The European Union and allies also want to demonstrate to the Putin government that violations of international law and violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of third countries cannot and must not go unpunished.

We are also committed to international legality, and the most effective way to work for international legality is to sanction its violation. The European Council will meet again tonight in an extraordinary session to define the European Union's response to this flagrant violation of international law. We have been in contact for many weeks with our partners, with our allies, to provide a coordinated and united European response to this crisis.

We show solidarity with the peoples affected by the aggression, and the most effective way of exercising that solidarity is to help Ukraine from the European Union: with financial aid, as we have been doing for some weeks now, to deal with the current difficulties, with economic and financial solvency, also with important investments to protect the well-being of the Ukrainian people and, of course, also with health material.

I have informed the leader of the opposition of all this and I will appear before Parliament next Wednesday to inform all the parliamentary groups of the decisions that will be taken at a European level.

I would also like to remember all the Spaniards who are currently in Ukraine. The Spanish Embassy in Kiev has been in contact with the Spanish community for some weeks now. There are 436 Spaniards registered at the Embassy, of whom a hundred have already returned to our country, leaving just over 320 compatriots. Our consular services are maintaining telephone contact with the residents of Ukraine to provide them with the information available at this difficult time about the possibilities and ways to leave Ukraine or to evacuate, as soon as the situation allows. And, likewise, the Spanish Embassy in Warsaw is on standby to provide logistical support, all the logistical support that is necessary.

What I can guarantee is that the Government of Spain, in collaboration with our European partners, will attend to and provide the necessary assistance to Spanish citizens who are still in Ukraine.

This conflict and the sanctions resulting from it will undoubtedly have an economic impact on our country and on the European Union, especially on the energy markets.

The Government of Spain, as you know, in coordination with the European Union, has been preparing for some time now to react to this risk of military aggression and crisis, which has unfortunately been confirmed.

We will therefore take whatever measures are necessary to mitigate the economic impact, including the energy impact, of this crisis on Spanish society, on its companies, on households, on industry, and undoubtedly also on the economic recovery that we are beginning to see on the verge of overcoming the pandemic.

The European Union has a new opportunity, as it did with COVID-19 and its devastating effects, to demonstrate unity, solidarity and integration by dedicating the necessary means and taking the appropriate decisions to deal with this serious crisis and its economic effects.

The position of the Government of Spain has been very clear from the outset. We have supported and pushed the diplomatic route to the extreme, the route of dialogue to reach a solution that would avoid this escalation of war. And at the same time we have done something important, which is to emphasise that together with the whole of Europe, we would never accept unjust, unjustified aggression, and that we would therefore sanction any violation of international law.

In the eyes of the Government of Spain, we need to maintain the unity of all those of us who believe in democracy, in the rule of law, in a world based on rules and therefore on certainty, in peace, in respect for borders, in national sovereignty and in the freedom of peoples, in this case Ukraine, to choose their future.

With our unity we are sending a clear, sharp, resounding message of our determination to stand up for what we believe in.

Spain wishes to maintain a relationship of friendship and respect with all the peoples of the world, and it is precisely from the friendship we profess to the Russian people, from the affection we profess to the thousands of Russian citizens who live in harmony on Spanish soil, that we send a clear message to Putin's government, and that is to demand an immediate end to the hostilities, to revoke recognition of the independence of the territories that form part of another sovereign nation, in this case Ukraine; we demand that it fulfil its commitments as signatory to the Minsk agreements.

Ultimately, we call on the Putin government to comply with international law and to return to discussions within the Normandy format and the Trilateral contact group.

Today, two paths are opening up before Spain and before the entire European Union, which is what I would also like to convey to the Spanish people to conclude this institutional declaration.

The path of peace and international legality is open, or the path of illegitimate force, which leads only to world disorder and insecurity, can also be opened. And for Spain, I am convinced that for the majority of Spaniards, as well as for the European Union as a whole, the choice is hard, but it is simple: we are a country, we are a democracy, we are a union, committed to the values of peace, international legality and solidarity.

Thank you.

2,289c3e82-53b5-49a1-812e-8efd5656d9a0,[],2022-02-24 00:00:00,"Russian media reported quoting President Putin had given approval to a ‘special military operation’ in the Donbas region of Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation” in eastern Ukraine has been swiftly condemned by several nations.

The authorisation by Putin was made at the same time as the United Nations Security Council met late on Wednesday for its second emergency meeting this week to urge de-escalation and return to diplomatic talks.

Russian media reported quoting Putin he had given approval to the operation in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where Moscow earlier recognised rebel-held territories in Luhansk and Donetsk and said they had asked for its “help”.

Here is how the world is reacting:

Ukraine

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Putin had “launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and that peaceful cities were “under strikes”.

“This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now,” he tweeted.

Speaking at an emergency UN Security Council meeting, Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said it was too late to talk about de-escalation. “I call on every one of you to do everything possible to stop the war,” he said.

United States

President Joe Biden has condemned Russia for an “unprovoked and unjustified attack” on Ukraine while promising that his country and its allies “will hold Russia accountable”.

“President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable,” he said.

Tomorrow, I will be meeting with the Leaders of the G7, and the United States and our Allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia. We will continue to provide support and assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. — President Biden (@POTUS) February 24, 2022

G7

The Group of Seven industrialised nations strongly condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and said they would bring forward severe and coordinated economic and financial sanctions against Moscow.

“This crisis is a serious threat to the rules-based international order, with ramifications well beyond Europe,” the G7 leaders said in a joint statement, adding Russian President Vladimir Putin had re-introduced war to the European continent.

“He has put himself on the wrong side of history,” said the leaders in the statement released by Germany.

The leaders also said they supported consistent and constructive engagement and coordination among major energy producers and consumers towards stable global energy supplies and were ready to act to address potential disruption.

United Nations

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Russia’s actions, telling Putin to “bring your troops back to Russia”.

“In the name of humanity, do not allow a war to start in Europe which could be worst war since the beginning of the century with consequences not only devastating for Ukraine, not only tragic for the Russian Federation but with an impact cannot even foresee.”

Speaking at the UN Security Council, Guterres implored Putin to “give peace a chance.”

World Health Organization

The UN health agency has voiced alarm over an expected health emergency in Ukraine.

“Amid the conflict rapidly unfolding in Ukraine, the WHO Regional Office for Europe reiterates its deepest concern for the safety, health and wellbeing of all civilians impacted by the crisis in the country and possibly beyond,” the office said in a statement.

United Kingdom

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the next steps.

“President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine,” Johnson tweeted.

In a televised address to the nation, he said Western powers would impose massive sanctions to hobble the Russian economy. “Today, in concert with our allies, we will agree a massive package of economic sanctions designed in time to hobble the Russian economy,” he said.

I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskyy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively. — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) February 24, 2022

European Union

The bloc will hold Moscow accountable for the “unjustified” attack on Ukraine, the chief of the EU’s Executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said.

“In these dark hours, our thoughts are with Ukraine and the innocent women, men and children as they face this unprovoked attack and fear for their lives,” she said on Twitter.

The EU is expected to discuss a further sanctions package on Russia at an emergency meeting later in the day.

Speaking at a news conference alongside the President of the European Council Charles Michel, von der Leyen said EU sanctions will “seriously degrade” Russia’s economy.

NATO

The Atlantic alliance’s secretary general said Russia had “chosen the path of aggression against a sovereign and independent country.”

The attack “puts at risk countless civilian lives,” Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement, describing it as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”

After chairing an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors, Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance will deploy capabilities and forces on its territory after Russian invaded Ukraine, saying it put over 100 warplanes on high alert.

NATO leaders will also hold a virtual summit on Friday.

International Olympic Committee

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Russia had breached the Olympic Truce that is currently in effect, which aims to harness the power of sport to promote peace and dialogue.

A UN resolution calling for cooperate with the IOC and the International Paralympic Committee “to use sport as a tool to promote peace, dialogue and reconciliation” was adopted on 2 December 2021 by consensus of all 193 UN Member States.

Belarus

President Alexander Lukashenko said the Belarusian armed forces were not taking part in Russia’s military operation against Ukraine, the Belta news agency reported.

“Our troops are taking no part in this operation,” Lukashenko was quoted as saying.

“We reject Russia’s military operation,” Erdogan said in a televised speech, calling it as a “heavy blow to regional peace and stability.”

Czech Republic

Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said Russia’s attack on Ukraine is a “barbaric act of aggression” and that his country will respond together with its allies,

“The Kremlin’s decision to launch a completely unprovoked attack is unacceptable and in contradiction to international law,” he posted on Twitter.

I strongly condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin's decision to launch a completely unprovoked attack is unacceptable and in contradiction to international law. Together with Allies, we will respond to this barbaric act of aggression. — Jan Lipavský (@JanLipavsky) February 24, 2022

China

China rejected calling Russia’s moves on Ukraine an “invasion” and urged all sides to exercise restraint.

“You are using a typical Western media question method of using the word invasion,” Hua Chunying, spokesperson at China’s foreign ministry told reporters.

“China is closely monitoring the latest situation. We call on all sides to exercise restraint to prevent the situation from getting out of control.”

The Chinese embassy in Ukraine told its citizens in Ukraine to stay put at home as a precautionary measure, following the bombings of some Ukrainian cities.

Poland

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki demanded an immediate reaction to Russia’s aggression on Ukraine, seeking the “fiercest possible” sanctions.

“We must immediately respond to Russia’s criminal aggression on Ukraine,” Morawiecki tweeted.

“Europe and the free world have to stop Putin. Today’s European Council should approve fiercest possible sanctions. Our support for Ukraine must be real.”

The country’s health ministry said it is preparing a medical train to transport the wounded, adding that Polish hospitals were ready to receive thousands of patients.

We must immediately respond to Russia's criminal aggression on Ukraine.

Europe and the free world has to stop Putin. Today's European Council should approve fiercest possible sanctions.

Our support for Ukraine must be real. — Mateusz Morawiecki (@MorawieckiM) February 24, 2022

Bulgaria

Bulgarian President Rumen Radev said his country was preparing to evacuate by land more than 4,000 ethnic Bulgarians from Ukraine and was ready to host other Ukrainian refugees.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said the Balkan country would prepare hotels and other tourism bases to host them.

Australia

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said sanctions against Russia would become law Friday but would not take effect until the end of March.

He said the time was needed to give “opportunities for businesses that have had very legitimate operations and business interests in Russia and in the affected territories of Ukraine to be able to make changes to their arrangements.”

“The reason we’re doing this is there must be a price for the unprovoked, unlawful, unwarranted, unjustified attacks and threats and intimidation that has been imposed by Russia on Ukraine. This cannot be a consequence-free action by Vladimir Putin and the Russian regime,” Morrison said.

Germany

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine as a “blatant breach of international law” that “cannot be justified by anything”.

He said western sanctions would ensure Russia paid a “bitter price” for its attack on Ukraine and that Putin had made “a serious mistake.”

France

President Emmanuel Macron has said France will stand by Ukraine’s side and warned that Russia’s invasion of its neighbour will have durable and “deep” consequences for the continent of Europe.

Deputy foreign minister Andreas Katsaniotis said that “while other countries withdrew their diplomats, we increased our personnel.”

Finland

Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö strongly condemned the Russian military measures, describing them as an assault not just on Ukraine, but “on the entire European security order.”

“We feel deep compassion towards Ukraine and are seeking ways to increase our support to Ukraine,” he said.

“These reckless and dangerous acts will not go unpunished.”

India

The Indian embassy in Ukraine said arrangements were being made to evacuate Indians since the Ukrainian airspace had been closed.

Lithuania

President Gitanas Nauseda said the Lithuanian parliament will decide whether to declare a state of emergency.

Japan

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned Russia’s military actions and said Japan will respond in a speedy fashion together with the US and other allies.

South Korea

President Moon Jae-in said at a National Security Council meeting that Ukraine’s sovereignty, territory, and independence must be respected.

Warschefsky']",2022-02-24 16:57:46-05:00,"Despite weeks of warning, Russia’s Feb. 24 decision to launch an invasion of Ukraine caught much of the world by surprise. Russian President Vladimir Putin released what appeared to be a prerecorded statement just as the offensive began, wherein he described the commencement of a “special military operation” aimed at defending the Ukrainian breakaway territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, which he had recently recognized as independent countries, as well as the “demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine.” Within minutes, the first of a barrage of missile strikes hit targets around the country as Russian ground troops moved into Ukrainian territory, initiating what is believed to be the biggest attack on a European state since World War II.

Perhaps not coincidentally, Putin made his announcement just as the U.N. Security Council was convening a special session on the Ukraine crisis. The ensuing debate provided a microcosm into much of the world’s initial reactions to Russia’s actions. While many member states quickly condemned Russia’s actions, others—most notably China and India—made more general calls for deescalation on all sides and a return to diplomatic dialogue. Russia’s representative continued to defend its actions as necessary responses to Ukraine’s own hostility toward the people of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine’s representative, meanwhile, called on Russia to end its aggression, noting: “[T]here is no purgatory for war criminals—they go straight to hell.”

“The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight[,]” President Biden said in his own press statement shortly after the invasion began. But much of the world has only begun to formulate its formal response to Russia’s actions. This post brings together the official responses we have been able to locate thus far. We will update this list—which was last updated at 3:00 p.m. on March 4—as more official statements become available.

Czech Republic

Security Council, the United Arab Emirates’s ambassador affirmed the importance of good-faith dialogue and diplomatic efforts, supported a return to the Minsk agreements, affirmed the importance of international law and the U.N. charter, and pointed out humanitarian obstacles. The ambassador also urged for involved states to allow for civilian movement and the provision of humanitarian aid.

Feb. 26: In a statement after its abstention from a vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution that would demand an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the UAE “expressed particular alarm at the consequences for civilians present in Ukraine, as well as for the region, and for the international community” and called for the “unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance.” Despite the UAE’s abstention, Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh reiterated “that the UAE is committed to the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of all member states.”

Australia

Feb. 24: Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison released a statement “Join(ing) our partners in condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” Morrison also said that “Vladimir Putin has fabricated a feeble pretext on which to invade. Russia’s disinformation and propaganda has convinced no one.” He reiterated support for Ukraine, and provided a brief description of sanctions and other actions Austria plans to take in response to Russia’s aggression.

Feb. 25: Morrison rebuked China’s stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “At a time when the world was seeking to put additional sanctions on Russia, they have eased restrictions on the trade of Russian wheat into China,” Morrison said. “At a time when Australia, together with the United Kingdom, together with the United States and Europe and Japan, are acting to cut off Russia, the Chinese government are following through on easing trade restrictions with Russia. That is simply unacceptable.”

New Zealand

Feb 24: New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardeen and Minister of Foreign Affairs Nania Mahuta condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “New Zealand strongly condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and joins the international community in calling on Russia to immediately cease military operations in Ukraine,” Jacinda Ardern said. “This is an unprovoked attack by Russia. By choosing to pursue this entirely avoidable path, an unthinkable number of innocent lives could be lost because of Russia’s decision.” Foreign Affairs Minister Mahuta added, “New Zealand has consistently expressed our strong support for international efforts to de-escalate the Ukraine crisis diplomatically. Given Russia has demonstrated a disregard for these efforts they must now face the consequences of their decision to invade.”

Security Council resolution that would demand an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Brazil condemned the ongoing war, called for U.N. action to create dialogue and expressed regret that the resolution, which “would send a decisive message in favor of respect for international law[,]” was defeated but stressed that the Security Council still had a mission and role to play, concluding that “[t]he security concerns voiced by the Russian Federation in the past few years, particularly regarding the strategic balance in Europe, do not give Russia the right to threaten the territorial integrity and sovereignty of another State. The Security Council has the legitimacy to debate and, with the good will of all, adopt measures to redress this dangerous situation.”

This is an attempt to replace that rules-based international order with a world in which might makes right, where the great powers have the authority to redraw the borders, dictate the foreign policies, and control the governments of sovereign democracies whose only fault is that they are smaller and that their militaries are not as powerful. … But if Russia does not pull back, it will be met with a firm and united response from Canada and our allies.”

Feb. 23 at 11:38 p.m. EST: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a statement calling on Russia to cease all hostile and provocative actions against Ukraine and to withdraw all military personnel from the country.

Nicaragua

Feb. 21: President Daniel Ortega backed Russia’s position on Ukraine. Ortega reported that Ukraine’s interest in joining NATO represents a threat to Russia. Ortega stated that “[i]f Ukraine gets into NATO they will be saying to Russia let’s go to war, and that explains why Russia is acting like this. Russia is simply defending itself.”

The attacks that began on Thursday at 5 am local time, approved by the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, as a “special military operation”, have been considered the biggest ones by one state against another in the European continent since World War II, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.

While the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has called on Ukrainian citizens who are ready to defend the country from Russian forces to come forward, Ukraine’s neighbouring countries are preparing for an influx of migrants.

Ukraine’s Neighbour Countries Prepare for an Influx of Migrants

The current situation in Ukraine has led its EU neighbouring countries, Slovakia, Romania, Poland, Hungary, to brace for a large number of refugees.

According to a recent report of Al Jazeera, in the worst-case scenario, nearly five million people could leave Ukraine. The country has a population of 44.13 million.

Slovakia’s Defence Minister, Jaroslav Nad, has stressed that the country was preparing its armed forces to manage the influx of refugees.

At the same time, authorities in Romania, with which Ukraine shares a 600-kilometre border, have stressed that they are prepared to receive as many as half a million potential refugees.

“We are not expecting a major influx coming here now, but one never knows,” the defence minister, Vasile Dincu, pointed out in this regard.

Authorities in Poland earlier this week braced for several scenarios in case of invasion in Ukraine.

Regarding the issue, the Deputy Interior Minister, Maciej Wąsik, said that the country should be ready for nearly one million refugees from Ukraine.

“We have to be prepared for a wave of up to a million people,” the Minister told Polish radio, according to the Guardian.

As for Hungary, Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó also announced that the country stands by Ukraine, participating in all talks and the allied forces on decisions regarding a coordinated response.

In this regard, the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA) also has offered its support in the reception of persons interested in international protection.

“The EUAA has been working very closely over the past weeks and months together with the European Commission, other EU Agencies, as well as the Member States, in order to be prepared for any scenario whereby armed conflict in Ukraine could lead to a sudden increase in individuals seeking international protection in the EU,” EUAA pointed out in this regard.

What Asylum Application Procedures Await Ukrainians?

All Ukrainians who are interested in filling in an application for international protection are eligible to do so, with all the rights as well as obligations related to such status.

Ukrainians who plan to make an asylum application are eligible to remain in the territory of the Member State, including at the border or transit areas, during the time the asylum procedure is provided with detailed information in a language that the applicant understands.

Once the application for international protection is made, it must be registered, which means registering the applicant’s purpose to seek asylum in EU countries. Then EU countries must show which authorities are responsible for registering asylum applications under national law.

Competent authorities in EU countries are obliged to ensure that applicants have the opportunity to lodge the request as soon as possible.

“EU countries must designate which authorities are responsible for the lodging of asylum applications under national law (Article 6(1) APD). If, however, a person refrains from lodging their application, the determining authority may take a decision to discontinue the procedure,” the European Agency for Asylum notes.

However, the rules may differ within EU countries after some Member States may set additional rules for persons interested in applying for asylum.

Applicants Should Be Informed When Applying for International Protection

After applying for international protection, the applicant should be informed at least of the following:

The procedure to be followed

Their obligations and rights during the procedure

The potential consequences of not complying with the obligations and not cooperating with the relevant authorities

The time frame of the examination process

The means at the applicant’s disposal for meeting the requirement to submit the elements to substantiate their asylum application

The possible consequences of an explicit or implicit withdrawal of the application.

As soon as a person who applied for international protection is required to lodge the request after the registration phase, the applicant should be provided with detailed information on how and where to lodge the petition, as well as the consequences of not lodging the application.

“It is essential that applicants are provided with information to ensure a fair and effective asylum procedure. Applicants should know their rights and obligations and understand the different stages of the procedure to present their claims as completely as possible and to comply with their obligations,” the Agency emphasises.

It is also important that Ukrainians interested in international protection in EU countries get informed and understand the stages of the request filed for asylum.

Intention as well as an expected outcome of the registration

Confidentiality in the international protection procedure

Registration procedure for asylum is free of charge

Practical steps during the registration process

Procedures to determine the European Union country responsible for examining the request filed for asylum

Document revealing the status of the applicant

How and where to lodge the application for asylum if the registration and the lodging are conducted separately

Soon after, a registration interview is organised.

“A registration interview is organised to collect reliable data from an applicant at the beginning of the procedure. As you may be the first person representing the asylum procedure who the applicant meets, it is important to approach the interview with a neutral attitude to enhance cooperation, establish an atmosphere of trust and provide information that is correct,” the Agency notes.

Citizens of Ukraine who plan to seek asylum in the EU countries are encouraged to provide all the necessary documents to the authorities in order to determine or verify their identity and nationality.

“Such documents include identity and travel documents (namely an identification card and/or passport), family documents (e.g. a family booklet, birth certificates, death certificates and/or marriage certificates), documents related to residence and travel routes and any documentary evidence that could support the asylum claim (e.g. a membership card to a claimed political or civil society organisation or a warrant of arrest)”, the Agency stressed.

In addition, applicants are urged to hand in their original documents. If the person who applies for asylum does not have the original documents but has copies, they are urged to tell the reason why the original document is not available and how the applicant was eligible to obtain copies of these documents.

As for the biometric data collected during the registration and lodging stage, it includes photographs as well as fingerprints. Depending on the national setup, there can be collected additional types of biometric data, including iris scan or voice recording.

Within a period of three days of filing in a request for asylum, the applicant must be provided with a document or asylum application card free of charge, which shows the applicant’s status for asylum and testifies that they are permitted to remain in the European Union country, in which they have applied for asylum while their application is being examined.

More countries in the European Union issue the application period for a specific period of time, after which it will be renewed if the person making the request is still authorised to remain in the country.

“Subsequent application means a further application for international protection made after a final decision has been taken on a previous application, including cases where the applicant has explicitly withdrawn his or her application and cases where the determining authority has rejected an application following its implicit withdrawal in accordance with Article 28,” the statement notes.

Number of Asylum Applications in EU Countries Filed by Ukrainians

According to the figures provided by the European Asylum Support Office EASO in 2021, a total of 5,301 first time asylum applications have been filed by Ukrainians in EU countries, while there were no repeated applications registered.

The figures published by EASO also revealed that 480 Ukrainians had refugee status, in November 2021, a total of 491 had the subsidiary protection status, while there were issued a total of 7,353 negative decisions.

EASO data also shows that the number of first-time applications filed by Ukrainians in EU countries in 2020, was 4,944, while in 2019, before the spread of the Coronavirus and its new strains, the number was 8,091.

While in 2014, the number of first time applications filed by Ukrainians in EU countries was 13,745, in the following year, in 2015, the first time application number reached its peak, during which year a total of 19,585 applications for asylum were registered by asylum authorities in EU countries.",https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/ukraine-invasion-these-are-the-procedures-that-await-ukrainian-asylum-seekers-in-eu/

Happening Today

This week, all eyes continue to be on Ukraine and what Vladimir Putin will do next as Russia appears on the brink of a full-scale invasion.

The U.S. and its allies, including the EU, Australia and Japan, have begun to roll out penalties largely aimed at Russian banks, sovereign debt and elites, as President Joe Biden on Tuesday called Putin’s moves “the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine” and warned of further sanctions. Earlier today, Ukraine moved to declare a state of emergency and urged its citizens to leave Russia immediately as the situation escalates.

Russia, for its part, has remained defiant. Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Antonov dismissed the sanctions, arguing that Russia has learned to live with sanctions and the new ones will hurt global financial and energy markets. “It is hard to imagine that there is a person in Washington who expects Russia to revise its foreign policy under a threat of restrictions,” he said.

Marking Defenders of the Fatherland Day, Putin said today that Moscow is still open to diplomacy, but underscored it will continue to increase its defense capacity. “Russia’s interests and the security of its citizens are unconditional,” Putin said, according to Russian state news agency TASS.

In Ukraine, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba today called the coordinated sanctions “first decisive steps,” but urged allies to do more: “[T]he pressure needs to step up to stop Putin. Hit his economy and cronies. Hit more. Hit hard. Hit now.”

EU STANDS AS ONE: Persuading the EU — a group of 27 member states with distinctive priorities and politics — to agree to anything, particularly on something as sensitive as sanctions, is always an uphill battle. But the EU on Tuesday finally agreed on a package of sanctions to punish Russia.

As with the U.K. and the U.S., it’s only a first step — Brussels is still holding back from imposing its full suite of sanctions, which the Commission has drawn up until there is a further escalation.

In a hastily convened meeting, EU foreign ministers on Tuesday in Paris agreed to specific measures linked to Russia’s incursion into the two east Ukrainian enclaves of Donetsk and Luhansk. This includes targeting 351 members of the Duma (Russian parliament) and sanctions on 27 individuals and entities.

“This package of sanctions will hurt Russia and will hurt a lot,"" says EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell announcing the deal. But he conceded that there could be further meetings — and sanctions — to come. ""We are afraid ... that this story has not finished,"" he said ominously.

Saying it as it is … and deleting it: In a tweet, Borrell said the sanctions mean there will be “no more … shopping in Milan, partying in Saint Tropez” or purchasing ""diamonds in Antwerp."" Borrell later deleted it but not before the Russian Foreign Ministry captured a screenshot and criticized him for “celebrating damage done by Brussels to businesses in EU Member-States.”

GERMANY BLINKS: But the big surprise was the decision by Germany to suspend the Nord Stream 2 Russia-to-Germany natural gas pipeline — a move the country had refused to commit to in recent weeks. Speaking at a news conference in Berlin, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that Putin’s decision to order troops into the Donbas region had been a game-changer. “The situation today is fundamentally different,” he said.

It also reflects heavy American pressure. German officials had been lobbying members of Congress in Washington for months, and Biden had made no secret of his view on the matter. The fact that Germany is still receiving gas — for the moment at least — from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline may have softened the blow.

Russian warning: Nonetheless, in a sign of what may be to come for Europe’s energy supply — and pricing, Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev tweeted: “Welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay €2,000 for 1,000 cubic metres of natural gas!”



MORE EU LEADERS’ MEETINGS TO COME: Rumors abound in Brussels that an emergency EU leaders’ summit could be called as early as Thursday if things continue to escalate and the EU decides to trigger its broader batch of sanctions.

MOSCOW LOOKS TO COURT LATIN AMERICA: Meanwhile, Russia hasn’t only had its sights on Ukraine. In recent weeks, the Kremlin has been playing up diplomacy in a region thousands of miles away from Moscow: Latin America.

In a clear display of Russia looking to increase its influence in the region, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov last week paid a visit to officials in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, including Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, in a bid to deepen ties. Meanwhile, Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro flew to Moscow to meet with Putin last week — just days after Argentina’s President Alberto Fernández did the same.

And as expected, leaders in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua — all antagonists to the U.S. with authoritarian, socialist regimes — have been quick to express support for Russia and its invasion of Ukraine. Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega argued Ukraine’s effort to join NATO was a threat to Russia and “Russia is simply defending itself.” Cuba’s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez rejected “the media and propaganda hysteria triggered by the US government against Russia.” Prior to the invasion, Maduro last week pledged “powerful military cooperation” with Russia.

Meanwhile, Brazil and Argentina have kept a more tepid tone on the crisis. At the United Nations Security Council meeting Monday, Brazil urged for negotiations but refused to mention Russia by name. Argentina’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday expressing “worry” over the situation in Ukraine and calling for “diplomatic negotiations.” It did not mention Russia by name, either.

“Latin America has a very well-honed sense of sovereignty and non-intervention, which they routinely ring before U.S. audiences … but where is that same sensitivity when it comes to Russia bullying a weaker neighbor?” said Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the think tank Council of the Americas, adding how he has not seen much forceful condemnation coming out of the region on Putin’s moves.

Latin America ultimately isn’t a “strategic location for Russia,” Farnsworth said, but he still expects more engagement to come in the region. “It is a convenience for them. If they can harass U.S. interests … if they can make our lives less convenient by stirring things up in the region, they’re going to be willing to do that.”

GLOBAL RISKS AND TRENDS

IRAN CORNER: LATEST ON THE NUCLEAR DEAL TALKS: POLITICO’s Stephanie Liechtenstein reports from Vienna that foreign ministers are likely to gather in the coming days with the hope of reviving the Iran nuclear deal.

Mixed signals: A U.S. official involved in the negotiations, however, downplayed the possibility of a meeting or an imminent breakthrough. “The remaining issues are extremely difficult, the official told Stephanie. But in recent weeks, other negotiators have indicated that an agreement to revive the nuclear deal was within reach.

Related reading: Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in POLITICO Magazine that the Biden administration “should walk away” from talks of a deal and, instead, plan for military action if Iran’s nuclear program “crosses certain red lines.”

EU PREPARING FOR CYBER WAR: The EU is deploying a team of cybersecurity experts to help Ukraine fight off cyberattacks. The EU’s Cyber Rapid Response Team includes around 10 national cybersecurity officials from six European countries — Croatia, Estonia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania — who can provide assistance to countries under cyberattack.

European officials from those countries will work out the details with Ukraine on how many and which experts it will devote to the operation. Sending the cyber team into Ukraine “is an option we’re considering,” said Margiris Abukevičius, vice minister at the Ministry of National Defense in Lithuania, adding it will depend on the type of support Ukraine requests.

Ukraine has faced cyberattacks — often from Russian security services and hacking groups — for years, and the EU has poured millions into schemes supporting Ukraine’s cybersecurity and digital infrastructure in past years. But rising tensions between Kyiv and Moscow have set off a spate of cyberattacks on Ukraine in past weeks.

BETTER U.S.-HONDURAS TIES TO COME?: Less than a month ago, Honduras swore in the country’s first female president, Xiomara Castro. Just over a week ago, Honduran authorities detained former president Juan Orlando Hernández, once a U.S. ally, after Washington requested his extradition over drug trafficking charges.

So far, U.S. officials and experts on the region are viewing the new leadership in the Central American country as a new opportunity for cooperation with the U.S. on an array of issues, including tackling the reasons why thousands of Hondurans flee their country and make the trek north to the U.S. southern border each year.

“Castro has always been skeptical of the U.S., but all of a sudden there’s a convergence of interests … and the U.S. is trying to see if she’s serious about fighting corruption and can develop a real working relationship with her government,” Andrew Selee, president of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, told us. “They see it as a moment of opportunity that they have to seize, but there’s an awareness that the relationship is still fragile.”

CALLING ON MEXICO TO PROTECT JOURNALISTS: Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday night joined international calls for accountability in the deaths of journalists in Mexico. In a tweet, he urged “greater accountability and protections for Mexican journalists.” It comes after Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) urged the State Department to take steps to ensure accountability for the recent murders and help protect the freedom of expression of journalists there.

Five journalists have been killed in Mexico this year, making it the deadliest country for journalists in the Western Hemisphere.

MEXICAN AVOCADO BAN IS OVER: The U.S. is lifting a temporary ban on inspections of Mexican avocados, a move that allows for imports of the fruit, the Associated Press reported. The inspections, which are required before Mexico can export it to the U.S., were stopped earlier this month after a U.S inspector was threatened in Mexico’s top avocado-producing state Michoacán.
