What do you do if you fall through the ice while wearing 20 kilograms of military gear? Cold Response 2022 is a long-planned exercise bringing together thousands of troops from NATO Allies and partners, testing their ability to work together in cold weather conditions across Norway – on land, in the air and at sea.

The host country Every year, NATO organises dozens of military exercises. NATO members also organise national exercises that include other Allies. Cold Response 2022 is organised by the Norwegian Armed Forces. Learn more about the exercise on their website.

Over the coming weeks, Allied and partner armed forces will trek across the vast wilderness, conduct live-fire drills, leap into freezing lakes, and much more. It's all about training vital skills, making sure that our armed forces are prepared to respond to any threat or crisis – and keep our countries and people safe. Cold Response 2022 is bringing together Allies from Europe and North America, demonstrating the enduring transatlantic bond at the heart of NATO.

The basics

: March-April 2022 WHY: Helping Allies and partners practise working together so that they are prepared for any situation

Cold Response 2022 is a long-planned and regular exercise, which Norway hosts biannually. This year's exercise was announced over eight months ago. It is not linked to Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, which NATO is responding to with preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory measures.

Did you know? Norway was a founding member of NATO in 1949. Why did Norway, a neutral country with close links to its neighbours, join an Atlantic alliance in 1949 instead of a Scandinavian union?

Embrace the cold – NATO and winter operations

Allied forces need to be ready to operate in any environment under any conditions. Training in Norway allows NATO Allies and partners to practise their skills operating in extreme and rugged surroundings, from frozen fjords to shivering seas to ice-encrusted mountains. There's a reason that Norway hosts the NATO Centre of Excellence for Cold Weather Operations!

But many other NATO Allies host exercises and help develop this expertise as well, from the bitterly cold Baltics to the remote volcanic beaches of Iceland to the Canadian High Arctic. Check out the videos below to see cold-weather troops in action.

From Arctic Express to Trident Juncture – a long legacy of exercises in Norway

Norway has hosted exercises with NATO Allies and partners since the early 1950s. From Anchor Express to Northern Express, Atlas Express to Winter Express, over the decades Norway has helped Allies and partners learn how to operate together in its rough northern terrain. Exercise Cold Response itself was first held in 2006. Click through the gallery to see archival images of soldiers during these exercises and the beautiful Norwegian countryside where they trained.

Why do we exercise?

Regular exercises allow NATO and partners to train together, identifying what works and what needs improving. Exercises are defensive, proportionate and announced months in advance. NATO Allies respect the transparency obligations under the OSCE Vienna Document, which governs the rules for military exercises in the Euro-Atlantic area.

Under the Vienna Document transparency obligations, Norway has invited all OSCE member states to send observers to the exercise. The Chief of the Norwegian Joint Headquarters also informed the Commander of the Russian Northern Fleet about Cold Response 2022 in a video call in January 2022.

Good morning,

It is great to be back in Bardufoss.

And to meet forces taking part in Cold Response exercise.

A week ago, four US Marines lost their lives in a tragic plane crash.

Let me start by expressing my deepest condolences to their families and loved ones.

And to all their fellow soldiers who stand together to defend NATO territory.

I want to thank Norway for leading this important exercise.

Cold Response shows NATO unity and strength in action.

There are 30,000 personnel from 27 nations participating.

Including NATO’s closest partners, Finland and Sweden.

We have deployed 220 aircraft, including fifth-generation fighter jets.

And more than 50 ships, including two aircraft carrier groups from the United Kingdom and Italy.

Russia’s war against Ukraine is a watershed moment.

It is a new normal for European security. And also for Arctic security.

NATO is an Arctic Alliance.

4 out of 5 Arctic littoral states are NATO nations.

It is a region of strategic importance for the security of the entire Euro-Atlantic area.

And critical for the communication links between North America and Europe.

It is also a region of growing strategic competition.

In the last few years, we have seen a significant increase in Russian military activity here.

Russia has re-established Soviet era Arctic bases.

This is a test bed for many of Russia’s novel weapon systems.

It is the home of Russia’s strategic submarine fleet.

Russia’s military build-up is the most serious challenge to stability and Allied security in the High North.

We also see an increased Chinese interest in the region.

China has defined itself as a “near Arctic” state an aims to build a presence here.

For all of these reasons, the High North is an area of critical importance for all Allies.

This is why NATO Allies have increased their military presence in the North.

And this exercise is an example of that. More will be required in the future.

A strong, firm and predictable Allied presence is the best way to ensure stability and protect our interests.

We cannot afford a security vacuum in the High North.

It could fuel Russian ambitions, expose NATO, and risk miscalculation and misunderstandings.

Over the last years, NATO has stepped up.

Established a new NATO command for the Atlantic.

Exercised more often, with the two biggest exercises since the Cold War held in this region.

Allies such as the US, the UK, and Norway have been investing more in cutting-edge capabilities.

Showing greater presence at sea and in the air.

And we monitor developments in the region very closely and share information.

NATO presence is not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict, and to preserve peace.

Cold Response is a crucial exercise.

It demonstrates NATO’s ability to defend against any threat, from any direction.

This exercise is defensive and long-planned.

We are open and transparent.

As we are with all our exercises.

Norway invited all 57 members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe to observe Cold Response.

But Russia declined that invitation.

At this dangerous time for our security, it is even more important that we exercise the readiness of our forces.

And our capacity to reinforce our troops across the Atlantic.

At the NATO Summit yesterday, Allies agreed to continue imposing costs on Russia and to further support our close partner Ukraine.

With additional military supplies.

As well as significant financial and humanitarian aid.

We also decided to start the reset of our defence and deterrence.

The first step is to deploy four new battlegroups to the East of our Alliance.

And I expect NATO leaders to agree further steps at our next Summit in June.

To keep our people safe.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: First of all I would like to ask you, how do you judge the Italian contribution to NATO? And then what can happen in case Russia will use in this conflict, in this war, Nuclear or chemical weapons?

Jens Stoltenberg NATO Secretary General: Italy is a highly valued NATO ally. It is a founding member of our Alliance and contributes in many different ways to our shared security; with maritime capabilities, with your presence in Kosovo, in Iraq, but not least, your contributions to our enhanced Forward Presence in the Baltic region.

And then of course, Italy is part of this exercise. Italy is in the high north with a carrier strike group, with hundreds of troops participating in this exercise, and also with other key capabilities. We really appreciate that strong Italian contribution to this exercise, demonstrating that the whole Alliance is taking part in exercise Cold Response, and that the high north matters for the whole Alliance. Italy in the south of the Alliance contributes to the security in the north of the Alliance, because the high north matters also for Italy, as it matters for all allies.

Any use of chemical weapons, or nuclear weapons will totally change the nature of the war in Ukraine. It will be absolutely unacceptable, and it will be a blatant violation of international law. And therefore, allies have also clearly stated that Russia should not use chemical, biological or of course nuclear weapons and it highlights also the importance of ending this senseless war. It is a dangerous war, it is a horrific war and it is important to end it as soon as possible. And that's reason why NATO Allies put pressure on Russia with unprecedented sanctions, and why we support Ukraine and why we also make sure that we do all we can to prevent an escalation of the conflict beyond Ukraine by increasing our military presence in eastern part of the Alliance.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: NATO has already established that it's going to, or announced, it is going to increase its presence in the eastern part of the alliance and now you speak about the high north and the need to increase its presence in the future. Could you be specific in which way it will increase its presence in the north? Will there be any talk about establishing new NATO bases closer to the Russian border into North?

NATO Secretary General: NATO is an arctic Alliance because we are in the Arctic. Four out of five littoral states to the Arctic Sea, to the polar sea, are NATO States; Canada, United States, Denmark and Norway. We have presence on our territory with our own national forces and also forces from all the NATO allied countries, that's the case for all NATO Allies because we are in the north.

Then we have increased our presence in the air and at sea. And then we see that different allies participate in different types of missions; surveillance, monitoring and also showing presence in the high north.

What we did at the summit yesterday was to task our military commanders to put forward proposals, so Allied leaders can make decisions in June and it's a bit early for me to preempt exactly the specific decisions they will take. But I expect that they will recommend, and that the Allies will agree, to both increase presence on land but also, of course, increase our naval capabilities, air carrier strike groups, submarines, warships, but also of course, more modern air capabilities including fifth generation aircraft and maritime surveillance aircraft.

These are capabilities which allies already invest in, but I see a need to escalate to do more and to do more together. And then this exercise demonstrates the types of capabilities and the type of activity we need to see more across the Alliance and I expect the allies to make decisions on the more concrete details when they meet later on this year.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: I just wanted to know your thoughts about, how specifically has the situation in Ukraine affected this exercise here in the in the north? And also if you can say something about; you mentioned that Russia has declined to be an observer, how problematic is that at this point?

NATO Secretary General: This exercise is long planned, but it has become even more important after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Because it demonstrates the need for allies to stand together. It demonstrates the need to everyday provide credible deterrence and defense; not to provoke a conflict but to prevent the conflict. As long as there is no room for misunderstanding in Moscow about NATO Allies readiness to protect and defend every inch of NATO territory, then there will be no attack. There'll be no war, there will be no conflict. So the purpose of deterrence is to prevent war, to preserve peace.

But then the deterrence has to be credible and to ensure that our deterrence is credible, we need exercises like Cold Response, demonstrating a capability to protect and defend, demonstrate the capability to reinforce quickly if needed, and demonstrate the unity of NATO allies across the Alliance, including working with two highly valued partners, Finland and Sweden. And that's exactly what this exercise does. And therefore Cold Response is an important exercise, not least in the light of the meaningless and senseless Russian attack on Ukraine.

For us it is important, especially now when we see increased tensions, more military activities, to prevent incidents, accidents, miscalculations and if incidents or accidents happen, at least to ensure that they don't spiral out of control and create really dangerous situations. And that is the reason why NATO so strongly supports the agreements we have, including something called the Vienna Document, which is an agreement among all the nations in Europe on transparency, mutual observations of exercises, notification of exercises, to ensure that when you have big exercises like this one, that there are no misunderstandings or incidents caused by that exercise.

We are always transparent. We plan and notify our exercises and invite other countries to observe. Therefore, we regret of course, that Russia declined to observe this exercise. But we regret even more that Russia never invites us to take part in mandatory observation inspections on their exercises. And you have to remember that the invasion they now conduct, or the war their President Putin, wages against Ukraine, was in the beginning disguised as an exercise. They told us that this is just an exercise and they repeated that again and again and again, and then suddenly the exercise turned into a full fledged war.

Every nation has the right to exercise its own forces on its own territory. But it is extremely important that we are transparent, predictable on everything we do related to big military exercises like this one. We are, but Russia has never lived up to their commitments in the Vienna document to be transparent on military exercises.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: How is cooperating with Sweden and Finland different from cooperating with NATO countries?

NATO Secretary General: NATO has a very close cooperation with Finland and Sweden and we have strengthened that cooperation in the light of the war in Ukraine, President Putin's invasion of Ukraine. We exercise together, we operate together, we exchange information and we have political consultations, and Finland and Sweden participate regularly in NATO exercises and they are part of the Cold Response exercise, as they were part of the Trident Juncture exercise and many other exercises.

To reinforce even more the close cooperation between NATO and Finland and Sweden, there is also a Nordic defense cooperation with even more joint activities, consultations and especially for instance, the air Force is exercising throughout the airspace in Norway, Finland and Sweden. This is important for NATO. It's also important for Finland and Sweden, and of course something we very much welcome. But of course, there will always be a difference between an ally and a close partner, Finland and Sweden; they are close partners, but not full members. We respect that decision. It is a sovereign Finnish and Swedish decision to decide whether they want to join NATO or not and of course it's extremely important to convey a clear message that we respect the sovereign decision of Finland and Sweden to be close partners but not be members.

Journalist from TV2: You have said that NATO members must invest more in their defense. One year ago NATO criticized Norway for not investing enough in our own defense. How do you consider the Norwegian defense today regarding the situation in Ukraine?

NATO Secretary General: All NATO allies, have over the last years, increased defense spending. I welcome that because we made the decision to get the NATO allies in 2014, at the Wales summit, the NATO Summit, then and that was after the Russian illegal annexation of Crimea, then allies realized that we actually face a more dangerous world and after years of reducing defense spending, after the end of the Cold War, NATO Allies decided that we need to invest more.

Norway and other allies have increased defense spending since 2014, following up our decision so I welcome that. And I welcome that Norway is acquiring new modern capabilities, including maritime patrol aircrafts, fifth generation aircrafts and many other types of modern military capabilities. I expect allies to do more, both to meet the 2% guideline but even go further, and therefore expect that Norway as all other NATO allies, who are not at 2%, to continue and step up and at least spend a minimum of 2% on defence.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: Last Monday (inaudible) we ask (inaudible) what Sweden will do if Norway was attacked from Russia and she confirmed that Sweden would stand along with Norway. Recently, President Putin has threatened Finland and Sweden if they look to NATO. My question is, if Sweden and Finland is attacked, or threatened, what will NATO do?

NATO Secretary General: NATO has a very close partnership with Finland and Sweden. We work together with them, we operate together with them. There are no other countries in the world which are closer partners to NATO, then Finland and Sweden. We share the same neighborhood, we share the same security challenges and we are together in condemning, for instance, the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

But of course there is a difference between being member and not being member. NATO allies have a treaty obligation the Washington Treaty, our founding treaty, to protect and defend all allies. That's Article Five, that states clearly that if one ally is attacked, it will be regarded as an attack on the whole Alliance; on all allies, it will trigger a response from the whole Alliance. That's our collective defense clause, that's one for all, all for one. That absolute security guarantee applies for members. It doesn't apply for non-members of NATO. So therefore, what I can say is that Sweden are close partners, their security of course matters for us, but the absolute security guarantees that we provide for NATO allies, are only for NATO allies.

Martina Colt from Information in Denmark: Is NATO strong enough in the Baltic Sea area with what has already been done, or do we need to do more there now? Are there any concrete plans of increasing NATO presence?

NATO Secretary General: We have significantly increased our presence in the Baltic region over the last few years and especially in the last weeks. After the illegal annexation of Crimea back in 2014 by Russia, we established for the first time in NATO's history, combat ready battlegroups in the three Baltic countries and Poland. We also increased air policing and naval presence. This is something that has taken place since 2014.

Then when we saw the intelligence, the warnings about a potential Russian invasion into Ukraine, we stepped further up and since the invasion we have added even more. There are now hundreds of thousands of troops, not in the Baltic region but across the Alliance which are on heightened alert, and we have 100,000 US troops in Europe, which is a significant increase. And then we have 40,000 troops on the direct NATO command supported by substantial sea, Navy, as in air and maritime capabilities.

A large part of our increased presence in the eastern part of the Alliances is actually in the Baltic region. For instance, the United Kingdom has doubled the size of the NATO battlegroup in Estonia; Germany has doubled the size of the battlegroup in Lithuania and we also have a significant increase of our presence in Latvia and more maritime presence. And then we have the ability to reinforce because of more forces on high readiness.

We have already done a lot in that region, partly as a long term response to what happened in 2014 and partly as an imminent response to the invasion of Ukraine. We have enough forces now to be able to protect and defend all allies. But we will, of course, always assess the need to further reinforce and we have tasked our military commanders, that was the decision that was taken at the NATO summit yesterday, to look into the more longer term consequences. The need to more fundamentally reset. So this has been kind of the imminent response, what we have seen over the last weeks, but I expect that we will have some more fundamental decisions on the strength, on the type of presence, but these are decisions we'll take a bit later at the Summit in June.

(Inaudible) Journalist introduction: How do you think the effects of the war in Ukraine will look forward and do you think these effects will affect the northern areas and more specifically the defense of Norway?

NATO Secretary General: Putin’s war against Ukraine has fundamentally changed the security reality in Europe and it has created a new normal for our security. So even if the war ended tomorrow, it will have some lasting effects. Because what we have seen is that Russia is willing to contest core principles for our security. Contest the right for every nation to choose his own path.

They are denying Ukraine the right to go the way they want to go as a sovereign, independent nation. Russia is also contesting NATO's right to protect and defend all allies because in the demands they put forward before the invasion they also demanded that NATO should remove all infrastructure and all forces from the eastern part of the Alliance, meaning that almost half of NATO members could not be defended and protected the same way as the rest. All allies who joined after 1997 could not have the same type of protection. Meaning that we were going to have some kind of Second Class NATO membership. Those who joined after and before 1997.

So Russia has contested core principles of our security, and they have demonstrated their will to use military force to meet their objectives, to get what they want. This is a more dangerous security environment than we have seen for decades. And this is reflected in the most brutal war we have seen in Europe since the Second World War. And that's the reason why we need to fundamentally rethink, reset our deterrence and defence to make sure that we, in this more dangerous world, are providing the same predictable, stable, reliable deterrence, as NATO has done for many years.

We have started that process, exactly what the conclusions will be well, that will be for Allies to decide later on. We are taking a lot of imminent steps and then we need to continue the adaptation of NATO. NATO is the most successful alliance in history because we have been able to stand united and change when the world is changing. Now the world is changing, and therefore NATO has to change again.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193681.htm

Good morning.

We meet here at the NATO Headquarters facing the most serious security crisis in a generation.

We will address this crisis together and address the threat that means for Ukraine, for NATO and for the whole international rules-based order.

President Zelensky will address the NATO leaders.

The leaders will focus on our support to Ukraine. Allies have provided support to Ukraine for several years and we have stepped up with more military support, financial support, humanitarian support to help Ukraine uphold its fundamental right for self-defence.

NATO's core task is to protect and defend all Allies.

We have increased our military presence in the eastern part of the Alliance.

The NATO leaders will today address the need for a reset of our deterrence and defence in the longer term.

And the first step is the establishment of four new battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia.

We need to do more, and therefore we need to invest more.

There is a new sense of urgency and I expect that the leaders will agree to accelerate the investments in defence to meet the pledge we have made to invest more in defence.

And I welcome that several Allies have already made announcements on investing more in defence.

The meeting today will demonstrate the importance of North America and Europe standing together facing this crisis.

We are the strongest Alliance in the world. And as long as we stand together, we are also safe.

Thank you.

Hadley Gamble (CNBC): I want to get a sense from you of NATO's understanding of President Putin's actual mental state at this point, because what we understand of course, is that even his central bank governor is trying to leave her post and he's being… he's seeing some defection, if you will, from his inner circle. What's your sense of his mental state at this point?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: President Putin has made a big mistake and that is to launch a war, to wage war, against an independent sovereign nation. He has underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian people, the bravery of the Ukrainian people and the armed forces, and therefore they're also meeting much more resistance than they expected. We need, in a way, to address the actions that we see Russia is doing in Ukraine. And that's also the reason why we have significantly stepped up the support to Ukraine, and why we have increased the presence of NATO troops in the eastern part of the Alliance and increased the readiness of our troops. We do so to be able to respond and address any threat, any challenge to our security, and what kind of decisions… and what kind of decisions they make in Moscow, I will not speculate further about that.

Ukrainian media: [inaudible]

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: NATO Allies provide significant military support to Ukraine. NATO Allies have trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who are now on the front line fighting against the invading Russian forces. The Ukrainian army is much better equipped, much better trained, much better commanded now than in 2014. And the combination of the training and support from NATO Allied countries with the bravery and the courage of the Ukrainian Armed Forces is enabling the Ukrainians to really resist and actually fight back the invading Russian Army. We provide Ukraine also with advanced air defence systems, with anti-tank weapons, with ammunition and fuel. So Allies are providing many different types of support. But we have also made it clear that we will not send in NATO troops on the ground, or NATO planes in the air. We do that because we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not escalate beyond Ukraine. That will cause even more suffering, even more death, even more destruction. And to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine means that we need to impose it, and to impose a no-fly zone means that we need to massively attack Russian air defence systems in Russia, in Belarus and in Ukraine, and also be ready to shoot down Russian planes. And then the risk for a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia will be very high, and that will cause more deaths and more destruction.

Bloomberg: You mentioned yesterday that if chemical weapons are used in Ukraine it could have a direct impact in NATO countries. Could this be considered an attack on a NATO Ally?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: I will not speculate beyond saying the following, that any use of chemical weapons would fundamentally change the nature of the conflict. It will be a blatant violation of international law and it will have widespread and severe consequences. The seriousness of using chemical weapons of course becomes even more obvious knowing that there is a risk always for contamination, for that chemical agents are spread over bigger areas. So this will be a catastrophe for the people of Ukraine, but of course there is also a risk that we can see the spread of chemical agents also into NATO territory. I will not speculate beyond the fact that NATO is always ready to defend, to protect and to react to any type of attack on a NATO Allied country.

ARD: How concerned are you about China’s role in this? And my second question, what does the new military posture of NATO mean in terms of national defence spending?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: On national defence spending, I see a new sense of urgency among Allies. They all understand that since we now need to do more – we face the most serious security crisis in a generation, so therefore, we need to invest more in our security. And the Allies understand that the only way to do that is also to allocate more money for national defence budgets. And I expect Allies to agree to accelerate the implementation of the commitments we have made to invest more in defence. And I welcome the decision, for instance, by Germany to spend 2% of GDP on defence. This will really make a difference because Germany has such a big economy, so the increased investments by Germany makes a different for the whole Alliance.

We call on China to join the rest of the world in clearly condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine and not provide political support. And of course, neither provide any kind of material support to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Question: If Allies were to unanimously ask you to stay on as General Secretary today, would you say yes?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So I will leave that decision to the 30 leaders to decide. I don't have any further comments.

Danish television: Would you call what is happening in Ukraine now a genocide? And if so, what kind of responsibility does NATO have to prevent a genocide?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: NATO is providing unprecedented support to Ukraine, helping them to defend themselves. NATO Allies are also imposing unprecedented sanctions on Russia to hamper, reduce the capability of Russia to finance this war against Ukraine. And we are also, of course, making sure that we are ready to protect and defend all Allies. What we have seen is attacks against civilians, civilian infrastructure, and this is a clear violation of international law. I therefore also welcome that the International Criminal Court has started an investigation and will look into this, because at the end it has to be this body that decides on issues related to violation of international law.

Georgian public broadcasting: Yesterday, you mentioned that it's important to protect other partners as well. What about Georgia, and do we see some statements about Georgia at the end of the communique of NATO?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: I expected that Allies also today… or today in the meeting, that the leaders today in the meeting will express their support to partners which are under pressure from Russia and that includes of course, Georgia. Georgia has the right to choose its own path. NATO Allies have provided support for Georgia over many years to help them to implement reforms, to modernise the defence and security institutions. And the brutal invasion of Ukraine just highlights, underscores the need to provide support to Georgia.

Pro TV Romania: Mr Secretary General, given the war in Ukraine, what is NATO's view regarding possible permanent NATO bases, presence, in Romania? And regarding the battlegroup, will it be made up of the troops that have already been sent from US, Belgium, France in Romania in the past month, or there will be additional troops from other countries?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So NATO has already increased its military presence in Romania. We have deployed the elements of the high readiness joint task force led by France. I visited Romania a few weeks ago and I also met with the troops from the United States and from other countries, and they will demonstrate the commitment to stay and to protect and help to defend NATO territory also in Romania. These troops will be there as long as necessary. But this is part of the immediate response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Then I expect at the meeting today that the leaders will start the process that will provide us with advice to make more longer term decisions on our longer term deterrence and defence, because we need to reset our deterrence and defence. These decisions, I expect leaders to take them at the summit later on in June. So these are two different processes, one is what we already have done, and that will be there as long as necessary. And then we are addressing the more longer term changes in our deterrence and defence. The fact is that we face the most serious security crisis in a generation and therefore NATO needs to respond. And that's the reason why we need to reset our deterrence and defence for the long term. Thank you.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193611.htm

President Zelensky addressed us with an impassioned message.

Thanking NATO Allies for the significant support we are providing.

And stressing the vital importance of even more military assistance.

Today, NATO leaders agreed that we must and will provide further support to Ukraine.

We will continue to impose unprecedented costs on Russia.

And we will reinforce Allied deterrence and defence.

Leaders approved our four new NATO battlegroups.

In Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia.

These are in addition to the four already in the Baltic countries and Poland.

So we have eight multinational NATO battlegroups now.

From the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.

Across Europe, there are one hundred thousand US troops supporting NATO efforts.

And European Allies and Canada have also stepped up.

We have 40,000 forces under direct NATO command, mostly in the eastern part of the Alliance.

Backed by major air and naval power.

Including an unprecedented five carrier strike groups from the High North to the Mediterranean.

Today, NATO leaders agreed to reset our deterrence and defence for the longer-term.

To face a new security reality.

On land, we will have substantially more forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, at higher readiness.

With more prepositioned equipment and supplies.

In the air, we will deploy more jets.

And strengthen our integrated air and missile defence.

At sea, we will have carrier strike groups, submarines and significant numbers of combat ships on a persistent basis.

We will also strengthen our cyber defences.

And enhance our exercises, focusing on collective defence and interoperability.

I expect we will decide on the details at our next Summit in Madrid in June.

Today, Allied leaders also agreed to provide further support to Ukraine.

Helping to uphold their fundamental right to self-defence.

Allies are also equipping Ukraine with significant military supplies.

Including anti-tank and air defence systems, and drones.

Which are proving highly effective.

As well as substantial financial and humanitarian aid.

Today, we agreed to do more.

Including cybersecurity assistance.

And equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats.

This could include detection, protection, and medical supplies, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management.

We are determined to do all we can to support Ukraine.

And I welcome the concrete offers of assistance made by Allies today.

At the same time, we have a responsibility to ensure the conflict does not escalate further. Because this would be even more dangerous and more devastating.

Allies agreed that we must also increase our support for other partners at risk from Russian threats and interference.

Including Georgia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Working together, and with the European Union, we must help them uphold their sovereignty and strengthen their resilience.

We also addressed Beijing’s role in the crisis.

Today, Allied leaders called on China to refrain from supporting Russia’s war effort.

China must not provide economic or military support for the Russian invasion.

Instead, Beijing should use its significant influence on Russia.

And promote an immediate, peaceful resolution.

Allies also agreed that Belarus must stop acting as an accomplice to Putin’s invasion.

At today’s meeting, leaders reaffirmed our strong commitment to NATO’s Open Door policy, under Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.

NATO enlargement has been an historic success.

Spreading democracy, freedom, and prosperity across Europe.

One month since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, NATO’s security environment has fundamentally changed.

For the long haul.

And we are responding.

But security does not come for free.

And doing more will cost more.

So NATO leaders agreed to redouble efforts to meet the Defence Investment Pledge we made in 2014.

Allies will submit additional plans on how to meet the pledge in time for the Madrid Summit in June.

And I welcome that a number of Allies today announced plans for significant increases in defence spending.

At this dangerous time, transatlantic unity and solidarity are vital.

Europe and North America are standing, and will continue to stand, strong together in NATO.

With that, I am ready to take your questions.

Natasha Bertrand (CNN): Hi, Mr Secretary General, thank you. President Zelensky in his address to NATO accused Russia of deploying phosphorus munitions. I am wondering whether NATO has seen evidence of that and what your response is or would be? And then I am wondering, did you discuss during this meeting a permanent basing of forces in any of these countries such as the Baltics and abandoning the NATO-Russia Founding Act?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So we are resetting NATO’s deterrence and defence for the long term, with more troops, with more air assets and more maritime capabilities. We have already increased our presence in the east and today we decided on four new battlegroups. The leaders agreed to task our military commanders to provide options for a long-term reset of our presence, of our military posture in the eastern part of the Alliance and across the whole Alliance. Details will be then decided at our summit in June but that comes on top for what we have already done. So this is long term, we are prepared for long haul because we can already today say that the Russian invasion, President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has changed our security environment for the long term. It is a new reality. It is a new normal and NATO is responding for the long term. We have seen very credible reports about the use of use of military force against civilians. Of course, this is a great concern for all NATO Allies.

NBC: Secretary General thank you for taking my question. How do you believe NATO will respond if China begins to support Russia economically and perhaps with military supplies? And also do you believe that there is a role to play for NATO when it comes to alleviating energy costs? And I'm talking about speaking directly to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers. Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So NATO Allies are coordinating their efforts when it comes to also energy security. It was also addressed in the meeting today to step up supplies, to diversify sources of supply and also to reduce dependence on supplies from Russia and later today, I will also participate in the G7 meeting. In different frameworks, G7, working with the EU, there are different formats where NATO Allies address the need to strengthen energy security and reduce dependence on Russian oil and gas. Our message to China is that they should join the rest of the world and clearly condemn the brutal war against Ukraine and not support Russia and neither with economic support or with military support.

Irina Somer (Interfax Ukraine): I would like to ask you if Polish leadership put at the table today for discussion, the proposal to send peacekeeping mission to Ukraine and if yes what kind of discussion it was? And is there some conclusion? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: We discussed a wide range of issues and the message is that we have to stand united and also that we need to provide support to Ukraine. At the same time, we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict does not become a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia. And that is also the reason why Allies have declared that we will not deploy troops on the ground in in Ukraine because the only way to do that is to be prepared to engage in full conflict with Russian troops.

Henry Foy (Financial Times): Thank you very much, Secretary General. Congratulations on your annual extension. You said in the statement that Allies agree to ‘enhance preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats’. Is that based on credible intelligence that those threats could be imminent, and how does the Alliance strengthen its protection against those threats? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: So we are concerned, partly because we see the rhetoric and we see that Russia is trying to create some kind of pretext accusing Ukraine, United States, NATO Allies [of] preparing to use chemical and biological weapons. And we have seen before that this way of accusing others is actually a way to create a pretext for doing the same themselves. And of course, accusations against Ukraine and NATO Allies are absolutely false. Any use of chemical weapons will totally change the nature of the conflict. It will be a blatant violation of international law and it will have widespread consequences and, of course, be extremely dangerous. It will affect the people in Ukraine. But there's also a risk that it will have a direct effect on people living in NATO countries, because we can see contamination, we can see the spread of chemical agents or biological weapons into our countries. We also know that Russia has used chemical agents against its own opposition, and they have used it on NATO territory, in Salisbury, before. And we also know that Russia has facilitated, supported, the Assad regime in Syria when they used chemical weapons against their own population.

So this just highlights the importance of ending this war immediately because this is a dangerous situation and therefore we impose the sanctions, and therefore we support Ukraine. Allies agreed to supply equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. This could include detection equipment, protection and medical support, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management. We are also enhancing Allies’ preparedness and readiness for chemical and biological and nuclear threats. Our top military commander, General Wolters, has activated NATO's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence elements, and Allies are deploying additional chemical and biological and nuclear defences to reinforce our existing and new battlegroups. So we are taking measures both to support Ukraine, and also to defend ourselves.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): President Zelensky, when he addressed… you recall the fact he first spoke to you a month ago, and he says he didn't get clear answers. So this time he asked you specifically for 1% of all your tanks, for 1% of all your aircraft, for multi-launch rocket systems, anti-ship weapons and means of air defence – a very specific list. What is your clear answer?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: We all listened very carefully to President Zelensky. And many of the leaders in the room have had contacts with him over these weeks. I also spoke with him and the Ukrainian defence minister participated in our defence ministerial meeting last week. We listened carefully. And of course, we took note of his very compassionate message to all NATO Allies.

NATO Allies provide significant support to Ukraine. And we provide also lethal weapons, advanced systems, and also systems that help them to shoot down planes and attack battle tanks with anti-tank weapons, and many other types of systems including drones. I will not go into the details of the exact type of systems we are deploying. There is close contact between NATO Allies and Ukraine. But what I can say is that Allies do what they can to support Ukraine with weapons so Ukraine can defend themselves. Self-defence is a right enshrined in the UN Charter.

At the same time, we have a responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe, involving not only Ukraine and Russia, but NATO Allies and Russia. That will be more dangerous and more devastating. And I think we have to be honest about that, and that's exactly what we have been in our meeting today, and also what I say to you in the press conference now.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): So again, no clear answer?

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: Well, what we do is that we are delivering a lot of equipment, and that is an answer. But I will not go into the details. I don't think that's wise for operational reasons if I listed exactly what and when and how we are delivering essential equipment to Ukraine. NATO Allies have stepped up and it is essential for the progress they have been able to make in the fight against the invading Russian forces.

NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu: Thank you very much, colleagues. I know there are many questions. I'm afraid the Secretary General needs to go to the G7 meeting, but there will be other briefings throughout the day. Thank you so much.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193613.htm
4,98012b92-b3ba-4c60-8e77-2c23e8861529,[],,"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, alternately known as NATO, is a military alliance between countries in North America and Europe . NATO was formed in the aftermath of World War II to preserve peace in Europe and protect democratic nations from potential attacks by the Soviet Union (which exists today as the Russian Federation). NATO’s website states that NATO's founding treaty ""commits the Allies to democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law, as well as to peaceful resolution of disputes. Importantly, the treaty sets out the idea of collective defense, meaning that an attack against one Ally is considered an attack against all Allies."" As of February 2022, NATO has 30 members in total.

The 12 founding member countries of NATO are Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. NATO also has a list of aspiring members, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Macedonia, and Ukraine, which may one day become full NATO members.

Is Ukraine part of NATO?

Not yet, but it is in the process of joining. Ukraine joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1994 and applied to join the NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) in 2008. The 2010 presidential election of Viktor Yanukovych, who wanted to keep the country non-aligned, delayed Ukraine's progress toward U.N. membership. However, after two important events in 2014—Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and a national election—Ukraine's new government renewed and prioritized efforts to join NATO. According to a 2017 poll, 69% of Ukrainians support joining NATO. Ukraine became a NATO aspiring member in 2018. On February 7, 2019, the Ukrainian parliament voted to change its constitution to affirm its intention to join NATO and the European Union.

Is Russia part of NATO?

No, Russia is not part of NATO. In fact, the Russian government's perceived aggressiveness is the main issue NATO was founded to counteract. Despite this, Russia has historically at least given the appearance of cooperation with NATO. Russia and NATO established the North Atlantic Cooperation Council in 1991, and Russia joined the Partnership for Peace program in 1994. The establishment of the Russia-NATO Council to address security issues and collaborate on joint projects followed in 2002. NATO suspended cooperation with Russia in 2014 following Russia's invasion of Crimea, not including the NATO-Russia Council. Russia and NATO have held several meetings since 2017, and NATO states that an improvement in their relationship with Russia is dependent on Russia's compliance with international law and their commitments. In October 2021, NATO expelled eight Russians from its Brussels, Belgium headquarters amid concerns that they were undeclared intelligence agents. Russia responded by suspending relations with NATO.

Future members and the Partnership for Peace program

Twenty countries are members of NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which is designed to build trust between the organization and states in Europe and the former Soviet Union. Perhaps ironically, Russia itself is a member of the Partnership for Peace program, though its invasions of Georgia (2008), Crimea (2014) and the Ukraine (2022) call the country's commitment to peace into question.

Members of NATO's Partnerships for Peace program:

Armenia - 1994 Ireland - 1999 Sweden - 1994 Austria - 1995 Kazakhstan - 1994 Switzerland - 1994 Azerbaijan - 1994 Kyrgyzstan - 1994 Tajikistan - 2002 Belarus - 1995 Malta - 2008 Turkmenistan - 1994 Bosnia and Herzegovnia - 2006 Moldova - 1994 Ukraine - 1994 Finland - 1994 Russia - 1994 Uzbekistan - 1994 Georgia - 1994 Serbia - 2006

Members of the Partnership for Peace program include former republics of the Soviet Union: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, as well as Yugoslavia's former republics Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. European Union members of the program include Austria, Finland, Ireland, Malta, and Sweden. Finally, the European Free Trade Association member Switzerland is also part of the Partnership for Peace program.",https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/nato-countries

Stoltenberg tweeted Thursday that he is honoured by the decision of leaders to extend my term as Secretary General until 30 September 2023.

As we face the biggest security crisis in a generation, we stand united to keep our alliance strong and our people safe, he said.

The former Norwegian prime minister was named to NATO's top civilian post in October 2014. It's the second time that his term of office has been extended. His mandate was due to expire in September.

In February, Norway's government appointed Stoltenberg as head of the Scandinavian country's central bank and said it hoped he could start in his new role around Dec 1. It later said that deputy governor Ida Wolden Bache would be in charge until Stoltenberg can take over.

Stoltenberg, 63, has described Russia's war on Ukraine as the most serious security situation we have been in for decades.

Stoltenberg has been praised for steering through a difficult and divisive period under the Trump administration, when the US threatened not to come to the aid of member countries that weren't spending enough on defence.

Speaking to reporters on an Air Force One flight to Brussels on Wednesday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that President Joe Biden thinks very highly of Secretary-General Stoltenberg.

They've developed a relationship of trust, Sullivan said. Secretary-General Stoltenberg has played an instrumental role in helping secure the powerful unity you've seen at NATO through this crisis.

Stoltenberg was twice prime minister in Norway from 2005 to 2013 and from 2002 to 2014 and he also served as finance minister, and industry and energy minister.

As Russia’s war in Ukraine grinds on, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he thinks it’s unlikely there will be a full-fledged war between Russia and the alliance.

Stoltenberg, speaking to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, credited the NATO countries’ display of unity for lowering the likelihood of a full-scale war.

However, he said the on the ground in Ukraine is “extremely unpredictable,” and that NATO is faced with a new reality and must be prepared for the long haul.

When asked about reports that Russia is not picking up the deconfliction line, Stoltenberg replied that is correct, and that the “Russians have not been ready, as I say, to use those lines, but we assume that if there is a need, they will be able to communicate with us.”

The secretary general, who was meant to become Norway’s Central Bank chief later this year, is now set to stay on as the head of NATO given the situation in Ukraine. “I feel privileged for the third time, actually, to extend my term.”

When asked if the job at NATO was more important than the job at Norway’s Central Bank, Stoltenberg replied “I feel it is more important,” adding that if there is anything he can do to stop this conflict from escalating into a full-fledged war between Russia and NATO, then “I feel that is an extremely meaningful task to do.”",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-24-22/h_59d85042a496b132fbd397578dd4d63e
8,98012b92-b3ba-4c60-8e77-2c23e8861529,['Rfe Rl'],,"KYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has threatened to break off talks with Moscow should Russian forces wipe out the remaining Ukrainian soldiers trapped in Mariupol as Moscow claimed it had taken control of the besieged and battered port city after a weeks-long battle.

The Russian Defense Ministry on April 16 said it had cleared the Mariupol urban area of Ukrainian troops and had trapped a few remaining fighters in the Azovstal steel plant, according to Russian state-run media.

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman was quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency as saying that Ukrainian forces have lost a total of 4,000 troops during the long fight for the city -- a battle that has caught the world’s attention for its brutality.

Casualty figures from both sides have proved impossible to independently confirm during the conflict, which began with Russia's unprovoked invasion on February 24.

Ukraine has not commented on the latest Russian claims but in recent days has indicated the situation in Mariupol was desperate, with deaths mounting among the trapped civilian population and many experts predicting the city would soon fall to the Russians.

In an interview published earlier on April 16 with Ukrayinska Pravda, Zelenskiy warned Russia against committing atrocities against Ukrainian soldiers in the city.

""The elimination of our troops, of our men [in Mariupol] will put an end to any negotiations,” he said.

""That will bring an impasse as we don't negotiate on either our territories or our people,"" he added.

Peace talks have taken place between the two sides since Russia's invasion began, with little or no progress.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Reports early on April 16 said heavy fighting continued in several parts of Mariupol as Ukrainian troops attempted to fend off Russian soldiers who have been bolstered by reinforcements in recent days.

""The situation is very difficult [in Mariupol],"" Zelenskiy said early in the day. ""Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis.... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.""

As the battle for the ruins of Mariupol appeared to be near its bloody end, air-raid sirens could be heard in many other parts of Ukraine on April 16, including in Kyiv, after Russia said it would seek revenge on the capital for what it claimed, without evidence, was Ukrainian targeting of Russian border towns.

Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said at least one person was killed and several others wounded in early morning attacks.

""For those Kyivites who left and are already thinking of heading back to return to the capital, I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,"" Klitschko said in a message on his Telegram channel.

Russian troops have faced tougher-than-expected resistance -- both from the Ukrainian military and from ordinary citizens -- forcing them to retreat from areas in the north and to focus on eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, including Mariupol.

In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskiy said the success of Ukraine's military and that of international sanctions against Russia will determine how long the war will last.

""The success of our military on the battlefield has been really significant. Historically significant. But it's still not enough to clear our land from the invading forces,"" he said.

""The sanctions against Russia are very serious, economically painful. But it is not enough to starve Russia's military machine. We need to promote stronger, more destructive sanctions. This will determine how long this war will last,"" he added.

Russia's warning to inflict more damage on Ukraine came a day after it suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, the Moskva, which sank while being towed to port on April 14 after suffering heavy damage under circumstances that remain in dispute.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on the Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

The National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) has rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Kyiv did claim, however, to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Meanwhile, the United States and its Western allies continued to pile pressure on Moscow over its campaign.

The German government said on April 15 that it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.



The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Russia's Foreign Ministry on April 16 said it was banning British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Minister Liz Truss, and several other cabinet ministers over British measures aimed at isolating Moscow and crippling the country's economy.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.

The UN refugee agency said as of April 16 that 4,836,445 million Ukrainians had left the country since the Russian invasion -- up by 40,200 from the previous day’s total.

He Covers Canadian', 'U.S. Politics', 'Current Affairs.']",,"While NATO has resisted military intervention against Russia, the potential use of chemical and even small tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine could be the red line that triggers a response from the Western alliance, experts say.

Yet setting such red lines come with challenges, and risk and fears of expanding the war into a global conflict.

NATO has made it clear that any deliberate attack by Russia on an alliance member would prompt, as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has stated, a ""decisive response from the whole alliance.""

However, there ""are many different scenarios that are less clear that could draw NATO into a larger war with Russia,"" said Roland Paris, director of the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa. ""And that is an extraordinary risk.""

Military response could widen the war

Although the idea of using weapons of mass destruction shocks the conscience, a military response to such attacks threatens to widen the war, Paris said.

""The potential for this to become a world war would be significant,"" he said.

How NATO may respond to the use of chemical, biological or even tactical nuclear weapons within Ukraine, a non-NATO country, is something that will likely be a focus of Thursday's NATO summit in Brussels.

""I think that what you're probably going to see at these meetings this week is kind of finding out whose trip lines are where so that NATO is ready to respond,"" said Elizabeth Shackelford, a former diplomat with the U.S. State Department and a senior fellow at Chicago Council on Global Affairs.

""It's my guess that it's going to be pretty contentious over who wants to do something more extreme and who doesn't.""

Vague threats

So far, leaders in NATO have made vague threats that Russia would pay if it were to launch weapons of mass destruction, without defining what specific action might be taken.

U.S. President Joe Biden has said that Russia would pay a ""severe price"" if it launched chemical weapons. And on Wednesday, Stoltenberg told a news conference that if Russia used chemical weapons, it would ""totally change the nature of the conflict"" and have ""far-reaching consequences.""

But he also said he would not ""speculate about any military response from the NATO side except for saying very clearly that NATO's main responsibility is to make sure that we defend and protect all allies.""

Some observers have raised concerns that, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine faltering, a desperate Vladimir Putin might resort to some form of weapons of mass destruction in the country.

""I suspect that Putin understands the risks of using weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine,"" Paris said. ""Up until a month ago, I would have thought that would never be a risk that he would take in the European context. But he's made decisions that are so reckless that there's no predicting his next steps.""

Earlier this month, Polish President Andrzej Duda told BBC that the use of weapons of mass destruction ""would be a game changer,"" and that NATO ""will have to sit at the table and they will really have to think seriously what to do because then it starts to be dangerous.""

As for chemical weapons, Shackelford said that may not trigger an automatic military response from NATO, but would depend on how or where they were deployed.

'Depend on what they did'

""I think it would be horrific. It would be alarming. But I think that it would depend on what they did. For example if it was a military target versus a civilian target,"" she said.

""Are they trying to kind of poison an area that people can use supplies there, versus are they actually spraying chemical weapons in a highly densely populated area with people fleeing the war,"" she said. ""I think those would merit a different reaction from NATO.""

WATCH | Russia must stop 'nuclear sabre rattling,' Stoltenberg says:

Russia must stop 'nuclear sabre rattling,' says NATO chief Duration 1:32 NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg addressed fears of chemical or nuclear attacks during Russia's war against Ukraine, saying: 'A nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought.' 1:32

Putin has previously implied he would launch nuclear weapons against any country interfering in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ordered his forces on high alert. Earlier this week, his chief spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN that Russia might resort to nuclear weapons in the face of an ""existential threat"" to the country.

Although such comments have raised significant worry, the more immediate concern, say some observers, is the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons.

Russia is believed to have around 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, with only a small fraction of the kiloton power of strategic nuclear weapons. They can still cause enormous damage but have significantly less blast capacity than those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Putin might fire a weapon at an uninhabited area instead of at troops, Ulrich Kühn, a nuclear expert at the University of Hamburg and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the New York Times.

And that, says Shackelford, would merit a qualitatively different response by NATO. Any use of nuclear weapons risks normalizing the idea that this could be a nuclear war, she said.

""I can't see Russia using any form of nuclear weapon and that not being something that the West can sit on the sidelines for, because at that stage, what we're trying to do is to not invite an escalation. And that would be a massive escalation.""

Problems with red lines

Still, setting red lines may also provoke Russia, some experts suggest.

""We should hope that NATO won't set a red line. This would be an invitation for further escalation by Russia and further efforts to damage NATO's credibility,"" said retired Gen. Wesley K. Clark, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe.

NATO response unclear if Putin launches chemical, nuclear weapons Duration 2:03 As experts raise concerns over the potential for Russian President Vladimir Putin to deploy chemical and nuclear weapons in his invasion of Ukraine, it's still not clear how NATO would respond to such an escalation. 2:03

Michael Kimmage, who served on Secretary of State John Kerry's policy planning staff, where he held the Russia/Ukraine portfolio, said setting red lines in this case is also complicated by the fact that Ukraine is not a NATO member.

""There are questions of precedent and where things would apply. If the Russians use chemical weapons in Ukraine, that's a problem for NATO. If the Chinese use chemical weapons somewhere else, is that a problem for NATO?""

Kimmage said it would be better not to declare red lines and be boxed into a corner.

Instead, if Russia used chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, it would be better to marshal as big of an international coalition as possible, one that includes China, and start to exert a kind of pressure on Russia that it hasn't yet seen, he said.

""But I don't know if that all has to be spelled out beforehand,"" he said.

Harry Nedelcu, director of policy at Rasmussen Global, an international political consultancy firm, echoed that any potential NATO response to such actions should be deliberately left unclear.

""That is actually very potent because you need a bit of that veil of uncertainty to actually increase your power to deter,"" he said.

""It's actually a good idea to not even spell out exactly what it is.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vladmir-putin-nato-red-line-1.6394192

After a month of intensive fighting in Ukraine, Russia has killed at least 1,000 civilians while an unknown number (but reportedly thousands) of Russian soldiers have died. By invading Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has catalyzed some major shifts. Germany, long averse to military spending, has decided to up its defense budget. European countries, skeptical of migrants, have welcomed Ukrainian refugees. And most of all, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been revived.

Long a lethargic dinosaur of an organization, NATO this week announced new battle groups would deploy to four countries on its eastern flank, and Biden announced that the alliance would respond to Russia should it use chemical weapons in Ukraine. It’s a remarkable shift for an alliance that French President Emmanuel Macron called brain dead just two and a half years ago. And it reveals a fundamental truth of the organization: It’s an alliance meant to counter a great power adversary, for good and bad.

Biden, who has long cheered the relationship between the United States and Europe, met 29 other heads of state and the secretary general of NATO for a closed-door meeting Thursday, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joined by video. “Today’s establishment of four new battle groups in Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary is a strong signal that we will collectively defend and protect every inch of NATO territory,” Biden said.

NATO summits, it might be said, are not usually very substantive. The family photo of recognizable world leaders is often the most memorable moment from these largely symbolic affairs. But NATO, an alliance forged to push back against Soviet influence in Europe during the Cold War, is designed for crisis.

Plenty of new things, in addition to the troop deployment, came out of Thursday’s meetings and in advance of them. Biden announced $1 billion in new humanitarian aid to those affected by the new refugee crisis in Europe, and a week earlier, the US had announced $1 billion more in military and security aid to Ukraine. Together with European countries, the White House and State Department announced even more sanctions on Russian politicians, military leaders, and elites, and measures to stop sanctions-evaders. Biden also said he would support throwing Russia out of the G20 club of countries with major economies.

The trip isn’t just about NATO. Biden is meeting with leaders of the European Union and the G7 countries. He will also travel to Poland, which, bordering Ukraine, has received more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees as of this week. And Biden announced that the US will welcome 100,000 refugees from the ongoing war.

“NATO was first sort of given a new mission, or a new lease on life, by the events of 2014,” the last time Putin invaded Ukraine, said Samuel Charap, a Russia expert at the RAND Corporation. “There’s a unity of purpose now that there wasn’t before.”

How NATO is meeting the moment

The alliance of 30 countries in Europe and North America had been intended to contain the Soviet Union’s advances in the world. Yet as recently as three years ago, critics — including some world leaders — wondered if it wasn’t well suited for the geopolitics of the 21st century.

Some preeminent US foreign policy leaders argued in the 1990s that NATO wasn’t the right way for the US to engage Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union, but then as now, NATO skeptics didn’t have much sway in Washington.

Enter US President Donald Trump. Preaching a so-called America-first foreign policy, Trump often bashed NATO; he wanted allies to spend more on their militaries, and reportedly for the US to withdraw from the alliance. That stance rankled members of the Washington security establishment, but he wasn’t the only one who emphasized the alliance’s shortcomings. “What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO,” Macron said in 2019.

The comment came after Trump pulled US troops out of Syria to avoid clashing with NATO ally Turkey. He withdrew those forces, however, without consulting with other NATO allies, calling into question the dependability of the Trump White House — and by extension, of the United States. US power is one of the biggest guarantors of the alliance, and Trump had battered that image.

“You have partners together in the same part of the world, and you have no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the United States and its NATO allies. None,” added Macron. He later stood by that harsh assessment.

Those criticisms, and other concerns throughout the late 2010s, led even former diplomats and scholars who were staunch supporters of the transatlantic alliance to say that NATO was in crisis.

Derek Chollet and Amanda Sloat, two policy experts who are now senior Biden administration officials, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine in 2018 that NATO summits were “just not worth it” and simply too risky when Trump was in office, as he denigrated the alliance on the world stage.

Nicholas Burns, a Harvard professor who is now serving as Biden’s ambassador to China, co-wrote a paper three years ago that argued that Trump’s NATO bashing, increasingly undemocratic leaders under the NATO umbrella (among them Turkey and Hungary), and NATO’s failure to confront Putin “have hurtled the Alliance into its most worrisome crisis in memory.”

Now NATO is a key pillar of the Biden administration’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “Putin has reinvigorated NATO in a fundamental way,” said Ivo Daalder, who served as Obama’s ambassador to NATO and now directs the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “What Biden has done is he has reminded Americans and our allies how important NATO is.”

To deter Russia, NATO has doubled the active forces under its direct command in eastern Europe; there are now about 40,000 on the continent, in addition to the 100,000 US troops stationed there. A NATO spokesperson tweeted a graphic showing that 130 aircraft and 140 naval vessels are “on high alert.”

We face a new reality for our security due to #Russia’s illegal invasion of #Ukraine.



In response, #NATO has reinforced its defensive presence in the eastern part of the Alliance with more troops, planes & ships.

As NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at the top of the summit, “NATO is providing unprecedented support to Ukraine, helping them to defend themselves.” He mentioned the “unprecedented sanctions” on Russia and NATO’s increased military presence, especially in Romania.

NATO is stepping up to be the leader of European security. Should it?

Proponents — and there are many — of the Biden team’s response and NATO’s resurgence say this is exactly what the alliance should be doing.

NATO was the United States’ first transcontinental peacetime alliance, and maintaining it in peacetime is important, says John Manza, a former senior NATO official who is now a professor at the National Defense University. “It’s like a fire truck that’s sitting in the local fire station. You can complain and say, ‘Oh, it’s not doing anything, it’s just costing us money’ — until there’s a fire and you need it,” he told me.

NATO is learning from its last major test, in 2014, when Putin annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and later invaded the country’s eastern provinces. In response, NATO expanded its cohort of rapid response troops.

The alliance in 2018 developed a readiness plan with major land, sea, and air capabilities able to mobilize in 30 days. This month, NATO announced that it is significantly growing its forward presence to plan for potential contingencies. “Now we have enough combat power to really defend conventionally alliance territory against a near-peer competitor, like Russia,” Manza said.

The alliance, at its core, is about preventing interstate war on the European continent. “It’s absolutely what you could call NATO’s sweet spot,” said Bruce Jentleson, a Duke political scientist and fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington. “When you have sort of a superseding shared security threat, that’s when countries work together.”

That’s not to say NATO has it all figured out. “The real conundrum for NATO is the nuclear, biological, and chemical one,” said Evelyn Farkas, a senior Pentagon official for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia during the Obama administration. “How would they respond if there was a nuclear detonation or a nuclear weapon used by Russia? And same for chemical and biological.”

The emerging consensus among the Washington foreign policy establishment, both right and left, is that the Biden administration deserves praise for how it has handled this crisis and shepherded NATO quickly to respond to Russian aggression. NATO has been unified with providing Ukraine with weapons, sanctioning Russia, and beginning to address the new influx of refugees.

But, critics say, there are potential downsides to NATO being the only institution for European security.

Ukraine’s precarious position — with a door open to join NATO at some point in the distant future, but at the moment nowhere near meeting the conditions for the alliance’s unanimous welcome — illustrates one of the complications.

By saying, as President George W. Bush did overtly at a NATO summit in 2008, that Ukraine could and would join NATO, but not providing Ukraine with a membership action plan and a timetable to join the alliance, Ukraine has been left unprotected. It lacks the ironclad protections of the treaty’s Article 5, in which all 30 countries consider an attack on one country an attack on all of them. But at the same time, Russia internalized threats of Ukraine’s closeness to NATO.

None of this is to validate the pretexts that Putin has used to launch this war, but if NATO actually wanted Ukraine to join the alliance, maybe it should have made that happen a little more quickly. Or perhaps it never should have made the offer explicit in the first place.

Given these circumstances, critics of NATO wonder whether NATO is the best forum for ensuring European security. “The time has come for Europe to take primary responsibility for its own defense,” said Rajan Menon of the research group Defense Priorities. “It just beggars belief to me that Germany, the wealthiest country in the EU, has an army that suffers from spare parts shortages and insufficient enlisted men and women and officers.” Germany, pacifist after the Second World War, announced it would invest in its military after Putin invaded Ukraine.

It may be in Europe’s best interest to prepare its own deterrent force separately from NATO. Menon notes that, given increasing American attention toward potential conflict in Asia, Europeans should realize that the United States won’t always have the capacity to have Europe’s back. He explains that while “one can dress it up in all kinds of multilateral clothing,” NATO has always been an overwhelmingly American operation.

Beyond Europe, the United Nations could be playing a bigger role. “NATO is filling a void that the UN has created,” as Farkas put it.

What this summit means for NATO’s future

NATO has come to the fore on the issue of Ukraine. But what’s equally clear is that the transatlantic alliance is not going to be the answer to every problem of this century.

The larger question emerging from this new war in Europe is whether the US will similarly be able to mobilize global allies more broadly in the face of more existential crises of the next period. There remains a bigger global agenda that the US must take on — countering climate change, preparing for future pandemics, and strengthening the internal dynamics of democracies that are backsliding — that can’t be totally put aside by the current war.

A recalcitrant Russia and a reinvigorated NATO has major implications for the future of European security. But Jentleson, the former State Department adviser to the Obama administration, cautioned that it doesn’t change everything we think and know about the world. “Our whole foreign policy is not going to revolve around a new Cold War,” he said. “I don’t see it as defining the next era comprehensively the way that the Cold War defined the era from the late ’40s on.”

What is much more likely to define the coming decades is China as a world power, and that’s why everyone is monitoring how China navigates Russia’s war. This has practical implications. Biden administration officials have leaked that Russia has sought Chinese weapons. In Thursday’s statements from NATO heads of state, the 30 countries called on China “to abstain from supporting Russia’s war effort in any way, and to refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions.”

The statement represented a larger acknowledgment of China as a competitor that is watching how the West responds to Russia.

In recent years, Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that the “East is rising” and the West is declining, and Putin has said that liberalism is “obsolete.” War in Europe’s east may have altered that equation and reinforced the notion that a military alliance alone is insufficient to address 21st-century problems. But some see NATO’s response — and that of non-NATO European countries alongside it — as a sign that concerted action is possible.

“The last four weeks have demonstrated that liberalism is strong and capable of standing up, and the West, if anything, is rising, not declining, if it works together,” Daalder said.",https://www.vox.com/22994826/nato-resurgence-biden-trip-putin-ukraine
