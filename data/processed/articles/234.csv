In 2013, when Metropolitan Paul (Ponomarev) was assigned to succeed Metropolitan Philaret, Metropolitan Paul asked to become a citizen of Belarus. This was granted by the government.

Metropolitan Paul and Metropolitan Philaret



The exceptional details of how Metropolitan Philaret (Vakhromeyev) was exceptionally treated and cared for in his retirement are all clear demonstrations of respect for a beloved father. Video presentations and articles about him after his retirement gave expression to this love, respect and gratitude in Christ for such a father in Christ.

When his retirement was granted, it is to be understood that the primary reason for this retirement was his failing health, and that his age was a secondary matter. Metropolitan Philaret served the Church with evangelical love, energy and zeal. In Christ, he was the catalyst for the remarkable growth and stability of the Belarusian Exarchate. Not only that, but also his fatherly presence, example and labour affected the whole country to a great extent, and this fact was obviously appreciated by the civil authorities.

This man had lived his whole life in joyful service of Christ. His life was in many ways similar to that of Patriarch Aleksey II, together with whom he had worked for a great many years. They each faced very many obstacles and troubles, but in the love and wisdom of Christ, they both led fruitfully the flock of rational sheep entrusted to them.







30th Anniversary of the Exarchate, 2019

On 29 September, 2019, Metropolitan Paul (Ponomarev) led the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy in Minsk, which marked the Anniversary of the Exarchate. This Divine Liturgy was served in the open air, in the square in front of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Minsk. Although he was unable to be present personally, the words of Metropolitan Philaret (Vakhromeyev) were read aloud to those present. On that occasion, Metropolitan Ilarion (Alfeyev) of the Department of External Relations of the Moscow Patriarch gave this brief overvew :

Byelorussia was one of the Republics of the Soviet Union that suffered greatly under the pressure of atheistic persecutions. A goal was set to destroy religion completely in Byelorussia, to make it a fully atheistic territory. However, when Metropolitan Philaret was appointed to serve here, the situation began to change. Of course, it began to change especially after the Millennium of the Baptism of Russia and after the establishment of the Exarchate, which gave an opportunity to take a fresh look at the religious situation in Byelorussia. That moment marked the beginning of true revival of Church life in the Byelorussian land. From one diocese headed by one hierarch, the Belarusian Church grew into the Exarchate with its own Holy Synod, the Exarchate which carries out missionary and charitable work, social projects and ministry among young people, which actively interacts with secular authorities and promotes contacts with other Christian confessions.

By 2020, with the controversies and political instability that surrounded the August presidential elections, Metropolitan Paul (Ponomarev), his successor, faced particular difficulties, in part because he was not himself born a Belarusian. In August, he asked Patriarch Kirill (Gundyaev) of Moscow and the Holy Synod of Bishops and the Russian Orthodox Church for release from his responsibilities as the Exarch of Belarus. As a consequence, he was transferred to the Diocese of Krasnodar and Kuban (in Ukraine), and Bishop Benjamin (Tupeko) was elected and assigned to replace him as the Metropolitan of Minsk and Zaslavsk.

In addition to his already frail condition, on 16 December, 2020, Metropolitan Philaret was taken to a hospital in Minsk for treatment after he was diagnosed as suffering from the covid-19 virus.

Repose, 2021

On 12 January, 2021, Metropolitan Philaret (Vakhromeyev) fell asleep in the Lord in Minsk. This was on the last day of the Post-feast of the Nativity of Christ.

On 13 January, 2021, Metropolitan Benjamin (Tupeko) of Minsk, Patriarchal Exarch of All Belarus, assisted by many bishops and clergy, offered a Panikhida for Metropolitan Philaret in the Holy Spirit Cathedral in Minsk.

On 14 January, 2021 (the Feast-day of the Circumcision of the Lord and the Feast of Saint Basil the Great), Metropolitan Benjamin (Tupeko) led the Hierarchical Memorial Divine Liturgy and funeral for Metropolitan Philaret, the Patriarchal Exarch Emeritus, in the Holy Spirit Cathedral in Minsk. He was assisted by 13 hierarchs, including Metropolitan Avgustin (Markevich) of Belotserkov, Ukraine, and many clergy.

Bishops serving at the funeral



After the Memorial Divine Liturgy, Metropolitan Benjamin (Tupeko) led the Funeral Service for the Burial of a Hierarch for Metropolitan Philaret (Vakhromeyev) in the Holy Spirit Cathedral in Minsk. He was assisted by the same bishops and clergy.

Before the funeral service, Metropolitan Benjamin read aloud the condolences of Patriarch Kirill, and of President Alexander Lukashenko.

During the funeral service, the eulogy of the Belarusian Holy Synod was read out, which included the following :

Our dear Abba, we are all your children in Christ. Imitating the feat of the righteous Philaret the Merciful, whose name was given to you in monastic vows, you have given us a vivid example of complete dedication to God. 'Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Your Name give glory' (Psalm 113:9) — you pronounced these words of the Psalmist as your motto. Indeed, you had no private life. All that you did was to serve the one King of kings and the Lord of lords (1 Timothy 6:15), inseparable from serving God’s beloved creation, mankind.

After the conclusion, Metropolitan Benjamin read the prayer of absolution, and the funeral service ended with the singing of “Memory Eternal”.

Afterwards, Metropolitan Avgustin (Markevich) of Bila Tserkva read aloud the condolences of Metropolitan Onufry (Berezovskiy) of Kiev and All Ukraine. Then, following the custom, his coffin was carried around Holy Spirit Cathedral. In accordance with the will of Metropolitan Philaret, during the procession the first Irmos of the Canon of Repentance of Saint Andrew of Crete was sung : “A helper and a protector, He has become my salvation. This is my God, I will glorify Him, my father’s God will I exalt, for gloriously has He been glorified”. Afterwards, his body was placed in the midst of the cathedral so that the Faithful could bid him farewell.



Procession around the Temple



After all the services were completed, the body of Metropolitan Philaret (Vakhromeyev) was interred behind the Altar of the Holy Cross Temple at the Zhirovichi Holy Dormition Monastery, the monastery which had been renewed thanks to the efforts of Metropolitan Philaret during the difficult times of soviet rule.

A theological seminary and academy also were later opened in Zhirovichi, and the monastery eventually became a spiritual centre for the whole of Belarus.

In a letter of condolence to the Church of Belarus, Patriarch Kirill (Gundyaev) of Moscow and All Russia noted that a thorough revival of Church life in Belarus took place precisely while Metropolitan Philaret was the Primate of the Belarusian Orthodox Church.

With deep sorrow I received the news of the death of one of the outstanding hierarchs, the honourary Patriarchal Exarch of All Belarus, Metropolitan Philaret (Vakhromeev). This is truly a great loss not only for the believers of Belarus, but for our entire Church.

Patriarch Kirill emphasised that the years of archpastoral mission of Vladyka Philaret on the Belarusian land

are marked by a comprehensive revival of Church life, the restoration and construction of new churches and monasteries, and the development of spiritual education and educational activities. While following the word of Scripture, in an effort to supervise the flock, not by compulsion, but willingly and piously, and by not dominating the inheritance of God, but by setting an example (1 Peter 5:2-3), the newly-departed hierarch testified to people with apostolic zeal about the beauty and truth of Orthodoxy, and contributed to the creation of peace and civil harmony on the Belarusian land.

In addition, the Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church noted

the significant contribution of the late Metropolitan Philaret to strengthening fraternal ties between Local Orthodox Churches, and the development of interfaith dialogue.

The Patriarch pointed out in particular that, while serving in Europe, as chairman of the Department for External Church Relations, Vladyka Philaret

diligently performed the service assigned to him and acquired sincere love and respect from many people outside his country.

At the time of the funeral, during the procession around the Temple, a large flock of white birds was seen flying in circles above the Temple of the monastery, an unusual event which caught the attention of those present.



Metropolitan Philaret receives the Holy Mysteries at the Divine Liturgy



Vladimir Prokoptsov, General Director of the National Art Museum of the Republic of Belarus, and ""Honoured Artist of the Republic of Belarus"" wrote the following reflection about Metropolitan Philaret, and the effects of his arrival in Belarus in 1989 :

The revival of historic dioceses began due to the influence of Metropolitan Philaret in Belarus. It happened in Polotsk, Pinsk and Mogilev in October of 1989 ; in Gomel and Brest in January of 1990 ; in Novogrudok and Grodno in October of 1991 ; in Turov and Vitebsk in May of 1992. The Belarusian Exarchate was established in 1989. It brought all the eparchies together into a united administrative structure of the Church. That year, the Women's Monastery of Saint Euphrosyne in Polotsk and the Women's Monastery of the Nativity of the Theotokos in Grodno were given back to the Church. The Minsk Theological Seminary in Zhirovichi resumed classes on 1 September, 1989. The most important sign of the blossoming Church is the number of active Orthodox Temples and monasteries in Belarus. Today, the Belarusian Exarchate numbers 1,582 places of worship, in which 1,655 priests provide pastoral services. There are 32 monasteries, 54 sketes, 113 women's monasteries, 7 religious educational institutions in the Belarusian Orthodox Church. The monasteries provide educational, charitable and missionary activities. A significant event in Belarus was the restration of the ancient relics, some spiritual symbols of White Russia, such as the Cross of Saint Euphrosyne, the Abbess of Polotsk, and her silver shrine. The image of the Cross, renewed by modern master Nikolai Kuzmich, was triumphantly brought to the Cathedral of the Saviour and Saint Euphrosyne in Polotsk in 1997. The sanctification of the restored shrine, where her incorrupt relics repose, took place on the Saint’s Memorial Day in 2007. Some of the recent glorifications of saints became a welcome development in the lives of believers in Belarus. They represent the vitality of the Church and an understanding of its historical past. On 13 June, 2003, the 'Basic Agreement on Co-operation between the Republic of Belarus and the Belarusian Orthodox Church' was signed. It laid the foundation for further co-operation between the Church and the state. Programmes of co-operation of the Belarusian Orthodox Church with several government ministries were being realised : the Ministry of Cultural Affairs ; the Education Ministry ; the Ministry of Information ; the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection ; the Ministry of Internal Affairs ; the Ministry of Defence ; the Emergency Situations Ministry ; the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection ; the Ministry of Sports and Tourism ; the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus ; the Belarusian State University ; the State Committee of Border-Security Forces ; the Committee on Problems of the Accident at Chernobyl NPP under the Council of Ministers ; the Committee on Aviation ; the National State TV and Radio Company ; 6 regional executive committees ; the Minsk City Executive Committee. The areas of co-operation between the state and the Church are in the spiritual, moral, patriotic raising and education of children and youth, in peace-making, in works of mercy and charity, in concern for strengthening moral and physical health, in support for the institution of the family, motherhood and childhood, in the protection, restoration and enhancement of our historical and cultural heritage, in environmental conservation, in care of the military and the people who are in places of deprivation of liberty.

The Web-site ""Orthodox Christianity"" published some spiritual instructions of Metropolitan Philaret on 29 January, 2021, which are reproduced here :

The main goal of man’s striving to find the meaning of his existence is to search for the truth of God, which gives meaning to life for individuals and for mankind as a whole and the entire universe. Our concern is not to prove the modernity of Orthodoxy, but that our life would always be correct, that is, Orthodox in the eyes of God. The Church of Christ’s responsibility for creation is above all the inculcation of the responsibility of every man for the contents of his own heart, for thoughts that work both for his destruction and his salvation proceed from it into the world. The Lord raises you, and Holy Communion nurses you ; that is, it accompanies the Divine Mystery, facilitates its acceptance by man, fills up earthly values with the Heavenly gift, and teaches it in perfect completeness. When we, Christians, are able to say ‘yes’ and ‘no’ with evangelical firmness, we will triumph ; but if we tend to say ‘yes, but [...]’ or ‘no, but [...]’ more often, then we will inevitably suffer defeat. How should we live ? We should live with a sense of responsibility before God for every one of our own actions — above all our own ! For every one of our own words — above all our own ! God’s love for man is not limited by human divisions, of whatever nature they may be. And therefore, man’s love for God is measured by his ability to show mercy, in the broadest sense of the word. A man’s trust in God is a conscious necessity, within the framework of which he limits his personal freedom and trusts all the circumstances of his life to Divine governance ; for none save the Lord can save man from non-existence unto eternal life. Friendship is more than one form of affection, more than one type of love. Friendship is a state that was natural for first-created man in his relation to everyone and everything before the Fall. Man is a rational, free, personal being, capable of infinite perfection. The goal of this perfection is not to acquire superpowers, but to achieve the inner integrity of the spirit, soul, and body, or chastity. The conscience is immortal, like the soul. It can flare up within the heart of even the most impenitent sinner in the blink of an eye, and in a matter of seconds can lead it to a degree of repentance that is given to another righteous man for a lifetime of labour. Man is greater than the world — if by ‘world’ we understand everything that is external to man. The human never dies within a man, for the image of God within him is indestructible. History is made by man, not impersonal laws. It is vital for us to be able to pray to God and to be silent before God, to hear His word, which He may speak softly so we would take pains to hear it. The purpose of our life and our Faith is that they would be filled with the Holy Spirit.
