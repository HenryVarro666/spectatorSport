Fake videos are now starting to surface to confuse the public regarding what is really happening in Ukraine.

These fake videos include clips from other incidents not related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A clip from a video game has even used in the misinformation circulating online.

Fake Videos Start to Spread on Social Media

According to the story by Gizmodo, it is important not to believe everything posted on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok regarding what is going on in Ukraine.

Photos and videos are starting to surface regarding Russian troops destroying Kyiv, the airports of Ukraine under fire, and even Kyiv being hit by Russian missiles.

While many of those being posted are true and accurate, many are also false and have been used to spread misinformation. The public is being cautioned about believing everything online right away so as not to fall victim to fake news.

Videos of Ukraine Being Invaded

Videos of Ukraine being invaded by Russia have been circulating online. Social media apps such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have become platforms through which such videos have been posted and widely circulated.

Here are some examples of videos that have been published on Twitter:

Fake Footage from Video Game 'War Thunder' Being Used

Aside from real videos showing what is taking place in Ukraine, fake videos are also starting to spread and creating confusion. These videos reportedly range from clips from other historical events and even coming from a video game called ""War Thunder.""

As uploaded on Twitter, footage coming from the video game known as ""War Thunder"" is being uploaded to erroneously show ""Ukraine launching anti aircraft missiles into the night.""

The game ""War Thunder"" was initially released back in 2017 and 2018.

Fake Videos Start to Spread on Social Media

The tweets, however, have been deleted and what remains is now a comment on the clip on YouTube saying ""they are using this as Russian footage."" This, however, is not the only misused video regarding the Russian invasion.

Another video from a 2015 fire in Tianjin China has been used with the caption ""fires started by Russian airstrike set off chain reaction at Luhansk power plant Ukrainian.""

In addition, another alarming video that has started going viral is the 2020 Beirut explosion, which resulted in 218 people being killed and has nothing to do with Russia or Ukraine.

It has since been deleted from Twitter.

In his speech, Zelensky stated that he wanted to have a phone call with Putin, but it ended as a fruitless attempt, and said that Russia was stationed on the Ukrainian border with 200 soldiers. Stating that Ukraine and Russia have a border of 200 km, Zelensky said that the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government want peace and are striving in this direction. Zelensky, on the other hand, said that Russia had ordered troops in the region to advance towards Ukraine. Just at this time, Russia closed its airspace on the border line with Ukraine for air traffic control security reasons.

On February 24, in the morning hours, Russia started targeting the Ukrainian Armed Forces with its high firepower. The Russian Army carries out missile attacks on Ukraine's military facilities. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced that the air defense systems, military airports and air force in Ukraine were neutralized with “high-precision weapons”.

Finally, it was reported that the P-14 (Nato code name: Tall King A) long-range early warning radar of the Ukrainian army stationed in the city of Mariupol, south of Donetsk, was destroyed by the Russian Air Force in the morning with an air operation. SEAD / DEAD missions for Ukrainian air defense systems are carried out by the Russian Air Force. It is stated that the radar systems in question were hit with anti-radiation missiles.

Developed during the Soviet Union, the P-14 (Nato codename: Tall King A) was introduced in 1959. The radar, which is actively used by the Ukrainian army today, has a range of 400 km.

A US defense official said today that the Russian military launched more than 160 missiles on the first day of a special military operation in Ukraine. “Mostly short-range ballistic missiles, but also medium-range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles,” the official said.

Military experts believe that Moscow has used an unprecedented number of guided missiles of various types to pave the way for other forces to enter Ukrainian territory.

3M14 Caliber

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that the Russian military launched about 30 rounds of 3M14, a ground-attack variant of the Kalibr cruise missile, in the opening strike of the operation. This is a weapon that has been widely used by the Russian navy in the military intervention campaign in Syria and is considered one of the most modern and important weapons in the Russian military payroll.

The 3M14 version is equipped with GLONASS satellite navigation and inertial navigation, and the ARGS-14E radar detector has a range of 20 km to capture targets with high radar reflectivity.

The missile uses an altimeter and topographic matching system, allowing it to fly close to the ground to reduce the possibility of detection, giving the enemy less time to react. Russia’s domestic 3M14 model has a range of 2,500 km and carries a warhead weighing more than 400 kg, capable of hitting any target in Ukraine if launched from the Black Sea.

This type of missile can be deployed from a vertical launch tube on a surface ship or fired through a submarine’s torpedo tube. The Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Navy based in Crimea possesses many ships that can deploy 3M14 missiles, including three Project 11356M frigates, four Project 21630 missile ships, three or four Project patrol boats 22160 can carry the Kalibr container launcher, and 6 Project 636.3 submarines, also known as the improved Kilo class.

Air-launched cruise missile

Military experts can’t be sure about the ability of the Russian plane to launch cruise missiles towards Ukraine, but a US defense official emphasized that the Russian attack that opened the campaign involved 75 bombers. heavy and powerful.

Of these, the strategic bomber duo Tu-95MS and Tu-160 can launch a variety of land attack cruise missiles with a large range.

The main weapon of these two aircraft is the stealthy Kh-101 cruise missile equipped with an inertial navigation system combined with an optical-electronic detector, as well as updated position and flight path via satellite. . The bomber crew can change the target and trajectory of the projectile after launch. The missile has a range of up to 5,000 km, capable of hitting targets within a 5 m circle.

The missile is equipped with a turbojet engine, which allows them to cruise at a speed of 700 km / h, then rush to the target at a maximum speed of 970 km / h. The radar reflection area is only 0.01 m2 and the cruising altitude is only 30-70 m, making Kh-101/102 very difficult to be detected by ground warning systems.

Each Kh-101 is equipped with a 400 kg warhead, including high explosive (HE), penetrating or beam explosive types, while the Kh-102 uses a nuclear warhead with a yield equivalent to 250,000 tons of medicine. TNT explosion.

In addition, the Kh-55 missile is capable of tracking terrain at extremely low altitudes and maneuvering continuously to avoid detection. The missile is capable of hitting targets from a distance of 2,500 km, carrying two additional oil tanks along the body to increase the range to nearly 3,000 km. Some Kh-55 missiles have been upgraded by Russia to Kh-555, equipped with many technologies that increase the ability to penetrate anti-aircraft defenses and have 5 times higher accuracy than the original model.

Iskander-US ballistic missile

Unverified videos show volleys of Russian ballistic missiles launched towards Ukraine. The Pentagon estimates about 100 rounds were fired in the early hours of the conflict.

Iskander is a solid propellant single-stage rocket equipped with a satellite navigation system, with a length of 7.2 m, a diameter of 0.95 m, a launch mass of 3.8 tons, a maximum range of 500 km, can carry both conventional warheads as well as nuclear warheads.

The highlight of the Iskander is its ability to penetrate any missile defense system in the world. Each projectile has a maximum speed of 9,350 km / h with the feature of constantly changing flight paths and launching traps, to neutralize the enemy’s interception efforts.

The Iskander rocket launcher was handed over to the Russian army in 2016. Photo: KBM.

The Iskander-M version is also equipped with an optical-electronic detector and data link with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or airborne early warning and control aircraft, allowing the missile to hit the target. mobile with an error of only two meters.

Ukraine’s intelligence last month said that Russia has deployed at least 36 Iskander missile launchers near the border, enough to threaten the capital Kiev and many targets within the country.

Iskander-K ground-launched cruise missile

The Iskander-K cruise missile complex shares a ammunition carrier cum launcher and support vehicle with the Iskander-M system.

The main weapon of this system is the 9M728 ammunition with a range of 500 km. Improved version 9M729 has high accuracy and larger warhead, alleged by the US to have a range of more than 5,000 km, while Russia claims it can only hit targets at a distance of 480 km.

Kh-31P . anti-radar missile

Photos taken in the capital Kiev on February 24 show the remains of a supersonic missile launched from a Kh-31 aircraft, which appears to be an anti-radar version of Kh-31P.

The Kh-31 missile was developed by the Soviet Union in the late 1970s with the goal of creating an anti-radar weapon that could deal with the advanced US weapons at that time such as the Patriot air defense complex and the Aegis shield.

The first Kh-31 prototype was test-launched in 1982 and entered service six years later. The first completed version carried a passive radar-killing detector with the designation Kh-31P, followed by an anti-ship variant with an active radar detector called Kh-31A. Both versions were made public in 1991, shortly before the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Ukrainian police examine the wreckage of a Kh-31 missile on a street in Kiev on February 24. Photo: Reuters.

All Kh-31 variants use a primary propulsion stage to achieve supersonic speed, then activate a ramjet engine to maintain supersonic speed throughout the journey.

The Kh-31P flies at high altitudes to track enemy radar signals, allowing it to reach a speed of more than 4,300 km/h and a range of 110 km, while the Kh-31A flies close to the sea surface and has a top speed of 3,300. km/h and a range of 100 km. Modernized versions can hit the target from a distance of 160-250 km.

The Kh-31 series is considered one of the most dangerous tactical weapons for Patriot batteries and American warships, forcing Washington to find a countermeasure. This type of missile can be deployed from Su-24 attack aircraft, Su-30SM and Su-35S heavy fighters, as well as Su-34 bombers.

5,c6d1ae7e-7fb6-4218-80d5-9cb6b8917065,[],2022-02-24 00:00:00,"In the early hours of 24 February 2022, Russia commenced a series of pre-assault operations to soften Ukrainian defenses ahead of an all-out, multi-axis invasion, which is now in progress.

This course of events was extensively threatcasted by the OSINT community weeks in advance, including us. Those familiar with our estimates from January 2022, see here, would have expected a Russian invasion and the subsequent operational and tactical developments.

DAWNBREAKER: PRE-ASSAULT OPERATIONS

Cyber attacks & Electronic Warfare (EW):

1. The opening salvos of Russia’s invasion were cybernetic and electronic and were initiated on 23 February 2022. Russia launched Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attacks on the Ukrainian government, jammed military communications, and psychological operations against Ukrainian troops.

⚠️ Confirmed: #Ukraine‘s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Security Service of Ukraine and Cabinet of Ministers websites have just been impacted by network disruptions; the incident appears consistent with recent DDOS attacks 📉 pic.twitter.com/EVyy7mzZRr — NetBlocks (@netblocks) February 23, 2022

2. One notable EW attack was conducted by a Leer-3 which spammed Ukrainian troops with SMS calling them to surrender or be killed.

Suppression/Destruction of Enemy Air Defences (S/DEAD)

3. In the dead of night, Russia launched land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs) and anti-radiation missiles (ARMs) at Ukrainian integrated air and missile defenses. They likely disabled several early warning, tracking, and engagement radars, rendering Ukraine’s sensors and SAM systems ineffective (S-300, Buk M-1). However, some might still be functional or serviceable.

Offensive Counter Air (OCA)

4. Russia launched massive strikes against airbases to ground the Ukrainian Air Force (UkAF). Damaged runways prevent Ukrainian aircraft from taking off and landing. Follow-up salvos disabled the grounded aircraft and cleared facilities for occupation by airborne troops.

5. Visual evidence suggests that Russia fired ballistic missiles, likely Iskanders (SS-26 Stone), at airbases to cause structural damage – a textbook use of BMs for anti-runway operations.

6. Latest satellite imagery of Chuhuiv Air Base near Harkhiv shows that Russia did not crater the runways of all airports, instead it destroyed fuel depots and munition storage.

7. One Ukrainian Su-27 flew into Romanian airspace where it was intercepted by Romanian F-16s and forced to ground at Bacau Air Base. As per Romanian government accounts, the pilot’s homebase was destroyed and had nowhere else to land.

Counter-C3

8. Russian LACMs also leveled command, control, and communication nodes (C3). These attacks aimed to separate the higher echelons from battlefield units, behead the leadership, and throw the military in disarray. This was another textbook pre-invasion tactic.

Counter-Logistics

9. Many videos emerged online showing LACMs pounding ammunition depots and warehouses, resulting in massive secondary explosions. Attacks to bleed Ukraine’s logistical supply lines have occurred nationwide, including Lviv (near Poland), Ivano-Frankivsk (close to Romania), Melitopol, and Odesa.

10. Our previous T-Intelligence analysis anticipated this tactic to diminish Ukraine’s growing ATGM stockpile.

MIDDAY RUMBLE

11. Shortly after the crack of dawn, the Russia commenced a multi-axis ground offensive, moving tanks and armored vehicles along select axis of attack.

Air superiority

12. As OCA was largely successful and grounded most of the UkAF’s extensive fighter fleet, the Russian Aerospace Forces (RuAF) could establish air superiority. Otherwise, we would not have seen a major helicopter assault on Kiyv and nearby airports. However, a video emerged showing a UkAF MiG-29 buzzing the skies of Kiyv and allegedly dogfighting an alleged Russian Su-35, which means that not all fighters are grounded or destroyed (update: a re-examination of the video concludes that both aircraft are Ukrainian).

Manoeuvre

13. Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) have advanced from nearly all operational directions:

Belarus (to Kiyv, the Pripyat area, Chernihiv)

14. Russian forces in Belarus crossed the border towards Chernihiv, seized the Chernobyl exclusion zone following a heavy armored battle with Ukrainian forces, and deployed a massive airborne assault on Kiyv.

Voronezh (to Kharkiv and Sumy)

15. Under the cover of rocket artillery, tank columns crossed into Ukraine and rapidly approached the country’s second-largest city, Kharkiv. The battle for Kharkiv is still raging on, with Russia facing losses. Intrusions have reportedly also occurred further north on the frontier near Sumy.

Don (further into Donbas)

16. Recently reinforced by Russian troops, Luhansk and Donetsk separatists have launched a tandem assault across the demilitarized zone. Operational objectives are to capture Kramatorsk and Severodonetsk, and secure the rest of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Splinter groups will likely then follow up to hit Ukrainian positions in Kharkiv from the rear, and separately, besiege Mariupol.

Crimea (to Kherson & Melitopol)

17. Russia made significant territorial gains north of Crimea, towards Kherson city and most adjacent areas. A separate line of the assault went eastwards and arrived at Melitopol. Beyond Melitopol, Russian forces aim to encircle Mariupol with Donbas formations.

*Black Sea Fleet

18. An amphibious assault on Odesa is still expected but would likely come later to complete the pincer movement with troops advancing from Kherson.

Close Air Support (CAS)

19. Ka-52 attack helicopters, Su-25 attack aircraft, and a myriad of ground-based artillery provide overwhelming fires to the advancing columns. Russia’s successful OCA and subsequent air superiority enabled aerial CAS platforms. Without a permissive aerial environment, Su-25s and attack helicopters would have been easy targets for Ukrainian fighter jets.

Airborne assault

20. Russian Airborne Forces aboard Mii-8 helicopters and escorted by attack helicopters have assaulted key areas around Kiyv. Russian paratroopers achieved a breakthrough at Hostomel airfield/Antonov International Airport, but lost three helicopters to ground to air fire in the process. Russia’s airborne assault seemed rushed, albeit speed is key to maintaining the initiative, and faced heavy resistance.

Securing these facilities is key to airlift tanks, personnel, and the necessary equipment to besiege Kiyv.

NIGHTFALL: OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS CONTINUE

Tactical defeat

21. Russian airborne units have lost Hostomel airfield after a strong counterattack from the Ukrainian military. If sustainable, the loss of Hostomel is a significant blow to Russia’s plans to quickly amass and encircle Kiyv before Ukrainian forces establish better defenses.

EPILOGUE

For reasons of operation security, we will not comment on Ukraine’s military movements. We urge OSINT analysts not to share videos or images of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
