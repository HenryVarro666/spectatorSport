Here are the latest developments on the war in Ukraine:

Changing hands: Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Army Gen. Alexander Dvornikov as theater commander of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, according to a US official and a European official. Dvornikov, the first commander of Russia’s military operations in Syria, could bring a new level of coordination to an assault now expected to focus on the Donbas region, instead of multiple fronts.

Zelensky’s diplomacy: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the United Kingdom for its decision to send more lethal aid to Ukraine after a meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Kyiv on Saturday. Zelensky also met with Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer the capital that day, following his talks with European Union leaders on Friday.

Civilian toll: The scale of Russia’s grisly assault on Ukrainian civilians in the north is becoming clearer in the wake of the forces’ withdrawal from the region. A UK Military Intelligence update on Saturday said evidence, including mass graves, indicate non-combatants were “disproportionately targeted.” Ukrainian officials have found hundreds of civilian bodies in towns near Kyiv, including Bucha and Makariv.

Bracing for onslaught: Ukrainian officials continue to warn about what could be a major Russian offensive set to take place in the country's east, where intense fighting is already underway. Ukraine’s Chief of Defense Intelligence said Russian troops are regrouping across the border and plan to advance toward the eastern city of Kharkiv in what could be a major offensive.

Getting out: Ten evacuation corridors in the country’s east and south, including one for private vehicles from bombarded Mariupol, have been agreed, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said Saturday. The Ukrainian military also said it was working to ""adjust"" routes for civilians following a Russian missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk that Ukrainian officials say killed more than 50 people Friday.",https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-04-10-22/h_892b884ecacd2ed726131bca647d5627

As the war in Ukraine drags on, the World Bank said Ukraine's economy will contract 45 per cent this year while warning of a bleak economic situation for the country.

Economic activity in the country has shrunk drastically in the country after President Putin declared ""special military operation"" on February 24 against Ukraine.

Ukraine's cities have experienced constant bombardment even as its forces have resisted the Russian invasion.

Reports claim there has been shelling in northeast Kharkiv as Ukrainian authorities declared that they had found over 1,200 bodies in the Kyiv region as President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned atrocities against civilians.

Russian missiles hit Dnipro's local airport as President Zelensky warned that Russia was set to launch ""even larger operations"" in eastern Ukraine.

""We are preparing for their actions. We will respond,"" the Ukraine president said.

Last week Kramatorsk city's railway station located in the eastern part of the country was hit by Russian missiles in which at least 57 people were killed including children. However, Russia's defence ministry denied it carried out the attack.

Lugansk governor Sergiy Gaiday informed that residents were fleeing the area amid reports of a Russian assault in the area.

Maxar reported that the convoy consists of ""armored vehicles, trucks with towed artillery and support equipment.""

Earlier, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that Russia was concentrating forces in eastern Ukraine, attempting to capture Kharkiv, Mariupol and Odesa.

Additionally, two battalion tactical groups of the enemy have been redeployed from the Belgorod region to the area of Shevchenkove in the Kharkiv region.

The press service of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.

""The Russian Federation continues its full-scale armed aggression against our state. The enemy continues to make preparations to intensify offensive operations in eastern Ukraine in order to establish full control over the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The occupiers are concentrating their main efforts on the seizure of Mariupol and the offensive near the town of Izium. There is still a high probability that the enemy will involve sabotage and reconnaissance groups to carry out acts of sabotage at transport infrastructure facilities,"" the statement said.

According to the statement, the enemy continues to launch missile strikes on civilian targets across Ukraine.

Ukrinform reported earlier that Russia lost about 19,100 soldiers in Ukraine from February 24 to April 9.
