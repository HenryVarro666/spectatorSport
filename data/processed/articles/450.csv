CNN reported that, according to videos of residents, several explosions were recorded in the area northwest of Kiev, where there is a military base.

After CNN reported on the explosions, Ukraine’s State Special Communications Service said clashes were also taking place in an eastern suburb of the capital Kiev.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the night of February 25 warned of the “most difficult night” for the people of this country when Russian troops flooded the capital.

“Tonight will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the Ukrainian resistance,” Zelensky said, calling on the Ukrainian people “to hold their ground.” “Ukraine’s fate is being decided right now”.

Earlier, Sky News quoted Israeli correspondent Barak Ravid as saying that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told EU leaders during an online meeting on February 24 that “this may be the last time they see him alive.” A European diplomat also briefly confirmed the conversation to Walla news site.

The diplomat said Mr Zelensky urged EU leaders to take further steps against Russia and the meeting ended with a decision to impose additional sanctions against Moscow.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who was on the call this morning, told the Italian parliament that Mr. Zelensky is currently hiding in Kyiv. “We were going to talk on the phone this morning, but he didn’t pick up,” Draghi said.

Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson, who was also on the call on Saturday evening, confirmed Walla’s report, telling the Swedish News Agency that “this may be the last time we see Zelensky”.

KYIV, Ukraine — As sirens blared in the streets of Kyiv, signaling that residents should head to underground bunkers, Washington Post journalists headed to their hotel’s basement where staff and their families were also sheltering. There, hotel workers served up heaping plates of spaghetti bolognese and Greek salad — a welcome surprise considering the restaurant is closed and supplies are dwindling.

With a shortage of plates, some guests shared, and others took turns waiting for plates or silverware to be washed. One man handed out pieces of carpet for guests to put over the cold tile floor. The elderly and children have been given priority for seating. Afterward, a jovial hotel staffer walked around mopping up spilled sauce and lettuce.

The shared sense of camaraderie in the basement bunker was a glimmer of light in an otherwise dark time.
