“They have started sorting through the ruins in Borodianka. It’s much more horrific there, there are even more victims of Russian occupiers,” Zelensky said in his nightly address to the nation, April 7, 2022.

The destruction left by Russian troops in the town of Borodianka outside of Kyiv is “much more horrific” than the situation uncovered in the nearby town of Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday. Earlier Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had sustained “significant losses” in Ukraine since its troops entered on February 24.

4:32 am: Pentagon says Putin has given up on taking Kyiv but ‘significant battle’ still ahead for southeastern Ukraine

US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has given up on conquering Kyiv after his forces were soundly beaten back by the Ukrainian military.

“Putin thought that he could very rapidly take over the country of Ukraine, very rapidly capture this capital city. He was wrong,” Austin told a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee in Congress.

“I think Putin has given up on his efforts to capture the capital city and is now focused on the south and east of the country,” said Austin.

But the path of the overall war, six weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, remains uncertain, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, told the same hearing.

For Ukraine to “win” the fight, it needs to remain a free and independent nation, with its recognised territory intact, he said.

“That’s going to be very difficult. That’s going to be a long slog,” Milley said.

“The first part of it has probably been successfully waged,” he said of the war that began on February 24.

“But there is a significant battle yet ahead down in the southeast, down around the Donbas region where the Russians intend to mass forces and continue their assault,” he said.

“So I think it’s an open question right now, how this ends.”

2:12 am: Lviv sees new refugee influx as Ukraine warns civilians to flee Donbas

Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk urged civilians in eastern Ukraine to evacuate to safer regions before it was too late, after Moscow announced plans to concentrate its forces in the east.

As a result, aid organisations in the western city of Lviv are welcoming a new wave of refugees. FRANCE 24 Chief International Affairs Editor Robert Parsons reports on the ground:

1:58 am: EU approves Russia coal embargo, proposes more arms to Ukraine

The European Union on Thursday said it had approved an embargo on Russian coal and the closing of the bloc’s ports to Russian vessels over the Ukraine war.

An official from the French presidency of the European Council said the moves spearhead a “very substantial” fifth round of sanctions against Moscow.

That package also includes a 10 billion euro ($10.9 billion) ban on exports to Russia, including high-tech goods, and the freezing of several Russian banks’ assets.

In addition to the sanctions, the EU also backed a proposal to boost its funding of arms supplies to Ukraine by 500 million euros, taking it to a total of 1.5 billion euros.

European Council President Charles Michel said on Twitter the package would be “swiftly approved”.

Thanks and support to @JosepBorrellF for your proposal to top up the #EuropeanPeaceFacility with a further €500M. Once swiftly approved this will bring to 1.5 billion the EU support already provided for military equipment for #Ukraine. @ZelenskyyUa — Charles Michel (@eucopresident) April 7, 2022

The new financial measures were proposed by the European Commission after the bodies of dozens of civilians were found last weekend in Bucha, near Kyiv.

It is the first time the Europeans have targeted the Russian energy sector, on which they are heavily dependent.

The EU nations import 45 percent of their coal from Russia, worth 4 billion euros a year.

The embargo will come into force at the beginning of August, 120 days after the publication of the new package in the EU’s official journal, expected on Friday.

1:28 am: WHO confirms over 100 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said it had confirmed over 100 attacks on health services in Ukraine, as it called for humanitarian access to the besieged city of Mariupol.

“As of now, WHO has verified 103 incidents of attacks on health care, with 73 people killed and 51 injured, including health workers and patients,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference, calling it a “grim milestone.”

Of the confirmed attacks, 89 had impacted health facilities and most of the rest hit transport services, including ambulances.

“We are outraged that attacks on health care are continuing,” the WHO chief said, adding they constituted “a violation of international humanitarian law.”

Speaking at an earlier press conference in Lviv, WHO regional director for Europe Hans Kluge lamented that while health assistance had reached many “affected areas”, some were still out of reach.

“It’s true some remain very difficult. I think a priority definitely, I think we all agree, would be Mariupol,” Kluge told reporters.

12:38 am: Support for Ukraine wanes in General Assembly as UN votes to suspends Russia from Human Rights Council

The vote was 93-24 with 58 abstentions, significantly lower than the vote on two resolutions the assembly adopted last month demanding an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine, withdrawal of all Russian troops and protection for civilians. Still the vote was “humiliating” for Moscow, FRANCE 24’s Jessica Le Masurier reports from New York:

April 8, 12:10 am: Canada to offer up to C$1 bn in new financing to Ukraine

Canada will offer Ukraine up to C$1 billion ($794 million) in new loan resources via the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and provide an additional C$500 million in military aid, the Liberal government said on Thursday.

The announcements in the federal budget mean Canada has now committed more than C$1.2 billion in direct contributions to Ukraine, as well as offering up to C$1.6 billion in loan supports.

“This support has helped respond to the humanitarian crisis, and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to provide essential services,” the budget said.

Canada will offer up to C$1 billion in new loan resources to Kyiv through a new Administered Account for Ukraine at the IMF.

Since 2015, Canadian troops have been training Ukrainian forces in the west of the country. In January, Ottawa said the mission would be expanded.

Canada, which has announced more than C$90 million in lethal and non-lethal weaponry to Ukraine so far, said on Thursday it proposed to provide an additional $500 million in the 2022-23 fiscal year to provide further military aid.

11:25 pm: Biden calls signs of Ukraine atrocities an ‘outrage’ to humanity

US President Joe Biden on Thursday called the images emerging as Russian troops withdraw from parts of Ukraine an “outrage” to humanity, as he hailed Moscow’s expulsion from the UN Human Rights Council.

“Russia’s lies are no match for the undeniable evidence of what is happening in Ukraine,” Biden said in a statement.

“The signs of people being raped, tortured, executed – in some cases having their bodies desecrated – are an outrage to our common humanity.”

10:40 pm: Scene in Borodianka near Kyiv 'much more horrific' than Bucha, Zelensky says

The destruction left by Russian troops in the town of Borodianka outside of Kyiv is ""much more horrific"" than the situation uncovered in the nearby town of Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday.

""They have started sorting through the ruins in Borodianka,"" Zelensky said in his daily address to the nation. ""It's much more horrific there, there are even more victims of Russian occupiers.""

10:20 pm: Russian Nobel-winning editor attacked on train

Russian journalist and Nobel Peace prize laureate Dmitry Muratov was Thursday assaulted on a train by a person who sprayed him with paint, his newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported.

“An unknown assailant attacked the chief editor of Novaya Gazeta and Nobel prize winner in a train coach,” the independent publication said via Telegram.

“He threw oil-based paint mixed with acetone into the compartment. He shouted, ‘Muratov, that’s for our boys’,” the paper quoted Muratov as saying, in apparent allusion to Russian casualties in the Ukraine war.

“My eyes are burning terribly. I am going to try to wash it off,” Muratov was quoted as saying after the attack on a train headed from Moscow to the southeastern city of Samara.

Aboard a train to Samara, somebody attacked Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Novaya Gazeta editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov with red paint laced with the solvent acetone. “This is for our boys!” the assailant shouted. Muratov’s eyes now burn, he wrote in a statement. pic.twitter.com/ny0Fjefo42 — Kevin Rothrock (@KevinRothrock) April 7, 2022

Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova on Thursday said 26 bodies had been found under two ruined buildings in the Kyiv region town of Borodianka, which is been being searched by the authorities after Russian troops occupying it withdrew.

In a televised briefing, Venediktova did not say if the authorities had established the cause of death, but she accused Russian troops of carrying out air strikes on the town before they seized control of it.

""Borodianka is the worst in terms of destruction and in terms of the uncertainty about (the number of) victims,"" she said.

7:59 pm: Revoke Russian investor passports, Zelensky urges Cyprus

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday urged Cyprus to revoke passports issued to Russians through an investment scheme and stop private yachts docking in its marinas. Zelensky made the plea during an address to the Cypriot parliament via live video link, the latest in a series of such speeches he has made to foreign legislatures after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""I'm grateful to you for your moral stance. You reacted to the Russian invasion and banned the docking of Russian ships in your ports,"" Zelensky said. He added that Cyprus has ""tools to pressure"" its traditionally close friend Russia, and urged Cypriot authorities to ""close the ports"" to all Russian private yachts.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that Russia had sustained ""significant losses"" in Ukraine, which its troops entered on February 24 in what it calls a ""special military operation"".

Russia's defence ministry said on March 25, its most recent update, that 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed since the start of the campaign, and 3,825 had been wounded.

7:06 pm: Russia says it would have to 'rebalance' if Finland and Sweden join NATO

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that if Finland and Sweden joined NATO then Russia would have to ""rebalance the situation"" with its own measures.

Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which it says aims among other things to degrade Ukraine's military potential and prevent it becoming a bridgehead for a NATO attack, has prompted the two Nordic countries to consider joining the US-led alliance.

If the two countries join, ""we'll have to make our western flank more sophisticated in terms of ensuring our security"", Peskov told Britain's Sky News.

7:02 pm: 'We must assume' Russians committing more atrocities in Ukraine, Blinken says

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday it is likely that Russian forces are carrying out more ""atrocities"" in parts of Ukraine after bodies were found in the town of Bucha.

""For every Bucha there are many more towns Russia has occupied and more towns that it is still occupying, places where we must assume Russian soldiers are committing more atrocities right now,"" Blinken told journalists after meeting foreign ministers from NATO and Ukraine in Brussels. He said the US had warned ahead of Russia's invasion that part of the Kremlin's ""campaign plan was to inflict atrocities, was to target individuals, was to commit the kinds of crimes that we're now seeing to terrorise civilian populations"".

""And so this, as we saw it, was part of the game plan all along,"" he said.

5:59 pm: US, allies have supplied Ukraine 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons, US general says

Ukraine has received about 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons systems from the United States and its allies, helping Kyiv prevent Russia from establishing air superiority that would have aided Moscow's ground invasion, the top U.S. general said on Thursday.

5:56 pm: Ukraine says it needs 'weapons, weapons, and weapons'

""NATO will be supporting Ukraine with more weapons and also delivery of the weapons that they have already promised to Ukraine,"" FRANCE 24's Dave Keating reported from Brussels.

""We'll get more details about what exactly that assistance is going to look like,"" Keating continued. When Ukraine's foreign minister entered this summit this morning, he said Ukraine needs three things: weapons, weapons, and weapons. So are they getting all the weapons that they want? That's what we're going to see here today. But we have very strong words there from the [NATO] Secretary-General Stoltenberg that they understand the gravity of the situation.""

5:50 pm: 'Usual suspects' supporting Russia at UN

As the UN assembly readies to vote on suspending Russia from the body's Human Rights Council, ""we've heard from countries that you might call the usual suspects when it comes to supporting Russia; we've heard already from Venezuela, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Kazakhstan that they will be voring against this resolution, saying that it's politicised, that it won't help move forward dialogue, that it will undermine efforts to move towards peace,"" FRANCE 24's Jessica Le Masurier reported.

5:21 pm: German intelligence service has radio intercepts on Bucha killings

German intelligence services have intercepted radio traffic of Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, Spiegel reported Thursday, in what would be new evidence linking Moscow troops to the deaths.

Some of the audio material collected appears to relate to victims found dead along a main street in Bucha, the magazine said, citing a closed-door parliamentary briefing given by Germany's foreign intelligence service BND. Among the intercepts was a soldier's description of how he and his platoon mates shot a person on a bicycle.

5:21 pm: Ukraine using landmines effectively against Russia, US general says

Ukraine is effectively using landmines in the conflict with Russia, forcing Russian armored vehicles into engagement areas where they are vulnerable to US-supplied anti-tank weaponry, the top US general told a Senate hearing on Thursday.

""That's one of the reasons why you see column after column of Russian vehicles that are destroyed. So anti-tank or anti-personnel mines are very effective,"" Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee.

4:43 pm: After Kyiv win, Ukraine still faces significant battle in southeast, US general says

Ukrainian forces have successfully managed to counter Russia's attempt to take Kyiv but a significant battle is still ahead in the southeast of the country, the top US general said on Thursday.

""There is a significant battle yet ahead down in the southeast, down around the Donbas, Donetsk region where the Russians intend to mass forces and continue their assault,"" General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told lawmakers during a hearing.

4:42 pm: Conquering Mariupol will 'take time', pro-Russian separatist official says

A pro-Russian separatist official in eastern Ukraine said Thursday it was impossible to say how long it could take Moscow's forces to fully seize the besieged city of Mariupol.

Mariupol, located in the country's southeast between Russia-occupied Crimea and pro-Russian separatist regions in Ukraine's east, has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting.

Most recently, fighting has centred around the city's Azovstal iron and steel works and port, said Eduard Basurin, a senior official in the self-proclaimed breakaway stronghold of Donetsk. In televised remarks, he described Mariupol's industrial zone as a ""city within a city"".

4:40 pm: India says focus is on stabilising economic ties with Russia

India is focused on stabilising its economic ties with Russia and is working to devise a payment mechanism to settle trade amid Western sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, the foreign ministry said on Thursday.

""We have an etablished economic relation with Russia. Given the current circumstance post development in Ukraine, I think there is an effort by both sides to ensure that this economic relationship remains stable,"" ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a news conference.

3:51 pm: Novaya Gazeta opens outlet in Europe after suspending activities in Russia

Russian journalists from investigative paper Novaya Gazeta said on Thursday they were launching a new media outlet in Europe after their paper suspended its activities over warnings it received from the authorities.

Novaya Gazeta, whose editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov was co-winner of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, was among the liberal Russian media facing increased pressure in the wake of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine.

Last month, the paper said it could no longer operate in Russia after receiving warnings from communications watchdog Roskomnadzor for failing to properly identify an organisation deemed a ""foreign agent"" by the authorities in its publications.

3:50 pm: Turkey offers to host future Ukraine-Russia peace talks

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday he had told his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba that peace talks with Russia can be held in Turkey from now on.

Speaking after a NATO meeting in Brussels, Cavusoglu said there were still around 30 Turkish citizens, including their companions, stuck in Ukraine's southern port city of Mariupol, where thousands of people are believed to have died after a month under Russian siege and relentless bombardment.

3:48 pm: 'The road to Chuhuiv is deserted'

""The road to Chuhuiv is deserted; the debris from recent fighting litters the wayside,"" FRANCE 24's Catherine Norris-Trent reports. ""This small town southeast of Kharkiv has been caught in the crossfire for weeks. Hiding from the bombs, thousands here are still living underground. Four hundred people are crammed into this network of bunkers; most have been living here non-stop since the first days of the war nearly six weeks ago. Among them, the elderly and nearly 80 children.""

3:47 pm:Thousands find refuge in Lviv transit centres

""Since the start of this war in Ukraine, some 200,000 people have come to Lviv in the west of the country; most of them have come through transit centres like this one, where they're given initial accomodation, food, security, backup, and of course they have to go through security checks as well,"" FRANCE 24 Chief International Affairs Editor Robert Parsons reported from Lviv. ""After that, they're redistributed around the country – to families, to churches, to anywhere that can take them and provide them with food.""

3:28 pm: Turkey says Bucha killings 'overshadow' Russia-Ukraine talks

Images of bodies found in the Ukrainian town of Bucha and other areas near Kyiv in the wake of a Russian pullback have scuppered the positive atmosphere that followed recent talks between Russia and Ukraine, Turkey said Thursday.

""The images from Bucha, Irpin and other regions are unacceptable. These scenes have overshadowed the negotiations,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told journalists after a NATO meeting in Brussels. ""The emerging positive atmosphere, unfortunately, was overshadowed.""

3:23 pm: Ukraine dismisses Russian criticism of Kyiv over peace talks as propaganda

Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak dismissed comments by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday suggesting Kyiv had presented it with a draft peace deal that deviated from proposals both sides had previously agreed on.

Podolyak told Reuters in a written statement that Lavrov was not directly involved in negotiations and his statements were ""of purely propagandistic significance"". Podolyak said Moscow wanted to divert attention from events in the town of Bucha, where Ukraine accuses Russian troops of killing civilians, and added: ""That is how any such statements should be regarded.""

3:21 pm: More than 4.3 million Ukrainians flee war, UN says

More than 4.3 million Ukrainians have now fled their country since the Russian invasion, the United Nations said Thursday.

UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said 4,319,494 Ukrainians had fled across the border since the war began on February 24 – a figure up 40,705 since Wednesday. The agency says it is Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. The UN's International Organisation for Migration estimates that 7.1 million internally displaced people had fled their homes but were still in Ukraine.

2:43 pm: Dnipro mayor urges women and children to leave as fighting intensifies

The mayor of Dnipro in central-eastern Ukraine urged women, children and the elderly on Thursday to leave the city because the conflict with Russia is expected to intensify in eastern regions.

The recommendation follows similar warnings by the authorities in the Luhansk region, which is east of Dnipro. The regional governor of Luhansk urged all residents on Wednesday to evacuate while they still could in relative safety.

""All those who have the ability, as I have already said, should leave. This involves women, children, the elderly, those who are not [...] directly integrated into the economy,"" said Dnipro's mayor Borys Filatov in an online video address.

2:37 pm: Cyprus to revoke passports of four sanctioned Russians

Cyprus will revoke the passports of four sanctioned Russians who had received citizenship under an investment scheme discontinued in late 2020, government sources said on Thursday.

The names of the individuals were not disclosed, but they are on a list of more than 800 people sanctioned by the European Union in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and considered to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

2:36 pm: Russia accuses Ukraine of changing demands since Istanbul talks

Russia on Thursday accused Ukrainian negotiators of changing demands since last month's talks in Istanbul, claiming that Kyiv was not interested in ending fighting.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that on Wednesday the Ukrainian side had presented its draft agreement. ""It shows a departure from the most important provisions spelled out at the meeting in Istanbul on March 29,"" he said.

In Turkey, ""the Ukrainians clearly stated that future (international) security guarantees for Ukraine do not apply to Crimea and Sevastopol,"" Lavrov said, referring to territory Moscow annexed in 2014.

2:35 pm: WHO says making contingency plans for possible 'chemical assaults'

The World Health Organisation's European head said on Thursday that the body was preparing for possible ""chemical assaults"" in Ukraine, in a sign it is taking warnings that have emerged from both the West and Moscow seriously.

""Given the uncertainties of the current situation, there are no assurances that the war will not get worse,"" Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, said during a briefing from Lviv, Ukraine. ""WHO is considering all scenarios and making contingencies for different situations that could afflict the people of Ukraine, from the continued treatment of mass casualties, to chemical assaults,"" he said.

2:03 pm: Hungary breaks ranks with the EU on the issue of arming Ukraine

NATO countries are debating over whether or not they should provide hard weapons to Ukraine. There are worries that hard military equipment like tanks would be vulnerable to Russian attacks while they are within NATO territory. For its part, Hungary has said that not only will it not arm Ukraine, but it will not allow any arms to go through Hungary if they were to come from another country further west in the EU. FRANCE 24's Dave Keating reports from Brussels.

Speaking at an online briefing about efforts to defend the capital, Oleksandr Gruzevich said: ""It is likely the enemy has not given up the goal of a second attack on Kyiv – there is such a threat.""

11:37 am: Ukraine warns of 'last chance' to flee Russian attacks in east

A Ukrainian official in the east of the county warned residents remaining there Thursday that time was running out to flee mounting Russian attacks, saying that all villages in the region were under attack.

9:38 am: Ukraine urges Hungary to 'get on the right side of history' over Russia

Ukraine said on Thursday that Hungary's position that it is prepared to pay in roubles for Russian gas was an ""unfriendly"" stance that was destroying the unity of the European Union over Russia's invasion.

""If Hungary really wants to help end the war, here's how to do it: stop destroying unity in the EU, support new anti-Russian sanctions, provide military assistance to Ukraine, and not create additional sources of funding for Russia's military machine. It is never too late to get on the right side of history,"" Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said.

9:26 am: Turkey says Black Sea countries discussed Ukraine war, floating mines

6:05 am: Ukraine girds for renewed Russian offensive on eastern front

Ukraine braced for a climactic battle for control of the besieged country's industrial east, as Russian forces withdrew from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their offensive across the Donbas region, where authorities urged people to evacuate before time runs out.

The mayor of the southern port city of Mariupol said Wednesday that more than 5,000 civilians had been killed there. Meanwhile, in areas north of the capital, Ukrainian officials gathered evidence of Russian atrocities amid telltale signs that Moscow’s troops killed people indiscriminately before retreating over the past several days.

In his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that the Russian military continued to build up its forces in preparation for a new offensive in the east, where the Kremlin has said its goal is to “liberate” the Donbas, Ukraine’s mostly Russian-speaking industrial heartland. But he said Ukraine, too, was preparing for battle.

“We will fight and we will not retreat,” he said. “We will seek all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace. This is our land. This is our future. And we won’t give them up.”

5:30 am: US Senate to vote on revoking Russia's trade status, oil ban

The US Senate will take up legislation Thursday to end normal trade relations with Russia and to ban the importation of its oil. Both bills have been bogged down in the Senate, frustrating lawmakers who want to ratchet up the US response to Russia’s war with Ukraine.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Russian President Vladimir Putin needs to be held accountable for what Schumer said were war crimes against Ukraine.

The trade suspension measure paves the way for US President Joe Biden to enact higher tariffs on certain Russian imports. The bill banning Russian oil would codify restrictions Biden has already put in place through executive action.

– Secretary of State Antony Blinken

After Ukraine’s forces liberated the town on March 31, 2022, disturbing reports emerged of civilians found lying dead in the streets, in back yards, and in mass graves. Some of the victims had their hands bound, some had fatal gunshot wounds to the head, others were beheaded or burned. Amid mounting evidence that Russia’s forces had committed atrocities in Bucha, the Kremlin immediately deployed a disinformation campaign to deflect responsibility for the slaughter from its forces.

A Kremlin Disinformation Blitz in Response to Bucha Reports and Global Condemnation

The Putin Regime’s disinformation campaign in response to the discovery of apparent killings of civilians in Bucha is notable for its speed and adaptability. In response to international shock and outrage at the initial images coming out of Bucha, the Kremlin was quick to deny everything. As reports continued to mount from Bucha and liberated areas surrounding Kyiv of killings, torture, looting, and rape, the Kremlin adapted and expanded its lies, drawing from the same playbook of false narratives it uses to deflect blame from the Assad regime’s atrocities in Syria, where members of the Syrian Civil Defense Organization “White Helmets” were falsely accused of staging fake attacks. Similarly, the Kremlin’s disinformation and propaganda ecosystem falsely depicted the atrocities in Bucha and in other parts of Ukraine as an “attack of fakes” and a “provocation by Ukrainian radicals” while also claiming that the victims are paid actors.

After reports from Bucha surfaced, Russian Federation officials and Kremlin-aligned purveyors of disinformation launched into a well-established pattern of simultaneous denial, “what-aboutism,” and counteraccusations. Russia’s state media broadcasts, and official statements, such as the remarks of Russia’s UN Permanent Representative Vasily Nebenzya at a Security Council meeting regarding Bucha, were all designed to hide the facts of the Russian Federation’s responsibility for these atrocities.

The Truth Behind the Lies

Russian Federation’s Disinformation Narrative : The bodies of the victims in Bucha have not entered rigor mortis and therefore could not have been killed when Russia’s forces were in the town.

Fact: According to experts, rigor mortis usually subsides by day four, so it is not unusual that the bodies are not stiff in the images.

Russian Federation’s Disinformation Narrative : One of the bodies allegedly moved an arm in a video and therefore the people are not dead but instead are just actors.

Fact: The alleged “movement” is simply a distortion effect of the video due to a rain drop on the mirror that warps the image.

Russian Federation’s Disinformation Narrative : The dead bodies appeared four days after Russia’s forces had left Bucha, so Ukraine’s Armed Forces must have put the bodies there.

Fact: Satellite images show the bodies were on the streets for more than three weeks, that is, during the time Russia’s forces still controlled the town.

Why Vladimir Putin Won’t Pull the Wool over the World’s Eyes about Bucha

The world is not falling for the Russian Federation’s disinformation and propaganda ecosystem’s false claims about Bucha. International fact checkers and media outlets, such as the New York Times, Bellingcat and BBC, have produced detailed analyses of the Kremlin’s false claims. Future investigations into the atrocities will only further reveal to the world the true extent of the Russian Federation’s responsibility for the atrocities in Ukraine, and its ongoing efforts to escape international accountability.",https://www.state.gov/disarming-disinformation/russian-federation-disinformation-about-its-atrocities-in-bucha/

The latest: The weeks-long resistance in besieged Mariupol appeared to be cracking as Russian forces moved closer to capturing the seaside port city in southeastern Ukraine, with a Russian-imposed deadline for Ukrainian forces in the city to surrender passing early Sunday local time. Meanwhile, officials in the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv reported explosions Saturday. Moscow has withdrawn its forces from those regions to focus on eastern Ukraine, but airstrikes have continued.

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Photos: Post photographers have been on the ground from the very beginning of the war — here’s some of their most powerful work.

How you can help: Here are ways those in the U.S. can help support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.

Ukraine war disruptions send food prices to their highest ever: UN index

World food prices hit an all-time high in March following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – an agricultural powerhouse – a United Nations agency has said.

The disruption in export flows resulting from the invasion and international sanctions against Russia has spurred fears of a global hunger crisis, especially across the Middle East and Africa.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said its Food Price Index, which tracks monthly changes in international prices for a basket of commodities, averaged 159.3 points last month, up 12.6 percent from February. As it is, the February index was the highest level since its inception in 1990.

Serbia’s UN vote against Russia driven by fear of sanctions, president says

Serbia voted for suspending Russia’s membership of the UN Human Rights Council fearing sanctions against it, President Aleksandar Vučić said.

“People ask why we didn’t vote against or why we didn’t abstain,” Vučić said on Serbia’s public broadcaster, Radio Television of Serbia.

He said if Serbia abstained, more countries would be against them “and the pressure will become even greater. At the same time, today a decision is being made about the fate of Serbia – whether we will be an exception from the package of sanctions on oil”.

Gazprom Neft, one of the Russian-owned companies sanctioned by the EU, is the majority shareholder of the Petroleum Industry of Serbia.

Zelenskyy says Russia will use dead Ukrainians in propaganda campaign against his country

Russian propagandists are planning to use the bodies of Mariupol victims to stage a scene that can be blamed on Ukraine, Zelenskyy has said.

“They are going to show the victims in Mariupol as if they were killed not by the Russian military, but by the Ukrainian defenders of the city. To do this, the occupiers collect corpses on the streets, take them out and can use them elsewhere in accordance with the elaborated propaganda scenarios.”

Zelenskyy called it a “mirror response” to what people saw in Bucha. Russia has claimed the atrocities in Bucha, where bodies of shot civilians lined the streets, were staged by Ukrainians.

Killings in Mali underscore Russia’s ‘malign activity’ beyond Ukraine, UK ambassador

The UK deputy representative to the UN, James Kariuki, has said reports of the massacre in the Malian town of Moura underline the extent of “Russia’s malign activity around the world, beyond Ukraine”.

“We know that, as of early 2022, around 1,000 Russian mercenary personnel have been stationed across Mali. Just as the presence of Russian mercenaries drove an increase in human rights violations and abuses in the Central African Republic last year, we fear we are now seeing the same in Mali,” Kariuki told the UN’s Security Council.

A Human Rights Watch (HRW) investigation revealed about 300 civilians and suspected members of armed groups were allegedly executed in Moura during an operation by Malian forces and foreign fighters. HRW says several sources identified the foreign fighters as Russians.

Russian mercenaries have reportedly been deployed to Africa as part of the Wagner Group, a paramilitary unit that was also allegedly aiding Russian separatists in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Russia has consistently denied the group’s connection to the state.

Russia’s suspension from UN rights body sends strong signal: Rights groups

The vote to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council has strengthened the forum and sent a powerful message that violators cannot be members, rights organisations say.

“This sends a powerful message that the Human Rights Council is no place for states that are perpetrating massive human rights violations, including acts that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,” said Phil Lynch, executive director of the International Service for Human Rights.

That was echoed by Human Rights Watch, which said in a statement that the UNGA “sent a crystal-clear message to Russia’s leadership that a government whose military is routinely committing horrific rights violations has no business” on the council.

Pink Floyd members reunite to record song for Ukraine

British rock band Pink Floyd will release a new song on Friday to raise money for humanitarian relief in Ukraine, featuring the vocals of a Ukrainian singer who quit an international tour to fight for his country and was wounded.

The single “Hey Hey, Rise Up” – Pink Floyd’s first original new music in almost 30 years – was recorded last week and highlights singing by Andriy Khlyvnyuk from Ukrainian band Boombox, which was taken from an Instagram post.

“Then I saw this incredible video on Instagram, where he stands in a square in Kyiv with this beautiful gold-domed church and sings in the silence of a city with no traffic or background noise because of the war,” guitarist David Gilmour said on Pink Floyd’s website.

“It was a powerful moment that made me want to put it to music.”

Number of Ukrainians arriving at Mexico-US border doubles

The number of Ukrainians arriving at the US-Mexico border to seek asylum in the US has more than doubled in less than a week, officials have said.

Lying on plastic mattresses, hundreds of Ukrainians — including families — waited in a crowded shelter run by the local government in the Mexican border city of Tijuana this week.

Enrique Lucero, director of Tijuana’s immigration services, said about 2,829 Ukrainians were waiting, more than double the 1,200 counted last Friday. Nearly two-thirds of them were in shelters, with the rest in hotels and churches, he said.

US plans to starve Russia’s ‘war machine’: Official

The US is ramping up sanctions against Russia to deprive its “war machine” of money, US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo has said, but added that curbing Moscow’s main source of funding – exports – will take time.

“What this means is that Russia will be deprived of the capital it needs to build up its economy, but also to invest in its war machine,” Adeyemo said in an interview with the Reuters news agency.

“Because of our ability to produce energy at home, we were able to ban the Russian import of oil to America rather quickly,” he said. “It’s going to take them more time but what they’re doing is they’re reducing their dependence over time.”

Russian Nobel laureate Muratov attacked with red paint

The Russian co-winner of last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, Dmitry Muratov, has said that he was attacked on a train with red paint, in an apparent protest at his newspaper’s coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“They poured oil paint with acetone all over the compartment. Eyes burning badly,” Muratov’s Novaya Gazeta investigative newspaper quoted him as saying.

Pictures posted by the newspaper on the Telegram messaging app showed Muratov with red paint on his head and clothes and around his sleeping compartment on a Moscow-Samara train.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on Russians to ""find the truth"" and ""share it.""

""Your president stands accused of committing war crimes. But I cannot believe he's acting in your name,"" Johnson said in a video directly addressing the Russian people.

Speaking in both Russian and English, he said: ""The atrocities committed by Russian troops in Bucha, Irpin and elsewhere in Ukraine have horrified the world.""

He went on to outline the alleged atrocities of Russian troops: civilians massacred, women raped, bodies burned and ""dumped in mass graves, or just left lying in the street.""

Ukrainian officials say that more than 300 civilians were tortured and killed by Russian troops in the town of Bucha outside Kyiv, discoveries made only after Moscow pulled out of those areas.

Graphic media images also revealed corpses of civilians in the streets — some with their hands and legs tied up — while satellite images captured mass graves.

Russia has been waging information warfare alongside its military operations.

The Russian people have been ""fed a steady diet of propaganda"" by Russian-state media, according to NBC News' Ken Dilanian. The Kremlin has labeled the unprovoked and unwarranted war in Ukraine a ""special military operation.""

""The reports are so shocking, so sickening, it's no wonder your government is seeking to hide them from you,"" Johnson said.

""But don't just take my word for it,"" he added, calling on them to access independent information via VPN connection. ""And when you find the truth, share it.""

In Bucha, bodies have been found with hands tied and gunshot wounds to the head. A report published by Human Rights Watch, on Sunday, documented sexual violence and alleged killings by Russian troops in other parts of the country. Earlier this week, President Biden called for the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, to face a trial for war crimes. (Satellite imagery revealed that the dead bodies in Bucha had been present for weeks, casting doubt on Russian claims that they had been placed there after Russian forces departed.) On Tuesday, the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, addressed the United Nations Security Council, and asked, “Are you ready to close the U.N.? Do you think the time of international law is gone? If the answer is no, then you need to act immediately.” (Later in the week, the New York Times posted a still frame from a video that appeared to show Ukrainian troops executing captured Russian combatants.)

To talk through what, if any, consequences the Russian leadership could face for these actions, I recently spoke by phone with Oona Hathaway, a professor at Yale Law School and the director of the school’s Center for Global Legal Challenges and the co-author, with Scott J. Shapiro, of the book “The Internationalists.” She also serves on a committee that offers guidance to the State Department on international law. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the different mechanisms that could be used to bring members of the Russian military to justice, how American actions have undermined the prospects for international accountability, and how international law might change after the Ukraine conflict.

What does it mean, in practice, for a big and powerful country to commit war crimes in 2022?

Well, it means that the international legal order is really under serious stress. This is, of course, not the first time that a major country has committed war crimes, even in recent years. We’ve seen war crimes taking place, for instance, in Syria, for much of the last several years. But what’s distinctive about this current moment is that we haven’t seen a fight between a major global power (here, Russia) and another state (here, Ukraine) in the last couple of decades, where the rules of the Geneva Conventions, the vast rules of international humanitarian law, are being broken on a massive scale.

We all have an idea of what war crimes are, but what is the underlying legal framework here? Is it just the Geneva Conventions, or something else?

The rules are not limited simply to the Geneva Conventions. It could also include customary international law that supplements the treaty rules in the Geneva Conventions. International humanitarian law creates a kind of foundational framework that we look to when we’re thinking about war crimes, and war crimes are any serious violation of international humanitarian law. So we look to: What does international humanitarian law provide? What does it require? What does it allow states to do? What does it prohibit states from doing? And then is there any significant violation of those rules? And, if there is, that can be a war crime.

And, in terms of enforcement mechanisms, it seems like there is the International Criminal Court, but beyond that?

There are two categories of accountability mechanisms. There are domestic courts, and there are international courts. And, generally speaking, when war crimes are committed it’s often the domestic courts that take the lead in addressing the problem. So you may remember that there were some courts-martial of U.S. soldiers for war crimes, and a few of them were pardoned by President Trump after having been convicted. And actually in Ukraine we see that the prosecutor general of the country has already opened more than two thousand investigations into possible war crimes taking place in Ukraine, and is likely to start prosecuting Russian soldiers—particularly soldiers who are currently being held as prisoners of war and may have participated in some of those war crimes and therefore can be subject to prosecution for violating international humanitarian law.

So it would be prosecutions on the domestic level for violations of international law?

Exactly. Almost every country in the world that is party to the Geneva Conventions has its own domestic statute that allows for the criminal prosecution of war crimes. So the United States has its own War Crimes Act that allows prosecution of war crimes here in the United States. And Ukraine has war crimes as part of its domestic criminal law. But that is done in the shadow of the international law, and the Geneva Conventions in fact require states that are party to the conventions to be able to criminally prosecute violations of the conventions. So every state is actually required to have a mechanism for domestic prosecutions of war crimes.

And what happens if America or Russia just decides not to follow the Geneva Conventions? There is no enforcement mechanism for that, correct?

Yeah, other than all the enforcement mechanisms we’re seeing the world try to use against Russia. So sanctions. And, if any of those who are suspected of crimes were to travel outside Russia, they potentially could be subject to prosecution for war crimes. So there are some possible mechanisms.

Yes, this happened with Pinochet.

Yeah, and that’s an issue that can come up for a number of these folks. And then they’re also subject to prosecution in Ukraine. And Ukraine actually has a system in place for not only indicting people in absentia but potentially even trying them, although I’m not sure that that’s something the international community is going to be enthusiastic about because it’s considered to be not entirely kosher with human-rights norms. But if they were to travel to other states that have war-crimes statutes . . .

Why isn’t it considered kosher?

The idea of trying someone who isn’t present brings up concerns that he or she is not able to properly defend themselves.

Can you talk a little bit about the International Criminal Court, which Russia is not party to? How does it function?

I think the I.C.C. has a lot of potential to be useful here. You are absolutely right that neither Russia nor Ukraine is a party to the Rome Statute, which is the treaty that created the I.C.C. But back in 2014 Ukraine agreed to submit events taking place in Ukraine to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, and then it renewed that and expanded it. And that submission remains in place. And so, even though Ukraine is not party to the International Criminal Court, it has submitted to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, which basically means that if there are crimes committed in Ukraine that are within the scope of the crimes that can be prosecuted in the International Criminal Court, then the I.C.C. can open an investigation and in fact move forward with the prosecution, and that has happened.

So an I.C.C. prosecutor announced that he was opening an investigation. And he also announced that he’s received forty-one state referrals, which essentially indicates that the state strongly supports moving forward with an investigation. Some states have offered additional funding and assistance to the prosecutor in investigating war crimes and crimes against humanity. And now we’re hearing reports potentially of genocidal acts, as well, in Ukraine. So that is the international mechanism that is already at work with doing some of the evidence collection and doing some investigations that would be necessary in order to move forward with prosecution of these war crimes.

America has played a huge role in undermining the I.C.C. The Bush Administration would not coöperate with it. The Trump Administration sanctioned people at the I.C.C. and said that we would never send people there for trial. Beyond the morality of this, what about the practical impact? Is the I.C.C. really going to function without meaningful American support?

So it has been functioning even without strong U.S. support. It’s not perfect, but it has managed to move forward with some significant prosecutions, some of which have been with U.S. support. It’s important to note that the United States supported the referral of the situation in Sudan to the International Criminal Court, for instance. [The U.S. declined to formally support a referral, but didn’t object.]

I was referring to referrals of our own citizens.

Oh, yes, absolutely. The United States has had a very fraught relationship with the International Criminal Court from the beginning of the Bush Administration, which was shortly after the Clinton Administration signed the Rome Statute. Bush came in, and he tried to unsign the Rome Statute and then proceeded to go around the world telling countries that if they didn’t sign an agreement exempting the U.S. from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, for crimes committed on their soil, the U.S. would withdraw foreign aid from them.",https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-shadow-of-international-law
8,ba998ad1-d132-48e7-8910-833aaa28f3eb,['Rfe Rl'],,"Russia's Defense Ministry warned on April 15 that it will intensify attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after accusing Ukraine of targeting Russian border towns.

The statement came a day after Russia suffered a symbolic defeat with the loss of its Black Sea fleet flagship, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed his people for their resolve since Russia invaded in February and for making “the most important decision of their life -- to fight.”

Zelenskiy told Ukrainians late on April 14 that they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the invaders “gave us a maximum of five.”

Live Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine RFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the major developments on Russia's invasion, how Kyiv is fighting back, the plight of civilians, and Western reaction. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.

Zelenskiy noted “those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it’s to the bottom” of the sea in a reference to Russia's guided-missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, which sank in the Black Sea after being damaged in disputed circumstances.

“The number and the scale of missile attacks on objects in Kyiv will be ramped up in response to the Kyiv nationalist regime committing any terrorist attacks or diversions on Russian territory,” Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said.

Kyiv claimed to have hit the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles early on April 14, while Russia said a fire broke out on the ship, causing an explosion.

The U.S. military agreed with the Ukrainian version.

""We assess that they hit it with two Neptunes,"" a senior Pentagon official said in a briefing with reporters on April 15, calling it a ""big blow"" for Moscow.

The strikes were believed to have caused casualties, but it was difficult to assess how many, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The official added that the United States had observed survivors being recovered by other Russian vessels in the area. Russia said the Moskva's crew was evacuated to nearby ships.

Natalia Humenyuk, a spokeswoman for Ukraine's southern military forces, said the Ukrainian side expects Russia to take revenge.

The strike on the Moskva ""hit not only the ship itself, it hit the enemy's imperial ambitions. We are all aware that we will not be forgiven for this,"" she said during a briefing. ""We are aware that attacks against us will intensify and that the enemy will take revenge,"" she added, citing ongoing strikes on cities in the south of Ukraine, Odesa, and Mykolaiv.

On April 15, Russian troops fired on almost all settlements in the Luhansk region, killing and injuring civilians, Ukrainian authorities said.

""Occupying Russian troops fired mortars, artillery, and rocket-propelled grenade launchers at the cities of Syevyerodonetsk, Rubizhne, Kreminna, Lysychansk, Popasna, Hirske, Zolote, Orikhove, and Novotoshkivka 26 times,"" Ukraine's national police agency said.

Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on April 15, according to local media, and fighting raged in the east.

The Russian Defense Ministry said that Russian troops hit a ""military"" factory outside Kyiv late on April 14 using Kalibr sea-based long-range missiles.

The Ukrainian presidency says explosions were heard in the Vasylkiv area outside the capital.

The Russian ministry also said its S-400 missile system shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter, which carried out ""an attack on civilians in the locality of Klimovo in the Bryansk region on April 14.”

On April 14, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine (RNBO) rejected Russia’s accusations about the attacks on Russian towns, calling them ""an attempt to ignite anti-Ukraine hysteria in Russia.""

Explosions were also heard on April 15 in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv, and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, media reported.

The German government said it plans to release more than 1 billion euros in military aid for Ukraine.

Berlin has decided to increase its international aid in the defense sector to 2 billion euros, with the largest part planned for Ukraine, Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Twitter.

The move comes amid criticism from Ukraine and some EU partners such as Poland and the Baltic states that Germany has not done enough to send armaments to Kyiv.

Ukrainian authorities continue to expect an imminent, stepped-up offensive by Russian forces in the eastern part of the country.

Some areas in the east have already felt the brunt of Russian attacks. An official in the Kharkiv region said at least 503 civilians have been killed since the invasion began. Regional Governor Oleh Synehubov said in a post on Telegram that the dead included 24 children.

The city near the Russian border has been on the eastern front line since the start of the war and has suffered massive destruction.

Efforts to evacuate people from the southern port city of Mariupol continued on April 15. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iyrna Vereshchuk said 363 people from Mariupol were among 2,864 people who were evacuated from conflict zones.

Ukraine says tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol, a strategic city that has seen some of the worst fighting of the war.

Seven people were killed and more than two dozen injured in a Russian attack on buses ferrying civilians in the village of Borova in the Izyum district, the Ukrainian Prosecutor-General's Office said in a statement on social media.

In Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) has asked the government to increase funding for troop funeral services and tombstones.

The FSB asked for a 17 percent increase for funeral services, according to documents recently posted to a government website.
