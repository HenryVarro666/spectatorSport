Russia purchased the drones in 2015 in an unusual $400 million deal intended to close Moscow’s technological and operational gap in unmanned aerial vehicles, according to a report by the Hebrew-language Ynet news outlet.

There is also a video showing how the Russian UAV has been converted to a combat drone carrying bombs.

Although Russia then sought to purchase the more advanced Hermes 450 UAV produced by Elbit, Israel’s Ministry of Defense only allowed the purchase of the Searcher 2, which first entered service in the early 1980s.

Russia subsequently began to produce the UAV domestically, at first using IAI components but eventually producing the entire aircraft locally, including its camera system.

The UAV that was shot down on Friday carried the original Israeli camera system produced by IAI, according to the report.

Israel’s Defense Ministry declined to say whether Israel continues to provide technical support for UAVs sold to Russia, Ynet reported.

At present Russian forces are operating more than 100 such combat drones, including in Syria.",https://www.jewishpress.com/news/israel/russian-forpost-r-uav-based-on-iais-searcher-2-shot-down-near-zhytomyr-ukraine/2022/03/12/

In the Zhytomyr region, the Ukrainian military shot down a Russian unmanned aerial vehicle Forpost. About it informed Advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs Anton Gerashchenko.

“It was used to adjust and direct artillery fire. Now, perhaps, a little less Ukrainian civilians will suffer from shelling,” Gerashchenko wrote in his Telegram.

It should be noted that the Forpost UAV was developed on the basis of the Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle IAI Searcher II, purchased by Russia in 2009-2010. The first Forpost UAV complexes entered the RF Armed Forces in 2014. In August 2021, it became known that the Outpost, previously used by intelligence, received shock functions. Two small rockets were placed on the external suspension under the wing of the apparatus.

As reported, on March 2, Ukraine received new Bayraktar attack drones. They are already on combat duty, Defense Minister Alexei Reznikov said. As you know, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are actively using Bayratkar drones against the Russian aggressor.

The photos, the authenticity of which has not been verified, show the ruins of a Forpost drone, including a plaque bearing the name of the Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI).

The Forpost is a reconnaissance UAV, produced by Russia under license based on the IAI Searcher. Such licenses were sold to Russia in 2015, and the country is believed to operate several dozens of such drones.

Israel’s Searcher is considered to be a relatively old model, developed in the 1980s.

The use of Israeli-linked weaponry by Russia is a somewhat sensitive issue, as Ukraine continues to urge the Jewish state to provide it with military aid to fend off the Russian invasion of the country.

Israel has provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine, including 100 tons of medical and cold-weather equipment flown out of Ben Gurion Airport last week. However, it has sought to walk a tightrope to maintain good relations with both Ukraine and Russia, the latter of which maintains a military presence in Syria and is negotiating Iran’s return to the 2015 nuclear deal.

Ukraine has been publicly pleading for Israel to provide it with protective gear, but has so far been rebuffed.

A Channel 12 report Friday said Jerusalem had begun considering Ukrainian requests for some defensive equipment, such as helmets and flak jackets.

Earlier Friday, the Ukrainian Ambassador to Israel Yevgen Korniychuk said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “does not” understand Israel’s refusal to provide defensive equipment, as he accused Israeli leaders of not doing enough to help Ukraine by providing defensive aid, absorbing refugees, and taking a clear stance against Russia.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/ukraine-photos-claim-to-show-downed-russian-drone-with-israeli-origin/

Today, March 11, is the 16th day of the Russian military attack on Ukraine. We're telling about all the current events. The article will be constantly updated.

What is today?

Key points.

Operational information as of the morning of March 11, 2022.

In the Polissia direction , the enemy is trying to break through the defenses of Ukraine's defenders in the areas of Poliske, Kukhari, Zhovtneve, Andriivka, Kopyliv, Motyzhyn, Buzova, Horenychi, Bucha, Demydiv, and block Kyiv.

In the Siverskyi direction , the enemy was stopped while trying to break through the defense of Chernihiv. Further movement of the enemy in the direction of Brovary from the east is not riled out.

In the Kharkiv direction , the enemy continues unsuccessful attempts to blockade the city from the north. Rifle regiments formed at the expense of Russian reservists were involved in the fighting in the Kharkiv region.

In the Pivdennyi Buh direction , the occupiers tried to gain control of Mykolaiv and develop an offensive in the directions of Zaporizhzhia and Kryvyi Rih. The Russian occupiers were stopped, demoralized, and suffered heavy losses.

In the Kherson region in the temporarily occupied settlements, the enemy is trying to establish an administrative-police regime.

The aggressor's losses are growing!

The EU Council recognized Russia's ""special operation"" in Ukraine as war and called Belarus an accomplice. The EU promises to further increase sanctions on Russia and Belarus.

The Russian Armed Forces have launched 775 missiles of ""all colors and all types"" since the invasion of Ukraine, a senior US State Department official told CNN.

The seized $415 billion of Russia's reserves will be used to compensate Ukraine: the Cabinet of Ministers and other governments are looking for a mechanism to transfer to Ukraine the seized gold and foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank, said First Deputy Economy Minister Denys Kudin.

15:00 – We have already reached a strategic turning point. We are moving towards our victory. The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is sure.

The Armed Forces managed to eliminate Major General Andrey Kolesnikov, commander of the 29th Army of the Eastern Military District of the Russian Federation. This is the third dead Russian general.

1,000 residents of Hostomel arrived in Bilohorodka. First aid is provided in the city. Further logistics to Kyiv and, if necessary, to the West of the country are provided.

20:00 – the Russian occupiers disrupted the evacuation from Izium; because of the shelling, the ""green corridor"" was not launched. The city was left without electricity, heat, water, communications.

A free transfer from Odesa to Moldova will be organized on March 12. This was reported in the press service of the Odesa regional organization of the Red Cross of Ukraine.

Chemical and biological threat

Russian media report that Russia has invited a meeting of the UN Security Council on US military-biological programs in Ukraine.

The President of Ukraine has already said in this regard: ""I am the President of an adequate country and an adequate people. And the father of two children. No chemical or any other weapons of mass destruction have been developed on my land. The entire world knows this. And if Russia does something similar against us, it will receive the harshest sanctions response,"" Zelenskyy promised in his address.

On March 8, graduates of the Moscow State University's bio faculty refuted their country's fake statement about ""biological weapons"" in Ukraine. ""The list of destroyed strains published by RIA Novosti and other Russian media outlets does not include any that are particularly dangerous. The list includes only strains common to microbiological and even epidemiological laboratories. General Konashenkov's statement about the existence of documented strains of 'plague, anthrax, tularemia, cholera' is pure fiction. The absolutely wild idea of ​​the existence of a special 'DNA of the Slavs, against whom special biological weapons were to be used,' according to Russian media, is a delusion for anyone who has studied a school biology course.

Such statements resonate with the theories of the German National Socialists with their cult of the 'Aryan higher race.' We demand to stop false statements about allegedly found evidence of the development of biological weapons in Ukrainian laboratories.""

Meanwhile, the WHO recommends that Ukraine destroy high-risk pathogens in medical laboratories to prevent spills.

Nuclear energy and facilities

Ukraine completely refuses to purchase Russian nuclear fuel, Energoatom says.

The nuclear subcritical unit, Neutron Source, which is located in the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology in Piatyhatki, was blacked out as a result of shelling by Russian troops, according to the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation of Ukraine.

It is impossible to deliver spare parts, equipment, and specialized personnel to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, which was captured by the Russians, to carry out scheduled repairs. Maintenance of Unit 1 has been reduced to the minimum allowable level, said IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi.

Importantly! According to available information, Putin ordered the preparation of a terrorist attack at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant. The Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warns about it.

In the Russian-controlled Chornobyl nuclear power plant, Russian troops plan to create a man-made catastrophe, for which the occupiers will try to shift responsibility to Ukraine. Currently, the Chornobyl nuclear power plant is completely disconnected from the monitoring systems of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The station is blacked out. The service life of the available diesel generators is designed for 48 hours of maintenance of safety systems.

The occupiers refuse to grant access to the station to Ukrainian repairmen. Instead, ""Belarusian specialists"" went there on the instructions of Aleksandr Lukashenko. Among them, under the guise of nuclear power plants, Russian saboteurs also come to organize a terrorist attack.

To imitate the involvement of the Ukrainian military in the Chornobyl accident, the occupiers are trying to create fake ""evidence"" to confirm their version. In particular, Russian car refrigerators collecting the bodies of dead Ukrainian defenders were spotted near the Antonov airport in Hostomel. There is a possibility that they will be played off as saboteurs in the Chornobyl zone.

18:00 – Chornobyl NPP managed to provide an additional supply of diesel fuel for power plants that provide emergency power supply to spent nuclear fuel storage facilities, according to the State Inspectorate for Nuclear Regulation. Attempts are being made to restore the station's external power supply.

22:00 – Russian fascists use Zaporizhzhia NPP as a military base, Energoatom states.

Who's coming to Ukraine?

About financial aid, weapons, and volunteer fighters

Forty Republican senators are demanding that the Biden administration allow the transfer of Polish MiG-29 fighters to Ukraine.

The US Senate approved the allocation of $13.6 million to help Ukraine. About half of this amount is spent on arming and equipping Ukraine, as well as the Pentagon's spending on sending US troops to other Eastern European countries. The rest of the money should go to humanitarian and economic aid, strengthening Allied defenses in the region, and protecting their energy and cybersecurity needs. The bill has now been submitted to President Joe Biden for signature.

American actress Mila Kunis and her husband and actor Ashton Kutcher raised $20 million for Ukrainians in a week.

""Thank you to everyone who helped us raise $20 million in less than a week. We can do it. We can hit our target. Together. Because we are with Ukraine,"" Kutcher wrote on social media.

Kazakhstan has sent 40 tons of humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

Ukraine's accession to the EU

Today, March 11, will be a crucial moment for the future of Ukraine and the future of the entirety of Europe. The heads of state must discuss Ukraine's request for quick accession to the European Union and announce a decision!

""EU leaders have said 'YES' to Ukraine's European integration. The process has begun. Now it depends on us and Ukrainians how quickly we will complete it. The heroic Ukrainian people deserve to know that the EU is happy to have them,"" the Lithuanian president wrote.

A rally in support of Ukraine will begin at 11:00 near the Palace of Versailles in France.

The EU Council supported Ukraine's application to join the EU and asks the European Commission to consider this issue immediately. The European Council has agreed in principle to our membership and the green light to start the accession process. Unfortunately, there is no ""accelerated"" procedure for joining the EU for Ukraine, although many have already written about it. The Chancellor of Germany and the Prime Minister of the Netherlands have already spoken publicly about the impossibility of such a procedure. But even without it, Ukraine has never been so close to joining the EU.

Ukraine's membership in the EU remains a matter of time and no more.

Foreign Minister Kuleba is convinced that Ukraine will 100% join the ranks of the European Union.

Also, the possibility of receiving funds from the IMF and other financial institutions will be blocked. Personal sanctions are being imposed on State Duma deputies and bank heads.

In addition, the United States has banned the import of alcohol, diamonds, and seafood from Russia. Be very careful, because where there's ""vodka and herring,"" there's Russia.

What can we hear about Belarusians?

Aleksandr Lukashenko flew to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss, in particular, the war in Ukraine.

While the mustached man is voyaging, banks in Belarus refuse to accept Russian rubles. And in some Belarusian currency exchange offices, the purchase of Russian money has stopped altogether.

At a meeting with Putin, Lukashenko said that ""by the end of the year, people will forget about the conflict in Ukraine."" Don't even hope. Nobody will forget anything, neither Mariupol, nor Kharkiv, nor Kyiv region. Neither millions of refugees nor thousands, killed and wounded by the criminal racist regime.

Don't let your country get involved in this war! Don't let the Kremlin destroy the future of Belarus!""

The command of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine also reported the shelling of the settlements of Bukhlychi and Verkhniy Terebezhiv in Belarus.

And all this immediately after the meeting between Putin and Lukashenko! So what did they really agree on? Did the President of Belarus himself approve of the bombing of his country?

Popasna and nearby settlements without gas due to damage to the gas pipeline as a result of hostilities.

A pregnant girl from Mariupol, who was pictured in a horrible scene after the bombing, is being harassed by Russians. They accuse her of allegedly being paid for a photo shoot at a maternity hospital because she was a blogger and a model before the war. It is impossible to read the comments of Russians under the photos of the bombed maternity hospital. They are so imbued with cynicism and hatred. These people really live in a distorted world and consider all the horrors of the war in Ukraine to be propaganda staging.
