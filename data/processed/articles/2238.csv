michael barbaro

From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. As Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine enters its second day, the people of Ukraine are starting to come to terms with the reality that the unthinkable has actually happened. Today, my colleague Anton Troianovski explains the significance of this moment. And Sabrina Tavernise, Lynsea Garrison, and Michael Schwirtz speak to Ukrainians about the agonizing decisions that they now must make.

[music]

It’s Friday, February 25. Anton, we are talking to you on Thursday night in Moscow. We are coming to the end of day one of this invasion. Help us wrap our heads around what’s happening and the significance of what we’re all witnessing. Because even if we’ve been hearing warnings about this for weeks, it’s hard to believe that we’re now experiencing a full scale attack on Ukraine by Russia.

anton troianovski

Yeah. It is really hard to believe. It’s the biggest attack of one nation on another nation in Europe since World War II. It is really kind of the worst case scenario of all those scenarios of a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine that have been discussed. It’s something that I’ve spent just about every day writing about this crisis for the last two months or so. And honestly, even until yesterday I didn’t think that this could actually happen. It’s Europe’s most powerful military, bearing, basically, its entire firepower, much of its firepower against the neighboring country. So since about 5:00 AM, we have seen cruise missile, ballistic missile strikes against infrastructure targets, military targets in Ukraine. Then during the day, today, we started seeing footage coming in of helicopter assaults, of paratroopers landing, of tanks rolling across the border. And this is happening from 3 sides, from the North, Belarus, from the East, Russia, from the South, from the Black Sea in Crimea. It started, what, like 18 hours ago or so, and it’s still very hard to just wrap our heads around the magnitude of what’s happening.

michael barbaro

And what do we understand to be the end goal here at this point?

anton troianovski

Well, Putin laid it out quite clearly in his early morning speech. He said, our goal is to demilitarize and de-Nazify, in his words, Ukraine.

michael barbaro

And just explain that because—

anton troianovski

Yeah.

michael barbaro

De-nazification is not a familiar phrase in 2022.

anton troianovski

Exactly. And I mean, I will say, until recently, it hasn’t been a familiar phrase in Russia either. But the Kremlin in their propaganda they consider the democratically elected government of Ukraine a Nazi regime. They claim falsely that it has perpetrated a genocide on Russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine. And so Putin is trying to claim the moral high ground here. He is saying he’s going in to remove this evil regime. And what that means is this is a full scale military assault to topple the government, most likely, of another country. This is just a massive undertaking that we’re only seeing the beginnings of.

michael barbaro

So we’re talking about a sovereign nation in Europe being attacked by another European nation. And its democratically elected leadership being, by what you just described, deposed. And these are developments that are unheard of in modern Europe. So how should we think about that?

anton troianovski

Yeah. I think it’s really the end of a certain post-Cold War order in Europe. It’s the end of 30 years of Russia trying to find a place in that kind of Western led order. It’s the end of 20 years of Putin trying to use diplomacy as well as his kind of hybrid warfare tactics to try to further his interests in Europe. That’s all gone now. We’re in a new reality now, where Russia is showing it is prepared to fight a large land war in Europe to achieve what it describes to be its aims. It’s just a totally different world that we’re in now.

michael barbaro

Well, so let’s talk about the consequences of that for all involved.

anton troianovski

Yeah. I mean, I would break it up into a few different parts, the consequences for Ukraine, for Russia, for Europe, and the U.S., and the rest of the world. So starting with Ukraine. This is just the beginning, I fear. If this continues, if this continues the way we think it’s going to, to Putin pursuing regime change, it could get much more bloody. So we don’t know yet what happens to the cities. There is a fight for territory going on in Eastern Ukraine, where those separatist regions are. But the big question is, will they go into Kyiv?

michael barbaro

Right.

anton troianovski

Very scarily, it looks like they may well.

michael barbaro

OK. So what about Russia, where you are based? What are the consequences you are seeing and expecting there?

anton troianovski

Well, so people are expecting a new crackdown on civil liberties, on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, even on business. The reason being that whenever we’ve had crackdowns here in Russia, the justification has always been that the Kremlin is hunting down internal enemies, who are serving some kind of foreign agenda to destabilize the country. So that’s certainly one thing to watch over the coming days and weeks is how much of an additional crackdown is there.

protesters [CHANTING]

anton troianovski

Tonight, we had pretty significant anti-war protests—

protesters [CHANTING]

anton troianovski

—in Moscow, and St. Petersburg, and in a number of cities in Siberia all told several thousand people were in the streets and there were more than 1,500 arrests. So—

michael barbaro

Wow.

anton troianovski

—one thing that’s very important to point out is, there has been next to no outpouring of support for this. And there is a lot of anger, disbelief, fear to see your country inflicting so much suffering on a neighboring country is awful, and this narrative for why it was necessary to do it. It really does fall apart quite quickly upon inspection. Why— How does Ukraine actually threaten Russia? Can it really be true that the Ukrainians were planning an invasion of these pro-Russian separatist areas in the East just as 150,000 plus troops were surrounding Ukraine on three sides? There’s just so much in the Kremlin propaganda narrative that doesn’t hold up, that I think a lot of people aren’t buying that story.

michael barbaro

OK. Finally, let’s talk about the consequences for the United States and for the rest of the world.

anton troianovski

So President Biden and the E.U. announced major sanctions today against Russia. And Russia has promised to respond potentially asymmetrically. So we might not see sanctions by Russia against the U.S., but we might see Russia take other actions that could cause harm and pain in the U.S. And they’re— We can really only speculate what that would be. Some folks are talking about the potential for cyber attacks here in Moscow. There’s been a lot of talk that Russia could base missiles or other military assets in Latin America, to more directly threaten the United States. Russia, obviously, is one of the world’s biggest energy suppliers, especially to Europe. If it were to turn that spigot, that could cause incredible problems for Europeans. So there is so much uncertainty here still, not just in Ukraine, not just in Russia, but really about how this crisis plays out and what it means for the rest of the world.

michael barbaro

And Anton, as you’re preparing to sign-off for the night, I want to return to Ukraine and where this situation leaves its people at this moment.

anton troianovski

I mean, it’s a horrible situation. These are people who— I think there was so little expectation that Russia could actually go ahead with this kind of invasion. And now they are making choices they would never thought they would have to make. Do they stay in Kyiv? Do they try to flee West? Do they try to get out of the country? Do you sleep in the basement? It’s really an unimaginable situation for millions and millions of people right now.

[music]

michael barbaro

Well, Anton, thank you. We’ll talk again soon. Stay safe.

anton troianovski

Thank you.

[music]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

[music]

All day yesterday, my colleagues in Ukraine and back in the U.S. we’re speaking with Ukrainians around the country about their experiences of the past 24 hours.

denis surkov

Hello.

lynsea garrison

Hi. How are you?

denis surkov

Hi, Lynsey. Not good.

lynsea garrison

Not good.

denis surkov

It’s not the same.

michael barbaro

Lynsea Garrison got on the phone with Denis Surkov, who lives in a city called Dnipro in Eastern Ukraine.

denis surkov

I am doctor, Chief of Dnipro Regional Children’s Hospital.

lynsea garrison

You’re a doctor at Dnipro Regional Children’s Hospital.

denis surkov

Yep.

lynsea garrison

OK.

denis surkov

And I am Chief of NICU and I.C.U.

lynsea garrison

Chief of NICU?

denis surkov

Exactly.

lynsea garrison

Got it. Can you just tell me a little bit about what the past 24 hours have been like for you?

denis surkov

So in the morning, we wake up and we have heard, first, rocket explosions near Dnipro Airport. So I was in my hospital. We were nervous. We were confused. Everybody was near their laptops or iPhones.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

And checked the news. And the news were and are dramatic.

lynsea garrison

Dramatic. How were you understanding this? Did you think that this would happen?

denis surkov

Honestly, no. We were expected for the beginning of the attack, but we didn’t know that it could be so, so fast, so right now. And now, the borders between Ukrainian regions are closed. We had some possibilities and some efforts to go last week.

lynsea garrison

OK.

denis surkov

I can’t explain, but something stopped us. We hoped that finally everything will resolve. But now, honestly, I don’t know exactly what to do.

lynsea garrison

What do you think stopped you?

denis surkov

My family didn’t want to leave Ukraine because we love Ukraine, and we wanted to live here happy and in peace, and so on. So I said, OK, maybe everything will be not so bad. Let’s wait. So my main question for myself is, if I made a very, very big mistake not to move from Ukraine when I had an opportunity to do this.

lynsea garrison

That’s a heavy question.

denis surkov

Yes. If there was a big mistake or not so big, and I have no answer. I can ask you, do you want to wake up in the morning and understand you should go forever, not for one day, not for two days, forever? Can you make such a decision in— I don’t know, in 10 minutes? My question to you.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

To bring just a bit of water, just a bit of food, single cloth, documents, money, and go outside your home forever, can you make such a decision? Just imagine.

lynsea garrison

Yeah.

denis surkov

So this was my family feeling last week. Even though yesterday in the evening, I told to my wife that this is the last calm day we can evacuate. In the morning, we realized that war came to Ukraine, not conflict, not disturbs, war, conventional war.

lynsea garrison

What are your children asking you? Like, how are you talking about this with them?

denis surkov

I say to my children, everything will be OK, your father will care about you.

lynsea garrison

How old are they?

denis surkov

My elder daughter is 30 and she lives abroad. And my younger daughter, she is 14. She’s with me.

lynsea garrison

How is she doing?

denis surkov

She believed me.

lynsea garrison

That you’ll protect her? And how does that make you feel that she believes you?

denis surkov

I will do all I can to protect her. I don’t know exactly what, but I will do everything, everything can.

lynsea garrison

Are you worried it won’t be enough?

denis surkov

I am worried. Everything could be changed, I don’t know, next few hours or even next few maybe minutes.

sabrina tavernise It’s 3:30 and we’re driving in Central Kyiv, and this is just a closed town right now. The day is still very gray. The sky is very low. Feels sort of raw, and cold, and wet. The air has a kind of bitter smell of ordinance. It’s the smell of the air after an air strike. Someone carrying a gun and some body armor down the street. A very sweet little bakery, I’m going to come in. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 10 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] sabrina tavernise Yeah.

sabrina tavernise OK. Back to the hotel. Everything is closed now. It’s almost as if it was nighttime. A few cars are still going by, but almost no pedestrians. It’s very central. The street is just completely deserted.

[music]

It does feel ominous.

michael schwirtz Day one of the war it’s been a very long day. The town I’m in, Slovyansk, kind of continued on as normal. There were bits of panic that could be evident. There were lines at the A.T.M.s. And people were stocking up on medications. But overall, the mood was pretty calm and collected, probably because these people have been through this before, the town came under heavy attack in 2014 when Ukrainian forces clashed with Russian backed rebels who had come in from the East. And so when I’m walking around town, people are telling me that this is just part of their lives. Very few people I met around town today said that they had any intention of leaving even though rocket attacks hit an airport nearby and Russian forces were fighting with the Ukrainian military just a few dozen kilometers away. lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz I met a woman named Lera Alekseevna, who was in the courtyard near my hotel. Oh, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And she had stuffed her pet hairless cat in her jacket and it was shivering. lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And she was telling me how she was planning on going to work at a company that sells cash registers and bringing her animals with her, so that they wouldn’t have to be alone. So if she had to make a quick dash for it, she could be with her animals. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz But she said she had no intention of leaving, mostly out of fear that she would be forced to leave behind her pets. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lera alekseevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Outside a blood bank in Slovyansk, I met a young man named Bogdan Kravchenko,

[non-english singing]

who was just sitting in his car listening to the Ukrainian national anthem cranked up on high volume.

bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He had just gone and donated blood. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And he said he wasn’t panicked, but he said that he was acting according to the situation and that things had only just begun. bogdan kravchenko [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] I walked up to a base of the National Guard Unit here in Slovyansk. And out front there were a few couples, men dressed in drab green uniforms, and women— all of them were being sent off. The men, they were all being sent off somewhere. Some of them said they couldn’t tell me where they were being sent. Some of them admitted that they didn’t even know. I met one couple, Yelena and Eugenia. Yelena had brought Eugenia, her husband, some clothes that he was going to take with him on his deployment wherever he was headed. Another couple just held each other for what seemed like 15, 20, 30 minutes, just held each other on the street in the sun ahead of whatever deployment this young man was being sent on. speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 12 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz You both [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 11 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And then, I met Lyubov Vasilyevna, a 75-year-old pensioner, she was carrying a bag filled with newly purchased loaves of bread. And she said she had spent her last bit of cash on. And was waiting in line at an A.T.M., it would appear that there was no cash left. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz All she wanted, she said, was to live in peace in her native Donbass, which is what this Eastern region is called. lyubov vasilavna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And then, she paused and recited a poem that she said she wrote 2 years ago. It was supposed to be evocative, the piece that she was looking for. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And I’ll read that poem that I translated from the Russian into English. I’m so looking forward to peace, but it is coming to us so slowly. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz We still have a little patience. Peace is close at hand, and we’re waiting for it to arrive without gunfire, without blood. Enough has been spilled in Donbass. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Let the sun smile, and the sky brighten, and the children smile. Let it go in a black moment. There will be peace for all. And people will say, god hurt us. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz Let all stormy skies leave us. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Donbass [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz And hail Donbass and the city of Slovyansk. lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael schwirtz [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] lyubov vasilyevna [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

sabrina tavernise It’s 11:30 AM on Friday in Kyiv. Last night, in the city there were a lot of airstrikes and it seems like they’re getting closer. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 13 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] sabrina tavernise [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

[music]

The airstrikes are beginning again. You can hear the siren. We’re trying to decide whether to leave. Our colleagues, a few of them drove out this morning because it’s really unclear what’s going to happen. Will there be a big fight with the Ukrainian military? Or will the Russians just come in? What will happen if they take the city? And it seems like that is imminent. So we’re trying to make arrangements. Our hotel doesn’t have a generator, which means we would be out of power if the power gets cut off in the city, which is a pretty good chance. Yeah. We’re trying to figure it out. I guess, like a lot of people here, we’re trying to make that decision. Should we leave or should we stay?

As of Friday afternoon in Kyiv, Ukrainian officials were bracing for an attack on the capital city as Russia’s military offenses pressed closer to the heart of the government.

Any provocation. Any flare-up -- one that could burn everything.”

In a late-night televised speech, Zelensky spoke Russian to “address Russian citizens as a citizen of Ukraine,” according to the BBC.

Update 4:25 p.m. EST Feb. 23: White House press secretary Jen Psaki called reports that rebels in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday asked Russia for military assistance in response to Ukrainian “aggression” an example of one of Russia’s “false flag operations” aimed at providing the pretext to go to war.

“As we’ve said from the beginning, there are going to be a range of false flag operations,” Psaki said. “This is an example of it. That is suggesting that they feel under threat -- by whom? The Ukrainians that the Russians are threatening to attack?”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said rebel chiefs contacted Russian President Vladimir Putin to say that shelling by the Ukrainian military had claimed civilian lives and forced people to flee, The Associated Press reported. Both Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian officials have accused each other of shelling in recent weeks as tensions between Russia and Ukraine have continued to rise.

Update 3:55 p.m. EST Feb. 23: Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said officials believe that additional Russian forces were moving Wednesday into the so-called Dunetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine in anticipation of military action.

“We continue to see (Russian President Vladimir Putin) form his capabilities in such a way that leads us to believe that we are potentially close to some sort of action,” Kirby said at a news conference. “What we see is that Russian forces continue to assemble closer to the border and put themselves in an advanced stage of readiness to act, to conduct military action in Ukraine ... at virtually anytime now.”

He stressed that officials don’t know exactly what action Putin plans to take or when he will take it.

“We believe that they are ready,” Kirby said. “I’ll just leave it at that.”

President Joe Biden said Tuesday that more than 150,000 Russian troops were surrounding Ukraine.

Update 3 p.m. EST Feb. 23: Ukraine’s parliament voted Wednesday to approve a state of emergency for the country, according to The Associated Press and The Guardian.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's parliament votes to declare a state of emergency after Russia recognized two separatist regions as independent. — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) February 23, 2022

The decree will take effect Thursday and last 30 days, The Guardian reported.

Update 2 p.m. EST Feb. 23: President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced sanctions on the company that built the 750-mile Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Germany and Russia.

Biden said the sanctions will apply to Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers. They were announced one day after German officials said they had halted the Nord Stream 2 project following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to sign a decree recognizing a pair of breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.

“These steps are another piece of our initial tranche of sanctions in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine,” Biden said in a statement. “As I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate.”

Update 1:45 p.m. EST Feb. 23: A senior U.S. defense official in Washington says the Russian forces arrayed along Ukraine’s borders are “as ready as they can be” for an invasion, if ordered to launch it.

U.S. authorities have estimated that Russia has more than 150,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders with Russia and Belarus.

About 80% of those forces are now in “what we would consider forward positions, ready to go,” the official said, adding that they are within 5 to 50 kilometers (3 to 31 miles) of the border. The official added “we still cannot confirm that Russian forces have moved into the Donbas (a rebel-held area in eastern Ukraine).”

The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the information.

The official said the U.S. has indications — based on intelligence as well as visual evidence — that “they (Russian forces) have advanced their readiness to a point where they are literally ready to go now, if they get the order to go.”

Update 1:20 p.m. EST Feb. 23: The U.S. and U.K. believe that an attack by Russia on Ukraine is imminent, according to multiple reports published Wednesday.

An unidentified U.S. official told Newsweek that authorities contacted Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zalensky to warn that U.S. intelligence indicated it was “highly likely” that Russia would launch an invasion of Ukraine “within 48 hours.” The Guardian reported that officials in the United Kingdom also shared the belief that an attack would be launched in the coming days.

Similar claims of an imminent invasion have failed to come to fruition in recent weeks, prompting Ukrainian officials to view the warnings with some caution, according to CNN and The Guardian.

In an off-camera briefing at the Pentagon on Wednesday, a senior U.S. Defense Department official told CNN that Russian President Vladimir Putin had amassed nearly “100% of all the forces that we anticipated that he would move in.”

Update 12:45 p.m. EST Feb. 23: European Union sanctions against Russia have come into effect.

They are the first steps in a planned series of retaliatory measures devised to be cranked up if Russian President Vladimir Putin orders an attack or pushes his troops deeper into Ukraine.

The sanctions that took effect Wednesday targeted senior Russian government officials, several companies and hundreds of lawmakers who voted in favor of recognizing the independence of separatist parts of southeast Ukraine.

The sanctions are mostly a freeze on the assets of those listed and a ban on them traveling in the 27-nation EU.

The measures come on top of a slew of economic and other sanctions slapped on Russia since it annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

Those sanctions already targeted Russia’s financial, energy and defense sectors, as well as goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes.

Update 11:10 a.m. EST Feb. 23: Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation said officials were dealing Wednesday with a mass cyberattack targeting government websites and several banks.

In a post on Telegram, Mykhailo Fedorov said the DDoS, or distributed denial of service, attack began around 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. EST) and targeted the websites of the Ukrainian parliament, Cabinet and foreign ministry. He said they also caused interruptions or delays on the sites of the defense and internal affairs ministry, which controls the police.

Officials worked Wednesday to restore the affected services.

The incident marked the second in days in which the Ukrainian government was targeted by a large-scale DDoS attack, Politico reported. Officials earlier said that they have seen warnings online stating that hackers planned to launch attacks on government agencies, banks and the defense sector, according to BBC News.

NATO has blamed recent cyberattacks in Ukraine on Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency and warned further attacks were likely as tensions over a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine mounted.

Update 10:50 a.m. EST Feb. 23: Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that he was disappointed with the U.S. and NATO in a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

In a statement issued by the Kremlin, officials said Putin and Erdogan spoke about the “theme of the development of long-term legal guarantees of the security of the Russian Federation.”

“In this context, Vladimir Putin expressed his disappointment with the reaction of the United States and NATO, which amounted to an attempt to ignore legitimate Russian concerns and demands,” the statement read.

Officials with Erdogan’s office told Reuters that the Turkish president told Putin that military conflict in the area would not benefit anyone.

“President Erdogan, who renewed his call for the matter to be resolved through dialogue, stated that it was important to bring diplomacy to the forefront, and that (Turkey) continued its constructive stance in NATO as well,” officials said, according to Reuters.

Update 10:15 a.m. EST Feb. 23: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked Wednesday for “immediate” security guarantees from the West and Moscow as the threat from Russia continued to loom, according to The Guardian.

Speaking at a joint media appearance with the leaders of Poland and Lithuania, the newspaper reported that Zelensky said he has tried to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate amid the ongoing tensions.

“Ukraine needs security guarantees. Clear, specific, and immediate,” he said, according to The Guardian. “I believe that Russia must be among those countries giving clear security guarantees.”

Tensions have risen between Ukraine and Russia in recent weeks. On Monday, Russia began what the U.S. characterized as the start of an invasion of Ukraine when Putin acknowledged a pair of separatist regions in the eastern part of the country. On Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said more than 150,000 Russian troops were surrounding Ukraine.

Update 9:20 a.m. EST Feb. 23: Russian officials on Wednesday called sanctions on the country announced one day earlier by U.S. President Joe Biden “ineffective and counterproductive from the point of view of American interests.”

In a statement issued by the country’s foreign ministry, officials called the sanctions part of “Washington’s ongoing attempts to change Russia’s course.”

“Russia has proved that, with all the sanctions costs, it is able to minimize the damage,” the statement read. “And even more so, sanctions pressure is not able to affect our determination to firmly defend our interests.”

Officials said they remained open to diplomacy “based on principles of mutual respect, equality and consideration of each other’s interests.”

“There should be no doubt that sanctions will be given a strong response, not necessarily symmetrical, but measured and sensitive for the American side,” the statement read.

Biden announced what he called the “first tranche” of sanctions on Russia one day after the country’s president, Vladimir Putin, acknowledged a pair of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine. The sanctions target Russian banks and oligarchs.

Update 8:07 a.m. EST Feb. 23: Russia’s state-run media agency, Tass, is reporting that Russia has begun to evacuate its diplomatic personnel from Ukraine, according to The Associated Press.

Update 7:05 a.m. EST Feb. 23: Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council said Wednesday that it is asking the country’s parliament to declare a 30-day state of emergency, which could later be extended, CNN is reporting.

Lawmakers are expected to approve the move, which would apply to all areas except for Donetsk and Luhansk, within the next 48 hours, according to the news outlet.

Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry urged citizens to refrain from traveling to Russia, The Guardian reported. Any Ukrainians currently in Russia should leave immediately, officials said.

Update 5:20 a.m. EST Feb. 23: In his general audience Wednesday, Pope Francis said his “heart aches” over the worsening situation in Ukraine.

“Despite the diplomatic efforts of the last few weeks, increasingly alarming scenarios are opening up,” the pope said, according to a readout on the Vatican’s website. “Like me, many people all over the world are feeling anguish and concern. Once again, the peace of all is threatened by partisan interests. I would like to appeal to those with political responsibility to examine their consciences seriously before God, who is the God of peace and not of war; who is the Father of all, not just of some, who wants us to be brothers and not enemies. I pray that all the parties involved refrain from any action that would cause even more suffering to the people, destabilising coexistence between nations and bringing international law into disrepute.”

He also called for everyone to “dedicate themselves intensely to prayer and fasting” for peace on March 2, Ash Wednesday.

“May the Queen of Peace preserve the world from the madness of war,” he said, according to the readout.

Second day of prayer and fasting for peace in #Ukraine called for by Pope Francis in two months: next one will be Ash Wednesday, March 2.

Update 5 a.m. EST Feb. 23: In a video statement Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he remains open to diplomacy, CNN is reporting.

“We can see the difficult international situation and the threats posed by current challenges, such as the erosion of the arms control system and NATO’s military activities. And yet, Russia’s appeals to build a system of equal and indivisible security that would reliably defend all countries, remain unanswered,” Putin said in the message, which was released for Russia’s Defender of the Fatherland holiday.

“Our country is always open to a direct and honest dialogue and ready to search for diplomatic solutions to the most complicated issues,” the statement continued. “But I want to repeat that Russia’s interests and the security of our people are an indisputable priority. So, we will continue to strengthen and modernise our Army and Navy, striving to increase their effectiveness, so they are fitted out with the most cutting-edge equipment.”

Meanwhile, Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Western nations to continue to impose sanctions on Russia, according to The Guardian.

“First decisive steps were taken yesterday, and we are grateful for them,” Kuleba tweeted Wednesday. “Now the pressure needs to step up to stop Putin. Hit his economy and cronies. Hit more. Hit hard. Hit now.”

Ukrainian lawmakers also voted to approve sanctions on more than 350 Russians, including restrictions on entering the country and accessing assets, The Guardian reported.

Update 1 a.m. EST Feb. 23: Australia and Japan have announced new sanctions against Russia.

According to The Associated Press, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday said the country will impose sanctions and travel bans targeting eight members of the Russian Security Council. Australia also will expand its previous sanctions to include two Russian banks, the AP reported.

Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced Wednesday that Japan will ban the new issuance and distribution of Russian bonds in the country, according to the news outlet. In addition, Japan will ban trade with Donetsk and Luhansk – the two Ukrainian rebel regions – as well as suspend the issuance of visas and freeze the assets of people linked to those areas, the AP reported.

6,b1890af8-22ec-45a6-bd1b-02a6e14f49d1,[],,"US President Joe Biden will nominate federal appeals court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, according to a person familiar with the matter, making her the first Black woman selected to serve on a court that once declared her race unworthy of citizenship and endorsed segregation.

In Jackson, Biden delivers on a campaign promise to make the historic appointment and to further diversify a court that was made up entirely of white men for almost two centuries. He has chosen an attorney who would be the high court’s first former public defender, though she also possesses the elite legal background of other justices.

Jackson would be the current court’s second Black justice — Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative, is the other — and just the third in history.

The news was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss it before the president’s official announcement later today.

She would also be only the sixth woman to serve on the court, and her confirmation would mean that for the first time four women would sit together on the nine-member court.

The current court includes three women, one of whom is the court’s first Latina, Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

Jackson would join the liberal minority of a conservative-dominated court that is weighing cutbacks to abortion rights and will be considering ending affirmative action in college admissions and restricting voting rights efforts to increase minority representation.

Biden is filling the seat that will be vacated by Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, who is retiring at the end of the term this summer.

Jackson, 51, once worked as one of Breyer’s law clerks early in her legal career. She attended Harvard as an undergraduate and for law school, and served on the US Sentencing Commission, the agency that develops federal sentencing policy, before becoming a federal judge in 2013.

Her nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority by a razor-thin 50-50 margin with Vice President Kamala Harris as the tie-breaker. Party leaders have promised swift but deliberate consideration of the president’s nominee.

The next justice will replace one of the more liberal justices, so she would not tip the balance of the court, which now leans 6-3 in favor of conservatives.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-february-25-2022/
7,b1890af8-22ec-45a6-bd1b-02a6e14f49d1,[],,"In an address to the US nation, Biden assails Putin and accuses him of a “flagrant violation of international law.”

Recounting the intelligence his administration has been declassifying and sharing with US allies over the past few weeks, as Russia geared up for war, Biden says, “We’ve been transparent with the world… so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.”

He accuses the Russian leader of planning the invasion for a long time and of lying to create pretexts for his actions in Ukraine.

“Putin is the aggressor, Putin chose this war,” Biden says, predicting that the Russian leader “will be a pariah on the international stage.”

“He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to reestablish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is all about,” he charges.

The US president, whose address comes after a meeting earlier today with leaders of the G7 group of nations, warns that powerful sanctions will exact a “severe cost” from Russia’s economy, “both immediately and over time.”

“We’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well over half of the global economy,” he says. “We’re in full and total agreement. We will limit… Russia’s ability to participate in the global economy.”

Watch live as I deliver remarks on Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine. https://t.co/fsc84Sq6F6 — President Biden (@POTUS) February 24, 2022

He says the steps imposed in coordination with Europe will block top Russian banks from the US financial system and “cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.”

The penalties fall in line with the White House’s insistence that it will look to hit Russia’s financial system and Putin’s inner circle, while also imposing export controls that aim to starve Russia’s industries and military of US semiconductors and other high-tech products.

But Biden, for now, holds off on imposing some of the most severe sanctions, including cutting Russia out of the SWIFT payment system, which allows for the transfers of money from bank to bank around the globe, or Russia’s energy sector.

On the military front, he vows to defend “every inch” of NATO territory, but reaffirms that no American troops will be deployed to Washington’s ally.

“As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with a full force of American power,” Biden says.

The president adds, however: “Our forces will not be engaged in a conflict with Russia in Ukraine.”
