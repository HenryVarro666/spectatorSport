Shelling can be heard across parts of Ukraine as Russia has begun its military action. In Odesa, Ukrainian's are packing up and leaving to seek shelter elsewhere.

A MARTINEZ, HOST:

Russia has invaded Ukraine. Ukraine's president says Ukrainian troops are currently fighting Russian forces that are trying to capture the former nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. Russia tanks have also rolled into the country from Belarus. And in many cities across Ukraine, residents woke to the sounds of shelling and air raid sirens. Missile strikes were reported in the capital city of Kyiv, as well as in other cities near the Russian border and in the southern port city of Odesa. That is where NPR's Frank Langfitt has been reporting for the last couple of days.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Walk us through what happened this morning in Odesa.

FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Yeah. I mean, just after President Putin declared war - about 5 o'clock local time - and 10 minutes later, we started (inaudible) explosions, which shook the hotel. These were clearly missile strikes. And it's no surprise because Odesa - it's a strategic port. There's a naval base in Odesa, and this is what it sounded like.

(SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)

LANGFITT: And then jets were roaring overhead. You can hear those.

(SOUNDBITE OF JETS FLYING)

LANGFITT: And then, Rachel, just more missile strikes. Now, most people in the hotel where I was staying - some of them actually slept through this, remarkably. But there's a father I ran into in the hallways. His name is Constantine (ph). He's a lawyer. He was trying to get his family out. And this is what he said as we stood, before dawn, and he was there packing his vehicle.

CONSTANTINE: I am scared.

LANGFITT: Yeah.

CONSTANTINE: I am very scared. I am scared for my baby. And the people don't know what do.

LANGFITT: And so, as he was saying there, people don't know what to do. He headed up north, as did we, out of the city because of the airstrikes. And he's going to be driving hundreds of miles today, west to the city of Lviv, which is near the Polish border, and then be able to settle in there, a place much safer.

MARTIN: What do we know about the damage so far?

LANGFITT: I think it's considerable. But I think what's really striking is the Russian military has come in from three different directions. It is pushing into the Kyiv region, according to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. So it's rolling along, apparently. In the Odesa region, there's a strike on a military base. They killed 18 people, according to the regional (inaudible) there. And there were also additional missile strikes in other strategic ports - Mykolaiv and Kherson - both of them in the Black Sea area.

MARTIN: I mean, Ukrainians have been living under the threat of this for so long now. Even so, it must be a shock.

LANGFITT: I think it was. I mean, it was really striking last night in Odesa, as I was - it was lovely, quiet night, and I went out to dinner and wanted to stroll around, but I was tired and headed back. But it was just a normal night in Odesa, and it is like flipping a switch when this happens. And so a lot of people didn't think it would, even though there have been lots of threats. And so as we made our way north, we just saw more and more people driving north - long lines at gas stations. I was in a gas station trying to get some food and ran into a guy named Sergey (ph), who had jumped on his motorcycle and headed north to try to find a place for him to live and his parents. And this is what he said.

SERGEY: So I left my parents behind, but they will be coming after me when - you know, when I settle everything down, when we know where to go.

MARTIN: And you can imagine all different versions of him - you know, people trying to leave. So, Frank...

LANGFITT: Tens of thousands.

MARTIN: Tens of thousands.

LANGFITT: Yeah.

MARTIN: You spent a lot of time in the capital city. What is the sense in political and intelligence circles about Putin's ultimate objective here?

LANGFITT: Well, I think that, you know, Putin has said Russia doesn't want to occupy Ukraine. Of course, he also said for months he didn't want to invade. Either way, it is a huge country - 41 million people. The widespread thought is what he really wants to do here is change the regime or change the politics of the regime, even if it could involve killing political leaders. And the reason is, Ukraine shares this huge border with Russia. Ukraine has been drifting west towards NATO and the European Union for many years. And people think Putin really wants to stop this and use his army to redraw the geopolitical map of Europe, that after the collapse of the Soviet Union was very (inaudible) to Russia. And many of these countries, Ukraine among them, have tilted away from Russia and towards democratic countries in Europe and, of course, ultimately, the U.S.

MARTIN: NPR's Frank Langfitt reporting from Ukraine near the port city of Odesa. Frank, thank you.

LANGFITT: Good to talk, Rachel.

Russian forces invaded Ukraine by land, air, and sea on Thursday morning, in what NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg condemned as a ""brutal act of war.""

People across Ukraine were jolted from their sleep by the sounds of sirens and explosions as Russian airstrikes hit the country's capital and other cities.

Eyewitnesses told Insider that this was their first realization that a full-scale invasion was underway.

—U.S. Embassy Kyiv (@USEmbassyKyiv) February 24, 2022

In Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, the airstrikes started before dawn, and across the city of 3 million people, the sound of explosions, gunfire, and sirens was heard, Reuters reported.

""I woke up at five in the morning to the sounds of the blasts. We all did,"" said Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, a member of the Ukrainian parliament with the European Solidarity Party, speaking to Insider from her home in Kyiv.

Bryan Stern from Project Dynamo, an American group helping to evacuate American, Canadian, and UK citizens from Ukraine, said his ""entire room shook"" when a missile landed near his hotel room in downtown Kyiv. ""It was pretty intense,"" he added.

Witnesses also described missile blasts in other cities, including Kramatorsk, Dnipro, and Odesa, reports said.

Minutes after President Vladimir Putin announced a military operation on Thursday morning, The New York Times reported, explosions were visible in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.

Makama Ezekial, a South African living in Kharkiv, said the ""crashing sounds"" of missiles exploding made him jump out of bed. Ezekial said he immediately went to find his children because he was afraid for their safety.

His children were fine. But Reuters reported that emergency services said a boy was killed in Kharkiv after shelling struck an apartment complex.

In Odesa, a picturesque tourist hub in the southwest of Ukraine, a local journalist said he heard ""roughly 20 rockets"" explode near his home on Thursday morning.

""Then we saw the smoke from the balcony,"" said Ugo Poletti, the editor in chief of The Odessa Journal.

But despite the ""scary scenario,"" Poletti said the citizens of Odesa appeared to be ""quite calm.""

Yosri Lahouar, a Tunisian living in Ukraine, was also struck by the calmness of the locals in Odesa.

A missile landed about 10 meters away from Lahouar's apartment, he said. He immediately grabbed his backpack and ran out to the streets to find shelter as smoke engulfed him, he said.

Then 10 minutes later, he continued, there was another explosion nearby. ""I was on the ground, and I started to cry,"" he said.

Lahouar said his reaction stood out from the crowd. ""When I looked around, everyone was walking around normally, like nothing had happened,"" he said. ""I was surprised.""

The explosions, Lahouar added, were a moment of clarity for him. He said, ""At first, I was one of the voices who thought that war would never happen."" But as of this morning, he said, he had to come to terms with the fact that he was living in a ""war zone.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-invades-ukraine-eyewitnesses-to-bombing-of-kyiv-odessa-kharkiv-2022-2

6,2ba3f953-345d-4792-8760-0210dd8a7dee,[],,"Odessa or Odesa is an international city in Ukraine and a major seaport and transportation hub located on the northwestern shore of the Black Sea. Odessa is also an administrative centre of the Odessa Oblast and a multiethnic major cultural centre. Odessa is the third most populous city in Ukraine and is alternatively known as the ""pearl of the Black Sea, ""the ""South Capital"" (under the Russian Empire and Soviet Union), and ""Southern Palmyra"".

The predecessor of Odessa, a small Tatar settlement, was founded by Haci I Giray, the Khan of Crimea, in 1440 and originally named after him as ""Hacibey"". After a period of Lithuanian control, it passed into the domain of the Ottoman Sultan in 1529 and remained in Ottoman hands until the Ottoman Empire's defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1792.

In 1794, the city of Odessa was founded by a decree of the Empress Catherine the Great. From 1819 to 1858, Odessa was a free port. During the Soviet period it was the most important port of trade in the Soviet Union and a Soviet naval base. On 1 January 2000, the Quarantine Pier at Odessa Commercial Sea Port was declared a free port and free economic zone for a period of 25 years.

During the 19th century, it was the fourth largest city of Imperial Russia, after Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Warsaw. Its historical architecture has a style more Mediterranean than Russian, having been heavily influenced by French and Italian styles. Some buildings are built in a mixture of different styles, including Art Nouveau, Renaissance and Classicist.

Odessa is a warm-water port. The city of Odessa hosts both the Port of Odessa and Port Yuzhne, a significant oil terminal situated in the city's suburbs. Another notable port, Illichivsk, is located in the same oblast, to the south-west of Odessa. Together they represent a major transport hub integrating with railways. Odessa's oil and chemical processing facilities are connected to Russian and European networks by strategic pipelines.

Odessa

Overlay image (Before and After)

This week, our tour of European cities takes us over the major city of Odessa in the south of central Ukraine, which is capital of Odessa administrative region. Odessa is the main trading and fishing port of the country and its harbour is kept open all year round, with the use of ice-breakers in winter. It is also a major industrial city, a cultural centre (with several museums and theatres, and an opera house), and owing to its milder climate, a popular resort.

The city being a rail junction helps Odessa with some of its exports:

Petroleum

Processed food

Fertiliser

Chemicals

Plastics

Pharmaceuticals

Machinery

Clothing

Odessa also is a centre for higher learning, with a university, polytechnic, medical schools, marine academy and a music conservatory.

A colony from ancient Greece may have occupied the site of the city once, and Crimean Tatars traded there in the 14th century. Odessa itself was founded in 1794 as a Russian naval fortress on territory annexed from Turkey in 1792. By the early 19th century, the Russian settlement had become an important grain port.

During the Crimean War, Odessa was bombarded by both French and British naval forces. In 1905, the city was the site of a workers' uprising; supported by the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin. Odessa suffered heavy damage during The Second World War, when it was occupied from 1941 to 1944 by German and Romanian forces. During the occupation, many civilians were killed by the occupying forces.

These images were acquired by the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites over thirty-one years and aims to show the difference from 1985 until today in Odessa. In these two images, using this comparison, you can see the changing urban development to the west of the city and in the harbour area, where new infrastructure has been built.

Another aim of these images is to promote the opportunity to download Landsat data through the ESA portals, where images captured every day are made available in near real time to the users and the scientific community.

7,2ba3f953-345d-4792-8760-0210dd8a7dee,[],,"Lviv, Ukraine — Ukrainian authorities said Sunday that Russia's military bombed an art school sheltering some 400 people in the embattled port city of Mariupol, where Ukraine's president said an unrelenting Russian siege would be remembered for centuries to come.

It was the second time in less than a week that city officials reported a public building where residents had taken shelter coming under attack. A bomb hit a Mariupol theater with more than 1,300 believed to be inside on Wednesday, local officials said.

There was no immediate word on casualties from the reported strike on the art school, which could not immediately be independently verified. Ukrainian officials have not given an update on the search of the theater since Friday, when they said at least 130 had been rescued.

Mariupol, a strategic port on the Azov Sea, has been under bombardment for at least three weeks and has seen some of the worst horrors of the war in Ukraine. At least 2,300 people have died, some of whom had to be buried in mass graves, and food, water and electricity have run low.

""To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. ""The more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences for it.""

In recent days, Russian forces have battled their way into the city, cutting it off from the Azov Sea and devastating a massive steel plant. The fall of Mariupol would be an important but costly victory for the Russians, whose advance is largely stalled outside other major cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europe since World War II.

In major cities across Ukraine, hundreds of men, women and children have been killed in Russian bombardments, while millions of civilians have raced to underground shelters or fled the country.

In the capital, Kyiv, at least 20 babies carried by Ukrainian surrogate mothers are stuck in a makeshift bomb shelter, waiting for parents to travel into the war zone to pick them up. The infants — some just days old — are being cared for by nurses who cannot leave the shelter because of constant shelling by Russian troops who are trying to encircle the city.

In the hard-hit northeastern city of Sumy, authorities evacuated 71 orphaned babies through a humanitarian corridor, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said Sunday. He said the orphans, most of whom need constant medical attention, would be taken to an unspecified foreign country.

Russian shelling killed at least five civilians, including a 9-year-old boy, in Kharkiv, an eastern city that is Ukraine's second-largest.

The British Defense Ministry said Russia's failure to gain control of the skies over Ukraine ""has significantly blunted their operational progress,"" forcing them to rely on stand-off weapons launched from the relative safety of Russian airspace.

The Russian Defense Ministry said a Kinzhal hypersonic missile hit a Ukrainian fuel depot in Kostiantynivka, a city near Mykolaiv. The Russian military said Saturday that it used a Kinzhal for the first time in combat to destroy an ammunition depot in the Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine.

Russia has said the Kinzhal, carried by MiG-31 fighter jets, has a range of up to about 1,250 miles and flies at 10 times the speed of sound. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Saturday that the U.S. couldn't confirm the use of a hypersonic missile in Ukraine.

Konashenkov said Kalibr cruise missiles launched by Russian warships from the Caspian Sea were also involved in the strike on the fuel depot in Kostiantynivka and were used to destroy an armor repair plant in northern Ukraine.

Unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance has dashed Russian President Vladimir Putin's hopes for a fast victory after he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine on February 24.

While the Kremlin has said Russia is conducting a ""special military operation"" aimed at legitimate targets, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday that ""brutal, savage techniques"" targeting civilians had allowed Moscow's troops to advance.

U.N. bodies have confirmed more than 847 civilian deaths since the war began, though they concede the actual toll is likely much higher. The U.N. says nearly 3.4 million people have fled Ukraine as refugees.

Estimates of Russian deaths vary widely, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands. The reported battlefield deaths of four Russian generals — out of an estimated 20 deployed in Ukraine — suggest an impaired command of the fighting, said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia's security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank.

Russia would need 800,000 troops — almost equal to its entire active-duty military — to control Ukraine in the face of prolonged armed opposition, according to Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank.

""Unless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal — they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation — there will be just constant guerrilla war,"" Clarke said.

Ukraine and Russia have held several rounds of negotiations aimed at ending the conflict, but the neighboring countries remain divided over several issues. Zelenskyy has said he is willing to drop Ukraine's bid to join NATO but wants certain security guarantees from Russia. Moscow is pressing for Ukraine's complete demilitarization.

Evacuations from Mariupol and other besieged cities proceeded along eight of 10 humanitarian corridors that Ukraine and Russia agreed to on Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, and officials said a total of 6,623 people left Kyiv and other cities.

Vereshchuk said planned humanitarian aid for the southern city of Kherson, which Russia seized early in the war, could not be delivered because the trucks were stopped along the way by Russian troops.

Mariupol authorities said Sunday that nearly 40,000 people had left the city in the last week, the vast majority in their own vehicles, despite ongoing air and artillery strikes.

Some Russians also have fled their country amid a widespread crackdown on dissent. Since the invasion of Ukraine started, police have arrested thousands of antiwar protesters, while government agencies have silenced independent media and cut off access to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.

In Ukraine, Zelenskyy on Sunday ordered the activities of 11 political parties with links to Russia to be suspended during the period of martial law. The largest of those parties has 44 out of 450 seats in the country's parliament.

""Activities by politicians aimed at discord and collaboration will not succeed,"" he said in the address.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-bombed-art-school-mariupol/

Late Thursday morning (Thursday evening AEDT), Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cut all diplomatic ties with Russia as one of his advisers said about 40 people had been killed so far in the attack.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called a summit of alliance leaders for Friday, saying Russia had launched war on Ukraine and shattered peace on the European continent.

NATO on Thursday agreed to beef up its land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank near Ukraine and Russia following the invasion.

While some of the alliance's 30 member countries are supplying arms, ammunition and other equipment to Ukraine, NATO as an organisation is not. It will not launch any military action in support of Ukraine.

Video shows Russian military vehicles moving in

Ukrainian border guards released footage on Thursday what they said were Russian military vehicles moving in, and big explosions were heard in the capital Kyiv, Kharkiv in the east and Odesa in the west.

As the Russian military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine's entire air defences in a matter of hours, Ukrainians fled some cities and European authorities declared Ukrainian air space an active conflict zone.

Oleksii Arestovich, an adviser to Mr Zelenskyy, said about 40 people had been killed and several dozen wounded, without specifying whether the casualties included civilians.

World leaders decried the start of a long-anticipated invasion with far-reaching consequences, as global financial markets plunged and oil prices soared.

Russia's actions could cause massive casualties, topple Ukraine's democratically elected government and upend geopolitics and Europe's post-Cold War security balance.

Governments from the US to Asia and Europe readied new sanctions after weeks of failed efforts for a diplomatic solution — but global powers have said they will not intervene militarily to defend Ukraine.

Ukraine cuts diplomatic ties with Russia

Mr Zelenskyy cut diplomatic ties with Moscow and declared martial law, saying Russia has targeted Ukraine's military infrastructure.

He said the Ukrainian authorities would hand weapons to all those willing to defend the country.

""The future of the Ukrainian people depends on every Ukrainian,"" he said, urging all those who can defend the country to come to the Interior Ministry's assembly facilities.

Ukrainians who had long braced for the prospect of an assault were urged to stay home and not to panic even as Ukrainian authorities reported artillery barrages and airstrikes on targets around the country.

After weeks of denying plans to invade, Mr Putin justified his actions in an overnight televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine — a false claim the US had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion.

He accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees.

He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to ""demilitarise"" it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.

The attacks came first from the air, but later Ukrainian border guards released security camera footage showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine's government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea.

Kyiv residents told to stay home

Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko has advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate.

Meanwhile, the mayor of Kharkiv also warned citizens not to leave their homes.

""Please do not leave your homes today. Due to the complicated situation, schools, kindergartens and other institutions do not work today — until the situation becomes clearer,"" Mayor Igor Terekhov said in a Facebook post.

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has urged Australians in Ukraine to ""shelter in place until it's safe to depart"".

China and US have also advised their citizens to shelter in place.

Traffic jams as residents flee capital

However, pictures emerging from Ukraine have shown residents fleeing the capital in droves.

The traffic appears to be significantly banked up.

Residents can also be seen sheltering in underground train stations.

9News reporter Carrie Greenbank was live on air when the air raid sirens began in Kyiv while CNN reporters have also confirmed hearing air raid sirens sounding for several minutes.

""We heard pretty consistent ones [explosions] maybe an hour ago but they have certainly died off,"" Greenbank said.

""We've got a siren that just started.

""We've also just heard the bells tolling at St Michael's Golden Dome Orthdox Church and that was going to be done when Russia invaded Ukraine.""

Greenbank said they hadn't been told about sirens and what they mean.

""There hasn't been a lot of talk about what to do if you hear a siren like this,"" she said.

CNN reporters said the mood is ""remarkably calm"" despite the explosions and air raid sirens.

After the initial explosions in Kyiv, people could be heard shouting in the streets, AP reported.

Then a sense of normality returned, with cars circulating and people walking in the streets as a pre-dawn commute appeared to start in relative calm.

Martial law declared in Ukraine

Mr Zelenskyy has introduced martial law across the country.

In a video address posted on his Facebook, Mr Zelenskyy urged people to stay calm.

""Russia conducted strikes on our military infrastructure and our border guards. There were blasts heard in many cities of Ukraine,"" Mr Zelenskyy said.

""We're introducing martial law on the whole territory of our country.

""Stay at home if you can. We are working. The army is working.

""The whole sector of defense and security is working.

""No panic. We are strong. We are ready for everything.

'C onsequences they have never seen'

In a televised address today, Mr Putin said the invasion comes in response to threats coming from Ukraine.

He warned other countries that any attempt to interfere with the Russian action would lead to ""consequences they have never seen"".

Mr Putin said Russia doesn't have a goal to occupy Ukraine, and that the responsibility for bloodshed lies with the Ukrainian ""regime"".

He accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia's demand to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and offer Moscow security guarantees.

He said the Russian military operation aims to ensure a ""demilitarisation"" of Ukraine.

Mr Putin said that all Ukrainian servicemen who lay down arms will be able to safely leave the zone of combat.

""The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace,"" he said in Russian, hours after declaring a nationwide state of emergency.

""Today I initiated a telephone conversation with the President of the Russian Federation. Silence. Although there should be silence in the Donbas,"" Mr Zelenskyy said.

Meanwhile, the heads of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR), two separatist regions in Ukraine, recently recognised by Russia as independent, formally asked Mr Putin for help repelling the aggression of Ukrainian Armed Forces, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti.

Following this formal appeal to Moscow for military support, he Ukrainian parliament approved Mr Zelenskyy's decree that imposes a nationwide state of emergency.

The decree allows Ukrainian authorities to impose restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organisations ""in the interests of national security and public order"".

He acknowledged that his country faces huge odds without membership in a powerful security alliance like NATO.

""We are self-defending ourselves with the support of our partners. But it's Ukrainians who are dying,"" he said.

Kyiv reported shelling on the frontline in eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed rebels have held territory since 2014.

The Ukrainian military said one of its soldiers was killed and six more were injured.

UN says 100,000 have fled their homes

U.S., EU, Britain and others impose sweeping sanctions

Russian police arrest 1,600 at anti-war protests

KYIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders on three sides on Thursday after Moscow unleashed the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, prompting tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.

After Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war in a pre-dawn televised address, explosions and gunfire were heard through the day in Ukraine's capital and elsewhere in the country, with at least 70 people reported killed.

The assault brought a calamitous end to weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by Western leaders to avert war over Russian demands for a redrawing of post-Cold War security arrangements in Europe.

""This is a premeditated attack,"" U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters at the White House as he unveiled harsh new sanctions, coordinated with allies, against Russian banks, oligarchs and state companies.

""Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,"" he said.

In his address, Putin said he had ordered ""a special military operation"" to protect people, including Russian citizens, subjected to ""genocide"" in Ukraine - an accusation the West calls baseless propaganda.

""And for this we will strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine,"" Putin said. read more

After nightfall, a picture was emerging of fierce fighting across multiple fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy late on Thursday ordered a general mobilization, to be carried out within 90 days, ""to ensure the defence of the state"".

An adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office said Russian forces had captured the Chernobyl former nuclear power plant, just 90 km (60 miles) north of Kyiv. The plant is along the shortest route from the Ukrainian capital to Belarus, where Moscow has staged troops.

There was also fighting at Hostomel airport, just outside Kyiv, where Russian paratroopers landed. A Ukrainian official later said the airfield had been recaptured, while a senior U.S. defence official said Russian forces were advancing closer to Kyiv.

Heavy exchanges of fire were also reported in the regions of Sumy and Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south.

The highway heading west out of Kyiv, home to 3 million people, was choked with traffic across five lanes as residents sought to escape, fearful of bombardments while stuck in their cars.

The U.N. refugee agency said an estimated 100,000 Ukrainians had fled their homes. Thousands were crossing into neighbouring countries, including Romania, Moldova, Poland and Hungary. read more

Some 57 people were killed and 169 were wounded on Thursday, Ukraine's health minister said, while the interior ministry said 13 border guards died when a Russian vessel shelled Ukraine's Zmiinyi Island, south of the Black Sea port of Odessa.

'NEW IRON CURTAIN'

The day began with missiles raining down on targets across Ukraine and reports of troops and armour pouring across the borders from Russia and Belarus to the north and east.

Zelenskiy called on Ukrainians to defend their country and said arms would be given to anyone prepared to fight.

""What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft. This is the sound of a new Iron Curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world,"" Zelenskiy said.

Putin, after referring earlier in his speech to Russia's powerful nuclear arsenal, warned: ""Whoever tries to hinder us... should know that Russia's response will be immediate. And it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history.""

Asked whether that threat was tantamount to threatening Russian use of nuclear weapons, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was indeed understood as such, adding that Putin should also understand that NATO was a nuclear alliance.

Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to defend Ukraine, but Washington has reinforced its NATO allies in the region with extra troops and planes.

After consulting with the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, Biden announced measures to impede Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned enterprises.

Britain also targeted banks, as well as members of Putin's inner circle. European Union leaders said measures would include freezing Russian assets in the 27-nation bloc. read more

China remained out of step, however, rejecting the description of Russia's actions as an ""invasion"". read more

Russia is one of the world's biggest energy producers, and both it and Ukraine are among the top exporters of grain. War and sanctions will disrupt economies around the world already facing a crisis as they emerge from the coronavirus pandemic.

European stocks dived to nine-month lows, but U.S. stocks ended higher after Biden's sanctions announcement. Brent oil earlier surged past $100/barrel for the first time since 2014.

'HANG THEM FROM BRIDGES'

Putin said he did not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and purge it of nationalists, and his endgame remains unclear.

The senior U.S. defence official said Washington believed the invasion was intended to ""decapitate"" Zelenskiy's government. read more

But it is hard to see Ukrainians accepting leadership installed by Moscow.

""I think we must fight all those who invade our country so strongly,"" said one man stuck in traffic trying to leave Kyiv. ""I would hang every single one of them from bridges.""

A democratic nation of 44 million people, Ukraine is Europe's biggest country by area after Russia itself. It voted for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and has recently stepped up efforts to join NATO and the European Union, aspirations that infuriate Moscow. read more

Putin, who denied for months that he was planning an invasion, has called Ukraine an artificial construct carved from Russia by its enemies - a characterisation Ukrainians see as an attempt to erase their more than 1,000-year-old history.

While many Ukrainians, particularly in the east, speak Russian as a native language, virtually all identify themselves as Ukrainian.

There was also some dissent in Russia. Police detained more than 1,600 taking part in anti-war rallies in 53 cities and authorities threatened to block media reports carrying ""false information"". read more

UKRAINIANS FLEE, SUPPORTERS PROTEST

In the southeastern port of Mariupol, near a frontline held by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, local authorities said 26 people were wounded in shelling.

Civilians packed bags. ""We are going into hiding,"" a woman said.

Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, said its forces had downed two Russian helicopters and seven other Russian aircraft and destroyed several Russian trucks, and a platoon from Russia's 74th Motor Rifles Brigade had surrendered. read more

Russia's defence ministry said it had destroyed 83 land-based Ukrainian targets and had achieved all its goals, according to Interfax news agency.

Protests against Russia's invasion were held in Europe and the United States. At a demonstration in New York's Time Square, Ivana Lotoshynski, who was born in Ukraine, urged solidarity with Ukrainians.

""People are losing their lives right now. Ukrainians are fighting against this regime from Russia and it's really devastating,"" she said. ""Today I think everybody is Ukrainian.""
