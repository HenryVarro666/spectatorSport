In a statement March 8, President Biden said he would ban the imports of Russian energy.

“That means that Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports, and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine,” Biden said in a late morning press conference from the White House. “This is a move that has strong bipartisan support in Congress, and I believe, in the country. Americans have rallied to support the Ukrainian people and made it clear that we will not be part of subsidizing Putin’s war.”",https://www.rubbernews.com/war-ukraine/president-biden-announced-russian-oil-embargo

President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that the U.S. will ban imports of oil and gas from Russia.

Biden warned that this could mean even higher prices at the gas pump.

“This is a step that we are taking to inflict further pain on Putin, but there will be costs as well here in the United States,” Biden said from the White House. “I said I will level with the American people from the beginning. When I first spoke to this, I said defending freedom is going to cost. It is going to cost us as well in the United States…Republicans and Democrats alike have been clear that we must do this.”

This decision today is not without costs here at home. Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the pump — and this will drive up costs further.



So, I will take every step we can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home. — President Biden (@POTUS) March 8, 2022

Biden added, “many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us. The United States produces far more oil domestically than all of the European countries combined.”

4,de705be9-90ef-4bd5-863f-2072f2e250a2,['Art Raymond'],2022-03-08 00:00:00,"President Joe Biden announced a U.S. ban on all Russian oil, gas and energy imports Tuesday at a White House press conference and noted the decision is likely to drive already record-level consumer prices even higher.

“Today, I’m announcing the U.S. is targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy,” Biden said. “We’re banning all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy.

“The American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine.”

Biden said international economic sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are pummeling the Russian economy and have helped drive the value of the country’s currency, the ruble, down by 50%.

But Russian energy exports have not, until now, been targeted as a part of sanctions, thanks in large part to Europe’s heavy dependence on Russian energy imports. Biden noted the ban is, for the time being, a unilateral move by the U.S.

“We’re moving forward with this ban understanding that many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us,” Biden said. “This is a step that we’re taking to inflict further pain on Putin, but there will be costs as well here in the U.S.”

Biden said he believes the ban has bipartisan support in Congress and among the American people.

Regular gasoline is $4.09 a gallon at a gas station in Salt Lake City on Monday, March 7, 2022. The average price of gas in the U.S. broke the $4 per gallon line over the weekend for the first time since 2008. Mengshin Lin, Deseret News

Some members of Utah’s congressional delegation applauded the Biden ban but noted more needs to be done on development of domestic energy resources, including in Utah.

The decision is likely to drive further U.S. price increases at the consumer level. On Tuesday, AAA reported the average price of gas in the U.S. reached an all-time high of $4.17, surpassing the previous high of $4.11 set in 2008. The average price per gallon of gas in Utah was $4.01 on Tuesday, according to AAA.

Biden’s move follows pleas by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to U.S. and Western officials to cut off the imports, which had been a glaring omission in the massive sanctions put in place on Russia over the invasion. Energy exports have kept a steady stream of cash flowing to Russia despite otherwise severe restrictions on its financial sector.

The U.S. will be acting alone, but in close consultation with European allies, who are more dependent on Russian energy supplies. The European Union this week will commit to phasing out its reliance on Russia for energy needs as soon as possible, but filling the void without crippling EU economies will likely take some time. Natural gas from Russia accounts for one-third of Europe’s consumption of the fossil fuel. The U.S. does not import Russian natural gas.

Biden also issued a warning to private sector industries that the current circumstances should not be used as an excuse for “excessive price increases” and said as Russia’s aggression is already “costing us all ... it’s not the time for profiteering or price gouging.”

The issue of oil sanctions has created a conflict for the president between political interests at home and efforts to impose costs on Russia. Though Russian oil makes up only a small part of U.S. imports, Biden has said he was reluctant to ban it, cutting into supplies here and pushing gasoline prices higher.

Now that @POTUS has finally consented to halting Russian oil imports, he must follow through with the logical second step and open the tap on America's clean, abundant energy resources.https://t.co/bxxjf5Il12 — Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) March 8, 2022

In a Tweet before Biden spoke Tuesday morning, Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee said Biden needed to follow up the Russian import ban by expanding access to U.S. domestic energy resources.

“Now that @POTUS has finally consented to halting Russian oil imports, he must follow through with the logical second step and open the tap on America’s clean, abundant energy resources,” Lee tweeted.

Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah, called the ban of Russian oil a positive step but said the U.S. “must go even further.”

“It is time to choke Russia’s entire oil and gas industry and take steps to wean Europe off of its reliance on Russia,” he tweeted.

Banning Russian oil and #natgas from the U.S. is a positive step but we must go even further.

Even before the U.S. ban many Western energy companies including ExxonMobil and BP moved to cut ties with Russia and limit imports. Shell, which purchased a shipment of Russian oil this weekend, apologized for the move on Tuesday amid international criticism and pledged to halt further purchases of Russian energy supplies. Preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Department shows imports of Russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in February.

Inflation is at a 40-year peak, fueled in large part by gas prices, and that could hurt Biden heading into the November midterm elections. He said two weeks ago that he wanted “to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.”

U.S. consumers have been feeling plenty of cost-related pain of late and the national average prices for a broad range of goods and services have been on the rise for a month.

Apartment rental costs rose 0.5% in January, the fastest pace in 20 years. Electricity prices surged 4.2% in January alone, the sharpest rise in 15 years, and are up 10.7% from a year earlier. Last month, household furniture and supplies rose 1.6%, the largest one-month increase on record dating to 1967.

Food costs, driven by pricier eggs, cereal and dairy products, increased 0.9% in January. Air fares rose 2.3%. New car prices, which have jumped during the pandemic because of a shortage of computer chips, were unchanged last month but are up 12.2% from a year ago. The surge in new car prices has, in turn, accelerated used car prices; they rose 1.5% in January and are up a dizzying 41% from a year ago.

The U.S. imported 245 million barrels of oil from Russia last year — about 8% of all U.S. oil imports — up from 198 million barrels in 2020. That’s less than the U.S. gets from Canada or Mexico but more than it imported last year from Saudi Arabia.

Steps taken after Zelensky’s appeal

The US President has taken this step after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s appeal to cut imports from America and Western countries. Despite severe restrictions on the financial sectors, energy exports have maintained a steady flow of cash flows into Russia.

At present, the US alone is taking the initiative in this matter, although it will continue to consult with its European allies, which are more dependent on Russian energy supplies. Russia’s natural gas accounts for a third of Europe’s consumption of fossil fuels. The US does not import Russian natural gas.

We are banning all imports of Russian oil and gas. — President Biden (@POTUS) March 8, 2022

The move comes as gas and other energy prices rapidly increase in the U.S. following the Russian invasion.

Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) praised the move Tuesday, while also calling on increasing domestic energy production.

“Great,” Sen. Steve Daines said in a press release. “Now instead of looking to Iran and Venezuela for oil—work with American producers and unleash American energy production!”

“I appreciate President Biden working with our bipartisan coalition to ban imports of Russian oil and gas. This will weaken Putin's regime,” wrote Sen. Jon Tester on Twitter. “Now we've got to increase domestic production and strengthen our energy independence so we can get working families some relief at the pump.”

In recent days both Daines and Tester have pushed for increasing U.S. energy independence, including restarting the Keystone XL pipeline.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy , Russian oil accounted for 7.4% of total U.S. imports between July 2021-December 2021.

Montana Governor Greg Gianforte tweeted Tuesday the state is ready to make America energy secure and independent.

“Our adversaries are the only beneficiaries when we aren't expanding production and supply here at home,” wrote Gianforte.

Biden said the move was made in consultation with NATO and European allies to show a united front against the actions of Russian President Vladamir Putin.

“We’re moving forward with this ban understanding that many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us,” Biden said in his address. “The United States produces far more oil domestically than all of the European countries combined. In fact, we are a net exporter of energy. We can take this step when others cannot.”

Congressman Matt Rosendale criticized Biden, saying the president was not being transparent on the United State’s oil production noting the country had decreased its oil production from 2019 to 2021.

President Biden claimed that the U.S. is producing more oil today than ever before.



Here are the facts:



In 2019, the U.S. produced 12.23 million barrels per day.



In 2021, the U.S. produced 11.2 million barrels per day.



Americans deserve better transparency from the president. — Matt Rosendale (@RepRosendale) March 8, 2022

According to data from the U.S. Department of Energy, in 2021 the country produced 11.2 million barrels of oil a day. In 2019 the U.S. produced 12.2 million barrels a day. That decrease comes after a significant increase over the last 14 years. In 2008, the U.S. was producing 5 million barrels a day, by 2018 the country was producing 10.9 million barrels a day.",https://www.ktvh.com/news/montana-elected-leaders-react-to-biden-banning-russian-oil

President Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on U.S. imports of Russian oil and gas — the latest move to try to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine.

""The United States is targeting the main artery of Russia's economy,"" Biden said. ""That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports, and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine.""

The ban also applies to U.S. imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), products made from oil, and coal. New purchases are to be ceased immediately, but U.S. buyers with existing contracts for Russian energy have 45 days to wind down deliveries.

Biden called the prohibition a critical step to punishing Russian President Vladimir Putin but said as a result, Americans should be prepared to face further price hikes at the pump.

Already, the cost to fuel up has spiked since the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to historic gas prices across the country.

""Defending freedom is going to cost. It's going to cost us as well in the United States,"" Biden said.

Biden pledged to do ""everything I can to minimize Putin's price hike here at home"" and said that lifting environmental regulations would not boost domestic energy production.

Instead, he said that oil and gas companies have leased millions of acres of U.S. land and received permits to drill but have decided not to use them for production.

""They can be drilling right now, yesterday, last week, last year,"" he said.

After Biden's address, a senior White House official said the Biden administration plans to continue working with major energy consumers to consider releasing more emergency reserves — and will continue urging oil producers with spare capacity to produce more oil.

But the move to cut off Russian oil reserves has redoubled the administration's push to wind down Western dependence on fossil fuels altogether.

The official said the United States and allies need to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and transition to more renewable sources of energy to avoid this kind of situation in the future, despite the short-term push to pump more oil.

The ban marks a divergence in U.S. sanctions from those of its allies and partners

Until now, Washington had worked in lockstep with European allies to carve out exceptions to its banking sanctions for energy transactions, recognizing the potential for disruptions to hike prices for consumers.

Biden said he made the decision after communication with U.S. allies, particularly those in Europe, and he realized many of Russia's buyers did not have the energy resources to cut off oil from Moscow.

""We will not be part of subsidizing Putin's war,"" Biden said. ""We can take this step when others cannot.""

Europe imports six times more oil from Russia than the United States does.

The White House had initially resisted the move, saying it was trying to avoid actions that would reduce global energy supplies or push up prices for Western consumers even more. ""We don't have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters last week.

A senior U.S. administration official on Tuesday told reporters that the United States had not asked its allies to adopt a similar ban, but the official declined to say whether allies asked the White House to not take this step.

The cut-off extends to the financial sector as well. Americans are now banned from investing in Russia's energy sector, including through foreign consortiums that may invest in the country.

There was a bipartisan push from Congress for the ban

Even though the United States counts on Russian oil for less than 10% of its imports, those sales were too much for many Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who pushed for the ban — which was among the requests for assistance from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a video call with U.S. lawmakers over the weekend.

""We are going to continue to consult with, continue to convey where our plans, where our discussions are here internally with the Europeans,"" Psaki said on Monday ahead of the announcement. ""But I would look at it through a different prism than past coordinated efforts.""

Oil and gas prices have soared

Oil prices hit a 14-year high on Monday ahead of the announcement, and U.S. gasoline prices have now hit a record. The AAA puts the national average at $4.17 per gallon, topping the previous high of $4.11 in 2008.

Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, inflation — at its highest level in decades — had become the top issue on the minds of voters ahead of elections this November that will determine whether Democrats hold on to their narrow majority in Congress.

""The decision today is not without cost here at home. Putin's war is already hurting American families at the gas pump,"" Biden said Tuesday.

Biden had strong words for oil and gas companies, as well as the financial firms backing them, saying that while energy prices will rise with the ban, it is ""no excuse to exercise excessive price increases or padding profits.""

About the current state of the invasion, Biden said, ""This much is already clear: Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin.""

U.S. officials have talked to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela about energy

American officials have been working behind the scenes to try to boost global energy supplies, starting during the weeks leading up to the invasion. The United States and other major energy consumers also jointly released emergency stocks of oil to try to take the edge off markets.

U.S. officials visited Saudi Arabia to try to urge the kingdom to pump more oil. And talks aimed at reviving the Iran nuclear deal have led to optimism that it could also lead to a resumption in trade for barrels of Iranian oil kept off the market by sanctions.

Over the weekend, U.S. officials took the extraordinary step of visiting Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro — a heavily sanctioned authoritarian leader whom Washington does not even recognize as the country's legitimate president — to talk about energy security. The United States has sanctions blocking dealings with the country's oil company and central banks. Most of Venezuela's remaining oil exports are going to India and China, with help from Russia.",https://www.npr.org/2022/03/08/1085089048/biden-ban-imports-russia-oil
