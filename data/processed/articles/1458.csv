Earlier, the bank’s board of directors held interest rates at 20 percent.

The bank said the doubling in interest rates on Feb. 28, from 9.5 percent, and capital controls curbing the movement of money had helped sustain financial stability in Russia and stop uncontrolled price increases. But the latest inflation data shows that, as of March 11, prices in Russia had risen 12.5 percent from a year earlier.

Russia’s war against Ukraine has led to strict economic sanctions by the United States and Europe, encouraged a large number of Western companies and banks to retreat from the country, and isolated Russia from much of the global financial system.

“The Russian economy is entering the phase of a large-scale structural transformation, which will be accompanied by a temporary but inevitable period of increased inflation,” the Russian central bank said in a statement Friday.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/business/economy/russia-central-bank-economy.html

Italy has offered to help rebuild Mariupol's damaged theater during a call on Friday, according to Ukraine's minister of culture.

Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini wrote on Twitter following his video call with Ukrainian Minister of Culture Oleksandr Tkachenko that the Italian Council of Ministers approved a proposal to provide Ukraine the resources to rebuild the theater on Wednesday.

""Theaters of all countries belong to the whole humanity,"" Franceschini added.

Hundreds of Ukrainians, including many children, were taking shelter inside the theater when it was bombed on Wednesday.

""Minister Franceschini assured that Italy has full solidarity with Ukraine. He expressed support for our state and offered cooperation with our creative teams during the war,"" Tkachenko wrote on Telegram after the call. ""Together, our Ministries in Ukraine and Italy will rebuild the Mariupol Drama Theater immediately after Ukraine's victory over the Russian occupiers.""

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Franceschini on Twitter Wednesday, saying that Italy ""set a good example to follow. Together we will rebuild the country to the last brick.""

While the Mariupol Drama Theater is not an official UNESCO World Heritage site, Tkachenko wrote on his official Facebook page that the UNESCO Committee for the Protection of Cultural Heritage is providing ""immediate support to Ukraine"" and ""expressed readiness to grant the status of enhanced protection of the main cultural heritage sites in accordance with the norms of the Haas Convention of 1954 and its protocols.""

This comes as more international cultural institutions have cut ties with Russia as a sign of solidarity with Ukraine.

During a Saturday telethon in Ukraine, Tkachenko said that ""more than 70 organizations have abandoned cultural cooperation with Russia,"" including the Cannes Film Festival, the La Scala Theater and other large art exhibitions.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-19-22/h_8e82128d3e4f0aaab113dbeaf0a0fce6

As Saturday nears its end in Ukraine, this is what you need to know about Russia's invasion:

Status of attacks in key cities: Rescue efforts are taking place in the southern city of Mykolaiv on Saturday morning at the scene of a missile strike on barracks housing soldiers, regional official Vitalli Kim said. Dozens of troops are reported to have been killed in the attack by Russian forces, according to journalists from CNN Swedish affiliate Expressen who were at the scene.

The besieged city of Mariupol is under almost constant bombardment, according to a major in Ukraine's army, and residents are rationing food and water as bodies are left in the streets. There are also conflicting reports over the status of one of Ukraine’s key industrial facilities, the Azov steel plant, in Mariupol. New satellite imagery shows the destruction of the city's bombed theater, with the word ""children"" clearly visible on the outside of the building.

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that Russia continues to make ""incremental gains"" in Ukraine's south and has used ""brutal, savage techniques'' in the way it has targeted civilians.

Staggering numbers of refugees: Approximately 1.5 million children have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began and are at risk of being trafficked, according to UNICEF, while “countless others” are displaced inside the country.

The mayor of the western Ukrainian city of Lviv told CNN that about 200,000 refugees from around the country are in his city right now.

US says Russia has used hypersonic missiles: US officials confirmed to CNN that Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine last week, the first known use of such missiles in combat.

Russia's Ministry of Defense said Saturday powerful hypersonic ""Kinzhal"" missile destroyed a military ammunitions warehouse in western Ukraine on Friday.

Deaths climb: As of Friday, at least 847 civilians — including 64 children — have been killed in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24, according to the latest update from the United Nations, but the actual toll is believed to be much higher.

Biden to Europe next week: US President Joe Biden is set to go to a NATO summit in Brussels on March 24 and will also join a European Council meeting, according to the White House. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko today called on Biden to visit Ukraine while in Europe.",https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-19-22/h_4aae864d06752854bdbc0d7baf7bcda4

The ""dire"" situation in the besieged city of Mariupol may be a ""red line"" in the path of negotiations, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has said.

In an interview with CBS News, Mr Kuleba also said there had not been any recent diplomatic communications between Russia and Ukraine at the level of their foreign ministries.

The foreign minister went on to say he was expecting ""intensification of heavy fighting in eastern Ukraine"" in the coming weeks.



Mr Kuleba said: ""We didn't really have any contacts with Russian diplomats in recent weeks at the level of foreign ministries.

""The only level of contact is the negotiating team that consists of the representatives of various institutions and members of parliament.

""They continue their consultations at the expert level but no high level talks are taking place.""

4,36e11f60-bdb7-4e75-832d-da88edc4fe11,['Lee Moran'],,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country’s representative on the world stage, praised Fox News in a new interview.

Fox News, whose prime-time star Tucker Carlson has pushed pro-Putin talking points to his millions of viewers on the air, is the only media network in the United States “trying to present some alternative points of view,” claimed Lavrov.

His comments came amid a lengthy diatribe against misinformation during an interview on Russian state TV channel RT. RT has been banned from broadcasting its state-sanctioned propaganda in multiple countries following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Lavrov’s words were delivered without any hint of irony.

“So we know the manners and the tricks which are being used by the Western countries to manipulate media,” he said. “We understood long ago that there is no such thing as an independent Western media. If you take the United States, only Fox News is trying to present some alternative points of view.”

“But when you see, you watch other channels, and when you watch, read social networks and internet platforms, when the acting president was blocked, as you know, and this censorship continues in a very big way and the substitution of notions whenever something is happening by the way of mass protest, mass demonstrations, which they don’t like, they immediately call it domestic terrorism,” he added. “So it’s a war, and it’s a war which involves the methods of information terrorism. There is no doubt about this.”

5,36e11f60-bdb7-4e75-832d-da88edc4fe11,"['Jerome Pugmire', 'Associated Press']",2022-03-20 16:56:17+00:00,"SAKHIR, Bahrain (AP) — Formula One champion Max Verstappen’s title defense turned into a nightmare when the Red Bull star retired near the end of the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday allowing Ferrari to clinch a 1-2 finish with Charles Leclerc winning ahead of teammate Carlos Sainz Jr.

Seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton took an unexpected third place after Sergio Perez’s Red Bull also retired with the finish line in sight as the race finished under a yellow flag.

Hamilton had been lagging way behind in fifth when late drama on Lap 46 changed the race.

Leclerc was leading comfortably from Verstappen when the back of Pierre Gasly’s AlphaTauri car caught fire as he parked it on the side of the track. It was quickly put out and the Frenchman walked away unharmed.

From the restart, Leclerc got away and Verstappen started complaining about steering problems.

A few minutes later both Red Bulls were out of the race and George Russell’s Mercedes moved up into fourth to give Mercedes an unexpected bonus.

Hamilton knows his car was slow until Gasly’s misfortune — he was more than 30 seconds behind Leclerc — so will not get carried away.

“We did the best we could and are grateful for these points,” Hamilton said. “It is not going to be a quick turnaround.”

In a 57-lap race, Verstappen retired on Lap 54 and Perez on 56.

It was a thrilling race to start the season and one laced with a large dollop of irony.

Verstappen won the F1 title last year with a last-lap pass of Hamilton following a controversial restart under a safety car, just when Hamilton was cruising to what would have been a record eighth title.

Red Bull celebrated wildly that night in Abu Dhabi, then Mercedes lost both appeals and Red Bull started in dynamic form as Verstappen led preseason testing. He lined up second behind Leclerc for Sunday’s race with trusted Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez starting from fourth and the team expecting a healthy haul of points.

Red Bull walked away with none.

Sweet revenge for Mercedes perhaps as team principal Toto Wolff smiled from the side and probably not only because of Hamilton’s unexpected podium.

But also unbridled joy for Ferrari.

“That’s exactly how we should start the season,” Leclerc screamed on radio. “Mamma mia.”

It was the team’s first win and its first 1-2 since former driver Sebastian Vettel won the Singapore GP ahead of Leclerc in 2019, and Leclerc’s first since winning the Italian GP in Monza two weeks earlier.

A stylish one, too.

“Pole position, victory, fastest lap, 1-2 with Carlos, we couldn’t have hoped for any better,” Leclerc said.

As Leclerc celebrates his third career win, the Scuderia’s Tifosi fans have something to crow about, while his old karting rival Verstappen will be fuming at his bad luck.

Hamilton knows a little about how that feels.

So does Kevin Magnussen, who was fired by Haas at the end of 2020 as a restructuring took place with a Russian backer and Russian driver. But when Nikita Mazepin was axed, Haas re-hired Magnussen and the determined Dane powered the car into fifth place.

Haas scored no points last year.

The dramatic ending should take nothing away from Leclerc’s superb driving on Laps 17-19.

Three times Verstappen overtook him with his trademark aggressive driving, two of those by diving inside Leclerc on Turn 1, only for the driver from Monaco to add steel to his silk and pass him back quickly to regain the lead.

“I was trying to be as clever as possible, brake early in Turn One and twice it worked out,” Leclerc said. “It was nice, on the limit, hard racing.”

The 24-year-old drivers were bitter rivals in their karting days. As Verstappen’s rise continued, a dreadful 2020 campaign left the Ferrari’s Tifosi fans in tears and the team in tatters. Last year was stable with a handful of podiums but no wins.

Ferrari’s last F1 title was Kimi Raikkonen’s in 2007.

Hopes will now be raised that this Ferrari is quick enough to compete, especially with Red Bull shelling so many early points.

“Ferrari are properly back with a 1-2, where the team should be,” Sainz Jr. said. “The hard work is paying off and we are there.”
