Informational Defence of Ukraine provides a daily review of the military-political situation in Ukraine as of April 2nd, based on an analysis of open sources.

1. The russian occupiers have not achieved success in any of the operational areas and have sustained heavy losses as a result of counterattacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, up to 75 BTGs have been involved in combat missions on the territory of Ukraine, up to 34 BTGs are being repaired, and 16 BTGs have been completely destroyed (this information is being clarified).

russian troops are trying to reach the administrative borders of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine and the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east. They are holding the borders in the occupied territories of the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions in order to distract some parts of the Ukrainian army.

In the Donetsk area, the enemy is still attempting to seize Mariupol and to block Rubizhne, Severodonetsk, Popasna, Troiitske, Avdijivka, Mar’inka, and Krasnohorivka. The occupiers have had no success and have sustained heavy losses.

Regarding operational and tactical group ""East"", russian troops carried out two attacks on Ukrainian defensive positions and sustained losses of up to 80 combatants, three tanks, two BMP artillery systems, one mortar, and three JSCs.

Total enemy combat losses from February 24th to April 2nd are approximately 17,800 combatants, 1776 armored fighting vehicles, 1236 autos, 631 tanks, 317 artillery systems, 76 tankers, 143 aircraft, 134 helicopters, 100 MLRS, 54 air defenсe systems, 87 drones, and seven boats.

According to former Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, an internal report of the Ministry of Defence of the russian federation states that russia’s operational loss of manpower is 17,549 personnel. Private military company losses include 5,366 personnel. The total loss of manpower of the russian Armed Forces and russian APCs (armored personnel carrier) is 22,915. These data are verified to the information of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

2. Information summary and assessments of foreign and Ukrainian intelligence.

In mid-January, US intelligence provided Ukraine's top leaders with detailed russian plans to attack Kyiv, which could play a key role in successfully repelling the attack on the capital in the critical first days of the war. This is according to a long piece in The Wall Street Journal (the WSJ).

The WSJ writes that during a secret visit to Kyiv in mid-January, intelligence chief William Bjorns met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and provided him with new information received by the United States about the russian federation's plans.

US intelligence was aware of the russians' intent to advance from Belarus through the Chernobyl zone, to seize the airport in Hostomel, and to use it as a springboard for an attack on Kyiv.

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reported that residents of the Izium district (in the Kharkiv region) ""treated"" russians from the 3rd Motorized Rifle Division with poisoned food. As a result, two russians died instantly and another 28 were taken to the intensive care unit.

According to military intelligence[MOU1] , about 500 more servicemen of the 3rd Motorized Rifle Division of the russian federation are in hospitals due to alcohol poisoning of unknown origin.

3. The russian invaders continue to violate international humanitarian law.

The russian aggressors continue to kill Ukrainian children. According to the Prosecutor General 's Office[MOU2] of Ukraine, 158 children have been killed and 258 children have been injured in Ukraine since the beginning of russia's military aggression.

Seventy-five children were injured in the Kyiv region, 71 in the Donetsk region, 56 in the Kharkiv region, 46 in the Chernihiv region, 31 in the Mykolaiiv and Luhansk regions, 22 in the Zaporizhzhia region, 29 in the Kherson region, 16 in the city of Kyiv, 16 in the Sumy region, and 15 in the Zhytomyr region.

Every six hours putin kills one child in Ukraine.

Every three hours his “orks” injure one little Ukrainian.

An outrageous incident occurred in the Chernihiv region, where from March 18 to March 20, the russian occupiers fired artillery at a convoy of civilian vehicles. As a result, 13 people died, two of whom were children.

The russian invaders continue to attack civilians daily. UNESCO has confirmed that at least 53 cultural heritage sites in Ukraine have been damaged since the start of russia's invasion.

In Kyiv, 154 houses, 20 private estates, 27 kindergartens, and 44 schools have been damaged since the beginning of the invasion.

In Chernihiv and Kyiv, the night of April 2nd was calmer than the previous nights. However, russian forces fired missiles in the Dnipropetrovsk and Poltava regions, used artillery in the Kharkiv region, and shelled the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Kherson regions.

In the Luhansk region, as a result of shelling, 19 structures were destroyed (including nine apartment buildings; seven private houses were damaged and one person was wounded).

As a result of rocket fire in the Pavlohrad district of the Dnipropetrovsk region, railroad was damaged and cars were exploded; one person was injured.

The number of victims of the missile strike on the Mykolaiiv region was originally stated on March 29th, but has increased to 36 people with 34 reported wounded.

In the temporarily occupied Balakliia of the Kharkiv region, russian shells hit a district hospital and patients and staff need to be evacuated immediately.

Peaceful resistance by Ukrainian citizens continues. Residents of the occupied city of Enerhodar in the Zaporizhzhia region gathered for a rally on April 2nd. russian occupiers caused grenade explosions and shelling, resulting in wounded and detained people there.

The abduction and hostage-taking of civilians continues. After the liberation of the Kyiv region, the bodies of Olha Sukhenko (the head of the village of Motyzhyn) and her husband were found. They had been abducted by the russians on March 23rd.

russian invaders have been detaining the leader of the Melitopol district council, Serhii Pryima, for more than two weeks and have also kidnaped five school principals there.

As of the evening of April 1st, there is no information about the whereabouts of the mayor of Tavriia, Mykola Rizak, after his detention by the russian military. The reason for his detention and the demands of the occupying forces have not been reliably established.

The deputy head of the Novoslobidska OTG (united territorial community) in the Sumy region was also captured by the russian military.

4. Evacuation of civilians through humanitarian corridors continues under attacks by russians.

On April 1st, people were evacuated through the humanitarian corridors from the Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions.

Specifically, the following numbers of people were evacuated: Mariupol – 3,071 people, Severodonetsk - 285 people, Rubizhne - 60 people, Lysychansk - 1,300 people, Kreminna - 52 people, Popasna - 38 people, Polohy - 452 people, Vasylivka - 180 people, Melitopol - 813 people, Berdiansk - 15 people.

6,266 people were evacuated through the humanitarian corridors on April 1st.

Eighty-six Ukrainian servicemen were released from captivity by prisoner exchange on April 1st and are returning home.

As of April 2nd, seven humanitarian corridors in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions were open along the following the routes: from Mariupol and Berdiansk to Zaporizhzhia and from Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Rubizhne, Popasna, and Nyzhnie to Bakhmut.

On Saturday, April 2nd, 1,263 people travelled to Zaporizhzhia by their own transport through the humanitarian corridors from Berdiansk and Melitopol. 765 people from Mariupol and 498 residents of the Zaporizhzhia region, including Berdiansk, Melitopol, Polohy, Orikhiv, and Vasylivka.

On April 2nd, 2,650 people were evacuated from Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Lysychansk, Kreminna, Popasna, and Nyzhnie in the Luhansk region.

Overall, 4,217 people were evacuated on Saturday, April 2nd via the humanitarian corridors.

5. Socio-economic situation in Ukraine and losses due to russian aggression.

Ukraine spends about $ 10 billion per month on hostilities. According to data from Ukraine’s Ministry of the Economy, the decline in GDP in the first quarter of 2022 will be 16%, and the decline this year may reach as high as 40%.

Economic sectors for which remote work is impossible have suffered the most. In particular, these include air and sea transportation services, where businesses work directly with consumers.

150 enterprises from different regions of Ukraine were relocated to the western regions of the country as part of an evacuation program, of which 57 restart their operations.

As of April 2nd, 1,322 applications for relocation have been submitted, of which 435 had already been ready for transportation.

Marketplace ALLO reports significant problems, including mass layoffs, asset losses, falling margins, and rental difficulties. However, the company is gradually adapting to new conditions.

Since the beginning of the russian invasion, 620,000 Ukrainians from abroad have returned to Ukraine. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of Ukrainian citizens returning home. In the first weeks of the conflict, the majority of Ukrainians who returned were men; now the increase is due to women and children returning.

Almost 32,000 people left Ukraine as refuges on April 1st. Almost 23,000 people came to our country; more than 19,000 of them are Ukrainians.

6. International support and assistance to Ukraine.

Political support for Ukraine and security guarantees. The President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, stated that Ukraine urgently needs help from EU partners, and while what has already been done is a lot, it is not enough. She stated this by video message after returning from Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told US President Joe Biden that he would like for the United States to be included in the agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine. President Zelenskyy clarified that the United States is “considering this proposal.”

The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, has said that the Italian government is ready to contribute to the peace process and to act as a guarantor of Ukraine's neutrality.

The Minister of the Economy and Vice Chancellor of Germany Robert Habeck has rejected Ukraine's calls for additional support in the fight against russia due to concerns for Germany’s own security. ""In everything we do, we are very careful not to take any ill-considered steps that could make Germany a target for russia,"" he said.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, Ceyhun Bayramov, stated the need to end hostilities in Ukraine and to resolve the situation politically and diplomatically.

Military assistance to Ukraine. The US Department of Defense will provide a security package of up to $300 million to Ukraine, including laser-guided missiles, armored vehicles, thermal imagers, machine guns, and drones. The United States will also assist Ukraine in the event that russia uses chemical weapons.

A United States government official, quoted anonymously by the NYT, said the United States would act as a mediator to help in the transfer of tanks to Ukraine, in response to a request from President Zelenskyy. The official said that the transfer of tanks would begin soon, but declined to say how many tanks would be shipped or from which countries.

Humanitarian aid to Ukraine. During a visit to Italy and the Vatican, the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda, and his wife Agata, brought with them Ukrainian children with cancer who had been evacuated to Poland.

According to the Embassy of Ukraine to the UK on April 2nd, 30 armored ambulances purchased by the embassy will be sent to Ukraine with funds raised from the UK.

7. A false report from the russian aggressors.

Conflict research journalists from the Intelligence Team ( CIT ) determined that the missile, which was allegedly launched from the territory of Ukraine and which fell near Belgorod, was actually fired from the northeast (i.e. from russia).

8. Political and socio-economic situation in russia and the impact of international sanctions.

The oil and gas embargo has had a decisive impact on the state of the russian economy. Bloomberg News reported that if other countries do not impose a full oil and gas embargo, russia could earn nearly $321 billion from energy exports this year and end the year with a record account surplus of $240 billion.

However, the forecast may change in the case of an embargo on energy sales. russia's exports and oil production are currently falling and the International Energy Agency estimates that it could lose almost a quarter of its oil production this month.

Lithuania stopped importing gas from russia beginning in April, becoming the first EU country to take such a step.

The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Morawiecki, said that his country would not agree to russia's demand to pay for natural gas in rubles.

New sanctions and restrictions are being imposed on russia, which is having a negative impact on the russian economy. The Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation, Mikhail Fedorov, has announced new sanctions by technology companies against russia. Their focus is on blocking important services and stopping the supply of goods. Here are some examples:

Logitech International SA has stopped supplying russia. This Swiss company is a manufacturer of computer peripherals and devices for gamers.

Recruit Group, a recruitment company, has restricted its Indeed system of vacancies in russia and removed all vacancy announcements from russian government and military organizations.

Automatic Data Processing has stopped sales in russia. It is an American company that provides software and services for human resource management.

Amadeus IT Group has stopped cooperating with Aeroflot. Now russia has been deprived of reservation systems for air tickets, hotels, cruise trips, and car rentals.

Emerson Electric has stopped investing in russia. This company offers technological solutions for industrial, commercial, and consumer markets.

Nintendo Company Limited has stopped supplying gaming consoles to russia. Also, the Nintendo eShop payment service has suspended the processing of payments in rubles.

An aircraft with alleged connections to russian oligarchs was not prohibited from flying in the UK.

The Ukrainian State Bureau of Investigation has initiated the nationalization of nearly 1,400 railway cars from russia and Belarus.",https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/press-release/820593.html

Informational Defence of Ukraine provides a daily review of the military-political situation in Ukraine, as of the past day on April 1st, based on an analysis of open sources.

1. The russian occupiers have not achieved success in any of the operational areas and have sustained heavy losses as a result of counterattacks by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, over the past 24 hours the Armed Forces of Ukraine have liberated more than 30 settlements.

In the Kyiv region, units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine regained control over the settlements of Borodianka, Hostomel, Demydiv, Dymer, Lytvynivka, Havrylivka, Kozarovychi, Zhovtneve, Hlybivka, Yasnohorodka, Talakun, Sukholuchchia, Lypivka, Havronka, Makovyshche, Mykolaiivka, and Khmilna.

Separate units of the 5th, 29th, and 35th Military Armies of the Eastern Military District and the 155th Separate Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet are retreating from the Chernobyl area to Belarus, probably with further movement to the Belgorod region.

In the Chernihiv region , units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have taken control of the settlements of Rudnia, Shevchenkove, Bobryk, Stara Basan’, Nova Basan’, Makiiivka, Pohreby, Bazhanivka, Volodymyrivka, Shniakivka, Salne, Sofiiivka, and Havrylivka.

In the Kherson region , the Armed Forces of Ukraine liberated and took control of 11 settlements from the invaders.

In the Izium direction, the occupiers continue to control part of the city of Izium and maintain pontoon crossings across the Siverskyi Donets River, regrouping troops in order to create an offensive group.

In the Donetsk direction, the enemy's main efforts are focused on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, carrying out fire damage and assault operations in order to establish control over Mariupol.

During the past 24 hours, the Allied forces successfully repulsed 9 attacks by the russian military. In particular, Ukrainian defenders destroyed 8 tanks, 44 units of armoured vehicles and 16 units of motor vehicles, as well as 10 enemy artillery systems.

Total enemy combat losses from 24.02 to 01.04: combatants – approximately 17,700 people, tanks - 625 units, armored combat vehicles - 1751 units, artillery systems - 316 units, MLRS - 96 units, air defence - 54 units, aircraft - 143 units, helicopters - 131 units, motor vehicles - 1220 units, ships / boats - 7 units, fuel tanks - 76, operational-tactical UAVs - 85, special equipment - 24, OTRK / TRK launchers - 4.

According to Information Defence analysts, a turning point in the Ukrainian-russian war has come.

The liberation of the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions continues. Ukrainian troops are fighting fierce battles near Kharkiv, trying to push the russian occupiers to the state border with russia, near Kherson and in the Zaporizhzhia region, threatening the Mariupol group of the russian invaders.

The enemy is trying to replenish and give a temporary respite to its BTRs from the Kyiv operational zone, which have completely or partially lost their combat readiness, and transfer them to eastern Ukraine, where the russian occupiers are defending this environment and then trying to take Mariupol.

The decisive military battle of this war will take place in the East of Ukraine. According to its results, the contours of the future peace, the new system of national, European and world security and the future of Ukraine as an independent state, the fate of the Donbas and the Crimea will be determined by the fighting of the heroic Armed Forces of Ukraine.

2. Information summaries and assessments of foreign and Ukrainian intelligence.

UK intelligence reports that Ukraine continues to conduct successful but limited counterattacks to the east and northeast of Kyiv.

It is noted that Ukrainian forces also recaptured the villages of Sloboda and Lukashivka in the south of Chernihiv and are now located along one of the main supply routes between the city and Kyiv.

At the same time, both Chernihiv and Kyiv continue to suffer air and missile strikes, despite russia's claims of declining activity in these areas.

Commenting on the withdrawal of the russian troops north and east of the Ukrainian capital on Thursday, a senior Pentagon spokesman said that Kyiv was still in danger and that airstrikes were continuing.

As reported by The Central Intelligence Agency of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, purchases of unmanned aerial vehicles, components for military equipment and electronic intelligence for units of the 47th tank division were made through the russian ""Promsvyazbank"" and ""Gazprombank"".

3. The russian occupiers continue to violate international humanitarian law.

The russian aggressors continue to kill Ukrainian children. Since the beginning of the war, 153 children have been killed and more than 245 wounded.

According to the prosecutor's office, the most affected children were in the following regions: the Kyiv region- 73, the Donetsk region- 65, the Kharkiv region- 53, the Chernihiv region- 43, the Mykolaiiv region- 30, the Luhansk region- 31, the Zaporizhzhia region- 22, the Kherson region- 29, the Sumy region- 16, the Zhytomyr region- 15. In Kyiv City - 16 children.

On March 31st, a 2-year-old girl from Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region, died of the injuries she has had. She and her 7-year-old brother were seriously injured the day before.

On March 31st, 5 minors injured in the shelling were taken to a medical facility in the Donetsk region.

The russian invaders continue to attack civilians daily. The bombing and shelling damaged 859 educational institutions. 83 of them were completely destroyed. The worst situation is in the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Sumy, Kherson, Mykolaiiv, Zhytomyr, Chernihiv, Kyiv regions and Kyiv City.

For the past 24 hours, on March 31st, the russian occupation forces fired artillery, mortar, and tank shells in the Kharkiv region, in particular in the Saltivka, Pyatykhatka, Oleksiiivka, KHTZ (Kharkiv Tractor Plant), Kholodna Hora, Kulinichi, Velyka Danylivka, and Derhachi districts. In total, about 46 strikes were recorded.

There were also about 170 shellings by the enemy with MLRS type ""Grad"" and 1 missile strike in the central part of Kharkiv.

As a result of the russian shelling on April 1st, 7 people died in the Donetsk region: 4 in Mar’inka, 2 in Vuhledar and 1 in Novoselivka. Six people were also injured, including three children.

The invaders smashed at least two columns of volunteers carrying humanitarian aid near Chernihiv, killing and wounding people.

The number of victims of a missile strike on the building of the Mykolaiiv regional administration caused by the russian occupiers on March 29th, increased to 28 people.

The abduction of civilians and the taking of hostages continues. According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in the temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhzhia region, in the city of Enerhodar, in the military unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, the russian occupiers continue to detain local residents suspected of organising pro-Ukrainian actions and plotting sabotage against invaders. FSB officers interrogate them using psychological and physical pressure.

A so-called referendum is planned by the russian occupiers for April 4th in the city of Tokmak. In particular, the occupation administration has already notified the local population about this event.

The Ukrainian authorities conducted a second exchange of prisoners in the ""86 to 86"" format, including 15 servicewomen.

4. Socio-economic situation in Ukraine, losses due to the russian aggression.

The Ukrainian government is trying to stabilize the socio-economic situation. At a meeting on April 1st, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved a law defining the procedure for nationalising property belonging to the russian citizens and Ukrainians who publicly deny the russian-Ukrainian war.

The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine approved a law guaranteeing full reimbursement of bank deposits to individuals during martial law.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that more than 25,000 applications for compensation for the destroyed real estate of Ukrainians have been submitted to Diia so far. For example, the city authorities of Mariupol estimate that $10 billion is needed to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure.

russia's aggression against Ukraine has a negative impact on the state of the country's economy. In March 2022, the general fund of the state budget received 103.4 billion hryvnias, so the monthly schedule was fulfilled by 92.9%. Expenditures of the general fund of the state budget for January-March amounted to 356.4 billion, which corresponds to 67.8% of the plan for this period.

The war damaged - slowed, reduced and even stopped - 86% of Ukrainian companies. This is stated in the Gradus study Research .

Answering the question “What help from the government do you need today?”, the entrepreneurs put tax breaks in the first place (37%). Secondly, by a wide margin, - assistance with logistics (17%).

Only 3-5% of businesses have increased payments for wages and purchases, 14-19% make payments at the pre-war level. The rest either reduced or stopped payments altogether - 39% did not pay wages, and 29% stopped paying suppliers.

Vladyslav Chechotkin, the founder of the Rozetka online store, wrote a letter to his staff announcing the decision to fire most of the team as a result of the war. He said that the company's monthly turnover fell from 4 billion hryvnias to 23 million hryvnias in three weeks, warehouses were blocked, shops were destroyed, and delivery was interrupted.

A U.S. government spokesman told Reuters that according to the United States, the russian troops have repeatedly damaged granaries in eastern Ukraine.

The official said that because countries in Africa and the Middle East depend on Ukrainian wheat exports, the destruction of these food supplies and warehouses could lead to shortages and rising prices in already vulnerable economies.

5. International support and assistance to Ukraine.

Political support for Ukraine and security guarantees. Roberta Metsola, the European Parliament President said that Ukraine could count on the support of the European Parliament in gaining the status of a candidate country for EU membership.

During an online summit with the Chinese leadership, European Union leaders called on Beijing to help with finishing the war in Ukraine. At this summit, Brussels wants assurances from Beijing that it will not help russia in the war against Ukraine.

According to EU officials, any aid provided to russia will damage China's international reputation and jeopardise relations with its largest trading partners, Europe and the United States. Last year, more than a quarter of China's world trade was with the European Union and the United States, while russia accounted for only 2.4 percent.

The G20 must reconsider the participation of russia and its president putin. This statement was made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has said the country is joining all sanctions against russia over the invasion of Ukraine. According to her, Georgia also supports all international resolutions in support of Ukraine. It should be noted that Zourabichvili does not have the authority to announce sanctions, as the country is governed by the Prime Minister under the Constitution.

According to sources interviewed by CNN, it is unlikely that the United States and its allies will eventually offer Ukraine the type of binding protection it is seeking.

Military assistance to Ukraine. Australia will send locally made armoured vehicles to Ukraine at the request of President Zelenskyy. In particular, this is an armoured personnel carrier Bushmasters, bulletproof vests and more.

The Ministry of Defence of Germany has decided to approve the supply of infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine from the reserves of the former GDR, which are now in the Czech Republic. These are 56-58 BMP (PbV-501, formerly known as BMP-1), equipped with a cannon and machine guns.

American actor Sean Penn has issued an appeal to billionaires to step forward to purchase fighter jets for Ukraine. He said that $300 million could purchase “12 aircraft with better tech than russian MiGs or SU's”.

Humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The European Commission has approved a proposal to convert cash hryvnia into the currency of host Member States fleeing the war in Ukraine.

6. Provocations and fakes of the russian aggressors.

The russian investigators have accused 22 Ukrainians of ""genocide of the russian-speaking population"" in the Donbas area. Among the participants are ex-Minister of Defence of Ukraine Valerii Heletey, former Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Viktor Muzhenko and 20 other Ukrainian servicemen.

According to the russian media, the Investigative Committee of the russian federation since 2014 has opened almost 600 criminal cases over the events in Ukraine.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine emphasises that the statement of the russian federation about the alleged refusal of Ukraine to comply with the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War is not true.

Earlier, the russian Foreign Intelligence Service said that Ukraine had allegedly informed the UK that it did not intend to abide by the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.

The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Oleh Nikolenko called the statement a disinformation, recalling that russia had previously created many fakes about Ukraine.

According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces, ""wounded"" servicemen of the Armed Forces of the russian federation, who received significant doses of radiation during their stay in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, are being placed in the Gomel Republican Scientific and Practical Centre for Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology, in the territory of the Republic of Belarus.

7. Political and socio-economic situation in russia, the impact of international sanctions on it.

Under the influence of propaganda and misinformation, russian society is demonstrating significant support for putin. 81% of russians trust russian president putin and 79% positively evaluate his activities, according to the russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion ( VTSVGD ).

This is evidenced by the ratings of the centre's research on April 1st, which are submitted without data on the number of respondents and statistical error

Western countries are persistently promoting the application of the oil embargo, applying compensatory measures. Oil prices continue to fall on April 1st in a statement by US President Joe Biden’s intention to market an average of 1 million barrels of oil per day from the US strategic reserve over the next six months.

The price of Brent oil futures on the London Stock Exchange ICE Futures is $104.35 per barrel, which is $ 0.36 (0.34%) lower than the closing price of the previous session.

On the evening of April 1st, the US President Joe Biden said that more than 30 countries had joined a campaign to saturate the oil market to reduce prices for this energy resource.

Information Defence analysts believe that such a measure will keep or reduce oil prices, even if russian oil will not be traded on the world market.

New sanctions and restrictions are being imposed on russia, which is having a negative impact on the russian economy. In March, production activity in russia demonstrated a sharp decline since the first wave of the pandemic - analysts attribute this to increased delivery times and an acute shortage of materials.

Thus, the index of business activity (PMI) of manufacturing industries in russia fell sharply in March to 44.1 points from 48.6 points in February, according to rating agency S&P Global.",https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/press-release/820419.html

From Zelenskyy's night video address: ""The world has seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it's time to do everything to make the war crimes of the Russian military the last manifestation of such evil on earth. Everyone guilty of such crimes will be entered into a special book of executioners. They will be found and punished.""

""This is not a war of two states and not a war of nations. This is a war of civilization and savage medieval barbarism. We will definitely defeat this savage Moscow horde. But we must win and remain civilized,"" said Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar.

12:00 – Now heavy fighting continues in Kharkiv, Luhansk, and Donetsk regions. Our troops are pushing back the occupiers in the Kherson region. Chernihiv remains in a difficult situation. The defenders of Mariupol, who have already become legends of today, are fighting heroically, said the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksii Reznikov about the situation on the fronts.

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Bucha, where evidence of mass killings of civilians was found. When asked by the BBC if he still considered it possible to discuss peace with Russia, he said: ""Yes, because Ukraine must gain peace. We are in 21st century Europe. We will continue diplomatic and military efforts.""

""Ukrainian prisoners were kept in a field, in a pit, in a garage. They were beaten and intimidated. Soldiers from the island of Zmiinyi, who were taken to Sevastopol, were used by local propagandists, and then kept in a tent camp at -20 ℃, which caused many to have frostbite. They were treated like prisoners and put a dog on them,"" said Ombudswoman Liudmyla Denisova on her Facebook page.

The Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense has published a list of personnel of the russian brigade that took part in war crimes against civilians in Bucha, the Kyiv region.

The Ministry of Culture and Information Policy expressed its deepest condolences to the families and relatives of all the wounded, taken prisoner, missing and journalists killed. So far, russia has committed 74 crimes against media representatives in Ukraine, including 19 against citizens of other countries: Great Britain, the Czech Republic, the United States, Denmark, the UAE, Russia, Ireland, Switzerland, France, and Lithuania. 18 journalists were killed, 8 were abducted, 13 were injured and three went missing.

The genocide perpetrated by the russians in Ukraine may be the largest in Europe since World War II. The number of civilian casualties in Irpin and Bucha has already exceeded the number of internationally recognized war crimes cases in the Croatian cities of Gospic and Vukovar. It is still unknown how many civilians died at the hands of the Russians in 450,000-people Mariupol.

But we know for sure that all those guilty of inhumane crimes will be put on trial and will receive their punishment. Of course, if they live.

""Currently, the fate of the whole of Eastern and Central Europe and the Black Sea region is being decided on the territory of Ukraine. Therefore, to protect the freedom of Ukraine, to protect the freedom of Ukrainians is to guarantee the security of Europe,"" Zelenskyy said in an address to the Romanian government.

British intelligence has said Mariupol is a key target of Russia's invasion. The Horde wants to take Mariupol, as it will provide a land corridor from Russia to the occupied Crimea.

In his speech, Victor Orban, who won the election, named Zelenskyy among those who prevented his party's re-election: ""This victory will be remembered for a lifetime because so many people rebelled against us, including the left at home. left abroad, bureaucrats in Brussels, all the foundations and organizations of the ruling empire, foreign media, and ultimately even the Ukrainian president.""

""In these difficult times, we will be part of this future, helping you to rebuild this city and make it even more beautiful, even better,"" Dandias said.

14:30 – The Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki criticized Macron for frequent calls to putin: ""President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin, what have you achieved? Did you stop any actions that took place? No one negotiated with Hitler. Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot?"" And really, what's the point in conversations that lead to nothing?

Dmytro Kuleba said that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had expressed solidarity with Ukraine over the mass killings of civilians in Ukraine. ""We both share the belief that ending the war against Ukraine is in the interests of peace, food security, and international trade,"" Kuleba said after a conversation with Wang Yi. It should be noted that there were no comments on the events in Bucha.

""Britain will never hesitate to support our friends, and I have no doubt that when this time of suffering is over, Ukraine will be reborn and take its place among free and sovereign states again,"" said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a video appeal. ""We in Britain are fascinated by the courage and patriotism of Ukrainians."" Thank you!

19:00 – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania ordered the russian ambassador to leave the country, according to the website of the agency. The Lithuanian government is also closing the consulate in Klaipeda, ""given the general unconstructive role of the Russian diplomatic service in its aggression against Ukraine.""

The United States is asking to exclude russia from the UN Human Rights Council. This was stated by the Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield over the massacre of civilians in Bucha. ""russia's participation in the Human Rights Council is a farce. This is wrong, and that is why we believe it is time for the UN General Assembly to vote to exclude them,"" she told Reuters.

After the Bucha massacre, the eyes of the President of Germany were opened. Frank-Walter Steinmeier regrets former support for Russia: ""My commitment to the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline was a clear mistake. We clung to bridges that Russia no longer believed in, as our partners warned us. I did not believe that Putin will accept the complete economic, political and moral decline of his country for the sake of his imperial madness,"" Steinmeier admitted.

21:00 – Germany and France send russian diplomats out of their countries. The German Foreign Ministry has declared 40 diplomats from Russia non grata.

Reaction to the atrocities of the russian occupiers in Ukraine

The Prime Minister of Poland Mateusz Morawiecki: ""No more maneuvers and false gestures. Enough! Sanctions do not work. Cut off oxygen from russia's genocide!""

""First, Ukraine needs three things: weapons, weapons, and weapons again."" This was stated by Polish leader Andrzej Duda after the publication of photos from Bucha. ""Criminals must be called criminals, prosecuted and convicted. The Bucha photos refute the belief that compromise must be sought at all costs. In fact, Ukraine's defenders need three things: weapons, weapons, and weapons again.""

Emmanuel Macron said that the russian authorities would have to answer for the crimes in Bucha: ""The footage coming from Bucha, a liberated city near Kyiv, is intolerable. Hundreds of civilians were cowardly killed in the streets. My condolences to the victims, my solidarity with Ukrainians.""

Email address: mnac1981@gmail.com

Address: Knyaze-Volkonskoye, Khabarovsk district.

The war crimes of the russian military in Bucha and other cities will be considered at a meeting of the UN Security Council on April 5, said President Zelenskyy.

Former UN tribunal prosecutor for ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda Carla del Ponte has called on the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for putin. Del Ponte explicitly called putin a ""war criminal"" over russia's invasion of Ukraine and stressed that the issuance of an arrest warrant would be an important signal that ""investigative work has been carried out.""

Who and how will carry out the arrest itself is a rhetorical question, there is no answer to it, but such steps are necessary. First, it will be an ""important signal"" that putin is no longer an equal member of the world's civilized community. No talks are being held with terrorists.

Moldova has declared April 4 a day of mourning for all those killed in russia's invasion of Ukraine, President Maia Sandu. ""It is impossible to watch the atrocities in Bucha and other Ukrainian cities. Shocked by the brutality against the civilian population. Moldova strongly condemns these crimes against humanity, this illegal and unprovoked war against Ukraine."" Is it possible to sponsor the aggressor's army by buying gas from them?

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida condemned the atrocities of the russian military in Bucha: ""I am deeply shocked by the horrific atrocities against civilians on the outskirts of Kyiv. The killing of innocent civilians is a violation of international humanitarian law. This is absolutely unbearable, and Japan strongly condemns it. russia must take strict responsibility for these actions.""

Crimes of the russian occupiers in Bucha are on the front pages of world newspapers! Europe, America, the world wake up! We are dealing with pathological killers and maniacs!

The European Union ""strongly condemns the atrocities committed by the russian armed forces in several Ukrainian cities."" This is stated in a statement issued by the European Council on 4 April.

""Evidence of the huge number of dead and wounded among the civilian population, as well as the destruction of civilian infrastructure, show the true identity of the brutal aggressive war that russia is waging against Ukraine and its people. The massacres in Bucha and other cities in Ukraine will be included in the list of atrocities committed on European soil,"" the statement said. According to the European Council, the russian authorities are ""responsible for the atrocities committed while they controlled the area.""

The Turkish embassy said it shared the pain of the friendly Ukrainian people over the crimes in the suburbs of Kyiv and expected an independent investigation.

""It is impossible to remain indifferent to the horrible images from Bucha, near Kyiv, after the withdrawal of the russian army,"" Israel condemned the actions of the russian armed forces in Bucha. The relevant statement was made by Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid on Twitter.

What's in russia?

""When Bucha was under the control of the russian Armed Forces, no local resident suffered from any violence,"" said the Ministry of Defense of the russian federation. And this was said after the documented atrocities of the russian army shocked the world!

russia has begun covert conscription of reservists. They expect to attract approximately 60,000 people. Conscripts are seduced by unrestrained looting, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reports.

putin signs decree suspending visa facilitation agreements with unfriendly EU countries, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, and Iceland

After Bucha Massacre, russia demands to convene an urgent meeting of the UN.

But it was denied. The UN Security Council will not meet on April 4 at russia's request to discuss ""criminal provocations by Ukrainian soldiers and radicals"" in Bucha but will hold a scheduled meeting on the war in Ukraine on April 5. The russians can't stop: the russian Foreign Ministry has stated that it will address the Security Council with a new proposal to hold such a meeting.

What about belarus?

The names of the occupiers who sent the property robbed in Ukraine to Russia became known. The looters delivered the stolen items through the post office in Mozyr (belarus), where they were caught on video by surveillance cameras.

Russian lies

russia's Defense Ministry is trying to deny the atrocities of its army in the Kyiv region. However, they fail to do it, traditionally. ""russian troops left Bucha on March 30,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said yesterday. Also, the same Ministry of Defense, but on April 1: ""Bucha and other settlements are under the full control of russian troops.""

Russian propagandists changed the name of the maps ""success of the special operation"" to ""special operation."" Judging by the map, ""successes"" have decreased significantly in just two days.

An eloquent comparison of how Google search engine and Kremlin-controlled Yandex search engine process Bucha's request.

The Center for Strategic Communications investigated the main narratives in the russian media amid the massacre staged by the occupiers in Bucha and other cities of the Kyiv region. One part of russian propaganda wrote something sacramental and hysterical: ""Someday we will hear and see the testimonies of these people, who may have been forced to lie at Volkssturm rifle point and imitate the dead on the cold ground."" The second dispersed the ""analysis of memories"" such as: ""Tactics of video staging ceased to amaze me in Syria…""

In fact, a year ago the russian media wrote that ""Ukrainians want to build Srebrenica in Donetsk region."" Now the Russians themselves arranged it in Bucha.

Sanctions on the aggressor!

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the West would soon agree to further sanctions against russia in connection with the war and, in particular, the atrocities committed in Bucha. This was reported by DW.

French President Macron has also called for new sanctions against Russia, which he says should affect coal and petrol. He confirmed that they would be discussed in the coming days.

According to Bild, up to 100 employees of russian diplomatic missions are going to be sent away from Germany.

Wargaming, which has created such popular MMO games as World of Tanks and World of Warships, has decided to close its business in russia and belarus. Wargaming has also started the process of closing its studio in Minsk.

Because of international sanctions being introduced, russia has lost the ability to supply a wide range of military, dual, and civilian goods. However, it would be a mistake to underestimate the enemy's agility. According to the Ukrainian Defense Intelligence, in order to circumvent the sanctions, russian agents are setting up smuggling channels that pass, in particular, through Georgia. At the same time, representatives of the Georgian special services were instructed by the political leadership not to interfere with the activities of smugglers.

Today we know about another channel of supply of military goods to Russia, East Asia. Through it, spare parts for machinery, electronics, and optical devices are delivered to the occupying country.

It became known that the possibility of resuming flights between Georgia and Russia is being considered.

The Polish prime minister called Germany the ""main brake"" on new sanctions against russia. He also added that Hungary does not block the possibility of tightening restrictions against russia. In addition, Moraweczki is convinced that the current sanctions against Russia are not enough: ""We need clear, tough sanctions. The current ones do not work, and decisive action is needed to break putin's military machine. Otherwise, more innocent people will die.""

Japan is shocked by the crimes committed by the Russians near Kyiv. Tokyo, along with the civilized world, is in favor of tough sanctions against moscow, said Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi.

But Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg opposed the Russian gas embargo. According to him, in addition to the gas embargo, ""there are enough other opportunities where [the EU] could tighten the sanctions valve.""

But the Italian authorities do not plan to block possible sanctions against the supply of russian gas, said Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio.

Trophies of the Ukrainian Armed Forces

Another trophy was won in the Brovary district.

Vasylkiv's territorial defense, together with the staff of the Defense Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, captured the Russian BMD-4. This was announced by the commander of the territorial defense unit Vasylkiv Shield Andrii Melnyk.

BMD-4 after inspection and necessary repairs will be used by our defenders on the front line.

Russian equipment was shattered in one of the liberated villages in the south of the Kharkiv region. It was the servicemen of the 93rd separate mechanized brigade, Kholodnyi Yar, who set the russians on fire.

Life considering hostilities

The Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine reports on the security of the ""Tell your story about the war in Ukraine"" message from Ukraine with reference to mywar.mkip.gov.ua, which Ukrainians received yesterday. mywar.mkip.gov.ua is a website created by the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine so that citizens can tell their war stories to the whole world. The account from which the message under the name ""Ukraine"" was sent belongs to the State Special Communications Service.

At the same time, today, after receiving this message, messages with the following text began to appear on the Internet: ""Do not open, delete, this is for the purpose of obtaining data."" These intimidations are not true. It's just that someone really needs the stories about the war not to be heard.

Ukraine has launched a chatbot to search for people with whom contact was lost during the war, https://t.me/Family_Search_bot. How to use the search people service is in the instructions at the link.

Wikipedia has published an article entitled Bucha Massacre, which tells about the horrors that took place in the city during its occupation by Russian troops. The article is also available in Russian.

April 4, International Day for Mine Awareness and De-mining Assistance. For Ukraine, this is no longer just one of the Days that can be read on Wikipedia. Thousands of munitions remain unexploded through Ukrainian streets and fields after enemy shelling. The occupiers, retreating, chaotically mine everything they can: the corpses of the people they killed, children's toys, houses, kindergartens, and even their abandoned equipment, trying to mutilate as many people as possible.

Therefore, the Ukrainian Armed Forces call on:

Returning to your hometown and village after the official permission of the state and local authorities. Specialists risk their lives every day in order to eliminate the consequences of the enemy's presence!

If you are in combat areas, do not try to clear explosive devices yourself. Report them to specialists immediately.

Be sure to instruct children and loved ones.

The Ministry of Justice said that in the Vinnytsia region and Kyiv City, the newborn boy and girl were named Yan Javelin and Javelina.

Kyiv and region

Bucha was liberated. The city continues to be demined. Humanitarian aid is distributed to those who remain there. In the city itself, there are the bodies of the dead. Russian military equipment. Waste. Empty shops. And the guys with the basketball on the playground. Life is stronger than death! Ukraine will win!

Kyiv metro resumes traffic across the South Bridge. Trains on this branch will start running from 8:30 on April 4, the Kyiv City State Administration reports. Also, as of today, traffic in both directions on the North Bridge has been completely restored. The Kyiv City State Administration notes that the Darnytsia Bridge is still working for road connections between the left and right banks. The South Bridge remains open to public transport, including the metro.

Bucha Mayor Anatolii Fedoruk said at least 280 people were buried in mass graves. But this is an approximate figure because they are still searching. And the first mass graves in Bucha around the church appeared on March 10. This is evidenced by satellite images of the American company Maxar Technologies.

A Ukrainian woman from the village with the eloquent name Peremoha (victory in Ukrainian – ed.), Baryshyvka district, took possession of a bag of ammunition and hid it in a cage for rabbits. She has already given it to the Ukrainian soldiers who liberated her native village. Everyone is making our victory closer as best they can.

The photo above shows a mass grave in the village of Motyzhyn, Kyiv region, which was discovered after the withdrawal of Russian troops. Here, among other buried villagers, the village head elder Olha Sukhenko was tortured.

Killed children under the age of 10 with signs of violence and torture were found in Irpin and Bucha: ""Some of the killed children have their hands tied. Children. Children were tied up. Shot dogs. Killed women. Girls under 10 with torn vaginas. Irpin, Bucha, Dmytrivka. How to explain it? How?""

A torture chamber with the bodies of five dead men was found in the basement of one of the children's sanatoriums in Bucha. They also had their hands tied.

Almost 5,000 explosive devices were found in the Kyiv region on April 3, mostly ammunition, the State Emergency Service said. ""Don't hurry to return!"" the SES urges. ""Wait for the official permission, be careful!""

The worst situation with regard to civilian casualties is in Borodianka, Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said. ""We can talk about the Kyiv region, because yesterday we got access to it, and we are working on Irpin, Bucha, Vorzel. I think we will talk about Borodianka separately. There is something to talk about,"" she said. The exact number of victims in the city has not yet been named.

20:00 – Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klychko appealed to Kyiv residents not to return to the city at least until the end of this week:

In some districts of the Kyiv region, there is now a curfew around the clock.

In the region and suburbs of Kyiv, there are many mines and shells that did not explode.

Despite the fact that the air defense works quite effectively, missile attacks on the capital are not ruled out.

Getting around the city is complicated by a large number of checkpoints.

Kyiv residents were promised to be informed when it will be possible to return to the capital.

A temporary crossing will be built in Stoianka on the site of the destroyed bridge over the Irpin River. It will be opened in two weeks. It will take up to four months to fully restore the bridge.

Donetsk and Luhansk regions

russian occupation forces continue to accumulate military equipment and personnel in the Luhansk region. On the night of March 4, the Ukrainian military repulsed an attack by the russian occupiers in the Rubizhne area.
