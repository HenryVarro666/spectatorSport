Ukraine: new wartime legislation

On 15 March, the Ukrainian parliament passed a number of laws regulating the functioning of the state during the war; these included an extension of martial law until 25 April and a rise in the defence budget. The powers of the police were also expanded, equating them with the powers of the Territorial Defence, and the manpower of the State Border Guard Service was expanded from 53,000 to 60,000 officers. In turn, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed two laws: on criminal liability for collaboration with Russia (punishable by up to 15 years’ imprisonment) and on counteracting Russian propaganda. During the period of martial law, a number of changes to the tax and budget law have also been introduced. For self-employed persons and small enterprises, payment of taxes is to be voluntary, and for companies with an annual turnover of up to 10 billion hryvnia (US$340 million), a flat tax rate will apply (2% of turnover), and these companies will be exempted from income tax and VAT. In order to reduce fuel prices, excise tax has been abolished and VAT was reduced from 20% to 7%. In addition, the gas extraction tax has been increased in a link to its price on the European market. The current rates (14% for wells deeper than 5 km, and 29% for shallower depths) will apply if the price of gas is between US$150 and US$400 per 1000 m³; if it exceeds this ceiling, then the tax will rise to between 31% and 65%. The government’s powers with regard to changes in budget expenditure were also expanded.

Commentary

• The adoption of this package of legislation regulating the functioning of the state during the period of armed conflict shows that, despite the Russian aggression, the Ukrainian system of government remains operational, and that the president, parliament and legislature are continuing to fulfil their tasks. The adoption of 20 out of the 21 acts by constitutional majorities of over 300 votes demonstrates the considerable consensus among the political elite and their common resistance to the enemy, regardless of their previous divisions and rivalries. It sends an important signal to the Ukrainian public and the international environment, confirming the durability and efficiency of the political institutions, as well as their resistance to demoralisation in the face of attacks.

• From the point of view of strengthening public resistance, the most important acts are those introducing criminal liability for cooperation with the occupiers. By virtue of the first, On introducing changes to other legal acts to guarantee criminal liability for collaborative activities, a new category of crime has been introduced into the Criminal Code of Ukraine, that of collaborative activity. A penalty of 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment has been introduced for cooperation with the aggressor state, the occupation administration and/or its armed and paramilitary formations, as well as for expressing views justifying the Russian attack. The second act, On establishing the liability of persons engaged in collaborative activity, states that such persons will be deprived of the right to hold any positions in central and local government administration, and their property will be confiscated. Both legal acts are preventive in nature: on the one hand, they indicate to citizens that cooperation with the occupiers will be ruthlessly punished, and collaborators will be deprived of their right to participate in public and social life; on the other, they are intended to motivate the population to help the investigative organs in identifying people who support the Russians or their associates.

• The adoption of the regulations on counteracting propaganda shows that the legislature has attached great importance to neutralising the Russian media message. It is now forbidden to spread any messages supporting Russian propaganda, under the threat of closing down any media which violate the law, or of banning political, social and religious organisations which do not comply from operating. This applies to denying the attack on Ukraine or recognising the conflict in Donbas as a civil war, and to calls for a change in the constitutional order, or for Ukraine’s sovereignty or territorial integrity to be violated. If this law is applied consistently, it will make it possible to remove pro-Russian circles from the domestic political scene. It could also affect the activity of the clergy of the Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate.

• In connection with the ongoing Russian aggression, the authorities are trying to increase the state’s defence potential. Equating the competences of the police officers with the powers of the soldiers of the territorial defence forces means the creation of another formation which can carry out combat tasks. The specialised police units’ responsibilities will include the removal of explosives and the supervision of POWs. The number of positions in the State Border Service will be increased by 7000, in order to facilitate the evacuation of civilians abroad and boost the staffing of the border with Belarus. In turn, the rise in defence spending has been made possible thanks to Britain’s consent to allocate part of the loan to develop the Ukrainian Navy for this purpose. The loan was originally granted as part of an agreement ratified in January 2022 for the purchase, repair and modernisation of weapons and military equipment, as well as for equipping volunteer units.

• The changes introduced to the tax law will significantly simplify the process of running a business, and are intended to revitalise Ukrainian enterprises. According to estimates from the President’s Office, 50% of them have suspended their activities, and a survey conducted by the European Business Association shows that 24% of companies do not have any reserve funds, 22% have reserves for just one month, and 32% for several months. The tax breaks should help to postpone mass bankruptcies, which could lead to a significant increase in unemployment. However, these changes will also cause a decline in budget revenues (which will be exacerbated by the abolition of excise duty on fuels). Considering the critical situation which the country is in, the government will to a large extent finance these expenditures from Western monetary support, as well as the foreign exchange reserves which the National Bank of Ukraine still possesses.",https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2022-03-17/ukraine-new-wartime-legislation

President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed laws establishing and regulating responsibility for collaborative activities.

This is stated in the cards of legislative acts published on the website of the Verkhovna Rada.

Thus, the Law ""On Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts (Concerning the Establishment of Criminal Liability for Collaborative Activities)"" (№5144) provides for introducing criminal liability for cooperation with the aggressor state, its occupation administration, and/or its armed or paramilitary formations which provide for restriction of access to positions related to the performance of state or local government functions for a period of 15 years and imposition of other appropriate penalties on persons who carried out such cooperation, as well as the possibility of liquidation of legal entities whose authorized persons carried out such cooperation.

In addition, the document amends the Criminal Procedure Code, which provides for the investigation of criminal offenses under Article 111-1 of the Criminal Code, by investigators of security agencies, as well as extending to such a criminal offense the possibility of special pre-trial investigation (in absentia).

In turn, the law ""On Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts (on Ensuring the Responsibility of Collaborators)"" (145143) provides for restrictions on access to certain functions related to elections at all levels, as well as access to military services and access to state secrets for persons who cooperated with the aggressor state, its occupation administration and/or its armed or paramilitary formations.

In addition, the law establishes additional legal grounds for the liquidation of political parties, public, charitable or religious organizations, trade unions, and public formations for the protection of public order and the state border, whose authorized persons carried out such cooperation.

Two weeks ago, Ukraine asked the International Court of Justice – also known as the World Court – to intervene, arguing Russia violated the 1948 Genocide Convention by falsely accusing Ukraine of committing genocide and using that as a pretext for the ongoing invasion.

“The Russian Federation shall immediately suspend the special military operations it commenced on 24 February 2022,” the court’s president, U.S. judge Joan E. Donoghue, said. Countries who refuse to abide by court orders can be referred to the U.N. Security Council, where Russia holds veto power.

Still, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed it as a major victory.

“Ukraine gained a complete victory in its case against Russia at the International Court of Justice,” he wrote on Twitter. “The ICJ ordered to immediately stop the invasion. The order is binding under international law. Russia must comply immediately. Ignoring the order will isolate Russia even further.”

Moscow snubbed a hearing last week, when lawyers for Ukraine told the court that Russia had started an “unprovoked aggression.” “Cities under siege, civilians under fire, humanitarian catastrophe and refugees fleeing for their lives,” argued David Zionts, a member of Ukraine’s legal team.

In written arguments submitted later in the week, Russia argued in writing that The Hague-based court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and that nothing in the convention forbids the use of force.

In a 13-2 decision, the court also told Moscow to ensure military units “take no steps” to further the conflict, which Russia refers to as a “special military operation.” The Russian and Chinese judges dissented.

The bar for granting provisional measures is low, says Melanie O’Brien, an associate professor of international law at the University of Western Australia and an expert on the Genocide Convention. “The court was not being asked to make a decision on the real crux of the case,” she told reporters in a briefing ahead of the ruling.

In January, the court ordered Myanmar to prevent genocide against the Rohingya people, a Muslim-minority group that has been persecuted in the country for years. As with Wednesday’s decision, the court also ordered Myanmar to preserve evidence of any crimes and submit regular reports to the court.

Earlier on Wednesday, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan met with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a surprise meeting. The pair discussed the court’s ongoing investigation into possible war crimes in the country. While the ICJ can hold states responsible, the International Criminal Court could prosecute individuals.

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

Statement of ICC Prosecutor, Karim A.A. Khan QC, on his visits to Ukraine and Poland: “Engagement with all actors critical for effective, independent investigations.”

Today, I visited western Ukraine and Poland in connection with the ongoing investigation by my Office into the Situation in the Ukraine. This has allowed me to personally assess the situation on the ground, meet with affected communities and to further accelerate our work by engaging with national counterparts.

During my time in western Ukraine, I met with Excellencies, Dmytro Kuleba, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Iryna Venediktova, Prosecutor-General of Ukraine. My message was clear: we stand ready to work with all relevant national authorities in order to obtain information, build a collective effort to establish the truth and ensure that individuals responsible for international crimes are held accountable in a court of law. I am sincerely grateful for the willingness of the Foreign Minister and the Prosecutor-General to meet at an incredibly difficult time for all those in Ukraine.

I was also pleased to have the opportunity during my visit to meet virtually with His Excellency, Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine. We were united in our view that every possible effort should be made to ensure that the conduct of hostilities does not give rise to breaches of international humanitarian law and that civilians are protected from the effects of conflict. I emphasised my willingness to expand collaboration with all relevant national authorities in order that we can together ensure that alleged violations of international law are thoroughly investigated.

During my visit, I have also had the opportunity to meet with those who have been forced to flee due to the hostilities in Ukraine at Medyka refugee reception centre in Poland. The accounts I have heard from men, women and children have deepened my concern regarding the impact of this situation on the civilian population.

I wish to send a clear message to all those participating in hostilities.

If attacks are intentionally directed against the civilian population: that is a crime that my Office may investigative and prosecute. If attacks are intentionally directed against civilian objects, including hospitals: that is a crime that my Office may investigate and prosecute.

Those taking part in these hostilities, whether as regular armed forces, militias, or self-defence groups, must know that in putting on a uniform or by carrying weapons they are not absolved of responsibility but indeed they take on extra legal obligations. For those that do not act in accordance with international humanitarian law, my Office is empowered to take action to ensure that those who have committed international crimes are held accountable in accordance with the Rome Statute. We are already actively collecting evidence in pursuit of this objective, and I believe my visit today will strengthen that work.

The work of my Office in relation to the Situation in Ukraine will at all times be carried out in a manner consistent with the founding principles of the Rome Statute. We conduct our work with independence, impartiality and integrity. I have underlined that I wish to engage with all parties to the conflict.

In line with this approach, I have also transmitted a formal request to the Russian Federation to meet their competent authorities and discuss the current situation as it concerns my Office's mandate. It is in my view essential that the Russian Federation actively engages in this investigation and I stand ready to meet with them.

My visit to Ukraine has also underlined the significant task we face in ensuring that the full range of documentary, digital, forensic and testimonial evidence is drawn upon as part of our investigations. The scale of this investigation and the challenging environment in which it will be conducted give rise to unavoidable demands on my Office which I intend to meet with an effective response.

It is therefore essential that the collective support of all States Parties is maintained as our work now moves to an important stage. I would reiterate my call to those States to provide assistance to my Office including through voluntary financial contributions and the provision of national experts on a secondment basis. This will be essential in addressing the urgent resource needs of my Office and in allowing us to effectively address all situations presently under investigation or in trial.

I wish to extend my thanks to the Polish authorities for their support with respect to the elements of my visit held in Poland today. I was pleased to hold an initial meeting this afternoon with His Excellency, Zbigniew Ziobro, Minister of Justice of Poland. Tomorrow, I will be engaging with other senior government officials in Warsaw to further strengthen the basis for collective action towards accountability for atrocity crimes.
