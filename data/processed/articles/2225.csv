Special to USA TODAY

Following the invasion of Ukraine, the European Union closed its airspace to all Russian airline, Russian-owned and Russian-operated aircraft. Soon after, Russia closed its airspace to all European aircraft. More countries like Canada have since followed the EU, consequently, the number of aircraft and flights affected increased.

So what does all of this mean to air travelers?

The most immediate effect is on travelers to and from Russia. Many flights are canceled, and some have been forced to turn around. One Aeroflot flight was nearing Canada airspace when the ban was announced and had to return to Russia.

Another Aeroflot flight en route from Miami to Moscow was mistakenly allowed to transit Canada. The controlling authority, NAV Canada, admitted the mistake and said that corrective action had been taken to prevent a reoccurrence.

As a result of losing access to Canadian airspace, Aeroflot has been canceling flights to their four destinations in the U.S. (New York, Washington, Los Angeles and Miami), as well as Cancun, Mexico, and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.

And last week, Delta Air Lines suspended its code-sharing agreement with Aeroflot, which is Russia's national airline.

During the State of the Union speech, President Joe Biden announced the U.S. is closing off airspace to all Russian flights, joining a growing number of countries around the world that have made similar moves in recent days.

Longer routes, fewer diversion airports

More consequences of the closing of airspace are the necessity to reroute some flights, adding flight time and increasing fuel costs.

Flights, for example, from London to Asia now fly much further south to avoid Russian airspace. Polar flights from the U.S. to Asia can no longer use Russia as alternate airports. Should an emergency such as engine failure occur, no Russian airport can be a diversion airport.

Under Long Range Operational Performance Standards, aircraft are rated by how long it would take to reach the nearest diversion airport. For newer, more efficient long-haul aircraft like the Airbus A-350, the limit is 370 minutes. For smaller twin-engine planes, the limit is lower.

Some polar flights must have Russian airports as an available diversion airport. Losing those airports mean that the flights must go much further south and may require a technical stop for fuel, which dramatically increases flight time and cost.

'IT WILL BE A LOT HARDER ON PEOPLE': How sanctions will impact ordinary Russians

The airspace over Ukraine is, of course, closed, requiring all air traffic to route around it.

The rules for closing airspace were tightened after the Russian military shot down Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 over eastern Ukraine in 2014. Hence, no civilian aircraft are flying over Ukraine until the conflict subsides.

In the meantime, any plans for travel that might overfly Russia or any of Eastern Europe should include regular information from your airline to see the departure time, flight time and other possible changes, such as a technical stop.

Fewer planes flying in Russia due to parts shortages, leased aircraft recall

Secondary issues include a ban on aircraft parts to Russian operators. Aircraft will be soon be grounded due to lack of needed parts. This will cause cancellations of domestic flights. Many Russian operators fly European, and U.S.-built aircraft. Once the flow of the parts stops, the reliability of the airlines will be adversely affected.

Meanwhile, a number of leased Russian planes will be recalled or seized in the next few weeks because the latest EU sanctions cut off the supply of planes, parts and technology to that country and its ability to insure planes starting March 28. This will impact Russian air travel as well.

For the aircraft that aren't recalled, it remains to be seen how airlines can make their payments after several major Russian banks were removed from SWIFT, a communications network linking financial institutions worldwide.

Already, European-based aircraft leasing companies are scrambling to recover billions from Russian airlines before the EU's embargo on planes and supplies kick in on March 28. They've also recalled some planes and could seize more.

All of us hope the conflict in Ukraine will end quickly and peacefully. Until then, travelers need to factor the fighting there into their planning. But know that the airlines are doing all they can to maintain our very high level of safety during this challenging time.

We’ve provided answers to common questions below. If you have a question we didn’t answer, please let us know in the comments or you can reach us on Twitter or Facebook.

Survey patterns

One of the most visible quirks of flying at the moment are survey-pattern flights. These flights take place all the time for a variety of reasons. Some flights are capturing imagery for mapping services—‘satellite’ maps used in commercial mapping services are often partially compiled from aerially imagery. Other flights are completing various other surveys using technology like LiDAR. Some of these are working on ecological projects, engineering works, or even checking for leaks in utility pipes.

Ground vehicles

We’re a flight tracker, but we also track airport ground vehicles that are equipped with transponders. Transponder-equipped ground vehicles enhance safety on the airfield by ensuring the vehicles can be seen by air traffic control and other vehicles and aircraft. Ground vehicles visible on Flightradar24 are generally those that are most active in the movement areas of an airport, like airport rescue and fire fighting, ‘follow me’ cars, and push back tugs. At some airports, specialized vehicles like wildlife control and lawnmowers are visible.

Incorrect or missing route display

‘Is that plane really going to…’ is a question we often receive when the route listed doesn’t match the current location or track of the aircraft. The route of the flight is not received directly from the aircraft. Through the use of various schedule databases and what some might call machine learning, but we’ll just call computer magic, we match the call sign the aircraft is broadcasting to a flight number and route for that flight. Sometimes the computer matches the flight incorrectly and sometimes it isn’t matched at all.

A route can be matched incorrectly for a few reasons, but generally it is because the flight is using the same call sign for a flight that previously flew the listed route and we have no received a schedule update for the current flight. For example, Turkish Cargo flight 6492 has flown between Istanbul and Riyadh multiple times recently and been matched correctly, but the airline also uses the flight number for other flights including Istanbul-Entebbe. Because we’re not receiving a schedule update from one of our schedule providers, the flight is incorrectly matched in this case. Schedule matching issues are more likely for cargo or special flights as they may not file a commercial schedule update or the routing is changed at the last minute after we have matched a flight to a route.

I heard a plane, but I don’t see it on Flightradar24

A flight may not be visible on Flightradar24 for different reasons, but most likely it is either outside our coverage in that area or not equipped with a compatible transponder or a combination of the two. Our service operates via line-of-sight radio signals and if receivers in the area are unable to see the aircraft, it cannot be displayed. For some aircraft operating with an older transponder, it is necessary for multiple receivers to see the aircraft in order to display it. That technology is called Multilateration (MLAT), which we’ve written about extensively before.

Restricted aircraft

Operators of private or sensitive aircraft may request their tracking details be restricted or not displayed. Generally, aircraft requesting that they not be displayed on Flightradar24 are military aircraft. Some military aircraft, such as various transport aircraft, are visible.",https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/whats-this-plane-doing-answering-recent-frequently-asked-questions/

Up to this point, all European Union Member States, as well as Albania, Switzerland, Canada, Norway, and the United Kingdom, have banned airlines of Russia from entering their airspace. Authorities in Moscow have taken similar measures, banning all flights from these countries from entering their airspace, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.

Amid raised safety concerns, the military attack on Ukraine by Russia has raised serious questions about whether it is safe to fly to and within Europe.

Besides, the war in Ukraine has also affected many European airlines, with airBaltic, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Jet2, KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Scandinavian Airlines, Swiss International Airlines, and Wizz Air being the most affected ones, as reported by Euronews.

airBaltic

Amid raised safety concerns, the Latvian airline has suspended all flights to Russia until the end of May. Russian authorities have also taken reciprocity measures.

“Due to the airspace limitations, a small number of airBaltic routes are adjusted, without a significant increase in the flight time,” a spokesperson from the airline said.

Austrian Airlines

Following the example of other airlines, Austrian Airlines has also suspended flights to Ukraine until March 26. At the same time, flights to Kyiv and Odessa have been cancelled since February 21.

Regarding flights to neighbouring countries, the airline said that “We continue to monitor the situation closely and are in close contact with national and international authorities. The safety of our passengers and crew members is our top priority at all times.”

British Airways

British Airways has also cancelled its flights to Russia’s capital, warning that such a decision would lead to rerouting some services to Asia, causing longer journey time.

Russian authorities have also been banned from landing at Russian airports.

Jet2

The airline has suspended all flights to Poland, at the same time cancelling flights to Krakow from late March until the end of May. Such a decision was announced through a statement published by the airline on March 9.

KLM

The Dutch airline has also cancelled all flights to Russia.

In this regard, the airline said the decision was prompted by sanctions imposed by EU states.

“This means KLM can no longer guarantee that flights to Russia or passing over Russian territory can return safely,” the statement reads.

Lufthansa

The German airline Lufthansa has also suspended flights to Russia.

“Lufthansa Group continues to monitor the situation closely and is in close exchange with national and international authorities,” a spokesperson pointed out in this regard.

Ryanair

The airline has also suspended flights to Ukraine and Russia for an unlimited period due to the current situation in Ukraine.",https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/these-are-the-most-affected-airlines-by-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/

In addition, Europe’s aviation regulator has warned airlines not to operate flights in bordering areas of Russia and Belarus due to military activities, SchengenVisaInfo.com reports.

The President of Russia Vladimir Putin authorised a military operation in Ukraine, while the latter was attacked through multiple borders, according to the report of the Ukrainian State Border Service early Thursday.

“At about 5:00 a.m., the state border of Ukraine in the area with the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus was attacked by Russian troops supported by Belarus,” the service pointed out in this regard.

The same said that attacks are being carried out in Luhansk, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Zhytomyr areas, targeting border patrols, units and checkpoints.

The Ukraine State Air Traffic Services Enterprise said that the airspace was closed to flights from 0045 GMT on Thursday while stressing that air traffic services have also been suspended.

According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), airspace in Russia and Belarus could also pose safety risks.

“In particular, there is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft. The presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems pose a high risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels,” the agency emphasised.

EASA stressed that Russia’s defence ministry had addressed Ukraine with an urgent message warning of high risk to flight safety as a result of the use of weapons and military equipment from 0045 GMT while calling on Ukraine’s air traffic control to stop flights.

The current situation has led Ukraine’s neighbouring countries to be prepared for an influx of migrants.

“We have to be prepared for a wave of up to a million people,” the Deputy Interior Minister, Maciej Wąsik, pointed out in this regard, as reported by the Guardian.

The Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary could also receive a large number of migrants from Ukraine.

According to a recent report by Al Jazeera, about five million people could leave Ukraine in the worst-case scenario.

Authorities in Ukraine announced that ten European airlines cancelled or suspended flights to this country.

In addition, several European countries such as Ireland, Norway, Netherlands, Switzerland and France advised their citizens not to travel to Ukraine due to the current situation that the latter is facing.",https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/ukraine-closes-airspace-to-civilian-flights-including-those-from-eu/

Airspace over all of Ukraine has been shut down to civilian air traffic, according to a notice posted to air crews early Thursday.

A commercial flight tracking website shows that an Israeli El Al Boeing 787 from Tel Aviv to Toronto turned abruptly out of Ukrainian airspace before detouring over Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland.

The only other aircraft tracked over Ukraine is a U.S. RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane that began flying westward out of Ukraine after Russia put in place flight restrictions over Ukrainian territory.

The Ukrainian government is closing airports in eastern Ukraine from midnight through 7 a.m. because of the confrontation with Russia.

Ukrainian aviation authorities also have declared some airspace in the east to be “danger areas” because of attempts by Russian aviation authorities to seize control of the airspace.

Ukraine acted after Russia issued a ban on civilian air traffic in airspace over eastern Ukraine.

The announcement Wednesday night establishes buffer zones for traffic controlled by Ukrainian authorities to avoid coming into potentially hazardous conflict with air traffic controlled by Russian authorities.

Last week, Ukrainian aviation officials warned pilots in the region to be on the lookout for Russian authorities trying to take control of the airspace and to only recognize Ukraine’s controllers.

United Nations

The U.N. Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting Wednesday night at the request of Ukraine, which says there is an immediate threat of a Russian invasion.

The meeting comes two days after the 15-member council held an emergency open meeting also requested by Ukraine. That session saw no support for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s declaration of independence for two separatist areas in Ukraine’s east and his announcement that Russian troops would be heading there to keep the peace.

The meeting Wednesday night comes as council diplomats are finalizing a draft resolution that they say would make clear that Russia is violating the U.N. Charter, international law and a 2015 council resolution endorsing the Minsk agreements aimed at restoring peace in eastern Ukraine.

They say the resolution would urge Russia to get back into compliance immediately.

Australia extends visa deadlines for Ukrainians

Australia’s prime minister says Ukrainians in Australia whose Australian visas will expire by the end of June will be allowed to stay an additional six months.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison also said Thursday that Ukrainians applying for Australian visas will be given priority over other nationalities.

Morrison made the announcement a day after Australia imposed sanctions on eight members of Russia’s Security Council in response to Russia’s actions against Ukraine.

Sanctions have also been placed on a series of banks and financial institution. Sanctions that have existed since 2014 on the transport, energy, minerals and telecommunications sectors have been extended to rebel-held areas of Ukraine that Russia recognizes as independent.

Zelenskyy addresses Ukraine

Ukraine’s president is rejecting Moscow’s claim that his country poses a threat to Russia and warns that a looming Russian invasion could cause tens of thousands of deaths.

RELATED

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the comments in a video address early Thursday.

Speaking emotionally in Russia, he said: “The people of Ukraine and the government of Ukraine want peace. But if we come under attack that threaten our freedom and lives of our people we will fight back.”

Zelenskyy says he tried to call Russian President Vladimir Putin late Wednesday but the Kremlin remained silent.

‘False Flag’ accusation by White House

The White House says the request by Ukrainian separatists for Russian military assistance in the face of supposed “aggression” by Ukraine’s government is an example of the “false flag” operations the West has consistently warned against.

The U.S. and allies have alleged for weeks that Russia would try to create a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine through the use of such operations.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki says the Kremlin’s announcement Wednesday that the separatists are seeking help “is an example” of such an operation.

Psaki adds that “we’ll continue to call out what we see as false flag operations or efforts to spread misinformation about what the actual status is on the ground.”

Rebels ask Moscow for help

The Kremlin says the rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine have asked Russia for military assistance to fend off the Ukrainian “aggression.”

RELATED

The appeal raises the prospect of Russia’s direct military involvement in eastern Ukraine amid Western fears that Moscow is poised to launch an all-out invasion of its neighbor.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the rebel chiefs wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin to tell him that shelling by the Ukrainian military has caused civilian deaths and forced many people to flee.

The move comes after Putin recognized the independence of Russia-backed rebel regions in eastern Ukraine and signed friendship treaties with them. On Tuesday, Russian lawmakers gave Putin permission to use military forces outside the country.

State of emergency in Ukraine

Lawmakers in Ukraine have approved a nationwide state of emergency amid fears of an all-out Russian invasion.

The parliament approved Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s decree that imposes the measure for 30 days starting Thursday. The state of emergency allows authorities to impose restrictions on movement, block rallies and ban political parties and organizations “in the interests of national security and public order.”

(Ivan Petrov/AP)

The move follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s move Monday to recognize the independence of two rebel regions in eastern Ukraine, where a nearly eight-year conflict with the pro-Russia rebels has left over 14,000 dead. Putin has sanctioned the deployment of Russian troops there to “maintain peace” and received a parliamentary approval to use military force outside the country.

Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly voiced concerns that Russia could try destabilize Ukraine by relying on Moscow supporters inside the country, including a pro-Russia political party in parliament.

Ukraine hit by more cyberattacks

Ukrainian government and banking websites have been knocked offline with another wave of distributed-denial-of-service attacks.

The targets Wednesday included the defense, foreign and interior ministries, as well as Privatbank, the country’s largest commercial bank.

Many of the same sites were similarly hit in Feb.13-14 attacks that the U.S. and U.K. governments quickly blamed on Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency. Such attacks barrage websites with junk traffic, rendering them unreachable.

Wednesday’s DDoS attacks appeared to be less impactful than the previous onslaught, with targeted sites soon reachable again as emergency responders blunted them.

This CZIB is issued on the basis of information currently available to EU Member States and EU institutions.

In the light of the latest developments, in particular:

on-going military activities in the territory of Ukraine;

the NOTAM UKBV A0586/22 issued by Ukraine stating that FIR LVIV (UKLV), FIR KYIV (UKBV), FIR DNIPROPETROVSK (UKDV), FIR SIMFEROPOL (UKFV), FIR ODESA (UKOV) are closed for civil aviation flights;

the information on a Danger Area affecting, inter alia, the airspace of Ukraine and neighbouring countries, issued by the Russian Federation, and

the NOTAM A0064/22 and associated AIP SUP 004/2022 issued by Moldova, stating that FIR CHISINAU (LUUU) is closed for all flights, except for a defined portion of airspace allowing arrivals to and departures from Chisinau airport (LUKK);

air operators are reminded that the affected airspace defined above is an active conflict zone or is bordering an active conflict zone.

Under these circumstances, the aforementioned airspace and critical infrastructure, including airports, are exposed to military activities which result in safety risks for civil aircraft. In particular, there is a risk of both intentional targeting and misidentification of civil aircraft.

The presence and possible use of a wide range of ground and airborne warfare systems poses a HIGH risk for civil flights operating at all altitudes and flight levels.
