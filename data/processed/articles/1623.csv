WASHINGTON -- Republican U.S. senators are imploring the Biden administration to reverse course and allow the transfer of Poland's MiG fighter jets to the Ukrainians to fight the Russian invasion, a sign the Defense Department's rejection of the offer may be running into steep resistance on Capitol Hill.

Forty GOP senators signed onto a letter Thursday from Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Mitt Romney of Utah urging President Joe Biden to answer the plea from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who told lawmakers over the weekend that if the U.S. could not help with a no-fly zone over his skies, it could at least send more planes for his people to defend against the attack from Russia.

“Enough talk. People are dying,” Romney said at a press conference on Capitol Hill. “Send them the planes they need.”

The groundswell of Republican opposition to the Pentagon’s rejection of Poland’s offer has apparently caught the attention of the highest ranks of the administration — senators said Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was reaching out in calls to Capitol Hill.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it's hard to see the destruction — especially the Russian airstrike on a maternity hospital — and be opposed to providing the Ukrainians ""with these essential aircraft.”

The Biden administration had initially indicated that the Soviet-era planes now in NATO ally Poland could be transferred to help provide air support as Ukraine battles Russia's assault. But the Pentagon on Wednesday slammed the door on a surprise offer from Poland to instead transfer the planes to NATO by handing them off at a U.S. base in Germany. The Pentagon said the planes are not the most effective weaponry and the Polish plan could run a “high risk” of escalating the war.

The GOP senators rejected the administration's arguments, saying the U.S. needs to stand by its commitments and provide Zelenskyy what he needs to defend Ukraine, as ordinary people take up arms in what many around the world have viewed as a heroic effort to save their country.

""We implore you to act without delay to provide urgently needed airpower that will bolster the ability of the Ukrainian armed forces to defend their country and help save civilian lives,” the senators wrote.

The Republican senators dismissed the Pentagon's concern that transferring the planes through NATO would be viewed by Russia as provocative at a time when the U.S. is already sending anti-aircraft missiles and other military support to the Ukrainians.

The senators also argued that the logistical problems the administration has raised against replacing Poland's MiGs with U.S. F-16s, which have been promised elsewhere, could be handled in other ways, perhaps with other surplus aircraft in U.S. storage.

While some on and off Capitol Hill have argued that lethal drones and anti-aircraft missiles could be more effective in the fight against Russian airpower, some of the GOP senators argued for an all-of-the-above approach.

Mostly the senators were hopeful — if not confident — that if they applied pressure to the White House it would reverse course. That has happened repeatedly in recent weeks, as lawmakers pushed the White House to take a tougher stand than the Biden administration first appeared willing to take.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky criticized the Biden administration for moving too slowly to send military help to Ukraine. Congress on Thursday gave final approval to a $13.6 billion package of military and humanitarian assistance.

“This administration has been a step behind every step of the way,” McConnell said.

“The Ukrainians need airplanes, they need equipment to fight with,” McConnell said. “They need this assistance and they need it right now.”

Senators pointed to the bipartisan push from Congress for sanctions on Russia, an end to the Nord Stream 2 energy pipeline and a ban on Russian oil imports as examples of policy decisions where the White House did a 180-degree turn, as Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, put it at the news conference.

“Every hour that goes by that we are not stepping up with our aid, whether it's legal or otherwise, we have Ukrainians dying,” Ernst said. “We need to provide everything we can.”",https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/gop-senators-urge-biden-send-polish-warplanes-ukraine-83383009

""So far, Russian forces have been stymied by stiff Ukrainian resistance, and we must redouble our efforts to prevent a brutal and unlawful takeover of Ukraine. We urge your administration to work with Poland and our NATO allies to expedite the transfer of urgently-needed airpower, air defense systems and other combat and support capabilities from the United States, NATO allies, and other European partners to Ukraine,"" the senators wrote in a letter to President Joe Biden on Thursday.

The letter, signed by 42 Republicans including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, came after U.S. officials rejected a proposal from Poland to transfer its Soviet-era MiG fighter jets to Ukraine through a U.S. military base in Germany.

The Defense Department has said such a handover would be a “high risk” step that could ratchet up tensions with Russia and risk direct military conflict.

If Ukrainian pilots go to a NATO country to pick up fighter jets and then fly them back into contested Ukrainian airspace, where they might have to engage with Russian fighters, Western officials worry, Moscow could view the country they left from as a combatant and therefore fair game. And NATO’s core tenet, spelled out in Article 5 of its charter, is that an attack on any member country is an attack on all, meaning all 30 member states would be obligated to join the fight.

U.S. military and intelligence officials have also determined that more jets are unlikely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force, and experts outside the government have noted that Ukraine hasn’t deployed many of the MiGs it already owns. That has made them wonder whether the country has the complex infrastructure needed to support the aircraft, from trained pilots and mechanics to extra parts, munitions and jet fuel.

The senators, however, said in their letter that the explanation they received from the Pentagon about why the U.S. has declined Poland's plan isn't adequate.

“Send these MiGs,"" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said at a news conference Thursday with other GOP colleagues. ""And the question is, well, why aren’t they being sent? Because we’ve heard now for days that this is something that’s being discussed. Enough talk. People are dying, send them the planes that they need.""

""That’s what they say they want,"" he added. ""They’re there. They have the eyes to determine what they want.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said it was a ""good day for Putin, bad day for the Ukraine and a dishonorable day for America"" because the U.S. is not providing Ukraine with aircraft to defend its airspace.

A growing number of U.S. lawmakers ratcheted up pressure on President Biden on Sunday to increase military aid to Ukraine, including sending fighter jets and air defense systems that the administration rejected last week. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The public calls from both Republicans and Democrats to answer Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s urgent pleas for air assistance come as the Biden administration declined an offer from Poland to deliver MiG-29 airplanes to Ukraine for fear such a move could be interpreted by the Russians as an escalation of the United States’ role in the war.

The bipartisan push underscores the growing hawkishness among many leaders on Capitol Hill, who have been urging Biden to do more to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian attacks as the war rages into its third week.

“[Russian President] Vladimir Putin and the Russians seem to be saying everything is escalatory. And yet they’re escalating every single day by coming into Ukraine with these weapons,” Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“This is an illegal — this is a brutal — totally unprovoked attack,” he added, emphasizing the horrors of civilian targets hit. “So, as they escalate, what the Ukrainian people are asking for is just the ability to defend themselves.”

Portman was part of a four-person bipartisan delegation of senators who traveled to Poland on Sunday who called on the White House to send air assistance to Ukraine, arguing that the country increasingly needs help to push back Russian forces. The others on the trip were Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), a staunch supporter of former president Donald Trump; moderate Democrat Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.); and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), one of the more liberal members of the Democratic caucus.

Portman argued that because Putin has already declared other forms of U.S. military aid escalatory, sending planes to Ukraine would not risk intensifying the conflict.

Separately, 58 members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus on Sunday again urged the Biden administration to try to facilitate the fighter jet deal with Poland, as well as to provide Ukraine with other air defense systems, including drones and surface-to-air missiles.

“Russia’s advantage in this domain could soon develop into air dominance if the Ukrainians do not receive necessary military aid,” the caucus members, who are evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, said in a new statement. “We commend the Polish government for taking proactive steps to deliver MiG-29 jets to the Ukrainian Air Force. We urge assistance to help facilitate this deal, commit to replenishing our allies’ fleets with American-made aircraft and help advance the transfer of [other] aircraft to Ukraine as well.”

The entreaties by both Democrats and Republicans on the White House come as Russia has continued to escalate its attacks in Ukraine. In addition, Russia has turned to China for military equipment and aid in the weeks since it began its invasion of Ukraine, U.S. officials familiar with the matter told The Washington Post, a move that could draw in a major world power into the conflict.

Russian forces are closing in on Kyiv and, early Sunday, unleashing missile attacks on a military facility a mere 15 miles from the border with Poland, a NATO member country. The strikes killed at least 35 and injured 134, and intensified fears that NATO could be drawn into a direct conflict with Russia.

Speaking from near the Poland-Ukraine border on Sunday, Portman said the bombing of the military facility in western Ukraine was close enough to be heard on the Polish side.

Ukrainians, he added, badly needed air defense systems to have better control over the skies for a “fighting chance” at winning the war. Portman also noted the United States has already provided shoulder-fired Stinger missiles and military helicopters to Ukraine, as recently as January.

“And those are directly from the United States. In this case, this would be Poland providing these airplanes, which are Soviet-style planes, old planes, MiG-29s,” Portman, a co-chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, said on CNN.

The White House has defended its decision to decline Poland’s offer, saying there were “a range of logistical operational challenges” that would come with delivering the warplanes.

Poland had said it was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base, an American military facility in Germany, but the Pentagon struck down the proposal, saying fighter jets departing from a U.S. or NATO base could be seen as an escalation of tensions with Russia. The Kremlin also warned on Saturday that convoys carrying U.S. or NATO weapons into Ukraine would be “legitimate targets” for attack.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday that Biden had consulted with NATO allies and military advisers and “ultimately determined that the risk/benefit analysis of flying planes from NATO bases into contested airspace over Ukraine did not make sense.” Biden has, however, been in contact with Zelensky about providing other anti-air systems, he said.

Klobuchar did not explicitly criticize the Biden administration on Sunday. But, breaking with most other Democrats, she said she would still like to see the United States send fighter planes to Ukraine, even if they weren’t the specific MiG-29 jets discussed.

“At some point, there’s been so much focus on these planes, especially these particular planes, that they themselves could become a target,” Klobuchar said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

She suggested that other effective weapons like drones and Javelins would also help Ukrainians in their fight. “One of the things we have to remember is, this is all about air defense,” she said.

Klobuchar said she had spoken with Biden 10 days ago to make her position clear, but understood that “things shift” in wartime. She stressed that there were negotiations about military aid that could and likely were happening outside of the public view for security reasons.

“I still don’t rule out having planes at some point,” Klobuchar said. “But, again, you take one day at a time and make the best defense system decisions. And that can’t always be discussed on the air, or you would be giving Vladimir Putin the road map to what NATO wants to do here to help protect Ukraine.”

Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday that the debate over the Polish fighter jets last week reminded him of a ping-pong game, with the two sides hitting a ball back and forth in what, to him, was a “diplomatic mystery.”

“We have no time for this kind of ping-pong diplomacy. We need planes to save lives of our people,” Kuleba said.

Ukrainian officials have continued their pleas for the United States and its NATO allies to help enact a “no-fly zone” over Ukrainian airspace, a move the allies have thus far rejected, also out of fear it would be seen by Russia as an escalation into a wider war.

But those who have urged more military support for Ukraine argue that the war and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine are already rapidly intensifying. An American journalist, Brent Renaud, was fatally shot while reporting outside of Kyiv, and Russian forces reportedly kidnapped a second mayor.

Republicans have for weeks pushed for more sanctions, earlier, and have accused Biden of responding to Putin from a position of weakness.

Though some GOP support for NATO eroded during the Trump administration — led by the former president’s public disdain for the NATO alliance — many Republican lawmakers have been quick to criticize Biden for doing too little, too late, to lead his European allies.

“The world needs the Biden administration to be flying this plane,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Thursday, arguing that supporting Ukraine is not a provocation. “Too often it feels like the plane is flying them.”

Democrats so far have defended Biden’s approach to the crisis, saying that Biden has succeeded in uniting the world to oppose Putin and rally support for Ukraine.

“I don’t know that it’s constructive for us to continue to try to manage this crisis day to day,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said last week. “I think there is a bit of a blind momentum around this question of, more and more and more. That is not always connected to what Ukraine actually needs to defend themselves.”

Sullivan acknowledged Sunday that Russia’s bombing of the military base in western Ukraine suggested Putin would likely ramp up his invasion.

“What it shows is that Vladimir Putin is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv,” Sullivan said. “That he is expanding the number of targets that he is lashing out [at] and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country.”

Sullivan reiterated on “Face the Nation” Biden’s insistence that U.S. military forces would not be drawn into fighting Russian troops on Ukrainian soil, but if Russian attacks spread to Poland or another NATO ally, that would “bring the full force of the NATO alliance to bear in responding.”

When it came to reports that Russia may be preparing to use chemical weapons to attack Ukraine, Sullivan declined to specify if that would be a new “red line” for increased U.S. intervention.

“Sitting here before you today, I’m not going to go further than what President Biden said on Friday, which is that the Russians would pay a severe price if they were to move forward with chemical weapons,” Sullivan said.

Condemning Washington's decision to refuse Poland's proposition, the senators in a letter to Biden said that the US must ""transfer aircraft...(to meet) dire need of lethal aid"" to counter the aggravated Russian aggression against Ukraine. The senators also mentioned that they ""strongly disagree"" with Biden's administration over its stance on Poland's offer.

In the letter, the senators also urged the US to work with its NATO allies to support Ukraine Armed Forces and provide adequate resources. However, administration officials believe that uniting behind Poland's proposal could pull the Western alliance into a confrontation with Russia. Given that Ukrainian Air Force is largely intact, the US also predicted that agreeing to the Polish offer could risk escalation without significantly changing the situation in Europe.

Following the submission of the letter, Senators Romney and Ernst addressed a press conference where they reiterated calls for the White House to accept Warsaw's proposal. ""I want to underscore the feelings in my heart and the feelings of every person I know in this great country of affection and concern and hope for the people of Ukraine, and admiration of President Zelenskyy in his effort to lead the world. He has asked us for aircraft—specifically MiGs. We need to get him those MiGs. It is a bipartisan message—not just us,"" Senator Romney said.

""Enough talk. People are dying. Send them the planes that they need. They say they need MiGs. People say, well maybe that’s not the ideal weapon for them. That is what they say they want. They are there. They have the eyes to determine what they want. They want MiGs. Get them the MiGs,"" he added.

US denies Polish offer to provide MiG-29 fighters to Kyiv

In a bid to deter Russia's offensive against Ukraine, Poland on Tuesday said that it is ready to hand over its MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. However, it added that the aircraft would be delivered only to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, leaving the decision to deliver them to Ukraine up to the US and NATO alliance. As the announcement came as a surprise for the US officials, they quickly rejected the idea as Pentagon stated the proposal of sending fighters from a US/NATO base “to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance.”

Poland's plane offer also faced a major setback as Pentagon spokesperson Kirby declared that the scheme was ""not tenable."" He underscored that Washington is not clear about the ""substantive rationale"" for the proposal. ""We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” FT quoted.

Nearly 2mn displaced in Russia-Ukraine war

The developments came after the US House approved a mass spending bill worth $13.6 billion in aid on Wednesday to help war-torn Ukraine and affected European allies. After two weeks into the war, resulting in massive devastation and deaths, Russian forces on Wednesday agreed to humanitarian corridors in order to allow mass evacuation of civilians from war zones. According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, around 40,000 people have been evacuated so far through green corridors. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Ukraine and thousands more injured since February 24 after Putin announced and full-blown ""military operations"" on its ex-Soviet neighbour. As per the UN refugee wing, at least 2 million people have fled the country in the wake of the raging war.

5,ab0c9db0-4392-4bf9-a522-ae8992e6eff2,['Edward Helmore'],2022-03-13 00:00:00,"A senior Republican senator on Sunday said the Ukrainian people were urging the US and Nato to “close the skies” over Ukraine, hours after a logistics hub and training base for foreign fighters 11 miles from the Polish border was struck by Russian forces, killing 35.

“People are just distraught and the message they’re giving us is loud and clear, as you can imagine, which is close the skies because the skies are where the bombs are coming, whether the missile attacks or airplane attacks or the artillery,” Ohio senator Rob Portman told CNN during a visit to the Poland-Ukraine border.

The US intelligence community has said that any attempt to create a no-fly zone would risk escalation. The US has also turned down a Polish offer to supply jets to Ukraine via an American airbase in Germany.

Asked if supplying Ukraine with Russian-made MiG-29s could trigger a third world war, Portman told CNN’s State of the Union he “didn’t know why that would be true”.

“The Russians have complained about everything,” he said. “Vladimir Putin has said that the sanctions are an act of war.”

Russia, Portman said, “complained when we provided Stingers directly from the US government, which can knock down an airplane and have been successful in doing that at lower altitudes. We have given [Ukraine] helicopters.

“What we have heard directly from the Ukrainians is they want [the jets] badly. They want the ability to have better control over the skies in order to give them a fighting chance. So I don’t understand why we’re not doing it.”

Portman welcomed an indication from Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, that anti-aircraft systems could be provided.

Sullivan repeated Joe Biden’s opposition to the transfer of “offensive” weapons while underlining commitment to supplying “defensive” arms, telling CBS’s Face the Nation the US and allies “believe in our capacity to continue to flow substantial amounts of military assistance, weapons and supplies to the front in Ukraine.

“We have been successful in doing so thus far and we believe we have a system in place that will allow us to continue to do so, notwithstanding Russian threats.”

Russia claimed the strike on the Yavoriv base was against foreign fighters and weapons. The Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, told ABC’s This Week no Americans were at the facility.

But Kirby reiterated that the US and allies would “continue to flow and to move and to reposition forces and capabilities along Nato’s eastern flank to make sure that we can defend every inch of Nato territory if we need to.

“We’ve made it very clear to Russia that Nato territory will be defended not just by the United States, but by our allies.”

Of calls to supply jets or announce a no-fly zone, Kirby said: “We can all understand the kind of escalatory measure that might be perceived as.”

The US deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, said Russia showed signs of “willingness to have real, serious negotiations”, despite four sets of talks having failed.

Sherman told Fox News Sunday the US had been working to “put enormous pressure on Vladimir Putin to try to change his calculus, to end this war, to get a ceasefire in the first instance, to get humanitarian corridors, and to end this invasion”.

“That pressure is beginning to have some effect,” Sherman said, though she added: “It appears that Vladimir Putin is intent on destroying Ukraine.”

On Saturday, the White House approved an additional $200m of military assistance.

“We are determined and the Ukrainians are determined to ensure that anti-tank, anti-armor, anti-air capabilities, ammunition and other forms of assistance actually do make it to the front to blunt the Russian advance,” Sullivan told NBC’s Meet the Press. “We’re coordinating the efforts of our allies and partners to do the same thing.”

Last week, Biden warned of a “severe price” if Russia used chemical or biological weapons. Sullivan said Russian claims about supposed Ukrainian bio-weapons labs signaled that Moscow could be preparing to do so.

“When Russia starts accusing other countries of potentially doing something, it’s a good tell that they may be on the cusp of doing it themselves,” he said.

“What we’re here to do is to deny them the capacity to have a false flag operation to blame this on the Ukrainians or on us, to take away their pretext and to make the world understand that if chemical weapons are used in Ukraine, it is the Russians who will have used them. And the response will, as the president said, be severe.”

Sullivan met with China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Rome on Monday. Sullivan said the US would respond to any attempts to work around western sanctions on Russia.

“We have made it clear to not just Beijing but every country in the world that if they think that they can basically bail Russia out, they can give Russia a workaround to the sanctions that we’ve imposed, they should have another think coming because we will ensure that neither China, nor anyone else, can compensate Russia for these losses,” Sullivan told NBC.

He declined to lay out what steps the US might take, saying: “We will communicate that privately to China, as we have already done and will continue to do.”

Later, in response to reports Moscow had asked Beijing for military equipment, the Chinese embassy in the US said China’s top priority was to prevent the situation in Ukraine from getting out of control.

The economic consequences of the war in Ukraine have yet to register heavily in US polls. On CNN, Portman deployed a Republican attack line, blaming Biden for not expanding domestic drilling for oil. Biden has countered that US oil companies have not exploited existing permits.

A CBS poll found that 77% of Americans across the political spectrum are willing to pay more for gas as a result of sanctions to punish Russia. According to the poll, 69% said economic pain now might be a wise hedge against bigger problems later.

Dear Mr. President:

Supporting Ukraine’s fight for freedom against the tyrannical, lawless Russian invasion of Ukraine’s sovereign territory is among the most urgent missions the West has faced in a generation. So far, Russian forces have been stymied by stiff Ukrainian resistance, and we must redouble our efforts to prevent a brutal and unlawful takeover of Ukraine. We urge your Administration to work with Poland and our NATO allies to expedite the transfer of urgently-needed airpower, air defense systems, and other combat and support capabilities from the United States, NATO allies, and other European partners to Ukraine.

While we commend the lethal aid that your Administration has sent to Ukraine thus far, we strongly disagree with your decision to delay and deny Poland the option to transfer fighter jets to Ukraine. Your Administration champions the $1 billion in defense articles provided to Ukraine over the past 13 months and has definitively stated there are no restrictions in your current suite of authorities to adequately respond to Russia's lawless and bloody invasion of Ukraine. We implore you to direct your Department of Defense to facilitate the transfer of aircraft, air defense systems, and other capabilities by and through our NATO partners immediately.

Today, Russia’s assault is trained on the Ukrainian people, public infrastructure, farms, hospitals, daycares, places of work, and even their homes. The Ukrainian military is in dire need of more lethal aid today to defend the foundations of their country that will allow it to function in the future. We cannot allow Putin to gain an advantage because of a failure to provide the Ukrainians with needed weaponry, ammunition, communications equipment, and medical supplies.

We implore you to act without delay to provide urgently needed airpower that will bolster the ability of the Ukrainian armed forces to defend their country and help save civilian lives.

7,ab0c9db0-4392-4bf9-a522-ae8992e6eff2,['Social Links For Steven Nelson'],2022-03-11 00:00:00,"President Biden on Friday defended his decision to veto the US-facilitated transfer of fighter jets to Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion, saying, “that’s called World War III.”

Biden faces bipartisan blowback for rejecting Poland’s offer to transfer 28 Soviet-designed MiG-29s — after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that Poland had a “green light.”

“The idea that we’re going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews — just understand, don’t kid yourself, no matter what y’all say, that’s called World War III,” Biden told a gathering of House Democrats in Philadelphia.

Poland offered to fly the jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where the US would facilitate the transfer. It was unclear whether US or Ukrainian pilots would fly the planes into Ukraine pursuant to the spiked Polish plan.

Biden went on to defend his economic record — blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for annual inflation hitting a fresh 40-year high of 7.9 percent in February, up from 7.5 percent in January.

“One-third of all the inflation in America last year was because of the price of automobiles… the companies couldn’t get semiconductors,” Biden said. “The second big reason for inflation is Vladimir Putin. From the moment he put his over 150,000 troops on the Ukrainian border, the price of gasoline in January went up 75 cents.”

Biden continued: “Putin began amassing troops along the border and guess what? The world took notice. And those who would work in the business know that the market anticipated — the prices went up more. Then Putin invaded. Make no mistake, inflation is largely the fault of Putin.”

Inflation began to take off before the White House started warning in November that a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine could be a prelude to an invasion.

Biden previously blamed inflation on supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In December, he claimed that the prior month’s 6.8 percent annual inflation rate was likely the “peak.” He said in July that inflation was “temporary” when it was around 5 percent.

Biden insisted that his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and his policies of curbing oil pipeline projects and drilling had little effect on inflation.

“Let’s get something straight here: The Keystone Pipeline was two years away. It had been 2 percent finished. Give me a break,” the president said 14 months after blocking the controversial project.

Biden blamed energy companies for not drilling for more oil, saying, “the oil companies and executives, they don’t want to pump more oil.”

President Biden said he didn’t want to trigger “World War III” by transferring fighter jets to Ukraine. AP

“Don’t tell me gas prices rose because I’ve slowed down the American energy production,” Biden said before arguing that “Putin’s gas tax has pushed prices up higher.”

The White House has made a concerted push to blame Putin for higher gas prices, particularly after the US banned Russian oil imports this week. Fuel cost can indirectly increase the cost of other goods, aggravating inflation.

“Democrats didn’t cause this problem. Vladimir Putin did,” Biden insisted once again Friday.

However, the latest monthly inflation data released Thursday covered only the first four days of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

The average price of US gasoline was $4.34 per gallon on Friday, up sharply from about $3.60 on the last day of February. The national average started at about $3.45 in February before nudging higher after hovering around $3.30 in January.

Biden defended his decision to block new planes for Ukraine as he faces intense bipartisan pressure to reconsider his decision to ax the aircraft transfer.

Poland offered to fly the jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where the US would facilitate the transfer. It was unclear whether US or Ukrainian pilots would fly the planes into Ukraine pursuant to the spiked Polish plan.

Forty Republican senators wrote Biden a letter Thursday urging him to reconsider and several Democrats have been sharply critical of that decision.

“There is bipartisan support to provide these planes,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) said Thursday. “It is disappointing to see the reluctance on the part of the administration. It’s coming across as indecision and bickering among members of the administration, which is not helpful to the cause.”

“Time is of the essence,” said Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “I understand why NATO and the United States are not engaged in a no-fly zone [in Ukraine]. That has potential [for] direct conflict with Russia, but I don’t understand why we are not working to facilitate planes to Ukraine.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that US military officials had assessed “that adding aircraft to the inventory is not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force relative to Russian capability.”

Psaki added, “The Ukrainian air force has several squadrons of fully mission-capable aircraft and although Russian air capabilities are significant, their effectiveness has been limited due to Ukrainian strategic operational and tactical ground-based air defense systems — surface-to-air missiles and MANPADS [man-portable air defense systems].”

A senior US defense official said Friday that Ukraine is believed to still have 56 fighter jets that are able to fly about five to 10 missions a day within the country.

It’s unclear why Ukraine has not used its air force to bomb a miles-long Russian convoy north of the capital city, Kyiv, though some experts speculate that Ukrainian leaders are reserving equipment for a potential counterattack if enemy forces get closer to the capital.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pressed for speedy delivery of the aircraft as Russian troops began to encircle the country’s largest cities after two weeks of war.

“Solve it faster,” Zelensky said Wednesday. “Do not shift the responsibility — send us planes.”",https://nypost.com/2022/03/11/thats-called-world-war-iii-biden-defends-decision-not-to-send-jets-to-ukraine/

The United States Senate gave final approval to a $13.6bn emergency military and humanitarian aid package for Ukraine and its European allies late on Thursday, sending the bill to President Joe Biden who has said he will sign the measure.

“We’re giving the Ukrainians billions for food, medicine, shelter, and support for the over two million refugees who have had to leave Ukraine,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, adding the funding would provide for “weapons transfers” of Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles.

The Ukraine aid was attached to an omnibus $1.5 trillion annual spending bill that passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday and was approved by the Senate amid rising anger among US legislators at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that has forced more than 2.5 million people to flee their homes and killed thousands.

President Biden reaffirmed on Thursday the US and NATO allies were sending more weapons and aid to Ukraine.

“We will make sure Ukraine has weapons to defend against an invading Russian force. We will send money and food and aid to save the Ukrainian people,” Biden said in remarks at the White House.

The US has sent more than $1bn in security assistance and military aid to Ukraine during the past year including anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons, “with new shipments arriving every day”, Biden said.

Vice President Kamala Harris visiting Poland on Thursday announced $53m in US humanitarian support to Ukraine bringing to $107m in humanitarian aid provided in the past two weeks along with hundreds of millions in additional aid from 30 other countries, the US president said.

Tens of thousands of tonnes of humanitarian supplies, food, water and medicines are being shipped into Ukraine by truck and rail on daily basis, he said.

Biden and other NATO leaders are under increasing pressure to help Ukraine as images of death and destruction wrought by Russian forces reach Western nations.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the $13.6bn allocates roughly $6.5bn to the Pentagon for military assistance and about $6.7bn to care for refugees and provide economic aid to eastern European allies.

She said the bill is likely to be just the start of much broader aid for Ukraine’s war effort, which other US officials have said could take years or decades.

A group of 40 Republican US senators, meanwhile, are imploring the Biden administration in a letter to reverse course and allow the transfer of Poland’s MiG fighter jets to the Ukrainians to fight the Russian invasion.

“Enough talk. People are dying,” Senator Mitt Romney said at a Capitol Hill media conference on Thursday. “Send them the planes they need.”

General Mark Milley, chairman of the Pentagon’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, was reaching out to members of Congress to discuss the Polish MiG issue with lawmakers, senators said.

Poland took the US by surprise on Tuesday with its public offer to exchange its Russian-made MiG fighter jets in for new US-made F-16 fighters. It intended to turn them over to the US at an American airbase, allowing the MiGs to be re-flagged in Germany and transferred to Ukraine, but the US and NATO rejected the proposal as likely to lead to an expansion of the war.

Republican Senator Susan Collins said it was hard to see the destruction – especially the Russian air raid on a maternity hospital – and be opposed to providing the Ukrainians “with these essential aircraft”.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had implored US lawmakers during the weekend to supply the Polish MiGs to help his people to defend against the attack from Russia.

Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said in a pair of tweets the failure to send MiGs to Ukraine was “a major misstep”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/11/us-congress-gives-final-approval-to-13-6b-ukraine-aid-budget

Poland can send its warplanes to Ukraine without the Biden administration’s approval. No, really, it can — right now, actually. But the issue is Warsaw doesn’t want to, not that President JOE BIDEN unilaterally blocked the handover to Kyiv.

This straightforward point — that Poland is in charge of its MiG-29s, not America — has gotten lost in the brouhaha over the botched U.S.-Poland deal.

After a broader secret arrangement was errantly made public by the European Union’s top diplomat, Washington worked for weeks with Warsaw to salvage the warplane transfer to Ukraine. Ultimately it fell through because Poland wanted the U.S. to act as the middleman instead of directly giving the keys to Ukrainian pilots. The reason? Fear, from all sides.

“They are worried about Russia responding with military strikes against Polish bases, including nuclear strikes,” someone familiar with the Polish government’s thinking told NatSec Daily. In effect, Poland passed the buck to the U.S., hoping America would take the heat while guaranteeing F-16s as a backfill.

Biden and his team didn’t think that was a good idea. Not only did the U.S. fear an open handover of warplanes would ratchet up tensions, but officials in the Pentagon and intelligence community made clear the costs would outweigh the benefits. The president agreed with them, leading the administration to express its opposition to the deal, even though they repeatedly said Poland maintains the sovereign right to give Ukraine its fighter jets.

“The transfer of MiG-29 aircraft will not appreciably increase the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force. The Ukrainian Air Force currently possesses numerous mission capable aircraft that are flying daily. Adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is unlikely to change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force relative to Russian capabilities. Therefore, we assess that the overall gain is low,” Gen. TOD WOLTERS, the U.S. European Command chief, said in a Thursday statement.

A senior U.S. defense official added Friday that the Ukrainians “are not using their fixed-wing fighter aircraft very much. They have about 56 fighter aircraft remaining on the ground, and that is the majority of their fleet.” Kyiv is only flying about five to 10 sorties a day compared to Russia’s roughly 200, the official continued. The Ukrainians “haven't proven that they need to do more than what they're doing. They've been very effective with the other tools that they have used, very creatively, and those are having a good effect on Russian airpower.”

(NatSec Daily can’t help but note that Ukrainians figured out how to drop Molotov cocktails from drones.)

Instead of fighter jets, the U.S. and its allies may soon provide what they deem are more effective weapons to counter Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN’s forces.

“The surface-to-air systems under consideration are more sophisticated than the shoulder-launched, heat-seeking missiles NATO members and others have already provided Ukraine. They include what NATO refers to as the SA-8 and SA-10, which can target planes at much higher altitudes, as well as what Russia calls the S-300, which was a state-of-the-art system until a few years ago,” The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. “The S-300 is an air-defense system, first produced by the Soviet Union and later Russia, that is capable of shooting down aircraft and cruise missiles. The S-300 was designed to be highly mobile, allowing air-defense forces to fire their weapons and quickly relocate to avoid being hit in a retaliatory strike.”

It’s still unclear where the S-300s would come from, but three NATO countries — Bulgaria, Greece and Slovakia — have them.

And yet, all the administration’s critics can talk about is the lack of MiGs, which, again, is Poland’s decision, not America’s.

“[W]e strongly disagree with your decision to delay and deny Poland the option to transfer fighter jets to Ukraine,” 42 Republican senators, led by Sen. JONI ERNST (R-Iowa) and including Senate Minority Leader MITCH McCONNELL, wrote to Biden in a Thursday letter.

“At this point, why are we picking and choosing what we think would constitute a bridge too far with Putin? He has said in the past he thinks sanctions are an act of war. We’ve been sending in military equipment already that is being used against Russian soldiers and likely killing Russian soldiers. We don’t understand why the administration thinks these planes will somehow become the straw that broke the camel’s back,” said a senior House GOP aide.

Democrats are pushing back. “Bottom line is Congress and the admin have poured an unprecedented amount of defensive and lethal aid to Ukraine to meet their most urgent needs. If Ukraine needs planes, we’ll find a way,” a senior Democratic staffer texted NatSec Daily. “But right now, it’s clear that’s not at the top of the list of what they need. But yet again, Republicans seem to be looking for ways to use Ukraine to score political points at home.”

U.S. ENDS NORMAL TRADE TIES WITH RUSSIA: Biden announced that he wants to work with Congress to impose Cold War-era trade restrictions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, our own DOUG PALMER reported.

Removing “permanent normal trade relations,” or PNTR, with Russia “is going to make it harder for Russia to do business with the United States and doing it in unison with other nations that make up half of the global economy will be another crushing blow to the Russian economy. It’s already suffering very badly from our sanctions,” Biden said at a White House event to announce coordinated action with Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom as well as the European Union.

Biden also announced he was banning imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds, which White House officials said collectively totaled more than $1 billion.

The Commerce Department also moved Friday to cut off Russia’s access to luxury goods, imposing restrictions on the export and reexport of American-made booze, jewelry, vehicles and clothing to all consumers in both Russia and neighboring Belarus.

Congress could vote on repealing PNTR as early as next week. “Vladimir Putin doesn’t get to tear down the international order, brutalize the Ukrainian people with his unjust war and then benefit from normal trade relations,” Senate Finance Chair RON WYDEN (D-Ore.) said.

RUSSIAN DRONES ARRIVE: Two weeks into the war, and Russian drones are finally starting to show up on the battlefield. Social media posts by Ukraine watchers have identified Russian Orlan and Forpost surveillance drones on the ground, suggesting that the lack of evidence of Russian unmanned operations doesn’t mean their absence.

The fact that small Russian units have been so regularly ambushed in the early days of the war indicates they weren’t using small drones for surveillance and reconnaissance, in effect ignoring their own doctrine and training, said SAMUEL BENDETT, an adviser with CNA’s Russia Studies Program and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

“They were supposed to have [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] ISR assets overhead,” Bendett said. While the Russian ground forces are still making “strange mistakes and errors, we are starting to see evidence of Russian UAVs as ISR assets” helping them out over the past several days.

The Russian defense ministry — possibly trying to match the epic videos of Ukrainian Bayraktar drones wiping out Russian armor — has released two videos of their Orion mid-range combat drone firing missiles at Ukrainian targets. “They're doing sort of a piecemeal PR by showing that an Orion drone is capable of striking targets,” Bendett said. But it’s still not clear how many drones Russia is flying, or why they don’t seem to be feeding useful intel back to the forces on the ground who continue to be surprised, and attacked, by the Ukrainians.

UKRAINE ON THE BRAIN: Instead of our normal Friday “Drinks with NatSec Daily” feature, for the next few weeks we’ll ask members of our community to send us their favorite things about Ukraine.

Today, we’re featuring the memories of Puck News’ JULIA IOFFE, who has been a must-read source on all things Ukraine these past few weeks. Here’s what she sent in:

“My favorite fact about Ukraine is that it gave us both the Beylis trial and [Ukrainian President] VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY. It is a country that had fought and worked to break away from its past, from its Soviet past, its nationalist, anti-Semitic past. It wasn't always perfect, but it was doing it, forging its way into a better, more tolerant, more democratic future. It is awful to see it being punished for exactly that, for having a future that is unlike its past,” she wrote.

“Favorite memory is sitting with my grandmother one evening on the patio of a traditional Odessa courtyard where we were staying with her cousin Volodya and his Greek-Ukrainian wife Galya. My grandmother's father and Volodya's father were brothers, born in Odessa to a poor, alcoholic Jewish cobbler. There were something like 11 siblings and they all scattered across the Soviet Union. Now we were sitting under the stars in their fathers' home city, drinking beer, and telling old Odessa jokes because Odessa is the wellspring of Jewish humor,” she continued.

Please send us your favorite memories of Ukraine and we’ll try to feature them in an upcoming Friday edition of NatSec Daily.

Flashpoints

EU DOESN’T FAST TRACK UKRAINE MEMBERSHIP: The European Union firmly sided with Ukraine during a summit in Versailles Friday, but stopped short of promising to admit the country into the bloc any time soon.

“The European Council acknowledged the European aspirations and the European choice of Ukraine,” the EU said in a statement, adding that it’s moving “swiftly” to get the European Commission’s “opinion” on the matter. As our own DAVID HERSZENHORN and JACOPO BARIGAZZI reported, all this means is Ukraine is at the “the initial stage of a long process toward being declared a candidate country and beginning membership talks.”

“While the statement was unequivocal in voicing the EU’s intention to help Ukraine, including with political and financial assistance and temporary protection for refugees, it did not offer the guarantee of membership that Zelenskyy had requested,” they continued. “A number of EU countries, led by the Netherlands, had insisted that there was no way to shortcut the lengthy accession process, even for Ukraine, which is under active military attack by Russia.”

Still, the EU will contribute around $550 million in assistance to Ukraine and further pledged to rebuild the country after the war — “presuming the country still exists and has not been occupied by” Russian forces, Herszenhorn and Barigazzi wrote.

DID DRONE FROM UKRAINE WAR LAND IN CROATIA? The War Zone’s TYLER ROGOWAY has a wild story about a drone from the Ukraine-Russia war possibly crash landing in Croatia — a NATO country.

“After close examination of the visual evidence, The War Zone strongly believes this was actually a Tu-141 ‘Strizh’ reconnaissance drone that must have severely malfunctioned and crossed over the entirety of Hungary or parts of neighboring countries and into Croatia from Ukraine. Flying direct from Ukraine's border to Zagreb is nearly a 350-mile journey. It has been reported that Ukraine has been putting the high-speed, Soviet-era drones to work in recent days following Russia's invasion of the country. Ukraine is the only known current operator of the Tu-141,” Rogoway wrote.

Croatian President ZORAN MILANOVIĆ said the drone crash was a “serious incident” but “was not directed at Croatia.”

“The drone flew over Hungary for over 40 minutes, it was less than seven minutes in the Croatian air space, and crashed in the Jarun neighbourhood, fortunately with no casualties,” he said in a Friday statement. “[C]ertain procedural things must be examined, we must ascertain how it has come to this, and how come a drone the size of an airplane was not struck down on its path from evidently Ukraine to Zagreb.”



Keystrokes

YOUTUBE BLOCKS RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA WORLDWIDE: YouTube announced on Friday that it’s banning Russian-state funded media channels on its video platform globally, setting up potential pushback and blockage by Moscow.

Google's video platform announcement has larger implications for how Russia spreads its state-run propaganda through its RT (formerly Russia Today) and Sputnik channels on YouTube, which will no longer be accessible in Russia or the rest of the world. This is an expansion from YouTube's ban of these channels in Europe on March 1, due to the spread of disinformation justifying Russia's invasion into Ukraine.

YouTube's actions — the furthest the platform has taken since Russia's invasion in Ukraine — puts the company square in the target of Russia's communications regulator, Roskomnadzor. The regulator has blocked Facebook and restricted access to Instagram due to their parent company's efforts to clamp down on Russian disinformation and the prevalence of Ukrainians calling for violence against Russian soldiers, our own REBECCA KERN wrote (for Pros!).



WH BRIEFED TIKTOKERS ON UKRAINE: I guess we can now add TikTok stars as extended members of the White House press corps.

Per The Washington Post’s TAYLOR LORENZ, White House press secretary JEN PSAKI and her team briefed 30 influential TikTokers about the administration’s Ukraine policy and strategic goals. The aim — other than promoting viral dances or one-person bits — is to better inform those with large followings so they can spread that message to the larger public.

“This week, the administration began working with Gen Z For Change, a nonprofit advocacy group, to help identify top content creators on the platform to orchestrate a briefing aimed at answering questions about the conflict and the United States’ role in it. VICTORIA HAMMETT, deputy executive director of Gen Z For Change, contacted dozens with invitations via email and gathered potential questions for the Biden administration,” Lorenz wrote.

“The invitations to the event were distributed Tuesday and Wednesday. KAHLIL GREENE, 21, a creator with more than 534,000 followers on TikTok, said he wasn’t surprised when an invitation arrived in his email inbox. ‘People in my generation get all our information from TikTok,’ he said. ‘It’s the first place we’re searching up new topics and learning about things.’ So, he figured, it made sense that the Biden administration would engage people like him on the platform,” Greene told Lorenz.

You can listen to the 50-minute recording of the call, led by special adviser for communications MATT MILLER.



The Complex

HERMEUS PAYDAY: Our friends at Morning Defense (for Pros!) reported that hypersonic aircraft company Hermeus raised $100 million — bringing its total to $176 million to make a new (very) fast plane.

Backers include In-Q-Tel, a nonprofit tech investor for U.S. intelligence agencies, and Founders Fund, the VC outfit that has invested in other start-ups such as Anduril, Palantir and SpaceX.

The Air Force has invested up to $30 million in the Atlanta-based company to expand the hypersonic propulsion industrial base. Hermeus was the only start-up present at the Pentagon’s unclassified meeting in February on hypersonic weapons development.

The new funding will be used to complete the development of the hypersonic aircraft Quarterhorse — which is slated to make its first flight next year — and accelerate the uncrewed Darkhorse. Both projects are expected to assist in development of Halcyon, a hypersonic commercial passenger aircraft.



On the Hill

$1.5B McCONNELL-SCHUMER CALL: McConnell and Senate Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER’s call this week led to the doubling of a $1.5 billion fund to assist Ukraine’s troops.

“While Ukraine came under attack, Congress scrambled to boost lethal and humanitarian aid for the European ally. So as leaders finalized a $1.5 trillion government spending bill that included emergency assistance for Ukraine, the Senate GOP leader phoned his Democratic counterpart this week with a simple but significant request: Double the size of a critical $1.5 billion fund for Ukraine to help its military fight Russian invaders,” our own BURGESS EVERETT and ANDREW DESIDERIO wrote.

“To Chuck’s credit, he said, ‘OK,’” McConnell recalled in an interview Thursday in his Capitol office. “It wasn’t a hard sell.”

All told, the bill Biden will soon sign will more than double his initial request of $6.4 billion for Ukraine to roughly $14 billion. Senators in both parties negotiating the aid deal described a pot of money that ballooned each day as Russia’s assault on Ukraine escalated, killing civilians and sending millions of refugees across Europe.

“I do think that they’ve taken every step they’ve needed to take, but not soon enough to have had a real impact,” McConnell said of the Biden administration. Nonetheless, he described his approach to Biden this way: “What I’m trying to do is, in a respectful way, get him to change. I’m not trying to take political advantage of the situation. I’m trying to influence him.”

FUNDING FIGHT FINISHED: A $1.5 trillion government spending package is ready for Biden's signature after it passed the Senate Thursday night in a 68-31 vote.

The deal provides a major funding hike to the Pentagon. National defense programs — including the Pentagon, nuclear programs and other security initiatives — get $782 billion for the full year, roughly $29 billion more than Biden sought. The package also includes nearly $14 billion in emergency military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.

The package ultimately won strong backing from Democrats, despite progressives' push to hold the line on defense spending. Democrats ultimately agreed to back a big Pentagon increase to lock in a major boost for spending on their domestic priorities.

No Democratic senators opposed the spending package. When the defense portion of omnibus came up for a vote Wednesday in the House, just 15 Democrats voted against it.

Our colleagues SARAH FERRIS and CONNOR O'BRIEN previewed the progressive defense dilemma earlier this week.

EGYPT DEAL SEALED: The Senate on Thursday also rejected in a whopping 19-80 vote a resolution from Sen. RAND PAUL (R-Ky.) to cancel a $2.2 billion sale of a dozen C-130J cargo planes to Egypt over the country's human rights record.

The Biden administration has walked a fine line with Egypt, notifying lawmakers about the sale in January within days of withholding $130 million in military aid due to human rights concerns. But most senators were fine allowing the sale of non-lethal equipment to go forward. Connor has the details.

Broadsides

RUBIO BASHES NSC STAFFER: Sen. MARCO RUBIO wishes there were a dislike button on Instagram so he could smash it for a pic by a top NSC staffer.

Rubio tweeted out an IG picture of JUAN GONZALEZ, the NSC’s Western Hemisphere lead. He recently traveled to Venezuela for a meeting with officials in Caracas, namely to secure the release of Americans hostages and convince Caracas to export oil to the U.S. But the Florida lawmaker — a longtime Venezuela hawk — didn’t appreciate the photo Gonzalez posted on his personal account.

“This is Biden’s NSC staffer for Western Hemisphere posting on instagram like he is a celebrity as he flies in the luxury of a government jet to #Caracas to meet with a narco-dictator responsible for 6 million refugees who have had to flee #Venezuela,” Rubio tweeted.

It’s unclear precisely why this bothered Rubio so much. Perhaps if Gonzalez were on his way somewhere other than Venezuela it wouldn’t have irked him. Still, this social media squabble underscores the intense resistance the White House is facing for thawing relations with Venezuela, including from some Democrats.

Gonzalez did return home having secured the release of two unlawfully detained Americans, however.
