DER SPIEGEL has learned that the BND has new satellite images and has intercepted incriminating radio traffic from Russian military personnel in the region north of Kyiv, where Bucha is located. Some of the intercepted radio traffic might be linked to dead bodies that have been photographed in Bucha.

Following the withdrawal of the Russian military from the town over the weekend, a mass grave was discovered as well as the bodies of several dozen dead civilians left lying on the streets. The hands of some of the victims had been tied, while other bodies showed signs of torture. Numerous women and children are also reportedly among the victims.

The Russian government has vehemently denied that Russian forces are responsible for these war crimes. Several – completely unsubstantiated – claims have been made that the alleged war crimes have been staged by Ukraine. Those claims, however, are contradicted by the statements of numerous witnesses interviewed by reporters from DER SPIEGEL and other news outlets in the town of Bucha.

The intercepted comments now appear to refute Russia’s denials. DER SPIEGEL has learned that the BND briefed parliamentarians on Wednesday about its findings. Some of the intercepted traffic apparently matches the locations of bodies found along the main road through town. In one of them, a soldier apparently told another that they had just shot a person on a bicycle. That corresponds to the photo of the dead body lying next to a bicycle that has been shared around the world. In another intercepted conversation, a man apparently said: First you interrogate soldiers, then you shoot them.

Part of the Plan? The BND material also apparently provides evidence that members of the Russian mercenary unit called the Wagner Group played a leading role in the atrocities. The group is known to have perpetrated similar atrocities in Syria. Eyewitnesses recently reported that the occupying force in Bucha was initially made up of ""young soldiers."" Once they were replaced by other units, the witnesses said, the attacks on civilians grew more frequent. Some eyewitnesses have said that Chechen units were in the town. The accounts raise the question as to whether this progression was part of the occupation plan.

The radio traffic intercepted by the BND makes it seem as though the atrocities perpetrated on civilians in Bucha were neither random acts nor the product of individual soldiers who got out of hand. Rather, say sources familiar with the audio, the material suggests that the troops spoke of the atrocities as though they were simply discussing their everyday lives. That, say sources familiar with the audio, indicates that the murder of civilians has become a standard element of Russian military activity, potentially even part of a broader strategy. The intention is that of spreading fear among the civilian population and thus reducing the will to resist.",https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/possible-evidence-of-russian-atrocities-german-intelligence-intercepts-radio-traffic-discussing-the-murder-of-civilians-in-bucha-a-0a191c96-634f-4d07-8c5c-c4a772315b0d

The latest: Kyiv region police said Friday that the bodies of more than 900 civilians had been tallied in the area — more than 350 of which were discovered in the Bucha suburb. The vast majority of them were found with gunshot wounds. Russia appears to be on the verge of capturing the devastated port city of Mariupol, which a regional leader said had been “wiped off the face of the earth.”

The fight: Russian forces continue to mount sporadic attacks on civilian targets in a number of Ukrainian cities. Ukrainian prosecutors have been taking detailed testimony from victims to investigate Russian war crimes.

The weapons: Ukraine is making use of weapons such as Javelin antitank missiles and Switchblade “kamikaze” drones, provided by the United States and other allies. Russia has used an array of weapons against Ukraine, some of which have drawn the attention and concern of analysts.

In Russia: Putin has locked down the flow of information within Russia, where the war isn’t even being called a war. The last independent newsletter in Russia suspended its operations.

BERLIN, April 7 (Reuters) - The German government has indications that Russia was involved in the killing of civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha based on satellite images, a security source said on Thursday.

German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that the intelligence agency had intercepted radio messages from Russian military sources discussing the killing of civilians in Bucha.

""It's true that the federal government has indications of Russian perpetration in Bucha,"" said the source. ""However, these findings on Bucha refer to satellite images. The radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha.""

The source did not elaborate. He said there was no indication of an order from the Russian armed forces' general staff regarding Bucha.

Bucha, 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv, was occupied by Russian troops for more than a month following their Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Local officials say more than 300 people were killed by Russian forces in Bucha alone, and around 50 of them were executed. Moscow denies the accusations.

Spiegel said the German intelligence office had intercepted the radio messages and presented the findings in parliament on Wednesday, without giving a source for the information.

Spiegel also said there were additional sound recordings whose physical origin was harder to pinpoint, which it said suggested similar events had occurred in other Ukrainian cities.

The BND foreign intelligence office declined to comment on the matter.

A German government spokesperson declined to comment on the Spiegel report.

Ukraine has accused Russia of genocide and war crimes. The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Western allegations Russian forces executed civilians in Bucha are a ""monstrous forgery"" meant to discredit the Russian army and justify new Western sanctions.

Russia casts the evidence of civilian executions as a cynical ploy by Ukraine and its Western backers, who Moscow says are gripped by discriminatory anti-Russian paranoia.

The evidence was presented by officials from the foreign intelligence service, the BND, to parliamentarians on Wednesday.

Reports of the radio communications were first published in the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which said the communications related to atrocities carried out in Bucha, north of Kyiv.

Several of them can be directly matched to locations and objects shown in photos that document the aftermath of the killings, the magazine reported.

A mass grave was discovered in Bucha at the weekend along with dozens of corpses of civilians lying on the ground, after the withdrawal of the Russian military. The hands of some of the dead were tied, while other corpses showed signs of torture. Numerous women and children are believed to have been among the victims.

The Russian government has vehemently denied the claims that its soldiers carried out the killings, which world leaders including Joe Biden and Germany’s Olaf Scholz have described as war crimes. Russia has repeatedly claimed the killings have been staged. Still, increasing numbers of witness accounts have added to the veracity of the reports. The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday suspended Russia from the UN Human Rights Council over reports of “gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights” by invading Russian troops in Ukraine.

In the radio communications, Russian soldiers were claimed to have discussed how they had questioned Ukrainian soldiers as well as civilians before shooting them.

According to Der Spiegel, which indirectly referenced people who had been present at the meeting at which the BND officers delivered the fresh evidence to a select group of MPs, the recordings “entirely invalidate Russia’s denials”.

In one of the radio conversations, a Russian voice is heard telling someone how he and another soldier shot a person who had been on a bicycle. One of the many pictures of the atrocities to have gone around the world in recent days was of the corpse of a person next to a bicycle.

In another communication, a man was heard saying: “Firstly you question the soldier, then you shoot them.” The impression given was that the soldiers were talking matter-of-factly about the killings as if they were discussing everyday activities, the MPs were told, according to Der Spiegel.

The intelligence material is also said to give credence to reports that the Russian mercenary Wagner Group was central participants in the killings. The group was previously active in the war in Syria where the vicious nature of its activities was notorious.

Speaking on Thursday, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, said the number of bodies found in the city was increasing every day, with 320 civilians identified so far. Specialist crime scene officers had retrieved corpses from private estates, parks and squares, he said, as well as from temporary graves. “Almost 90% were killed by bullets, not shrapnel,” he added.

The BND’s recordings have intensified suspicions that these killings were neither random nor carried out by soldiers who might have been acting autonomously as has previously been suggested.

Other radio recordings are being analysed, according to Der Spiegel. However, the precise localisation of them appears to be more difficult. They reportedly point to similar activities in other parts of Ukraine, in and around the port city of Mariupol which has been largely destroyed by Russian bombardment.

The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the expertise of forensic specialists in Europe was being sought as a matter of urgency, with independent experts needing to be ready to gather as much evidence as quickly as possible as soon as suspected atrocities came to light, of which the source said it was expected there would be many more.

A massacre in Mali last week in which 300 people died and in which Russian fighters are alleged to have been involved had “all the hallmarks of the modus operandi of the Russian army”, the source said, adding it was similar to attacks the army had been involved in in Syria. This had raised the expectation that expert capacities to gather forensic evidence would increasingly be needed, the source added.

In Ukraine on Thursday, as humanitarian relief teams and volunteers ventured further into territory around Kyiv retaken from Russian troops, evidence of more atrocities committed against Ukrainian civilians by the occupying force continued to emerge.

As roads were cleared of mines and the wreckage of burned tanks and civilian cars, residents returned home to find their homes looted or destroyed, neighbours missing, bodies decomposing in basements, and hastily dug graves in gardens. The violence and death in towns and villages surrounding Kyiv stands out even by the abysmal standards of other conflict zones.

Also on Thursday, Amnesty International published a report detailing apparent war crimes in the Kyiv region, based on interviews with 20 people who witnessed or had direct knowledge of horrifying violence.

A woman in a village east of the capital told Amnesty’s investigators that on 9 March two Russian soldiers entered her house, killed her husband and repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid nearby. She later managed to escape to Ukrainian-controlled territory.

In the village of Vorzel, Nataliya and Valeryi Tkachova left their basement on 3 March to check whether Russian tanks were coming, telling their 18-year-old daughter Kateryna to stay hidden. After hearing gunshots, Kateryna left the cellar to find her parents lying dead in the street, her father shot six times in the back, and her mother once in the chest. She was assisted in leaving Vorzel on 10 March.

“Testimonies show that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality,” Agnès Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary general, said in a statement. “The intentional killing of civilians is a human rights violation and a war crime. These deaths must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be prosecuted, including up the chain of command.”",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/russian-soldiers-discussed-killing-civilians-in-radio-intercepts

Amid loud Russian denials about the massacre in Bucha of over 400 civilians, Germany's news agency DER SPIEGEL has learned that the BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst, Germany’s foreign intelligence service) intercepted Russian military radio traffic in which the murder of civilians in Bucha was discussed.

It has also claimed that some of the intercepted radio traffic ""can be directly linked"" to dead bodies that have been photographed in Bucha.

DER SPIEGEL reported that the BND briefed parliamentarians on Wednesday about its findings. Some of the intercepted traffic apparently matches the locations of bodies found along the main road through town. In one of them, a soldier apparently told another that they had just shot a person on a bicycle. It corresponds to the photo of the dead body lying next to a bicycle that has been shared around the world. In another intercepted conversation, a man apparently said: ""First you interrogate soldiers, then you shoot them"".

This also corresponds to a report by New York Times, which states a new video has surfaced that shows a cyclist moving along a street in Bucha, dismounting and walking a bicycle around the corner onto a street occupied by Russian soldiers. As soon as the cyclist rounds the turn, a Russian armored vehicle fires several high-caliber rounds along the thoroughfare. A second armored vehicle fires two rounds in the direction of the cyclist. A plume of dust and smoke rises from the scene.

""The video is aerial footage recorded by Ukraine’s military in early March when Russian forces still held the town. It has been independently verified by The New York Times,"" says the report by the news agency.

Premeditated Move?

The BND material also apparently provides evidence that members of the Russian mercenary unit called the Wagner Group played a leading role in the atrocities. The group is known to have perpetrated similar atrocities in Syria.

Eyewitnesses recently reported that the occupying force in Bucha was initially made up of ""young soldiers."" Once they were replaced by other units, the witnesses said, the attacks on civilians grew more frequent. Some eyewitnesses have said that Chechen units were in the town. The accounts raise the question as to whether this progression was part of the occupation plan.

DER SPIEGEL said that more intercepted radio traffic is currently being analyzed, though it is apparently difficult to precisely localise some of the audio. Some of the recordings apparently indicate that incidents such as those in Bucha have also taken place elsewhere. There are reportedly indications of potential atrocities in the area surrounding Mariupol, the large city in southern Ukraine that has been besieged by the Russian military.

The Bucha Massacre

At the beginning of April dozens of corpses in civilian clothes were discovered in Bucha, on the northwestern gates of the Ukrainian capital, in the streets or in mass graves, following the Russian withdrawal. Images from the city sent shockwaves across the world, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calling the killings ""genocide"".

Russia Denies

But the Russians have remained steadfast in their denial of the massacre, claiming that the images emerging from Bucha and other towns are fakes produced by Ukrainian forces, or that the deaths occurred after Russian soldiers pulled out.

Satellite Images

The news of the interception of the Russian military radio traffic comes after the German government said on Wednesday that satellite pictures from last month provided strong counterevidence against Russian denials of involvement in civilian deaths in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit told reporters that the ""evaluation of satellite images"" led Berlin to conclude that ""Russian declarations"" that images of civilian deaths ""were posed scenes or that they were not responsible for the murders are in our view not tenable"".

He said that images at Berlin's disposal covered the period from 10-18 March and ""led to the conclusion that the victims whose images we all saw were lying there since at least 10 March"".

""Reliable evidence shows that Russian fighting and security forces were deployed in this area from 7 March until the 30,"" he said.

""They were involved in the interrogation of prisoners who were later executed. That is the information we have,"" Hebestreit said, adding, ""targeted killings by Russian armed forces are evidence that the Russian president and commander in chief (Vladimir) Putin at the least tacitly approved of human rights violations and war crimes"".

World powers, including the US, has called for Russia to be tried for war crimes.

The radio transmissions were obtained by German intelligence and presented in parliament Wednesday.

They contradict Russian claims that the atrocities found in the Ukrainian town were staged.

Germany intercepted radio transmissions of Russian soldiers discussing the killings of civilians in the town of Bucha, contradicting Russian propaganda claims of a hoax, according to a report by Der Spiegel.

The radio transmissions were obtained by the Bundesnachrichtendienst, Germany's foreign intelligence service, and presented to parliament on Wednesday, Der Spiegel reported.

In one of the recordings, a Russian soldier could be heard describing how he shot someone off their bicycle, Der Spiegel reported.

It is unclear what day the radio messages were sent and where the Russian troops were at the time.

Footage and images of people killed, with some on the street, in Bucha emerged earlier this week after Russian forces left the town.

On Tuesday, The New York Times published independently verified aerial footage that shows a Russian armored vehicle shooting at a civilian on a bicycle in Bucha. It is unclear whether the person in the video was the same as the one referred to in the radio messages.

The audio recordings also suggest that the Russian mercenary military, the Wagner Group, played a key role in the atrocities in Bucha, Der Spiegel reported.

It is not entirely clear who runs or finances the Wagner Group, but the US and European Union have linked Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to the organization.

The group has been tied to Russian separatists in the pro-Kremlin Donbas region since 2014, as well as accused of committing war crimes and human-rights abuses in Syria in 2015.

Western intelligence said last month that as many as 1,000 of the group's mercenaries were being deployed to eastern Ukraine.

Story continues

Russia has denied responsibility for the atrocities in Bucha, claiming without evidence that the footage coming out of Bucha is staged or otherwise manipulated.

On Tuesday, the Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti ran an opinion column that speculated the killings were a ploy by Western nations to impose further sanctions on Russia.

This timeline undermines Russia's claim that the Bucha killings were a Ukrainian hoax.

The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine tweeted the Spiegel report on Thursday, writing: ""Radio intercepts by the German Intelligence, show that the massacre of civilians in Bucha was not accidental or actions of rogue soldiers.""

The Federal Intelligence Service of Germany (BND) allegedly intercepted radio communications of the Russian military, which contain new information about the massacre in the town of Bucha near Kyiv, reports Der Spiegel.

In radio messages, the Russians discussed the killings of civilians in Bucha. Some radio conversations can be correlated with the specific dead bodies in the photos from Bucha.

In particular, the German intelligence service has radio messages, the content of which correlates with the locations of the dead bodies along the main street of Bucha.

In one of them, a Russian soldier claimed that he and his comrades had shot a man on a bicycle. The photo of the murdered man with a bicycle, which was published in the media around the world, has become one of the most famous testimonies of the atrocities in Bucha. In another conversation, a man, according to Der Spiegel, says that Ukrainian soldiers are first interrogated and then shot.

According to Der Spiegel, these materials lead to a conclusion that the mercenaries of the Russian private military company the Wagner Group played a decisive role in the atrocities in Bucha. These mercenaries demonstrated a special degree of cruelty during their participation in the war in Syria.

The newspaper emphasizes that the conversations intercepted by the BND indicate that the massacres in Bucha were neither accidental actions nor the actions of individual out-of-control soldiers.

The findings are much more likely to indicate that the killing of civilians has become part of the normal modus operandi of the Russian military, and perhaps part of its strategy to spread fear and terror among the civilian population and suppress resistance. Der Spiegel writes that in the intercepted conversations the Russian soldiers soldiers talk very casually about these atrocities.

According to the newspaper, on April 6, the German intelligence informed the relevant parliamentary authorities in Berlin about this. In addition, on the same day, an examination of other audio recordings was carried out. It is difficult to determine their locations, but they suggest that similar cases happened in other places.

CNN visited the Moskva in 2015. This is what it looked like on board

CNN —

Germany’s foreign intelligence service told a parliamentary committee Wednesday that it has intercepted radio communications where Russian soldiers talked about shooting soldiers and civilians in Ukraine, a source with knowledge of the meeting said.

The briefing was the top item at the Wednesday meeting, the source added.

Those intelligence findings – first reported by Der Spiegel – appear to implicate Russian troops in a pattern of apparent war crimes despite denials from Moscow, most recently in the indiscriminate killing of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha.

Der Spiegel reported that the BND, Germany’s foreign intelligence agency, intercepted Russian radio chatter about the killing of civilians in Bucha, and that some of the conversations could be tied directly to specific killings in Bucha that have been documented since news first emerged of an apparent massacre there.

German intelligence has satellite images that point to the involvement of Russian troops in the Bucha killings, the Washington Post reported, citing an unnamed intelligence official, though the paper said the radio transmissions have not been linked to that location.

News of the German intelligence assessment comes amid massive international outrage over Bucha and a growing body of evidence that points to the Russian military’s involvement in the indiscriminate killing of civilians in Ukraine.

A drone video taken before March 10 has captured the moment a person riding a bicycle is gunned down on a street in Bucha by Russian soldiers. International media have broadcast extensive footage of that same street, where the bodies of at least 20 civilian men were found following the exit of Russian forces from the area.

Germany’s foreign intelligence office declined to comment, and a German government spokesperson declined to comment on the Der Spiegel reporting.

The German intercepts are not the first audio evidence that indicates Russian troops have engaged in the murder of civilians.

On Tuesday, the Security Service of Ukraine released a series of intercepted audio recordings that purport to reveal Russians receiving orders to kill civilians.

In one of the alleged intercepts, one soldier identifies what he describes as a car carrying two civilians.
