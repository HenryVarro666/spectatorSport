6:58 p.m.: Russia released Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of the occupied Ukrainian city of Melitopol, in exchange for nine Russian prisoners of war, according to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Office of the President.

Fedorov was detained on March 11 when Russian troops captured the city.

He says he refused to cooperate despite pressure from the Russians to endorse the occupation.

Russian warships around midnight fired missiles and artillery at the Ukrainian sea coast near Tuzla, to the south of Odesa, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said.

“They fired a huge amount of ammunition from a great distance,” he said on Facebook.

Gerashchenko said Russia wanted to test Ukraine’s coastal defense system.

He said there was no attempt to land troops. He didn’t say whether any of the shelling hit anything.

4:35 p.m. - Zelenskyy suggests Russia might have begun World War III

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told NBC News' Lester Holt that the Russians may have already ignited World War III with their invasion of Ukraine.

""Nobody knows whether it may have already started. And what is the possibility of this war if Ukraine will fall, in case Ukraine will? It's very hard to say,"" Zelenskyy said. ""And we've seen this 80 years ago, when the Second World War had started ... nobody would be able to predict when the full-scale war would start.""

He also said the outcome of the war had the ""whole civilization at stake.""

In an exclusive interview with @LesterHoltNBC, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy discusses President Biden's concern about triggering World War III.

4:00 p.m. - Mayor of Melitopol freed by Russian forces 5 days after capture

The mayor of the southeastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol has been freed after he was seized by Russian forces five days ago, a Ukrainian official said Wednesday.

Andriy Yermak, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, announced the news but did not share details about how Ivan Fedorov became free.

Surveillance video last week showed Fedorov being marched out of city hall apparently surrounded by Russian soldiers.

Prior to the start of the invasion, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration had warned of Russian plans to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine, with Zelenskyy himself likely top target.

﻿1:25 p.m. - Biden announces $800M in additional security assistance to Ukraine, this week’s total now $1B

President Joe Biden announced that he has authorized another $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine as it “fends off Russia’s assault,” bringing the total of new U.S. security assistance to the besieged country to $1 billion this week.

“We’re going to give Ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead,"" Biden said.

He said the assistance includes 800 anti-aircraft systems, 9,000 anti-armor systems, 7,000 small arms like machineguns, and some 20 million rounds of ammo, including artillery and mortar rounds. It also includes “cutting-edge” security systems like drones.

“These are direct transfers of equipment from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military,” he said.

The president said “more will be coming” as the U.S. sources additional stocks of equipment to transfer.

Today, @POTUS announced an $800M assistance package to help Ukraine defend their country against Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion.



This brings the total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine to $1B in the past week and a total of $2B since @POTUS took office. — The White House (@WhiteHouse) March 16, 2022

The $800 million is in addition to $350 million in aid that was sent when the invasion started in late February, as well as $200 million that was authorized Saturday to “keep the steady flow of weapons and ammunition moving to Ukraine.”

Biden said that assistance included hundreds of anti-air systems, thousands of anti-tank weapons, transport helicopters, armed patrol boats, radar systems, secure communications equipment, and tactical gear.

“It’s clearly helped Ukraine inflict dramatic losses on Russian forces,” Biden said.

The president warned that “this could be a long and difficult battle, but the American people will be steadfast in our support of the people of Ukraine.”

“We are united in our abhorrence of [Vladimir] Putin’s depraved onslaught, and we’re going to continue to have their backs as they fight for their freedom, their democracy, their very survival,” Biden said.

During his address, Biden said nothing about the “no-fly zone” that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked the U.S. Congress to impose during a virtual speech Wednesday morning.

The Biden administration has stopped short of providing a no-fly zone or the transfer of military jets from neighboring Poland as the U.S. seeks to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia.

Biden wouldn’t comment when asked about the Polish jets during his announcement Wednesday.

12:35 p.m. - NATO leader rules out no-fly zone over Ukraine

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has categorically ruled out any role for the military organization in setting up and policing a no-fly zone over Ukraine to protect against Russian airstrikes.

Stoltenberg says “NATO should not deploy forces on the ground or in the air space over Ukraine because we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict, this war, doesn’t escalate beyond Ukraine.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly appealed for NATO to set up a no-fly zone given Russia’s air superiority, as civilian casualties mount three weeks into the war.

Speaking Wednesday after chairing a meeting of NATO defense ministers, Stoltenberg conceded that “we see human suffering in Ukraine, but this can become even worse if NATO (takes) actions that actually turned this into a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia.”

He says the decision not to send air or ground forces into Ukraine is “the united position from NATO allies.” Earlier Wednesday, Estonia urged its 29 NATO partners to consider setting up a no-fly zone.

10:45 a.m. - Ukraine, Russia negotiators reportedly draft 15-point peace plan to end war

Ukraine and Russia are working on a tentative 15-point peace plan that would lead to the withdrawal of Russian forces from the country and several concessions from Kyiv, according to the Financial Times.

The proposed deal would include Ukraine renouncing its interest in joining NATO and other outside military alliances, as well as accepting limits on its armed forces and promising not to host foreign military bases or weaponry, three people involved in the talks told the outlet.

The tentative deal was first discussed by negotiators on Monday and significant progress has been made, according to the report.

Instead of hosting foreign military bases or weaponry, Ukraine would get protection from allies like the U.S. and U.K. It would still be allowed to keep its armed forces.

Our position at the negotiations is quite specific - legally verified security guarantees; ceasefire; withdrawal of Russian troops. This is possible only with a direct dialogue between the heads of Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Details are in an interview with the @NewsHour pic.twitter.com/TlPUl3XfGK — Михайло Подоляк (@Podolyak_M) March 16, 2022

The report noted that guarantees about Ukraine’s security from the West, as well as Russia’s acceptance of those guarantees, was still up in the air and could be an obstacle to the potential plan.

Another obstacle is the status of the territories that Russia has seized from Ukraine over the past decade, including Crimea and parts of the Donbas.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Wednesday that a “business-like spirit” is emerging at talks with Ukraine that are now focused on a neutral status for the war-torn country.

“A neutral status is being seriously discussed in connection with security guarantees,” Lavrov said.

A senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the Financial Times that any deal would include “the troops of the Russian Federation in any case leaving the territory of Ukraine.”

News of a tentative peace plan comes as Russia continued to bombard Ukrainian cities and edged closer to the center of Kyiv on Wednesday, and as Zelenskyy pleaded for a no-fly zone over his country in an address to the U.S. Congress.

10:30 a.m. - Sullivan warns counterpart about ‘consequences and implications’ of use of chemical, biological weapons

White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan and Gen. Nikolay Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council, spoke by phone on Wednesday, the highest level engagement between the U.S. and Russia since the invasion nearly three weeks ago.

Sullivan warned Patrushev “about the consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine,” according national security council spokesperson Emily Horne. The White House last week accused China of spreading Russian disinformation that could be a pretext for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces to attack Ukraine with chemical or biological weapons.

Patrushev spoke of “the need to stop Washington’s support for neo-Nazis and terrorists in Ukraine and to facilitate the transfer of foreign mercenaries to the conflict zone, as well as to refuse to continue supplying weapons to the Kyiv regime,” council spokesman Yevgeny Anoshin said.

The call marked the highest-level conversation between the two sides since the invasion began.

9:30 a.m. - Zelenskyy address US Congress, pleads for no-fly zone: ‘Right now the destiny of our country is being decided’

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed U.S. Congress virtually from Kyiv, saying, “the destiny of our country is being decided” and urging the U.S. to impose a no-fly zone over the country.

The president received a round of applause from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other lawmakers in an auditorium at the U.S. Capitol.

Zelenskyy talked about Pearl Harbor and 9/11, saying those attacks would allow Americans to “understand Ukrainians” and why they need help.

Speaking in Ukrainian through a translator, Zelenskyy called 9/11 a “terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn your cities into battlefields, when innocent people were attacked from the air.”

“Our country experiences the same every day,” he said as he again asked for a no-fly zone over Ukraine.

“Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people. Russian troops have already fired nearly 1,000 missiles at Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said. “This is a terror that Europe has not seen for 80 years.”

“Is this a lot to ask for to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people,” he said, urging the U.S. and its allies to “reply to this terror.”

Zelenskyy then showed a graphic video of the violence in Ukraine, including attacks on civilians in its cities. The video ended with the words, “Close the sky over Ukraine.”

President Joe Biden’s administration has stopped short of providing a no-fly zone or the transfer of military jets from neighboring Poland as the U.S. seeks to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia.

In lieu of a no-fly zone, Zelenskyy asked the U.S. for more defense systems and continued pressure, including through sanctions, on Russia. He said “peace is more important than income.”

The U.S. aid to Ukraine so far includes over 600 “Stinger” anti-aircraft missiles, 2,600 “Javelin” anti-tank missiles, 200 grenade launchers and ammunition, and five helicopters, three boats and 70 other vehicles, according to ABC News.

Switching to English, Zelenskyy closed the speech by saying, “Today the Ukrainian people are defending not only Ukraine, we are fighting for the values of Europe and the world, sacrificing our lives in the name of the future. That’s why today the American people are helping not just Ukraine but Europe and the world to keep the planet alive, to keep justice in history.”

Biden will deliver his own address at 11:45 a.m., in which he is expected to announce an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, according to a White House official.

8:45 a.m. - Zelenskyy to address Congress, ask for more help

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will address the U.S. Congress virtually around 9 a.m. ET. The speech will follow similar ones to the parliaments of Canada and the U.K. over the past week.

Zelenskyy's livestreamed address will be among the most important in a very public strategy in which he has invoked Winston Churchill, Hamlet and the power of world opinion in his fight to stop Russia.

Nearing the three-week mark in an ever-escalating war, Zelenskyy has used his campaign to implore allied leaders to “close the sky” to prevent the Russian airstrikes that are devastating his country.

It has also put Zelenskyy at odds with President Joe Biden, whose administration has stopped short of providing a no-fly zone or the transfer of military jets from neighboring Poland as the U.S. seeks to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia.

Instead, Biden will deliver his own address following Zelenskyy’s speech, in which he is expected to announce an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, according to a White House official.

That would bring the total announced in the last week alone to $1 billion. It includes money for anti-armor and air-defense weapons, an anonymous official told the Associated Press.

8:30 a.m. - Russia says ‘neutral status’ for Ukraine ‘is being seriously discussed’

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says a “business-like spirit” is emerging at talks with Ukraine that are now focused on a neutral status for the war-torn country.

“A neutral status is being seriously discussed in connection with security guarantees,” Lavrov said Wednesday on Russian channel RBK TV. “There are concrete formulations that in my view are close to being agreed.”

He didn’t elaborate but said “the business-like spirit” starting to surface in the talks “gives hope that we can agree on this issue.”

Russia’s chief negotiator in the latest round of talks with Ukraine, which started Monday and are set to continue Wednesday, said earlier the sides are discussing a possible compromise idea for a future Ukraine with a smaller, non-aligned military.

“A whole range of issues tied with the size of Ukraine’s army is being discussed,” Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said, according to Russian news agencies.

There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that the country realizes it can’t join NATO. Ukraine’s bid to join the Western military alliance has been a sore point for Moscow.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday that Ukraine is not going to join NATO “any time soon.”

8:00 a.m. - European leaders return safely from Kyiv visit

The prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia have returned safely from a visit to Kyiv, as invading Russian forces menace the embattled Ukrainian capital.

The visit was meant to show support for Ukraine as it endures heavy bombardment.

The leaders met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday to send the message that Ukraine is not alone and that they support the nation’s aspirations to one day join the European Union.

They went ahead with the hours-long train trip despite worries within the European Union about the security risks of traveling within a war zone.

Polish government spokesman Piotr Mueller said Wednesday morning that they had returned safely to Poland.

7:30 a.m. - Explosions continue to rock Kyiv area

A plume of smoke was seen rising up over western Kyiv on Wednesday morning after shrapnel from an artillery shell slammed into a 12-story apartment building in central Kyiv, obliterating the top floor and igniting a fire, according to a statement and images released by the Kyiv emergencies agency.

The neighboring building was also damaged. The agency reported two victims, without elaborating.

Russian forces have intensified fighting in Kyiv suburbs, notably around the town of Bucha in the northwest and the highway leading west toward Zhytomyr, the head of the Kyiv region Oleksiy Kuleba said Wednesday.

He said Russian troops are trying to cut off the capital from transport arteries and destroy logistical capabilities even as they plan a wide-ranging attack to seize Kyiv.

Twelve towns around Kyiv are without water and six without heat.

Russia has occupied the city of Ivankiv, 50 miles north of Kyiv, and controls the surrounding region on the border with Belarus, Kuleba said.

Across the Kyiv region, he said, “Kindergartens, museums, churches, residential blocks and engineering infrastructure are suffering from the endless firing.”

Russian warships around midnight fired missiles and artillery at the Ukrainian sea coast near Tuzla, to the south of Odesa, Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said.

Russia’s Defense Ministry reported fighting near the separatist-held eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk Wednesday but did not comment on Russian military activity elsewhere.

Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov claimed Russian forces have destroyed 111 Ukrainian aircraft, 160 drones and more than 1,000 tanks or other military vehicles since the start of what Russia calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.

Ukraine said a fourth Russian general has been killed in the fighting.

Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityaev, 46, died Tuesday during the storming of Mariupol, said Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko, who published a photo on Telegram of what he said was the dead officer. There was no confirmation of the death from Russia.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Republicans criticized President Joe Biden on Wednesday for moving too slowly in helping arm Ukrainian forces and demanded that he help deliver Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to bolster its defense against the Russian invasion.

They spoke after Biden called Vladimir Putin a 'war criminal' and unveiled an $800 million military package which includes 100 killer drones and thousands of anti-tank weapons.

And it followed an impassioned plea to Congress by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a no-fly zone.

'Zelensky knows what he's asking for,' Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming told Fox News.

'He needs the mix. We have a bipartisan group that says: Give this man the aeroplanes that he needs. He needs the sky to be protected.

'Joe Biden's been slow on that to me. They're a game changer.'

Biden has been under pressure to do more to bolster Ukrainian forces, who have been using foreign Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to defend their cities.

'We’re going to give Ukraine the arms to fight and defend themselves through all the difficult days ahead,' he said as he laid out a comprehensive list of weapons on their way to the war.

They include 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols and more than 20 million rounds of ammunition.

But the most exciting addition is likely to be the 100 tactical unmanned aerial systems, reported to be 'Switchblade' drones which deliver their deadly payload by crashing into targets.

Even so, the package does not include the planes demanded by Zelensky nor will the Biden administration back calls for a no-fly zone.

Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma said it was a 'half measure' that failed to meet the moment.

'I've been clear that we should have been sending much more military aid to the Ukrainians, with more training, for more than a year,' he said.

'President Biden didn't do that, and now we're rushing to deliver aid just in time.'

In his appeal, Zelensky said defending the skies was crucial to defeating Russia.

'You know how much depends on the battlefield, on the ability to use aircraft, powerful, strong aviation to protect our people, our freedom, our land,' he said.

'Aircrafts that can help Ukraine help Europe and you know that they exist, and you have them, but they are on Earth, not in the Ukrainian sky.'

All the way through this whole process @POTUS has had to be pushed or prodded across the line. The Ukrainian people are being slaughtered.

Last week Poland offered its 28 MiG-29s to Ukraine, but said it would hand them over to U.S. custody at Ramstein air base, in Germany, for delivery.

The announcement appeared to wrongfoot American officials, who eventually declined the offer.

They had been in talks to backfill Poland's air force with more modern F-16s, but were not prepared for a plan that involved such close involvement in the MiGs transfer to Ukraine.

At issue, is the danger of N.A.T.O. getting sucked into a war with Russia, and red lines laid down by Moscow.

The result has been growing pressure from lawmakers to help send the planes, while the Biden administration has at times got twisted up with multiple explanations about why the deal should not happen.

Biden himself ignored shouted questions about the MiGs during public appearances on Wednesday.

But last week, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Ukraine's air force remained largely intact, and Russian planes were avoiding exposure by launching missiles inside their own airspace.

'Therefore, we believe that the gain from transferring those MIG-29s is low,' he said.

'And finally, the intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MIG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory.

'And could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with N.A.T.O.'

Biden has already ruled out a no-fly zone for fear of sparking World War Three with N.A.T.O. pilots going head to head with Russian flyers.

And delivering the planes could bring the same outcome. Polish or American pilots flying into Ukraine risks Russia accusing N.A.T.O. of entering the war.

Or if Ukrainian pilots travel to Poland to collect them, Moscow could accuse the Ukrainian air force of using foreign air fields - a potential 'casus belli' and grounds to attack Poland, according to a foreign diplomat familiar with discussions.

So how about towing them across the border - something the U.S. did in World War Two, when it gave planes to Canada before formally ending the conflict.

The White House has raised another distinction. Air defense systems, small arms and anti-tank weapons are defensive in nature, runs the argument, while Mig-29 fighter jets are offensive and capable of taking the fight to Russia.

'Again, I would note that the equipment that we've provided is defensive, as you know, not offensive and we see that as being a difference,' said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday.

But with the addition of deadly drones - as well as grenade launchers, rifles and shotguns - on the list supplied to Ukraine, she faced repeated probing about what was so different about sending planes.

'Anybody that looks at that list of weapons that I just mentioned, they would say clearly, they're offensive,' said John Decker of Fox News Radio.

Psaki responded by saying: 'There is a difference between a plane, and planes, and massive military systems - I think anybody would recognise this.

'And what we were talking about, which is giving rifles and pistols to many of them farmers and people living in countrysides to defend themselves, I think there's a difference that most people recognize.'

After announcing $800 million in new military aid for Ukraine on Wednesday following Volodymyr Zelensky's impassioned address to Congress, Biden told reporters he believes Vladimir Putin is a 'war criminal'

Congress carries on calls for Biden to give jets to Ukraine over White House fears it could lead to escalation with Putin - while attacks on civilians continue

A number of lawmakers, including Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Wednesday, called on Biden to provide the planes, despite the administration's concern it could lead to escalation.

'This could be a long and difficult battle,' Biden predicted, as the invasion approached the end of its third week.

He denounced 'Putin’s immoral and unethical attacks,' and said the world was 'united in our abhorrence of Putin’s depraved onslaught.'

Biden also cited international efforts to put pressure on Russia's 'crumbling' economy, while 'isolating Putin' on the global stage. Zelensky also urged more action on that front, urging sanctions not only on Putin but on cronies deep within his government.

'That's our goal. Make Putin pay the price, weaken his position, while strengthening the hand of the Ukrainians on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. Together with our allies and partners, we’re going to stay the course. and we’re going to to push for to push for and end this tragic and unnecessary war,' Biden said, while flanked by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.

Biden calling Putin a war criminal is not the first such denunciation by a world leader. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this month that Putin's targeting of civilians 'already fully qualifies as a war crime.'

A Ukrainian service member holds a Javelin missile system at a position on the front line in the north Kyiv region, Ukraine

Russia has so far denied deliberately targeting innocents, though reports from Ukraine paint a far more sinister picture.

New footage published by Ukrainian outlet Public appears to show Moscow's soldiers gunning down 10 civilians assembled in a bread line outside Chernihiv in northern Ukraine.

'This is not the first such incoming shell [in the city] nor is it the first shelling of civilians by the enemy. The Russians are shelling and destroying mostly civilian infrastructure in the city of Chernihiv and other cities in the region,' a local official named Vyacheslav Chaus said.

And drone video from last week shows Russian troops shooting and killing a Ukrainian civilian who held up his hands in surrender on a highway outside of Kyiv. A woman and child were pulled out of the car but it's not clear what their fates were.

The soldiers can be seen callously dragging the motorist's lifeless body to the side of the road and leaving it there.

Russian troops also bombarded the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia hours after roughly 20,000 civilians arrived there via humanitarian corridor.

They had come from Mariupol, where officials say thousands of civilians have perished as Russians surrounded the city and cut it off from power and supply lines.

Zelensky said last week that a young girl died of dehydration there, alone in the ruins of her home, after Moscow's shelling killed her mother. The report has not been verified by western media outlets.

The eastern Ukrainian city has also seen one of its maternity hospitals attacked. At least one pregnant woman and her baby died after the health facility was bombarded by Russian missiles.

Moscow had claimed the Mariupol hospital was being used by the Ukrainian military and that no civilians were present during the assault -- adding that images of wounded and bloody mothers were staged using crisis actors.

Russia has been accused of attacking humanitarian corridors where refugees are escaping several times, breaking agreed-upon ceasefires to slay civilians in cold blood.

The U.S. Senate unanimously voted to condemn Putin as a war criminal late on Tuesday, a rare show of unity in an otherwise highly divided Congress.

The resolution, introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), demands that the International Criminal Court in The Hague investigate the Russian military for war crimes, backing Ukraine's earlier request for the body to do so.

Canada also announced earlier this month that it would lend support to Kyiv by also referring Putin and his troops to the ICC.

On March 3 the ICC's chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced his intention to probe reports of Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

Biden is not the first world leader to accuse Putin of committing war crimes. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he carried out such atrocities in remarks earlier this month, as reports grew of Russian troops slaughtering civilians (pictured: Dead bodies are put into a mass grave on the outskirts of Mariupol, Ukraine, Wednesday, March 9)

The invasion has also created a refugee crisis, with the United Nations stating that more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since Putin first ordered the attack on February 24 (pictured: Women rest as children play in a humanitarian aid tent, where refugees are coming to warm up and rest, after crossing from Ukraine into Poland at the Medyka border crossing, southeastern Poland on March 16)

Biden spoke at the White House shortly after Zelensky addressed American lawmakers in the first virtual address.

'I need to protect our skies. I need your help, which means the same you feel when you hear I have a dream,' he said.

'We need you right now,' Zelensky said, adding: 'I call on you to do more.'

Right as Kyiv's leader delivered his gut-wrenching address, Putin shared his own speech that was notably darker and more threatening.

In addition to the West, the autocrat also took aim at Russian oligarchs who have been increasingly opposed to the war.

He disparaged Moscow's elite who are frustrated at the West's targeted sanctions as 'traitors' as they find more and more of their assets in the U.S. and Europe seized by foreign authorities over their close ties to Putin.

'I do not judge those with villas in Miami or the French Riviera, or who can't get by without oysters or foie gras or so-called ""gender freedoms."" The problem is they mentally exist there, and not here, with our people, with Russia,' he said. 'The West will try to bet on the so-called fifth column, on traitors... to divide our society.. to provoke civil confrontation... to strive to achieve its aim. And there is one aim - the destruction of Russia.'

Putin claimed the West's sanctions were being levied only to prevent a 'strong and sovereign Russia.'

He added that Moscow was 'fighting for our sovereignty and the future of our children,' even as Ukrainian officials condemn him for slaughtering their own.

On Tuesday Biden signed a $13.6 billion package into law that provides military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

His speech followed reports the administration was considering providing U.S.-made kamikaze 'Switchblade' killer drones to Ukraine.

The small, lightweight and comparatively cheap 'kamikaze' weapons, which are effectively remote-controlled bombs, come in two versions which have been designed to take out tanks or artillery positions.

They are believed to be the same missiles that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani under Donald Trump's administration in 2020.

U.S. military officials have noted the Ukrainians have been highly effective at using weapons to take out Russian tanks, trucks, and other armored vehicles.

Biden provided details on the deadly military equipment the U.S. was providing, which follows previous aid packages. He was joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken (L), Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a heartfelt plea for President Joe Biden and America to 'be the leader of the world' and help his country against Russian attacks in a speech where he appealed to U.S. heartstrings by comparing the crisis to the tragedies of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor and invoked Martin Luther King Jr. by saying: 'I have a dream... I have a need'

Zelensky showed a video montage to Congress of the destruction and death in Ukraine (pictured), and said his country is facing a 9/11-like attack every day

Biden's speech followed reports the administration was considering providing U.S.-made kamikaze 'Switchblade' killer drones to Ukraine

Biden said the package would include 'Cutting edge' drones, without providing specifics

Vladimir Putin said today that the West's 'attempt to have global dominance' is coming to an end as he warned it is trying to 'cancel Russia' with an 'economic blitzkrieg' of sanctions

The drones can be used to take out tanks and artillery positions, but can only be used once

There have been reports of a rising death toll among Russian troops – as the staggering toll of civilian Ukrainian losses also rises.

The new aid package Biden just signs includes $6.5 billion to fund Pentagon troop deployments so the nation can bolster its presence in the region, plus $4 billion pays for humanitarian aid.

Although the aid package has been in the works for days, Biden set up his remarks to follow Zelensky's.

Zelensky concluded his speech with a personal appeal to Biden.

'I am addressing the President Biden. You are the leader of the nation, of your great nation. I wish you be the leader of the world. Being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace,' he said.

The two leaders spoke on a day when Russian President Vladimir Putin inveighed against 'scum' traitors and fifth columnists, after western officials have hoped openly that he might face an internal schism.

'I do not judge those with villas in Miami or the French Riviera. Or who can't get by without oysters or foie gras or so-called 'gender freedoms,' Putin said in a TV address. 'The problem is they mentally exist there, and not here, with our people, with Russia,' he said.

'The West will try to bet on the so-called fifth column, on traitors... to divide our society.. to provoke civil confrontation... to strive to achieve its aim. And there is one aim - the destruction of Russia,' he claimed.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10621333/Republicans-say-Bidens-new-Ukraine-weapons-deal-NOT-send-MiG-fighters.html

Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine, but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to the fighting or withdrawal of Russian troops. Russia put forward the text after France and Mexico withdrew their own push for a UNSC resolution on Ukraine's humanitarian situation because they said it would have been vetoed by Moscow, Reuters reported. They instead plan to put it to a vote in the 193-member General Assembly, where no country wields a veto.

2:15 p.m.: In Photos: Russia's Invasion of Ukraine, March 16, 2022

2:10 p.m.: Russia's defense ministry denied a report published by the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on Wednesday that its forces had shot and killed 10 people waiting in line for bread in the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, and said there were no Russian troops in the area, according to Reuters. The embassy did not say what evidence it had for the attack in a statement posted on its official Twitter site and its Facebook page. Ukraine's general prosecutor's office said it had opened an investigation into the alleged incident.

2:01 p.m. : Some of the three million Ukrainian refugees who have managed to escape the war are now moving beyond Poland and Eastern Europe to the farthest stretches of the continent. That includes Spain which is already home to a community of 100,000 Ukrainians. VOA’s Alfonso Beato in the Catalonia region has this story, narrated by Jon Spier.

1:52 p.m. : Pope Francis and the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill spoke on the phone Wednesday about Ukraine and the need for a “just peace,” the Russian church said. This is the first known communication between the two leaders since the Kremlin’s invasion, The Associated Press reported.

The call was all the more remarkable because Francis and Kirill have only met once – at the Havana airport in 2016 – in what was then the first encounter between a pope and Russian patriarch in over 1,000 years.

Wednesday’s call came just hours after Francis evoked the specter of a “final catastrophe” of an atomic war that would extinguish humanity during his weekly general audience. While Francis didn’t reference Ukraine explicitly in that part of his speech, he did elsewhere call for prayers for Ukraine and for God to protect its children and forgive those who make war.

Francis’ long-term goal to improve relations with Kirill and avoid antagonizing the Russian Orthodox Church had explained his initially tepid response to the February 24 Russian invasion. He has since stepped up his denunciations, demanding “an end to the war.""

1:30 p.m. : The White House on Wednesday released a fact sheet detailing U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, including what will be done with the additional $800 million worth of assistance announced today.

This brings the total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine to $1 billion in just the past week, and a total of $2 billion since the start of the Biden Administration, according to an official statement. ""America is leading this effort, together with our allies and partners, providing an enormous level of security and humanitarian assistance that we're adding to today and we're going to continue to do more in the days and weeks ahead,"" Biden said. VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara monitored his speech.

He said NATO defense ministers “agreed that we must continue to provide significant support to Ukraine, including with military supplies, financial help and humanitarian aid.” He added that Russia’s president “must stop this war immediately” and “withdraw his forces now and engage in diplomacy in good faith.” VOA’s National Security correspondent Jeff Seldin tweeted the highlights.

12:10 p.m. : A few weeks ago, Nargiz Gurbanova was working as a criminal defense lawyer, but now she spends her days sheltering in a hospital basement as the Russian military bombards her city, Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine. In an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, she says she is now gathering evidence of war crimes.

11:51 a.m. : Ukraine’s president welcomed a ruling by the International Court of Justice Wednesday. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the ruling compels Russia to halt its military offensive in Ukraine.

11:49 a.m.: The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Russia on Wednesday to stop the military actions it started in Ukraine on Feb. 24. ""The Russian Federation shall immediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on Feb 24, 2022 in the territory of Ukraine,"" the judges said. The judges added Russia must also ensure that other forces under its control or supported by Moscow should not continue the military operation. The ICJ also asked both Ukraine and Russia to “refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve.”

11:39 a.m. : Taiwanese citizens and their government are sending donations to war-torn Ukraine as a show of extra sympathy, analysts say. They argue that many on the Asian Pacific island fear they could become the next place to be targeted by a major military power.

11:15 a.m.: Both Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress gave Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a standing ovation following an address he delivered via video link Wednesday.

VOA’s Yulia Yarmolenko interviewed Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska after the speech, who said, “ We need to be doing more. The United States Congress was called on today and the United States government were called on today to act like a superpower and we should be doing more.”

“They need more weaponry.” Sasses said. “I think we've seen that the Ukrainians have great fighters, they have great courage and they have pilots. So they're willing to engage the battle directly.”

Asked about Zelenskyy’s request for a no-fly zone, Sasse said “NATO with 30 countries and complicated Article Five obligations has not made the decision to directly go to war with Russia at this time. And so that's why a no fly zone, I don't think is the central discussion.”

Sasse advocated giving Ukrainians “a lot more air power, we should be supplying the weaponry. And we know that the Ukrainians will supply the pilots and the fighters.” He said, “As long as they're willing to fight, we're willing to supply them. If something shoots, we should be giving it to the Ukrainians.”

10:51 a.m. Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to Ukraine’s president who is actively involved in negotiations with his Russian counterparts to end the conflict, on Wednesday said Ukraine’s model of security guarantees would entail “a rigid agreement with a number of guarantor states undertaking clear legal obligations to Ukraine.” Later Wednesday, he also tweeted a link to an interview with the PBS News Hour, in which he said he makes Ukraine’s position at the negotiations clear.

10:18 a.m.: International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Karim Khan visited Ukraine, Reuters reported Wednesday.

10:10 a.m.: U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke today with General Nikolay Patrushev, Secretary of the Russian Security Council, to reiterate the United States’ firm and clear opposition to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, according to a statement released by NSC Spokesperson Emily Horne. Sullivan told General Patrushev that if Russia is serious about diplomacy, then Moscow should stop attacking Ukrainian cities and towns. He also warned General Patrushev about the consequences and implications of any possible Russian decision to use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, the statement added.

10:07 a.m.: While embedded with Ukrainian troops, Current Time journalists Borys Sachalko and Ivan Lyubysh-Kirdey came under fire during a Russian artillery assault in the combat zone northwest of Kyiv. Current Time is a Russian-language TV and digital network led by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in partnership with VOA.

9:30 a.m.: In a virtual address to the U.S. Congress Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked for more support to fight off the Russian invasion and proposed a new alliance of countries that would stand together against such aggression in the future, VOA News reported.



""Right now, the destiny of our country is being decided - whether our people will be free,"" Zelenskyy said, speaking to the lawmakers in Ukrainian. He said Ukrainians and Americans have much in common, especially a desire to live in freedom.



Zelenskyy also drew parallels between Japan's 1941 attack on the U.S. naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, saying that Ukraine is experiencing the same kind of assault every day. He again asked for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, but added that if that was not possible, the U.S. supply more weapons to fight off the Russian attacks.

""I can say to each of you today, 'I have a need,'"" he said. Zelenskyy said he and Ukraine are grateful for everything the U.S. has done, and asked that the U.S. do more, including more sanctions against Russia. ""All American companies must leave the Russian market, because it is flooded with our blood,"" Zelenskyy said.

He also called for a new association of countries that would oppose aggression like the Russian invasion through economic sanctions and military support.

Zelenskyy’s speech follows similar addresses to Britain’s House of Commons, Canada’s Parliament and the European Parliament in recent weeks as he pushes for more military and humanitarian support from the international community.

9:03 a.m.: The American broadcasting agency FOX News says journalist Benjamin Hall is safe and out of Ukraine after the attack that killed 2 of his colleagues Monday, according to National Public Radio correspondent David Folkenflick.

8:54 a.m.: The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv sent this report on Twitter Wednesday.

8:44 a.m.: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has arrived in Saudi Arabia, according to state news agency SPA. Johnson is on a visit to the Gulf as part of efforts to secure more oil supplies and increase pressure on President Vladimir Putin over Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported.

8:34 a.m.: Ukraine has rejected Russian proposals that it adopt a neutral status, Agence France-Presse reported Wednesday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that a ""compromise"" outcome would center on Ukraine becoming a neutral state comparable to Sweden and Austria. But Zelensky's office gave the idea short shrift. ""Ukraine is now in a direct state of war with Russia. Consequently, the model can only be 'Ukrainian' and only on legally verified security guarantees,"" Kyiv's negotiator Mikhailo Podolyak said.

8:22 a.m.: At the Gare de l’Est train station in Paris, French Red Cross workers greet newly arrived Ukrainian refugees as they step off trains and direct them to a makeshift welcome center that offers food and other assistance. “Most of them are exhausted,” says Elodie Esteve, of the French Red Cross. “We’re here to welcome them, to tell them it’s OK, that they’re safe, and to orient them depending on what they plan to do after.” VOA’s Lisa Bryant went to the station and has this report.

8:01 a.m.: Another mayor was reported to have been abducted by Russian forces in Ukraine on Wedensday. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dymtro Kuleba said on Twitter that the mayor and deputy of the Ukrainian city of Skadovsk were kidnapped.

At least two other mayors have been seized recently by invading Russian military forces this week, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The mayor of Dniprorudne was abducted March 13, and the mayor of Melitopol was marched out of city hall by Russian soldiers March 11.

7:52 a.m.: Human rights advocates are pushing U.S. administration officials to expedite the process of reuniting refugees with relatives in the U.S. During a White House briefing Tuesday, press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is discussing the available options. VOA’s Immigration Correspondent Aline Barros has the story.

7:15 a.m.: VOA’s Eastern Europe Chief Myroslava Gongadze visited a warehouse in Poland managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). It serves as a humanitarian relief hub for many international organizations, according to Stephan Allen, the USAID Ukraine Crisis Disaster Assistance Response Team leader.

7:08 a.m.: Ukraine's Foreign Minister on Wednesday tweeted a message calling for ""deputinization"" -- in other words, for the world to cut all ties to Russia’s president Vladimir Putin, his administration and his policies, describing them as “toxic.”

6:47 a.m.: The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a demilitarized Ukraine with its own army along the lines of Austria or Sweden was being looked at as a possible compromise, Reuters reports.



""This is a variant that is currently being discussed and which could really be seen a compromise,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by RIA news agency. The reference to demilitarization appeared to relate to the idea of neutral status for Ukraine.

Ukraine was promised by NATO as far back as 2008 that it would one day become a member of the alliance. Russia has said it cannot allow that to happen and cited it as part of the logic for what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine.

6:30 a.m.: Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, has arrived in Kyiv on a five-day visit to Ukraine to urge for greater humanitarian access and protection of civilians, the organization said Wednesday.

“After enormous suffering by the civilian population and after our intensive virtual conversations with the Russian and Ukraine governments, I find it utterly important that we have person-to-person contacts, that we are able to go in-depth into the understanding of neutral, independent and impartial humanitarian work, and that our licence to operate in the country is fully understood by the authorities,” Maurer said in a statement.

“People in Ukraine are crying out for help. Needs are massive, conditions volatile. We are sparing no effort to answer their call,” Maurer later said in a Twitter post.

5:20 a.m.: NATO defense ministers gathered Wednesday to discuss what Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said would be both the “immediate consequences of Russia’s invasion” and long-term efforts to strengthen NATO’s collective defense.

“NATO has a responsibility to ensure that this crisis does not escalate beyond Ukraine, and that's also the reason why we have increased the presence in the eastern part of the alliance,” Stoltenberg told reporters. He has said potential actions could include placing “substantially more forces” in the eastern part of the alliance, along with increases in naval and air deployments, missile defense systems and holding larger and more frequent military exercises.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin highlighted support for Ukraine’s ability to defend itself as well as U.S. commitment to aid any NATO ally that comes under attack.

“I think our presence here sends a signal to the world that we remain united in our support of Ukraine, and we condemn Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion into Ukraine,” Austin said.

Russia has objected to NATO’s presence near its borders and sought a guarantee that Ukraine will never join the alliance. NATO insists countries are free to make their own decisions about security ties.

While Ukraine is not part of NATO, seven NATO countries share borders with Russia, Ukraine or Russian ally Belarus, and that proximity has raised concerns of a wider conflict.

Stoltenberg said there are 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe and another 40,000 troops under direct NATO command, as well as hundreds of thousands more on heightened alert across NATO nations.

4:30 a.m.: The Netherlands and other NATO countries will continue to deliver weapons to Ukraine even as these deliveries could become the target of Russian attacks, Dutch defense minister Kajsa Ollongren said on Wednesday.

“Ukraine has the right to defend itself, we will continue to support it,” Ollongren said at her arrival for a meeting with NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Reuters reported.

4:00 a.m.: VOA’s Yan Boechat documents life in Irpin and Kyiv as Russia’s military assault continues.

3:30 a.m.: Russia said on Tuesday it has written guarantees it can carry out its work as a party to the Iran nuclear deal, suggesting Moscow could allow a revival of the tattered 2015 pact to go forward.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's comments appeared to signal Moscow may have backed off its previous view that Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine were an impediment to salvaging the nuclear deal, Reuters reports.

3:00 a.m.: The British Ministry of Defence said Wednesday that Russian troops are struggling to overcome challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain. Russia’s advance has been confined to Ukraine’s roads and highways, the daily battleground intelligence report added.

The destruction of bridges by Ukranian forces has “played a key role in stalling Russia’s advance,” the report said.

“The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia’s lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces.”

2:30 a.m.: Millions of Ukrainians have now fled their country, mostly to Poland, but also to Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Moldova. In Hungary, there are reports of some Ukrainians deciding to turn back. Jon Spier narrates this report from Gabor Ancsin on Hungary’s border with Ukraine.

1:30 a.m.: As civilians in Ukraine bear the brunt of Russian artillery attacks, the White House announced that President Joe Biden will head to Brussels next week to coordinate deterrence and defense efforts with NATO allies. VOA’s Senior Diplomatic Correspondent Cindy Saine reports.

1:00 a.m.: In his latest Facebook address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered a more optimistic assessment of peace talks with Russia. He said the negotiations are starting to “sound more realistic, but time is still needed.”

The talks are scheduled to continue today. Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak also said there is “room for compromise” while cautioning that “fundamental contradictions” continue to emerge during the talks.

Russia has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine concede the provinces of Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea. It has also insisted that Ukraine renounce any intention of joining NATO, something Zelenskyy has appeared willing to do.

12:40 a.m.: A funeral ceremony was held in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv on Tuesday for four Ukrainian soldiers who lost their lives following the Russian invasion.

12:00 a.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his condolences Tuesday to the journalists killed in Ukraine on Monday.

“I am grateful to all those risking their lives to show the world what is happening in Ukraine. The United States condemns Russia's ongoing violence, which is putting the safety of journalists and other media workers in Ukraine at risk.”

Journalists Pierre Zakrzewski and Oleksandra Kuvshynova were killed in an attack that also seriously injured Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall.

U.S. broadcaster Fox News on Tuesday announced that cameraman Zakrzewski had died in Ukraine. Kuvshynova, a 24-year-old Ukrainian journalist, also was killed in the same attack.

WASHINGTON (AFP, REUTERS) - US President Joe Biden labelled Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" on Wednesday (March 16) after watching harrowing TV footage of the invasion of Ukraine, triggering an immediate angry riposte from Russia.

It was the first time Biden has used the phrase to describe Putin, and the US president then deepened his attack, tweeting that Putin was ""inflicting appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine - bombing apartment buildings and maternity wards.""

Referring to reports that Russian troops took hostage doctors and patients in a Mariupol hospital, Biden said that ""these are atrocities. It is an outrage to the world"".

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden was ""speaking from his heart"" after seeing images on television of ""barbaric actions by a brutal dictator"".

Putin is inflicting appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine — bombing apartment buildings and maternity wards.



Yesterday, we saw reports that Russian forces were holding hundreds of doctors and patients hostage.



These are atrocities. It is an outrage to the world. — President Biden (@POTUS) March 16, 2022

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies that Biden's rhetorical attack was ""unacceptable and unforgivable on the part of the head of a state, whose bombs have killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world.""

Putin ordered a large-scale invasion of Ukraine three weeks ago, saying Russia wants to force the disarmament of Ukraine's military and topple the pro-Western government.

With the Russian advance largely stalled by Ukrainian troops, Moscow has turned increasingly to bombardments of civilians, prompting three million Ukrainians to become refugees.

Psaki said the US State Department already has ""a legal process that is ongoing"" to examine Russia's actions.

Reporter: ‘Are you ready to call [Putin] a war criminal?’



Pres. Biden: ‘I think he is a war criminal’ pic.twitter.com/EyWB6Ca8JP — NowThis (@nowthisnews) March 16, 2022

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made an impassioned video address to US lawmakers earlier Wednesday, bolstered by a montage of horrific TV footage of Ukrainian civilians under Russian assault.

Last year, Russia briefly recalled its US ambassador after Biden likened Putin to a ""killer.""

At the request of Mr Zelensky, Washington will help Ukraine acquire additional long-range missile anti-aircraft systems as the West bolsters his government, which still hopes for a diplomatic solution.

Mr Zelensky said negotiations with Russia were becoming “more realistic” and Russia’s foreign minister said proposals under discussion were “close to an agreement”.

The US Embassy in Kyiv said Russian forces had shot dead 10 people waiting in line for bread in Chernihiv, north-east of Kyiv. Russia denied the attack and said the incident was a hoax.

Footage from Ukraine’s state broadcaster showed bodies lying on the street. The Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office said it had opened an investigation.

Emergency services said rescue workers had found the bodies of five people, including three children, during searches of shell-hit residential buildings in Chernihiv.

In the besieged southern port of Mariupol, the city council said Russian forces bombed a theatre where civilians were sheltering. The number of casualties was not known.

Russia’s defence ministry denied it had carried out an air strike against the theatre. Reuters could not independently verify the information.

Maxar Technologies, a private US company, distributed satellite imagery that it said was collected on March 14 and showed the word “children” in large Russian script painted on the ground outside the red-roofed Mariupol Drama Theatre.

The word ""children"" is seen outside the Mariupol Drama Theatre before bombing in Mariupol on March 14, 2022. PHOTO: REUTERS/MAXAR TECHNOLOGIES

The governor of Zaporizhzhia region said Russian forces had fired artillery at a convoy of evacuees from Mariupol, wounding five people on Wednesday. Ukraine’s military said children were among the casualties.

Three people were killed and five wounded after shelling caused a fire at a market in eastern Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, emergency services said.

Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said 400 staff and patients were being held hostage at a hospital Russian forces had captured in Mariupol on Tuesday.

Moscow denies targeting civilians.

Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko said Russian shelling caused a fire and damaged private homes and a gas line there on Wednesday evening after early morning barrages.

Russian troops have halted at the gates of the capital after taking heavy losses in a war Western officials say Moscow expected to win within days.

Rescuers remove debris from a building damaged by shelling in central Kharkiv on March 16, 2022. PHOTO: AFP

And as an information battle goes on alongside fighting, Facebook on Wednesday removed official Russian posts that falsely claimed reports of Russia bombing a children’s hospital in Ukraine were a hoax.

Russia has shifted its stance over the bombing that caused outrage around the world with a mix of statements that veered between aggressive denials and a call to establish clear facts.

In a speech to the US Congress by video link, Zelensky appealed for tougher sanctions on Russia and more weapons to help his country, repeating a request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something the West fears would worsen the conflict.

“In the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I call on you to do more,” said Zelensky, who showed video clips of dead and wounded children and blasted buildings.

Alongside additional US help announced on Wednesday, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) defence ministers meeting in Brussels also pledged more arms supplies to help Ukraine.

Negotiations were due to resume on Wednesday by a video link for a third straight day.

The Kremlin said negotiators were discussing a status for Ukraine similar to that of Austria or Sweden, both members of the European Union that are outside the Nato military alliance.

Ukraine’s chief negotiator said Kyiv was still demanding a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops, with guarantees.

Zelensky has said Ukraine could accept international security guarantees that stopped short of its longstanding aim to join Nato, one of Russia’s main demands before it invaded.

“Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said.

“There are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement.”

Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s chief negotiator, told state TV: ""Ukraine is offering an Austrian or Swedish version of a neutral demilitarised state, but at the same time a state with its own army and navy.”

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the idea “could really be seen as a compromise”.

Austria and Sweden, the biggest of six EU members outside Nato, both have small militaries that cooperate with the alliance.

While Russia has long objected to Ukraine’s Nato ambitions, Kyiv and its allies have said Moscow’s true aim was to overthrow Ukraine’s pro-Western, elected leaders.

Ukrainian forces have withstood an assault by a much larger army. Zelensky said Ukrainian troops had killed a fourth Russian major general. Reuters was not able to verify this.

Ukraine said about 20,000 people had escaped besieged Mariupol in cars, but hundreds of thousands remain trapped under bombardment without heat, power or water. More than 3 million refugees have now fled Ukraine for other countries.

Russia was due to pay US$117 million (S$159 million) in interest on dollar-denominated sovereign bonds, but may pay in roubles instead, amounting to its first default on foreign debt since the Bolshevik revolution.

Moscow said it had the money, and Washington would be to blame if it cannot pay.

In his most explicit acknowledgment of the pain inflicted by Western sanctions, Putin said inflation and unemployment would rise, and structural changes to the economy would be needed.",https://www.tnp.sg/news/world/biden-brands-putin-war-criminal
6,904d7e9a-166b-4db8-8667-bfee05c9e774,['The New Arab Staff'],,"Moscow has denied dropping a powerful bomb on a theatre in the encircled Ukrainian port city of Mariupol where hundreds of civilians were sheltering on Wednesday.

US President Joe Biden branded Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal""on Wednesday as the Russian leader's onslaught in Ukraine claimed more civilian lives, and a theatre where ""hundreds"" were sheltering was destroyed by bombing.

Biden's rebuke -- his sharpest yet -- came after Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky made a searing appeal for help to the US Congress and the president himself, who responded by pledging $1 billion in new weapons to fight Russia's invading army.

Officials in the port city of Mariupol were struggling to count the dead at the Drama Theatre, where thick smoke rose from the rubble of the building that had the word ""children"" painted in large Russian letters on the ground outside.

It was the latest in a litany of assaults on civilians across Ukraine since Putin invaded on February 24 that has included homes, hospitals, ambulances and food queues.

""I think he is a war criminal,"" Biden told reporters of his Russian counterpart, the first time he has used the phrase.

Biden's spokesperson added that he had spoken ""from his heart"" -- but the Kremlin quickly punched back, calling the comment ""unacceptable and unforgivable on the part of the head of a state, whose bombs have killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world.""

So far the destruction that has marked other cities has been halted outside Kyiv.

But dull booms echoed across the capital's deserted streets Wednesday, with only an occasional vehicle passing through sandbagged checkpoints, and very few permits granted to break its latest curfew.

Kyiv has been emptied of around half of its 3.5 million people.

""It's worrying, of course. It's war after all. But we try to stay calm, we won't allow panic,"" said Eduard Demenchuk, a private-security employee in his 50s, was among those who have stayed.

""If need be, we will take arms and will stand to defend the city,"" he told AFP by telephone, after stocking up on groceries.

'Destruction of hope'

The attack on the theatre in Mariupol is the latest atrocity in the southern city, which has been besieged for weeks, with more than 2,000 people killed so far.

Mariupol city authorities said Russia ""purposefully destroyed"" the theatre, though Moscow blamed Ukrainian forces for the blast.

Efforts to establish the number of casualties were hampered by nearby shelling.

President Zelensky gave no further details in his regular evening address, saying only ""my heart is breaking seeing what Russia is doing to our people, to our Mariupol.""

Also on Wednesday at least 15 civilians were killed in the northern city of Chernihiv.

Ten of them died while queueing to collect bread. Another five, including three children, were killed when Russian forces shelled a residential building.

As the civilian toll climbed, the World Health Organization warned that Ukraine's health system was ""teetering on the brink.""

""This is about the destruction of hope ... This is the most basic of human rights and it has been directly denied,"" WHO official Michael Ryan said in Geneva.

The conflict has already sent more than three million Ukrainians fleeing across the border, many of them women and children.

Ukraine authorities said 103 children have been killed since the invasion began.

7,904d7e9a-166b-4db8-8667-bfee05c9e774,[],2022-03-17 05:15:44+08:00,"WASHINGTON (AFP, REUTERS) - US President Joe Biden labelled Vladimir Putin a ""war criminal"" on Wednesday (March 16) after watching harrowing TV footage of the invasion of Ukraine, triggering an immediate angry riposte from Russia.

It was the first time Biden has used the phrase to describe Putin, and the US president then deepened his attack, tweeting that Putin was ""inflicting appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine - bombing apartment buildings and maternity wards"".

The term war criminal applies to anyone who violates a set of rules adopted by world leaders known as the law of armed conflict, according to The Associated Press. The rules govern how countries behave in times of war.

AP reported that the most likely way Putin could come into the picture as a war criminal is through the widely recognised legal doctrine of command responsibility. If commanders order or even know or are in a position to know about crimes and did nothing to prevent them, they can be held legally responsible.

Referring to reports that Russian troops took hostage 400 staff and patients in a Mariupol hospital, Biden said that ""these are atrocities. It is an outrage to the world"".

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden was ""speaking from his heart"" after seeing images on television of ""barbaric actions by a brutal dictator"".",https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/biden-brands-putin-a-war-criminal
