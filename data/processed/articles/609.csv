President Joe Biden announced new sanctions against Russia and ordered the deployment of 7,000 additional service members to Germany to reassure NATO allies after Russia invaded Ukraine, but the President withheld the most serious punishment, citing disagreement among European partners.

“This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for the freedom around the world,” Biden said from the East room of the White House after a day that included a meeting with his National Security Council and G-7 world leaders.

“It’s a large conflict already,” Biden said. “The way we’re going to assure it’s not going to spiral to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the Eastern European nations that are members of NATO.”

In response to the President’s directive, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III has ordered an armored brigade combat team to Germany, a senior defense official said in a statement.

“They will deploy to Germany to reassure NATO allies, deter Russian aggression, and be prepared to support a range of requirements in the region. We expect them to depart in the coming days,” the statement read.

In recent days, Biden has ordered the repositioning of six F-35s and a total of 24 F-16s and F-15s to the NATO eastern flank to take part in joint training and enhanced air policing missions. He also repositioned an infantry battalion, attack aviation battalion, and attack aviation task force totaling 32 Apache helicopters, multiple Stryker units, and 4,700 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division. NATO is set to meet Feb. 25 to discuss further measures, including the possible deployment of 8,500 U.S. troops currently in the U.S. on high alert as part of a NATO Reaction Force. Some of the 7,000 troops set to deploy will come from those already standing on alert, with the bulk of those forces coming from Fort Carson, Colo., and Fort Bragg, N.C., the Pentagon confirmed.

Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst told Air Force Magazine additional forces were needed on the eastern flank as a show of force to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“Now’s the time to truly increase NATO forces in the East,” he said. “And let it be known to Moscow that this is not on a temporary basis, so that they see their geopolitical position deteriorating, and we make sure we continue the weapons flowing to Ukraine.”

Biden did not say how long the additional forces would remain in Europe, though eastern flank allies have long called for increasing the permanent U.S. troop and capabilities presence.

Punishing Sanctions

Biden also announced punishing new sanctions designed to cripple the Russian economy, military, technology, and aerospace industries.

“Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly, economically and strategically,” Biden said before outlining a series of coordinated sanctions to target more than $1 trillion of Russian assets, impose new export controls, sanctions on oligarchs close to Putin, and restrictions on Russia’s ability to raise money from investors.

Criticized for not imposing the sanctions before Russia began its attack on Ukraine early Feb. 24, Biden said it could take a month or longer before sanctions begin to impact the Russian economy.

“No one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening,” Biden said. “This is going to take time … He’s gonna test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together. And we will—we will—and we’ll impose significant costs on him.”

Biden said he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky late Feb. 23, promising humanitarian assistance, and expressed confidence in the Ukrainian people to resist a much more powerful Russian military.

The U.S. has provided more than $650 million in defense assistance to Ukraine in the past year, but the President did not comment on continued defense support to the Ukrainian military. A day earlier the Department of Defense said it was exploring alternative means of transferring defense assistance once airspace is closed.

Biden also said Putin had left diplomatic options on the table before launching an avoidable war.

“Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences,” Biden said. “It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for Empire, by any means necessary, by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force. And ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause.”

The U.S. President did not escape criticism from the White House Press Corps, who demanded why he would not sanction Putin himself or block Russia from the international banking system known as SWIFT.

Biden did not respond to questions about sanctioning Putin, but he indicated he did not have consensus for the action to remove Russia from SWIFT.

“Right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take,” Biden said. “. .. The sanctions we’ve imposed exceed SWIFT; the sanctions we impose exceed anything that’s ever been done.”

Biden said the sanctions regiment outlined reached a consensus of “two-thirds of the world joining us” totaling more than half the world economy.

Biden declined to comment when questioned as to whether he was pressuring China to isolate Russia.

Herbst said that not including SWIFT was “a mistake, but predictable.”

Still, Herbst said Ukraine has a plan for continuity of government during the war and the Ukrainian people will resist a Russian occupation.

“Any government they install will be installed by Russian bayonets,” Herbst said. “Napoleon said, famously, ‘You can do anything with bayonets except sit on them.’”",https://www.airforcemag.com/biden-orders-7000-troops-to-europe-sanctions-russia-but-holds-back-swift/

The activation by President Joe Biden and leaders of member states marks the first such use of the NATO Response Force to guard alliance territory, which does not include Ukraine. But it remained unclear how many American service members could participate as the alliance was still weighing its needs.

Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the force would be sent to the alliance's eastern flank, which borders Ukraine and the ongoing war triggered by Russia's invasion, according to The Associated Press.

Some of the 7,000 troops that Biden said on Thursday will deploy to Germany could also be part of the NATO force, though the U.S. and NATO members have made clear it would not be sent to fight Russia in Ukraine. The U.S. has already deployed about 12,000 troops and equipment such as F-35 Lightning II fighter jets and Apache attack helicopters to Germany, Poland, Romania and the Baltic states.

""We are going to provide additional security assistance for Ukraine -- we will,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. ""How that is going to be done is still being worked out.""

The Pentagon has said more than 11,000 troops have been put on heightened alert for deployment since January, but it could not provide exact figures on Friday of those who remain on alert or have been deployed.

Gen. Tod Wolters, the head of U.S. European Command who also serves as the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, said the alliance activation on Friday was a ""historic moment."" The NATO Response Force is described by the organization as a ""highly ready and technologically advanced"" group of 40,000 troops from member nations.

Biden said Thursday the 7,000-troop deployment will include the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, out of Fort Stewart, Georgia.

The NATO activation came as Russia pushed farther into Ukraine and continued to threaten the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, after launching an invasion Wednesday. Progress appeared to be slowing, with Russian troops facing more resistance from Ukrainian forces than anticipated.

""It's looking like they're trying to reach the capital as fast as they can to encircle Kyiv,"" Michael Kofman, an adjunct senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security think tank, said during a briefing event Friday. ""It also looks like they're attempting large pincer movements to try to cut off and encircle big parts of the Ukrainian military in the east and south of the country.""

Earlier Friday, the Ukrainian military still had command-and-control capabilities and was flying air offensives against Russian forces, according to a senior defense official who briefed the press on the situation on the condition of anonymity. There was intense fighting in the capital as well as at a hydro-electric dam, and Russia was staging an amphibious landing in the east of the country along the Sea of Azov.

""I think they [the Russians] tried something that at best had very mixed results for them,"" Kofman said, cautioning that it was still very early in the invasion. ""I think the things they're trying aren't necessarily working very well right now, but they're likely going to adjust.""

Russia had deployed only about one-third of the more than 150,000 troops it had staged around Ukraine's borders in the buildup before the invasion, the defense official said.

The fighting had already started a flood of refugees fleeing from Ukraine across neighboring borders. Several hundred Americans had crossed from Ukraine to Poland between Thursday and Friday. The Army's 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, has set up in Poland to train with its forces and prepare to help U.S. citizens trying to escape.

Before invading, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that Ukraine, a former Soviet republic along its western border, never be allowed to join the West's 30-nation NATO alliance, which has expanded dramatically over the past few decades.

Putin carved off and annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014 following a coup that ousted the Moscow-aligned president and government, and has since fueled a years-long separatist conflict between the new pro-western government in Kyiv and the heavily ethnically Russian region of Donbas in the eastern part of the country.

2,49e1b730-edc2-4413-a79b-5824b95c3967,[],,"The NRF has the overarching purpose of being able to provide a rapid military response to an emerging crisis, whether for collective defence purposes or for other crisis-response operations.

The NRF gives the Alliance the means to respond swiftly to various types of crises anywhere in the world. It is also a driving engine for NATO’s military transformation.

A rotational force

The NRF is based on a rotational system where Allied countries commit land, air, maritime or Special Operations Forces (SOF) units for a period of 12 months.

The NRF is also open to partner countries, once approved by the North Atlantic Council.

Participation in the NRF is preceded by national preparation, followed by training with other participants in the multinational force. As units rotate through the NRF, the associated high standards, concepts and technologies are gradually spread throughout the Alliance, thereby fulfilling one of the key purposes of the NATO Response Force – the further transformation of Allied forces.

Operational command of the NRF alternates annually between Allied Joint Force Commands in Brunssum, the Netherlands and Naples, Italy.

A powerful package

NATO Allies decided at the 2014 Wales Summit to enhance the NRF by creating a “spearhead force” within it, known as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force or VJTF. This enhanced NRF is one of the measures of the Readiness Action Plan (RAP) agreed by Allies to respond to the changes in the security environment.

The enhanced NATO Response Force includes:

a command and control element: Operational command of the NRF alternates between Allied Joint Force Commands in Brunssum and Naples;

Operational command of the NRF alternates between Allied Joint Force Commands in Brunssum and Naples; the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) : This NRF element – about 20,000 strong – includes a multinational land brigade of around 5,000 troops and air, maritime and SOF components. Leading elements are ready to move within two to three days. Allies assume the lead role for the VJTF on a rotational basis;

: This NRF element – about 20,000 strong – includes a multinational land brigade of around 5,000 troops and air, maritime and SOF components. Leading elements are ready to move within two to three days. Allies assume the lead role for the VJTF on a rotational basis; the Initial Follow-On Forces Group (IFFG) : These are high-readiness forces that can deploy quickly following the VJTF, in response to a crisis. They are made up of two multinational brigades;

: These are high-readiness forces that can deploy quickly following the VJTF, in response to a crisis. They are made up of two multinational brigades; a maritime component : it is based on the Standing NATO Maritime Groups (SNMGs) and the Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Groups (SNMCMGs);

: it is based on the Standing NATO Maritime Groups (SNMGs) and the Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Groups (SNMCMGs); a combat air and air-support component ;

; Special Operations Forces ; and

; and a chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) defence task force.

Before use, the NRF will be tailored (adjusted in size and capability) to match the demands of any specific operation to which it is committed.

The VJTF and Initial Follow-on Forces are based in their home countries, but are able to deploy to wherever they are needed for exercises or crisis response. The VJTF participated in its first deployment exercise in Poland in June 2015 and is regularly tested during exercises on its ability to deploy and respond to any arising crisis.

Leadership of the VJTF rotates on an annual basis, with one Ally designated as the lead country and other Allies participating.

Altogether, the enhanced NRF comprises around 40,000 troops.

Any mission, anywhere

The NRF provides a tangible demonstration of NATO’s cohesion and commitment to deterrence and collective defence. Each NRF rotation has to prepare itself for a wide range of tasks. These include contributing to the preservation of territorial integrity, making a demonstration of force, peace support operations, disaster relief, protecting critical infrastructure and security operations. Initial-entry operations are conducted jointly as part of a larger force to facilitate the arrival of follow-on troops.

Elements of the NRF helped protect the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, and were deployed to support the Afghan presidential elections in September of the same year.

The NRF has also been used in disaster relief.

In September and October 2005, aircraft from the NRF delivered relief supplies donated by NATO member and partner countries to the United States to assist in dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

From October 2005 to February 2006, elements of the NRF were used in the disaster relief effort in Pakistan, following the devastating 8 October earthquake. Aircraft from the NRF were used in an air bridge that delivered almost 3,500 tons of urgently needed supplies to Pakistan, while engineers and medical personnel from the NRF were deployed to the country to assist in the relief effort.

Elements of he NRF were activated in August 2021 to support the evacuation and relocation of Afghans who worked alongside NATO, together with their families. This response included the establishment of Task Force Noble, a task force coordinating hundreds of NRF troops from 20 Allied countries. These troops are supporting the evacuation in locations across Europe, including with transportation aircraft, construction equipment, ambulances, medical teams, civil affairs teams and security personnel.",https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_49755.htm

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he had convened a virtual emergency summit of the alliance's 30 nations for Friday, which is set to include U.S. President Joe Biden, and they would be joined by the leaders of Sweden, Finland and European Union institutions.

""Peace on our continent has been shattered,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference. ""Russia is using force to try to rewrite history, and deny Ukraine its free and independent path.""

The activation of NATO's ""graduated response plans"" is a rare step that Stoltenberg said underscored the gravity of a ""full-fledged invasion"" of Ukraine, giving allied commanders greater scope for decision-making.

""This is a deliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned invasion,"" Stoltenberg said. ""Russia's unjustified, unprovoked attack on Ukraine is putting countless innocent lives at risk with air and missile attacks.""

Ukraine is not a member of the alliance and Stoltenberg said there were no NATO troops in the country. ""What we do is defensive,"" he said.

But NATO is now set to step up its plans to deploy capabilities and forces, including the high combat-readiness NATO Response Force, to eastern European countries.

NATO is also planning to create combat units in Romania and Bulgaria, and possibly Hungary and Slovakia - similar to those already set up in the Baltic states and Poland.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine appeared to galvanise support for such a step in Slovakia, with the Slovak government saying any new battlegroup plans would include Slovakia.

""The unit will be made from countries that are geographically close to us. It will be about several hundred soldiers which will come with equipment that we don't have and which will significantly increase our ability to defend our country,"" Slovak Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad said.

“We have activated NATO’s defense plans to prepare ourselves to respond to a range of contingencies and secure Alliance territory, including by drawing on our response forces,” NATO heads of state and government said in a joint statement released Friday after the alliance held a virtual summit.

“We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the Alliance. We will make all deployments necessary to ensure strong and credible deterrence and defense across the Alliance, now and in the future.”

The leaders stressed the moves “are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.”

The extraordinary move marks the first time NATO has activated the NRF, a multinational force comprised of around 40,000 land, air, maritime and special operations personnel the alliance can deploy on short notice as needed. All 30 members of NATO must agree to activate the force, which they did on Thursday.

The Pentagon in January put 8,500 U.S. troops on heightened alert for such a mission, and with the NRF now activated, those troops could soon be ordered to Europe to help bolster NATO countries near Ukraine. President Biden has stressed, however, that they will not go to Ukraine as it is not a member of the alliance.

Supreme Allied Commander of NATO Gen. Tod Wolters, the head of the NRF, called the force’s activation a “historic moment” according to a statement.

“They represent a flexible, combat credible force that can be employed in multiple ways and we are utilizing fully their inherent agility,” Wolters said. “These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect.”

The force is still on standby and has not yet been deployed.

In addition, NATO has “deployed defensive land and air forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, and maritime assets across the NATO area,” according to its statement.

The alliance also reaffirmed its “unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity” of Ukraine, and pledged continued “political and practice support” to its government.

Speaking to reporters after the summit, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the U.S., Canada and European allies have deployed “thousands of more troops to the eastern part of the alliance,” with more than 100 jets and 120 ships operating on high alert in more than 30 locations.

Stoltenberg also again called on Russia to stop its attack on Ukraine.

“We call on Russia to stop this senseless war, immediately cease its assaults, withdraw all of its forces from Ukraine and turn back to the path of dialogue and turn away from aggression,” he said.

He warned that the alliance is facing a new normal in European security, and that “the world will hold Russia and Belarus accountable for their actions — Russia as the aggressor, Belarus as the enabler.”

The United States has already deployed or repositioned roughly 15,000 American troops to locations in Germany, Romania and Poland.

“Russia has shattered peace on the European continent. What we have warned against for months has come to pass, despite all of our efforts to find a diplomatic solution,” Stoltenberg said as he opened the summit.



“Moscow bears sole responsibility for the deliberate, cold-blooded, and long-planned invasion,” he added.



He did not say how many troops from the NATO response force would be deployed but referred to “thousands” and confirmed that the move would involve land, sea, and air power.



In addition, parts of a force known as the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), which is currently led by France, will also be sent.



NATO previously had around 5,000 troops stationed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland but has significantly increased its defenses in the countries over the past three months.



U.S. President Joe Biden welcomed the decision to activate the NATO response force and said Russian President Vladimir Putin had “failed in his goal of dividing the West.”



NATO is “as united and resolute as it’s ever been, and NATO will maintain its Open Door to those European states who share our values and who one day may seek to join our Alliance,” Biden said in a statement issued by the White House.



After participating in the summit, Biden said he spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.



“I commended the brave actions of the Ukrainian people who were fighting to defend their country,” Biden said in the statement. “I also conveyed ongoing economic, humanitarian, and security support being provided by the United States as well as our continued efforts to rally other countries to provide similar assistance.”

The United States and some of NATO’s other 29 members are supplying a variety of weapons to Ukraine, and Stoltenberg said that would continue. He said weapons they would supply include air defenses.



But NATO has said it won’t launch any military action in support of Ukraine, which is a close partner of the alliance but not a member.



The U.S. military said on February 24 that it is sending 7,000 troops to Europe in addition to 5,000 recently deployed.

The activation of the response troops does not mean that any US or NATO troops will go into Ukraine, which is not a member. US President Joe Biden has been clear that US troops are deploying to eastern Europe to help bolster NATO countries nervous about Russia's aggressive actions, and they will not be fighting in Ukraine.

Biden announced the latest ordered deployment of American forces from the U.S into Europe in an address from the White House to the U.S. people, in which he labeled Russian President Vladimir Putin a “pariah on the international stage” and announced new sanctions on Russian banks, businesses and elites meant to severely damage the country’s economy as punishment for its invasion of its neighbor to the west.

“There should be no confusion or cover up about what Putin is doing,” Biden said. “Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences.”

The latest tranche of U.S. forces includes an armored brigade combat team with additional “capabilities and enablers” that will deploy in the coming days to Germany, the Pentagon said after Biden’s remarks. They will join some 7,000 American troops sent in recent weeks into NATO countries, including those neighboring Ukraine, which fear Putin could turn his forces toward them next.

“On the enablers, I would say it’s largely transport and supporting fires, artillery,” a senior defense official told Pentagon reporters Thursday on condition of anonymity.

The bulk of those troops are members of the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Ga., an Army official said Thursday. After they reach Germany, they could be repositioned to other locations as needed.

The units and locations of the remaining troops that make up the 7,000 were not identified by the defense official.

However, the official said some were among the 8,500 U.S-based forces on high alert to deploy on short notice to Europe amid the heightening tensions with Russia. Those forces included troops from nearly a dozen military posts, Pentagon officials announced previously. Among them were Fort Bragg, N.C., Fort Hood, Texas, Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash., and Fort Carson, Colo., where another armored brigade combat team — the 3rd Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division — was already scheduled to deploy to Europe in the coming weeks on a regular rotation of troops supporting NATO’s Atlantic Resolve training mission.

Earlier Thursday, the Pentagon incorrectly named the 3rd Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division as the unit ordered immediately to Europe, but officials later confirmed the Fort Stewart unit was tasked with the rapid deployment.

“The [1st] Brigade Combat Team that is going could also be used should the [NATO response force] get activated because they will have been pre-positioned,” the official said. “They’re going to deter aggression, reassure rallies and be prepared for other requirements, [so] that could be a requirement that they could fill.”

Biden said at least some of those forces would soon move to Europe, after the alliance earlier Thursday granted U.S. Gen. Tod Wolters, the top NATO and U.S. commander in Europe, the authority to active the NATO response force of some 40,000 troops from multiple countries.

NATO leaders were set to hold an emergency summit on Friday to “map out our next steps” in the alliance’s response to Russia, Biden said, hinting that could include activation of the response force.

The president reiterated his long-held stance that American forces would not enter Ukraine. But, he warned, if Putin’s forces entered a NATO country that the U.S. military would be forced to respond.

“There is no doubt, no doubt that the United States and every NATO ally will meet our Article 5 commitments, which says an attack on one is an attack on all,” Biden said. “It’s a large conflict already [in Ukraine] and the way we’re going to assure it’s not going to spiral into a larger conflict is by providing all the [military] forces needed in Eastern European nations that are members of NATO. NATO is more united than it’s ever been.”

The United States had already sent some 5,000 U.S.-based soldiers — largely from the 82nd and 101st airborne divisions — into Poland, Romania and Germany in recent weeks. The Pentagon on Tuesday ordered a deployment of another 1,000 troops — including a 173rd Airborne Brigade infantry battalion, six F-35 advanced fighter jets and a battalion of 20 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters — from locations elsewhere in Europe to the Baltics countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

The Pentagon on Thursday painted a bleak picture of the Russian attack on Ukraine, reporting Putin’s forces appeared to be moving toward Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and other “key population centers” intent on toppling that nation’s western-aligned government. Russia had launched more than 160 missiles into Ukrainian territory and moved its troops into that country from multiple directions as part of an “initial phase of an operation,” a senior Pentagon official told reporters Thursday.

“Our assessment is that [the Russians] have every intention of basically decapitating the government and installing their own method of governance,” said this official, who spoke about the latest events in Ukraine on the condition of anonymity. “We haven’t seen a conventional [military] move like this — nation-state to nation-state — since World War II.”",https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2022-02-24/biden-militray-troops-europe-nato-russia-ukraine-5133207.html

He added that eastern-flank allies ""are extremely concerned. They are close to the fighting in Ukraine, and they also border Russia, and they've seen not only the military buildup and the ongoing war in Ukraine, but also seen the very threatening rhetoric because this goes far beyond Ukraine.""

""Russia's attack on Ukraine is more than an attack on Ukraine. It's a devastating horrendous attack on innocent people in Ukraine, but it's also an attack on the whole European security order. And that's the reason why we take it so extremely seriously,"" Stoltenberg said.
