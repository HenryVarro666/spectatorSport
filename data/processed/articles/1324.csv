Russia invades Ukraine

The US and its allies in the past weeks have engaged in frequent talks to discuss the ongoing turmoil on Eastern European soil. The situation remained wary ever since Russian began the concentration of troops along the Donbas region, a breakaway rebel-held region of Ukraine. Eventually, Russian President Vladimir Putin on February 21 announced unilateral recognition of Donbas (including Donetsk and Luhansk) and on February 24 he unleashed an ""unjustified invasion"" of Ukraine. Despite several rounds of diplomatic talks with Russia, the situation is yet to reach a resolution while nearly 352 Ukrainians, including 14 children have already lost their lives and over 1,000 have been injured. On Monday, a Russian delegation is scheduled to meet their Ukrainian counterparts in Belarus in an attempt to dilute the four-day-long running devastation in the ex-Soviet nation.
