The Russian offensive against Ukraine remains largely static as of late March 19, with mobile ground operations appearing to be concentrated in the south of the country as well as the Donbas region. Heavy fighting has been reported around the cities of Mariupol and Severodonetsk in recent days as the Kremlin seeks to achieve its military aim of seizing control of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, in addition to establishing a land bridge between Russia and Crimea. Nevertheless, a one-day humanitarian corridor and localized ceasefire were reportedly observed in the Luhansk Region starting at 09:00 March 19, enabling the evacuation of refugees from the towns of Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Popasna, and Lysychansk.

Russian air, missile, and artillery strikes against targets elsewhere in Ukraine also continue as of March 19. Daily shelling has been reported in several cities, including the capital, Kyiv, as well as Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy. In recent days, shelling and aerial bombardments have also occurred in Vinnytsia, Izyum, Kremenchuk, Bila Tserkva, Nikopol, Mykolaiv, Kyiv, Izmail, Odesa, Poltava, and Zaporizhzhia. Russian missiles have also sporadically targeted military facilities in western Ukraine, including an aviation repair facility near Danylo Halytskyi International Airport (LWO) in the Lviv Region along with a missile and aircraft munitions depot near the village of Deliatyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk Region.

Though Russian advances have slowed or halted, ground assaults continue to take place in several locations, albeit at a lower intensity than in the initial phase of the conflict. Russian forces have clashed with Ukrainian troops on the outskirts of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv without making significant advances. Inconclusive clashes have also reportedly taken place on the outskirts of Izyum, in Kharkiv Region, as well as in areas surrounding the city. Mariupol continues to face ground assaults on its eastern and western outskirts amid heavy bombardment; Russia-backed forces have occupied several satellite towns around Mariupol.

Protests denouncing the Russian offensive and the subsequent occupation have taken place in multiple urban centers. Residents have held protests in locations throughout the Kherson Region in recent days; Russian forces reportedly fired into the air to disperse a gathering in Kherson March 14. Elsewhere, protests have been held in Berdyansk and Melitopol, which are also under Russian occupation. These actions highlight the difficulty Russian forces may encounter when attempting to impose order in some cities under their occupation.

Disruptions and Shortages

Ukrainian Railways (UZ) continues to operate evacuation trains from Kyiv and multiple other areas, including Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kryvyi Rih, Zakarpattia, Zaporizhzhia, and Odesa. Clashes and artillery strikes periodically prompt the suspension of evacuations. Large crowds continue to be reported at stations offering evacuation services. Intercity and regional rail services are available intermittently; rail services are subject to disruptions without warning. Civilian aviation is suspended and the nation's seaports are closed.

Nightly curfews are in effect in multiple regions during various time frames. In the Kyiv Region, a curfew is in place 20:00-06:00 on March 19 and 20; in Mikolaiv, a nightly 20:00-06:00 curfew will enter into force on March 20. In Zaporizhzhia, authorities have imposed a curfew from 16:00 March 19 through 06:00 March 21; the city's railway station will suspend operations during this time frame. Generally, civilians must stay indoors during curfew hours; exemptions are in place for workers in critical infrastructure, and persons seeking urgent medical care or bomb shelters. Depending on the ground situation, authorities may extend or amend curfew hours on short notice.

Intermittent telecommunications, internet, and utility disruptions continue across much of the country. Reports also indicate a shortage of basic supplies, including groceries and pharmaceutical products, in multiple cities facing Russian ground assaults. The most severe shortages and disruptions are consistently reported in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol, which have suffered heavy bombardments and repeated ground assaults in recent days. Similar situations are likely in other cities facing Russian ground offensives or heavy bombardments. Finally, the National Bank of Ukraine has limited foreign currency transfers and withdrawals.

Ukraine's borders with Belarus, Russia, and the Transnistria region of Moldova are closed to foreign nationals; only Ukrainian citizens can enter from these areas. Ukraine's borders with Hungary, Moldova, Poland, and Slovakia remain open. Though congestion has eased since the early days of the conflict, delays may worsen depending on conflict developments elsewhere in the country.

Context

Negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian officials are ongoing. Although recent talks have failed to yield any concrete de-escalation of the conflict, officials from both sides have intimated that progress is being made. Both Russian and Ukrainian positions are believed to have softened with Moscow no longer demanding Ukraine's unconditional surrender, while Kyiv has indicated a willingness to abandon the pursuit of NATO membership in exchange for security guarantees. However, the official negotiating positions of each country are still far apart. Ukraine has demanded a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces, while Russia has demanded that Ukraine surrender, disarm, and declare itself to be a neutral country remaining outside NATO and the EU.

The Verkhovna Rada (parliament) has voted to extend martial law through April 25. Martial law gives the government emergency powers to carry out extraordinary measures for the defense of the country. Public gatherings are prohibited and authorities may use private property for the needs of defense.

Advice

Avoid travel to Ukraine until the situation stabilizes; consider exiting the country if safe to do so. Where fighting or airstrikes are occurring, shelter in place until the situation becomes clear. If officials report incoming fire, stay away from windows and exterior walls. Strictly heed the instructions of local security personnel, particularly when ordered to air-raid shelters. Stockpile food, fuel, and water when possible and safe to do so. Maintain contact with your diplomatic representation. Confirm that a thorough communication plan exists to ensure rapid accountability for all personnel operating in Ukraine. Reconfirm the status of public transport services, road routes, and borders before departure.

On 11 March, according to hromadske, Roschina left the city of Energodar to travel to Mariupol to report on what was really going on in the city, which has been shelled by Russian troops every day for more than two weeks.

The TV station has been unable to contact Roschina since 12 March when she is known to have been in the occupied city of Berdyansk.

On 16 March, the station learned that Roschina had been detained by the Russian FSB but nothing is known about her whereabouts.

“For two days we made every effort to release the journalist in a private manner. But it turned out to be ineffective. Therefore, we call on the Ukrainian and international community to join in the information and action to the release of hromadske journalist Victoria Roschina,” the channel said in a statement.

The channel (whose name means public) was founded originally as an independent TV station and prides itself on its freedom from control by oligarchs or the state even after Yanukovych was forced to flee by the “Maidan” protests of 2014. Over the years journalists at the station have adapted to shifts in the media landscape and now streams topical videos on YouTube and Facebook with special reports every Tuesday and Thursday.

In a Facebook post published before she disappeared, Roschina said she would “never forgive Russia”.

She wrote: “The other day I came across a column of Russian tanks in the Zaporozhzhya region. On the way there I saw a burnt car, a little further another with the burnt body of a man next to it. As it turned out, he was a civilian from the village.

“Then – the roar of tanks, the white letter Z, the flag of the Russian Federation. They came out of the turn and headed in our direction.

“Me and the driver switched to reverse gear and tried to turn around. The Russians began to ‘work’ [e.g. shoot] us actively. First bullets, and then red-hot shells. Fortunately, they flew by. I commanded the driver to stop, drop the car and lie down in the field. But the columns came in our direction and an abandoned house came to our rescue, behind [which we] waited for the Russian military hardware to pass by.

“Then we were saved by good people. While we were hiding, our car was opened although it had a PRESS sticker. They took away my laptop, camera, backpack…and the driver’s cigarettes.

“No connection, no light. Tanks on both sides of the village. We are surrounded and unable to pass on information. The scariest thing under occupation is night. Dawn still inspires hope for the best. In our case it did not start with shelling or [hiding in] the basement. Around 150 units of Russian hardware moved towards our peaceful villages. I went on reconnaissance on foot. Due to the stress, I felt neither tired, nor cold, nor afraid.

“I went to the regions to cover what is going on there and what people think. People who have been living without communication all this time, at the gunpoint of machine guns, [threatened by] MLRS Grad [rockets] and the rumble of Russian tanks.

“In small villages and towns, the occupiers feel that they’re ‘heroes’ [but they] shoot civilians, set cars on fire, kill, loot. They turn people’s lives into hell, traumatise the children. They took away my gear, but won’t take away the desire to tell the truth about their crimes.

“This time I was probably saved by a miracle once again.

“But I will never forgive Russia. Never. They will burn in hell. And they will definitely stand trial.”

Roschina is just one of a number of journalists and activists that have been detained in occupied areas of Ukraine according to our sources.

Index CEO Ruth Smeeth said, “Index on Censorship has always supported independent journalism throughout the world and the detention of reporters trying to report the facts can never be justified.

At least 37 residential buildings and infrastructure facilities were damaged; dozens of civilians were killed or injured as a result of the attacks, Ukraine’s National Police said.

Russian military members were firing at Mariupol, a city which has seen immense suffering in the war, Avdiivka, Kramatorsk, Pokrovsk, Novoselydivka, Verkhnotoretske, Krymka and Stepne.

On Saturday, Russian forces pushed deeper into Mariupol. Heavy fighting shut down a major steel plant there.

“Children, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it is wiped off the face of the earth,” Mariupol police officer Michail Vershnin said in a video addressed to Western leaders that was authenticated by The Associated Press.

Putin’s forces are in position to capture Mariupol. Satellite images show long lines of cars leaving as people try to evacuate the city. More than 9,000 people were able to leave the city in the past day, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.

Among the civilian objects destroyed by Russia are multistory and private houses, a school, a kindergarten, a museum, a shopping center and administrative buildings, Ukraine’s National Police said.

Bucha, Hostomel, Irpin and Moshchun, all northwestern suburbs in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital were also under fire on Saturday.

Slavutich, north of the capital was “completely isolated,” Kyiv’s regional administration reported.

Seven people were killed and five others wounded after a Friday mortar attack on Makariv, with Kyiv regional police saying the attack destroyed residential houses and damaged administrative and other buildings.

Earlier Saturday, Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s office alleged that Russia’s Federal Security Service, or the FSB, and the Russian military abducted the journalist of Ukrainian news outlet Hromadske on Tuesday in Berdyansk. The statement didn’t identify the journalists, whose whereabouts are unknown by officials.

A Friday strike by Russian forces on a missile and ammunition warehouse in the Delyatyn settlement of the Ivano-Frankivsk region in western Ukraine was reported by a local newspaper.

Even with cities under siege and devastation across the country, signs are abundant of how Ukraine frustrated Vladimir Putin’s hopes for a swift victory, and how Russia’s military proved far from ready for the fight.

Zelenskyy called on the Swiss government to freeze the bank accounts of all Russian oligarchs on Saturday.

Swiss public broadcaster SRF reported that Zelenskyy, who spoke via livestream to thousands of antiwar protesters in the Swiss city of Bern, said “in your banks are the funds of the people who unleashed this war. Help to fight this. So that their funds are frozen. (…) It would be good to take away those privileges from them.”

Zelenskyy could be seen on a big screen sitting behind a desk wearing a short-sleeved camouflage T-shirt. His speech was dubbed into German. When he called for the blocking of oligarchs’ accounts, great applause erupted.

SRF also reported that the Ukrainian president criticized the Swiss multinational food conglomerate Nestle, which has decided not to withdraw from Russia for the time being, as opposed to many other international companies.

A bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers visiting Poland said Saturday that the most urgent need in Ukraine’s fight against a Russian invasion is to equip and support the country in every way that will help it defend its independence.

The seven-member delegation led by Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Democrat from Massachusetts, has visited reception centers for refugees from Ukraine in eastern Poland. They noted Poland’s openness in accepting refugees from Ukraine, including in private homes. More than 2 million people fleeing war have come to Poland since Feb. 24, when Russia’s troops invaded Ukraine.

“We are here to reassure and support the people of Ukraine. We are here to thank the people of Poland for the unbelievable generosity they have shown to the refugees,” said Lynch, who is chairman of the subcommittee on National Security in the Committee on Oversight and Reform.

During an online meeting with the media Saturday, the American lawmakers stressed the need to urgently assist Ukraine’s military in their fight against Russian forces. They said there is no room for peace talks as long as there is a “hot war.”

“The most urgent action that we can take is to make sure that the Ukrainian fighters — those valiant patriots who are fighting for their freedom — have every bit of equipment, every bit of supply, every bit of support that we can possibly deliver to them,” Lynch said.

A truck carrying Russian troops crashes, its doors blown open by a rocket-propelled grenade. Foreign-supplied drones target Russian command posts. Orthodox priests in trailing vestments parade Ukraine’s blue and yellow flag in defiance of their Russian captors in the occupied city of Berdyansk.

Russia has lost hundreds of tanks, many left charred or abandoned along the roads, and its death toll is on a pace to outstrip that of the country’s previous military campaigns.

Yet more than three weeks into the war, with Putin’s initial aim of an easy regime change in Ukraine long gone, Russia’s military still has a strong hand. With their greater might and stockpile of city-flattening munitions, Russian forces can fight on for whatever the Russian president may plan next, whether leveraging a negotiated settlement or brute destruction, military analysts warn.

Despite all the determination of Ukraine’s people, all the losses among Russia’s forces, and all the errors of Russia’s leaders, there is no sign that the war will soon be over. Even if he fails to take control of the country, Putin can keep up the punishing attacks on its cities and people.

And that the Russian president has done.

“For us in Ukraine it means Putin can hit us everywhere,” Nazar Zinchuk, executive editor of LvivLab.com, said on “NewsNation Prime” Friday of the missiles hitting Lviv and other cities in western Ukraine.

Two missile strikes in the Zaporizhzhia suburbs killed nine people on Friday, wounded 17 more and left five others with injuries, a spokesman of the Zaporizhzhia regional administration, Ivan Arefiev said Saturday.

In Zaporizhzhia, regional governor Oleksandr Starukh has announced a 38-hour curfew to last from 4 p.m. local time on Saturday until 6 a.m. on Monday.

10 humanitarian corridors were agreed on with the Russians, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced Saturday. These corridors include one from Mariupol, several in the Kyiv region and several in the Luhansk region.

Putin’s forces in Ukraine are waging Russia’s largest, most complex combined military campaign since taking Berlin in 1945. His initial objective, which he announced in a television address on Feb. 24 as the invasion began, was to “demilitarize” Ukraine and save its people from “neo-Nazis,” a false description of Ukraine’s government, which is led by a Jewish president.

Fatefully, Putin underestimated the national pride and battlefield skills that Ukrainians have built up over the past eight years of battling Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east.

That’s a view shared by former Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Hancharuk on Friday’s “Banfield.” “Ukraine is a peaceful but free nation,” Hancharuk said. “During all our history, we have been fighting for our freedom for hundreds of years. That’s why we understand very well that if we don’t fight, we will become slaves. We are not slaves, we are free people.”

At the start, Russians thought “they would install, you know, some pro-Russian government and call it a day and declare victory,” said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia’s security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. “That was sort of Plan A, and as near as we can tell, they didn’t really have a Plan B.”

Russia’s first apparent plan — attack key Ukrainian military targets, and make a quick run to Kyiv — failed immediately. It was foiled by Ukraine’s defenses along with the countless mistakes and organizational failures by a Russian force that had been told it was only mobilized for military drills.

With no friendly population to welcome them, Russian forces reverted to tactics from their past offensives in Syria and Chechnya — dropping bombs and lobbing missiles into cities and town, sending millions of men, women and children fleeing.

Experts say Putin will continue to pound away militarily because he’s essentially out of options.

“His back is to the wall and he knows he’s all in,” NATO adviser Dmitri Alperovitch told Leland Vittert Friday on “On Balance.” “Unless he gets major concessions from Ukraine, like (pledging not to join) NATO and (giving up) Donbas there’s just no way he can pull back and save face.”

Putin is killing civilians with “alarming” regularity, Jamil Jaffer, former associate White House counsel said on “Dan Abrams Live” on Friday of Putin’s war tactics.

“He’s targeting hospitals, schools, the core infrastructure in Ukraine in an effort to make the Ukrainian government make concessions,” Jaffer said.

Overall, Russians appear to be fighting with three objectives now: to surround Kyiv, to encircle spread-out Ukrainian fighters in the east, and to break through to the major port city of Odesa in the west, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military and program director at CNA.

Kofman cautions that much of the information on the war is coming from Ukrainians or their American or other allies. That makes the partial picture skewed, and a full picture impossible.

A senior U.S. defense official on Friday said the Russians have launched more than 1,080 missiles since the start of the war as they remain largely stalled across the country. The official said they retain about 90% of the combat power they had arrayed around Ukraine at the start of the war.

The U.S. assesses that the airspace over Ukraine remains contested, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the military assessments. The Ukrainian air force is continuing to fly aircraft and employ air and missile defense.

Estimates of Russian deaths vary widely. Yet even conservative figures are in the low thousands. That’s a much faster pace than in previous Russian offensives, threatening support for the war among ordinary Russians. Russia had 64 deaths in five days of fighting during its 2008 war with Georgia. It lost about 15,000 in Afghanistan over 10 years, and more than 11,000 over years of fighting in Chechnya.

Russia’s number of dead and wounded in Ukraine is nearing the 10% benchmark of diminished combat effectiveness, Gorenburg said. The reported battlefield deaths of four Russian generals — out of an estimated 20 in the fight — signal impaired command, he said.

Researchers tracking only those Russian equipment losses that were photographed or recorded on video say Russia has lost more than 1,500 tanks, trucks, mounted equipment and other heavy gear. Two out of three of those were captured or abandoned, signaling the failings of the Russian troops that let them go.

Other Russian options remain possible, including a negotiated settlement.

Moscow is demanding that Ukraine formally embrace neutrality, thus swearing off any alliance with NATO, and recognize the independence of the separatist regions in the east and Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.

Russia’s other options include an unrelenting air campaign in which it bombs and depopulates cities as it did in Chechnya and Syria. U.S. officials also warn of the risk of Russian chemical attacks, and the threat of escalation to nuclear war.

“Unless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal — they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation — there will be just constant guerrilla war” if Russian troops remain, Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank, said.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/russia-at-war/denied-easy-victory-russia-presses-reduced-goals-in-ukraine/

Nowhere in Ukraine has Russia’s invasion gone to plan, but a combination of geography, better troops, shorter supply lines and weaker opposition means Moscow’s campaign has progressed enough in the south to show what President Vladimir Putin at least intended.

Early capture of the cities of Melitopol, Berdyansk and Kherson allowed Russian forces to start carrying out what looks like a template for the war’s stated goals — repeated on Wednesday by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov — of the “demilitarization” and “denazification” of Ukraine.

On Wednesday, both sides also indicated they were inching toward a potential cease-fire deal, even as major differences remain and Putin gave a televised speech about the “self-cleansing” power of current events for Russia that offered little obvious cause for hope.

After initial gains, the Russian military’s southern advance has met resistance in Mariupol, Ukraine’s easternmost port city, and Mykolayiv, the gateway to Odesa in the west, where the wide Bug river estuary makes a natural defensive barrier.

Still, a Russian breakthrough to take the entire coastline “would be a disaster for Ukraine, because 70% of our exports go by sea, 90% of our grain,” said Hanna Shelest, Odesa-based director of security programs at Foreign Policy Council “Ukrainian Prism.”

Beyond the economic and political importance of controlling Ukraine’s access to sea ports, Russia could also secure a land bridge from Crimea — the peninsula Putin annexed from Ukraine in 2014 — to the Russian mainland, open rail connections for logistics and free up substantial manpower to support military goals elsewhere.

No less important is the political and propaganda importance of the region. Novorossiya, or New Russia — the imperial era name for southern and eastern Ukraine — is central to Putin’s rhetoric that the two countries form one Russian nation.

In the first days of the invasion, Russian expectations seemed to be getting met. Its forces broke out of Crimea on the morning of Feb. 24 with little opposition and, for the next 10 days, proceeded across about about 500 km (311 miles) of coastline.

“The Russian military that has gone in from Belarus in the north is essentially the B team, while the more elite bits of the military that came from north east of Kyiv and the south have performed better,” said General Richard Barrons, who retired as commander of the U.K.’s Joint Forces Command in 2016. “They were also on easier more open ground and had the big advantage of shorter supply lines, with a firm foot on the ground in Crimea.”

On Feb. 26, Russian troops entered Melitopol, about 130 km northeast of Crimea. A day later it was Berdyansk, 120 km further west. On March 3 it was the turn of Kherson, 130 km northwest of Crimea, and with a population of 280,000 the only larger Ukrainian city to fall to Russian troops to date.

The treatment of these cities, as well as some smaller towns in the south, appears to have followed a blueprint. First, they were secured by the army. Next, units of Rosgvardia — a well-armed Gendarmerie that performs a similar role to the Soviet-era special police — moved in. Russian flags replaced Ukrainian ones at the main administrative centers.

In Melitopol, elected mayor Ivan Fedorov was abducted and marched across the town square by soldiers, according to fixed camera footage released by the office of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Fedorov was replaced by Halyna Danylchenko, a local politician willing to collaborate. In a video address, she asked citizens to accept “the new reality” and stop “extremist” acts, an apparent reference to protests.

In Kherson, local politician Serhiy Khlan said house-to-house searches were being conducted in a hunt for pro-Ukraine security officials, journalists and activists, something Shelest said friends in Kherson had also told her.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia was trying to organize a referendum to declare a “Kherson People’s Republic,” analogous to the separatist Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics further east. Russian authorities have yet to confirm such a proposal.

On Wednesday, Putin said the “special military operation” he ordered in Ukraine was going to plan, but even in the south that looks unlikely. Far from hanging out their own Russian flags, thousands have gathered daily in Kherson to protest the occupation. In Berdyansk, smaller crowds chanted “go home”. In Melitopol, protesters scuffled with Russian soldiers on March 14, as they demanded Fedorov’s return.

On Wednesday, the Ukrainian presidential office said Fedorov had been freed in a special operation. It then released a video clip of Zelenskiy purportedly speaking to the Melitopol mayor in an audio call.

Mariupol, meanwhile, risks acquiring the totemic status of Vukovar or Sarajevo during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, sieges whose destruction and cruelty sparked indignation around much of the world and, eventually, contributed to more forceful international intervention. Thousands of civilians have escaped Mariupol this week. The city’s theater, used as a bomb shelter by hundreds, was destroyed on Wednesday. Russia denied responsibility and says it does not target civilians.

Odesa will present an even bigger challenge for Russian commanders, because it holds a special place in Russian historical and cultural imaginations. So far, perhaps as a result, it has been spared the aerial bombing suffered by some other cities.

The city of just over 1 million traditionally has had a large pro-Russia population but if that support remains, it has yet to show itself. Instead, Mayor Gennadiy Trukhanov, who had a Russian passport until 2017, has been vocal in denouncing the Russian attack and has directed volunteers as they fill sandbags and make tank traps.

“They really hoped Odesa would raise the Russian flag,” said Shelest. “Now it has to be an assault and that is not something easy for them to bear either psychologically or militarily.”

First the Russian military will need to get past Mykolayiv and move the remaining 130 km to Odesa. Multiple efforts to break through or circumvent the town so far have ended in failure.

Volunteers fill sand bags at a beach in Odesa, Ukraine.

And while Russian landing craft have gathered off Odesa’s Black Sea coast several times over the last two weeks as if to attack, a sea landing would be difficult. Suitable beaches have been mined and are defended, said Shelest. On reaching the city, there’s every indication Russian troops would have to fight their way in.

Sealing Ukraine from the Black Sea in the south will likely remain a major strategic objective for Russia as long as fighting continues, according to Barrons, now chairman of Universal Defence & Security Solutions, a strategic consultancy of former military officers. Though wary of the firepower Russia still wields, he was skeptical that anything like Putin’s original plan for Ukraine is still attainable.

“This is an occupation that will never work,” Barrons said, and the reasons for Putin to look for an off ramp are mounting. The question for Odesa and other cities, he added, is just how far a frustrated Putin will be willing to go, including options such chemical weapons or ethnic cleansing, in his bid to control Ukraine.

Russia has lost hundreds of tanks, many left charred or abandoned along the roads, and its death toll is on a pace to outstrip that of the country's previous military campaigns.

Yet more than three weeks into the war, with Putin's initial aim of an easy regime change in Ukraine long gone, Russia's military still has a strong hand. With their greater might and stockpile of city-flattening munitions, Russian forces can fight on for whatever the Russian president may plan next, whether leveraging a negotiated settlement or brute destruction, military analysts warn.

Despite all the determination of Ukraine's people, all the losses among Russia's forces, and all the errors of Russia's leaders, there is no sign that the war will soon be over. Even if he fails to take control of the country, Putin can keep up the punishing attacks on its cities and people.

""His instinct will be always to double down, because he's got himself into a dreadful mess, a huge strategic blunder,"" said Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank.

""And I don't think it's in his character to try to retrieve that, except by carrying on, going forward,"" he said.

Putin's forces in Ukraine are waging Russia's largest, most complex combined military campaign since taking Berlin in 1945. His initial objective, which he announced in a television address on Feb. 24 as the invasion began, was to ""demilitarize"" Ukraine and save its people from ""neo-Nazis,"" a false description of Ukraine's government, which is led by a Jewish president.

Fatefully, Putin underestimated the national pride and battlefield skills that Ukrainians have built up over the past eight years of battling Russian-backed separatists in the country's east.

At the start, Russians thought ""they would install, you know, some pro-Russian government and call it a day and declare victory,"" said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia's security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. ""That was sort of Plan A, and as near as we can tell, they didn't really have a Plan B.""

Russia's first apparent plan — attack key Ukrainian military targets, and make a quick run to Kyiv — failed immediately. It was foiled by Ukraine's defenses along with the countless mistakes and organizational failures by a Russian force that had been told it was only mobilized for military drills.

Clarke, the British researcher, related accounts of Russian troops selling communication equipment and fuel out of military vehicles to locals during the weeks they waited on Ukraine's borders.

With no friendly population to welcome them, Russian forces reverted to tactics from their past offensives in Syria and Chechnya — dropping bombs and lobbing missiles into cities and towns, sending millions of men, women and children fleeing.

Putin's forces are in a position to capture the besieged port city of Mariupol. Overall, Russians appear to be fighting with three objectives now: to surround Kyiv, to encircle spread-out Ukrainian fighters in the east, and to break through to the major port city of Odessa in the west, said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military and program director at CNA.

""Just look at the map, and you just look at how little progress the Russians have been able to make,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said recently.

The math of military conquests and occupation may be against Putin in Ukraine.

Estimates of Russian deaths vary widely. Yet even conservative figures are in the low thousands. That's a much faster pace than in previous Russian offensives, threatening support for the war among ordinary Russians. Russia had 64 deaths in five days of fighting during its 2008 war with Georgia.

Two out of three of those were captured or abandoned, signaling the failings of the Russian troops that let them go.

Meanwhile, Russia needs to limit its use of smart, long-range missiles in case they're needed in any larger war with NATO, military analysts say.

When it comes to the grinding job of capturing and holding cities, conventional military metrics suggest Russia needs a 5-to-1 advantage in urban fighting, analysts say. Meanwhile, the formula for ruling a restive territory in the face of armed opposition is 20 fighters for every 1,000 people — or 800,000 Russian troops for Ukraine's more than 40 million people, Clarke notes. That's almost as many as Russia's entire active-duty military of 900,000.

On the ground, that means controlling any substantial chunk of Ukrainian territory long-term would take more resources than Russia could foreseeably commit.

Other Russian options remain possible, including a negotiated settlement. Moscow is demanding that Ukraine formally embrace neutrality, thus swearing off any alliance with NATO, and recognize the independence of the separatist regions in the east and Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014.
