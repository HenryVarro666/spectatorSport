The NS Champion, operated by Sovcomflot, a large shipping company majority-owned by the Russian state, is due to berth at Flotta oil terminal in Orkney on Tuesday to collect crude oil.

To the dismay of politicians and islanders – including Ukrainian residents who attended an anti-war demonstration on Saturday in the archipelago’s largest town, Kirkwall – Orkney Islands council said the UK government had advised that at present the vessel cannot be refused permission to dock.

“As a council we are in an extremely difficult position,” a spokesperson said. “We recognise the strength of feeling around this – feelings that we share – but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK government tells us otherwise.”

A UK government spokesperson indicated there were a number of Russian vessels scheduled to dock at British ports, despite the intensifying trade embargos against Russian businesses and state entities.

Last week, the French impounded a Russian cargo ship carrying cars suspected of being linked to Russians targeted by sanctions implemented by the US Treasury Department.

“We are aware of concerns about Russian-connected ships potentially docking in the UK and we are working rapidly to explore a range of measures to restrict access for them,” the spokesperson said.

“We are already discussing this issue with the Scottish government and the sanctions being considered are part of a wider package being worked up across the UK government.”

Angus Robertson, the Scottish government’s external affairs secretary, told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show: “The UK authorities have got a big decision to take, on whether we are going to allow Russian-owned or charted vessels to dock in UK ports.

“[This] is a very fast-moving situation and we’re going to have to act decisively in my view.”

At Saturday’s protest against the invasion, Nataliia Kuzmina, a Ukrainian living in Orkney, told the BBC she was angered that the vessel may arrive. She said her parents remained in Ukraine and her father had volunteered to fight to defend their town but did not have any weapons.

“Every little thing matters now. Hundreds of people around Europe will do some small act like this, stopping buying Russian products, stopping tankers being filled up with oil,” she said. “It matters and I feel it’s my duty to turn away this tanker from Scapa Flow.”

Jamie Halcro Johnston, a Scottish Conservative MSP for the Highlands and Islands, said he discussed the issue with Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, on Saturday morning; Jack said it had been raised with the prime minister’s office.

“The United Kingdom has already closed our airspace to Russian airlines, and our waters should be closed to Russian state-owned shipping too,” Halcro Johnston said.

“It is important that, given the actions already taken against Putin’s regime and its interests, we ensure there are no loopholes left available to be exploited by Russian state interests.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/27/uk-considers-banning-russian-ships-from-british-ports
1,64d368f0-7090-45e7-a586-84dc0b1da082,"['Rob Davies', 'Severin Carrell']",2022-02-28 00:00:00,"Russian vessels will be banned from British ports, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said on Monday, in an effort to ensure the Kremlin is not funding its war effort in Ukraine with sales of oil and gas in the UK.

The pledge came as multiple Russian oil tankers were either docked at UK ports or on either way to drop off consignments, in south Wales, Scotland and Orkney.

A Russian oil tanker was moored at Milford Haven in south Wales on Monday, even as Shapps announced plans to bar any future arrivals.

Pluto, a crude oil tanker delivering supplies from Primorsk – which accounts for 30% of Russian oil exports – arrived in the UK on 26 February, where it remained on Monday morning.

Milford Haven is the closest port to the Pembroke oil refinery, owned by the US energy firm Valero, which supplies petrol, diesel and jet fuel to the British market.

The Guardian has approached Valero for comment on whether Pluto has been offloading oil for use in its refinery. The vessel’s next destination is Derry, Northern Ireland, according to information from the marine traffic website VesselFinder.

Speaking in parliament on Monday, Brendan O’Hara MP, of the Scottish National party, questioned why the Russian tanker the NS Century was allowed to dock at the port of Finnart, near the Faslane nuclear submarine base.

Another ship, NS Champion, operated by the Russian state-owned shipping company Sovcomflot, was due to dock at the Flotta oil terminal in Orkney at 6pm on Tuesday.

However, Orkney council confirmed on Monday evening that the vessel would not be allowed into port, after Shapps sent a letter to all UK ports asking them not to grant access to Russian vessels.

He wrote: “The maritime sector is fundamental to international trade and we must play our part in restricting Russia’s economic interests and holding the Russian government to account.

“In these circumstances the Department for Transport does not consider it appropriate for Russian vessels to continue to enter UK ports.”

Today I've written to all UK ports asking them not to provide access to any Russian flagged, registered, owned, controlled, chartered or operated vessels.

He said ports should refuse access to vessels that were “owned, controlled, chartered or operated by any person connected with Russia”.

The blockade should also apply to vessels connected to people targeted by sanctions, flying a Russian flag, or registered in Russia, Shapps said.

He added that the government would help ports identify Russian vessels in advance of them arriving at port and that further shipping sanctions would be announced soon.

A source in Orkney Islands council said they would be delighted if Shapps authorises a ban on Russian vessels.

“We’ve spent all weekend exploring every possible option to us [to prevent the NS Champion from docking],” the official said. “No stone has been left unturned. So this is good news, as far as we’re concerned.”

About 3% of UK gas demand is fulfilled by shipments of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), a super-chilled form of gas that can be transported by sea.

Terminals at Milford Haven and the Isle of Grain, Kent, have taken multiple consignments of LNG this month, including from the vast Yamal facility in northern Siberia, opened by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in 2017.

National Grid said it was still unsure whether LNG terminals, such as the one it operates on the Isle of Grain, were included in the order from Shapps.

“We are supportive of government action to order UK ports to block all Russian-linked ships, and are seeking to understand if this includes LNG terminals and Russian-linked cargo,” said a spokesperson.

“The decision as to whether the UK accepts Russian LNG sits with [the business department] and our customers – we have a legal, contractual obligation to receive our customers’ vessels into our terminal, and do not have any control over the origin of the LNG they contain.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/28/russia-oil-tanker-docked-in-wales-even-as-uk-moves-to-restrict-access-ukraine-sanctions

The NS Champion is a Liberian flagged crude oil tanker built in July 2005 and is inspected by the Norweigan classification society DNV. The ship’s owner, Sovcomflot, is majority-owned by the Russian state. Shares of Sovcomflot have fallen 50% in the past ten days but bounced 15% on Friday as the company’s ships continued to sail uneffected by sanctions and as the broader market shrugged off the Russian invasion.

“To the dismay of politicians and islanders the UK government had advised that at present the vessel cannot be refused permission to dock,” reports The Guardian. “A UK government spokesperson indicated there were a number of Russian vessels scheduled to dock at British ports, despite the intensifying trade embargos against Russian businesses and state entities.”

Sources close the the matter say talk about a policy change began yesterday after France impounded a Russian cargo ship carrying cars suspected of being linked to Russians targeted by sanctions implemented by the US Treasury Department. According to another source, local politicians acted after being pressed by protestors at the port.

“We are aware of concerns about Russian-connected ships potentially docking in the UK and we are working rapidly to explore a range of measures to restrict access for them,” a UK spokesperson told the Guardian. “We are already discussing this issue with the Scottish government and the sanctions being considered are part of a wider package being worked up across the UK government.”

Angus Robertson, Scotland’s cabinet secretary for external affairs, told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show: “The UK authorities have got a big decision to take, on whether we are going to allow Russian-owned or charted vessels to dock in UK ports. The Scottish government is in discussions with the UK authorities about this particular case but there will be others.”

“This is a very fast moving situation,” said Robertson. “We are going to have to act decisively in my view.”

Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael has written to Boris Johnson urging him to take action.

“Like right thinking people across the United Kingdom, the people of Orkney have been sickened by what we have seen on our television screens of the Russian attack on Ukraine,” he wrote in a letter to the Prime Minister. “We expect you, as our prime minister, to act to stop this continued trade that is earning money to fund the slaughter of Ukrainian citizens. It is imperative… that you should act without delay to ensure that Sovcomflot is sanctioned and denied access for their vessels to British ports.”

A spokeswoman for Repsol Sinopec, which operates the Flotta oil terminal told the BBC that the NS Champion was due to arrive on Tuesday. “We are liaising with regulatory authorities regarding the appropriate provision of access to facilities,” she added.
